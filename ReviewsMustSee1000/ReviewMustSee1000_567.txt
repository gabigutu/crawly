		<shortDescription>Is anyone seeing this?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm going to try to be restrained in my praise of this film, but it's going to be hard, because I think it's about as close to perfect film-making as I've ever seen. I generally only write reviews for movies I've really loved, or really hated, and this movie I really loved.This is a masterpiece.I don't know where to begin, really. Leaving the cinema, I felt as though I'd had some kind of accident - a little as if I was in shock. I had a very strong physical reaction to this movie, in tandem with my emotional response, and in many scenes I felt my heart racing. This is powerful material and has been delivered with great skill. The pacing is perfect, moving slowly and quietly toward not one but several emotional climaxes, each greater than the last, allowing the audience to enter Curtis' world and share his emotions. The cinematography was beautiful, elegant, and achingly frightening at times; the dialogue was so real it hurt, and the soundtrack sinister and intense. Michael Shannon should win something for this role - he is Curtis completely and it's a complex and deeply sympathetic portrayal of the confusion of a good man, a complicated portrait of a man trying to BE a good man, in the face of his own fear. From the very beginning, the atmosphere is unsettled, and some of the dream sequences are heart-stoppingly frightening. The story is multi-layered, working with ideas of family, mental illness, responsibility, fear, the current feeling of the-end-is-nigh that everyone senses - when Curtis said, 'Is anyone seeing this?' I almost cried for him.I have thought very hard about this film since I saw it two days ago and I simply cannot fault anything about it, not one thing. I know I'm going to see it many times. It left me shaken and moved and I cannot wait to see more from this writer/director. Hands down the movie of the century, so far.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It seems that art films come in all shapes and sizes these days. If you look hard enough you'll find small independent art films within any genre. Take Shelter is a film you will find amongst dramatic thrillers, and it is definitely one you should seek out. It stars Michael Shannon as Curtis, a middle class family man working on the pipeline in Ohio. He leads a capable life where he must cope with his monetary issues as well as his deaf daughter. But he makes the most of it and lives a life of relative ease and compassion for his family. However, things become complicated when he starts seeing apocalyptic visions of a terrible storm he believes is on its way. The dreams and visions make his life very difficult and it becomes increasingly more stressful. Curtis must fight a battle within himself as he tries to figure out if these visions are meaningful or if he is just going crazy, as well as with his family and friends who become more disconnected from him as his sanity seems to deteriorate before their eyes. Take Shelter is a harrowing, dramatic, and slow building film that will surely amaze you once it is all over.Take Shelter is a film that moves so slowly and builds so dramatically that one begins to wonder if we're every getting to the end. It's an incredibly quiet and sincerely somber film. We spend almost the entire movie honing in on Michael Shannon's powerful facial expressions and the deep thought going into the story. It progresses so slowly with a build up that pushes its way through molasses.I'll admit that I was getting worried about this film not being as good as I expected it to be. I was afraid it might not live up to my expectations and that the payoff wouldn't be worth the crawling build up. But one you reach the end you will be incredibly satisfied. The payoff is incredible. I couldn't have asked for a better ending. It could not have been executed more precisely. It plays to something bigger than what you could have ever expected from this fantastic film. Just as my mind began to slip away from Take Shelter it ended with such a deep and deafening bang that my eyes flew open to realize the incredible film I had just sat through.Take Shelter might not look like much at first, but it turns out to be a tremendous film. It's smart, engaging, fascinating, and brutally sincere. This is a must see film for 2011. Depending on your attention span you may want to give up about an hour and a half in, but if you stick around for the end you will be very satisfied. I guarantee it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intelligent, nicely shot film with great lead from Shannon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Take Shelter is an intelligent, thought provoking, nicely shot film featuring an excellent performance by Michael Shannon (an Oscar nomination, surely?), who was also great in director Nichols' previous/first film, Shotgun Stories. The film explores the line between fear and paranoia, or objectivity and subjectivity, as it's protagonist - a blue-collar family man of few words - wrestles with apocalyptic dreams and visions of a strange, possibly supernatural storm, responding to them as best he can as both literal warnings AND possible signs of mental illness. The film has a brooding, at times Hitchcockian atmosphere and a very timely feel to it (think financial and environmental disasters). Set in a rural community, we have plenty of lovely wide shots of the land- and sky-scape (also a strong element of Shotgun Stories) with some added CGI on the latter for the dream/visions. Shannon's performance constitutes at least 50% of this films worth but the rest of the cast are good too. It's a slow mover and, at around two hours and fifteen minutes, perhaps a bit too long. My wife and I did have a few criticisms after watching it (at the Sydney Film Festival), but I wouldn't want to discourage anyone from seeing this film, which will no doubt be a hot topic and bring Nichols deserved recognition when it goes on general release (September 30 2011 in US)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review for Take Shelter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fear is the driving force for most of humanity, whether we choose to admit it or not. We fear financial distress, health problems, losing the people we love, and even bad weather. Fear grips our ability to function properly, to mentally process right and wrong, and to keep hold of the things we cherish most. Fear is the ring-leader in our circus of life. Take Shelter is an exposition of how fear can rule and ruin our lives. In this film, Curtis, played by Michael Shannon, succumbs to his greatest fear of "the storm" that is coming. Curtis begins dreaming of a horrific storm that not only takes his life but the lives of those he loves. This storm is almost depicted as an end-times, natural disaster. Curtis' dream becomes all-consuming for him as it starts impacting not only his sleep, but his life during the day. It is the fear of the dream becoming a reality that drives Curtis over the edge. Because of this, his job, finances, relationships, and marriage are all affected. This film is so much more than just the average apocalyptic, fear-fest. Take Shelter also portrays the commitment and faithfulness of marriage during a time of extreme doubt and confusion. It is beautifully portrayed how and why Samantha (Curtis' wife) stays so committed to her husband, even after he has given her plenty of reasons to leave. In a culture where over 40% of marriages end in divorce, this film speaks profoundly against that percentage. It is a refreshing experience to see the storms of marriage overcome by the vow of commitment. This film could quite possibly stir up a new statistic?and I think that would do the world some good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The real Sundance winner!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Take Shelter could be easily renamed to something like Anxieties of living in the 21st Century Western Country. It showcases a rich pallet of phobias, from fear of financial instability, job loss, to anxiety about upcoming environmental apocalypse. Curtis (flawlessly played by Michael Shannon) begins having dreams and visions of bad things happening to him and his family and so he decides to build a huge shelter in his backyard where they can all seek refuge in case any of his dreams were to come true. But following his instincts comes at a price ? he loses his job, takes out unstable loan from a bank and destroys his deaf daughter's only chance to undergo a surgery to restore her hearing. The dreams drive Curtis into insanity as he mirrors his behaviour with what once happened to his mother, a victim of schizophrenia.The moment Curtis admits to himself and to others that he might be going insane, the apocalypse does arrive and so everyone else is forced to agree that something bad was on its way all along. Take Shelter is a very contemporary drama, which would not have been made, let's say, ten years ago. The problems the film presents are mostly influenced by the recession, political divide in nowadays America and environmental problems caused by global warming. The director Jeff Nichols finds a perfect balance between building up the multitude of his main character's anxieties and presenting Curtis's struggle in a believable way. He escapes preaching about the presented issues and makes the sole existence of the problems uncertain up until the very last moment. What is most admirable though is that Nichols avoids religious aspects of his apocalypse and keeps it very close to life, making forces of nature the most vengeful and destructive.Take Shelter was a rare jewel among the films presented at Sundance. It was beautifully executed (besides the outstanding performances from the cast, music and pictures are also note-worthy) and felt fresh and exciting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Challenging but supremely suspenseful character-driven drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When done right, few tales are more riveting than a person's descent into madness. Alfred Hitchcock proved this time and time again and Jeff Nichols reinforces it in "Take Shelter," a film likely to have been lauded by the master of suspense himself. Anchored by the performances of Michael Shannon and Jessica Chastain, "Shelter" broods and festers but ultimately thrives on the brink between buildup and utter chaos.Shannon, far from a household name but a favorite of cinephiles since his head-turning supporting role in "Revolutionary Road," stars as Curtis, a construction worker and father living in a rural town with his wife, Sam (Chastain), and their young daughter, Hannah (Tova Stewart). Their daughter has developed extreme hearing loss and Curtis' job provides them the benefits necessary to afford cochlear implants, but Curtis' recent slew of horrifically real nightmares seems to be the real issue here.In his dreams, Curtis experiences premonitions of a near-apocalyptic storm that includes odd bird flight formations, motor-oil-like rain, and twisters, and appears to make everyone that shows up in his dreams eerily violent from his dog to complete strangers. The resulting paranoia and occasional physical side affects leads Curtis to seek medical attention, but also to start renovating the storm cellar in his backyard should his visions come true.The question of whether Curtis is a prophet of sorts or just mentally disturbed drives the film ? not much else does. Nichols tells this story largely through a series of character snapshots depicting Curtis riding the ups and downs caused by these nightmares. A few key moments boil the story to a point, namely a riveting scene when Curtis loses it a social luncheon, but the pensive script withholds from us straight through the end like a well-trained indie film.As we go deeper and deeper with Curtis ? and eventually Samantha and Curtis' best friend/co-worker Dewart (Shea Whigham) ? we do learn some key details about Curtis' medical history that shed light on the situation, but even in the midst of fact, Nichols never gives us the satisfaction of arriving at any concrete conclusion about his predicament.With the weight of an immensely introverted character dealing with a mental struggle placed squarely on his shoulders, Shannon proves why you'll only see him with more and more frequency in the future. He makes sure we care about what happens to Curtis, but beyond that he slips back and forth between deserving sympathy and deserving skepticism. He is not simply some Jobian character to whom bad things are happening, and this makes his challenge all the more challenging for the viewer. Credit as well to Nichols for crafting a protagonist far from the norm.The winner of 2011&#x2032;s most ubiquitous actress award, Chastain, gets the more alpha-type role instead. She's the good-hearted, open and loving type driven entirely by logic and unafraid of confrontation. Many will identify more with Samantha as a result, which adds a layer of complexity to the film to say the least."Take Shelter" offers compelling character-driven suspense, though at times it will try your patience. If you can chalk that up to quintessential indie filmmaking, then by all means do and enjoy this complex and challenging character portrait all the more for it. However, the real thrill of this type of film is that at any moment the bottom might drop out on the entire story (aka the $%&amp;+ might hit the proverbial tornado); the difference between liking that and loving it is accepting when it doesn't.~Steven CCheck out my site, moviemusereviews.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A magnificent sleeper</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Take Shelter is one of the most enriching and well made apocalyptic films I've seen since The Book of Eli. Not only does the art direction perfectly and naturally blend itself with the story, but the subtle and remarkable work of Michael Shannon and the slow, but intricate directing by Jeff Nichols work wonders for the pacing and the final outcome.There's a grand difference between a story that takes forever to develop for a reason, and a story that takes forever to develop just because. Take Shelter lets its characters work their way into becoming recognizable human beings one step at a time. It's not one of those films that begins to get interesting during the second half because everything suddenly picks up. It's a film that starts out interesting because we are greeted with characters that have humanistic problems, and we are left contemplating the same characters who still occupy problems. It's a genius anomaly of filmmaking, and it's taken with great care here.Another film that had that same sort of motto was Alexander Payne's The Descendants. Again, it followed the idea of letting its characters develop at a human-like pace before throwing in real climatic elements. Rarely do screenwriters want to create characters that slowly evolve into almost real characters. Most are too busy to jump right into "the good stuff." The story revolves around Curtis LaForche (Shannon), a Ohio construction worker living with his wife (Chastain) and their deaf daughter. Their house is on a wide stretch of land below a vast chunk of open sky. Curtis begins having very surreal and haunting nightmares about a forthcoming storm that has dark, ominous clouds and loud, rip-roaring thunder. In each of his dreams, something hurts him physically or mentally. In one, his own dog attacks him and he can almost feel the pain upon waking up.Curtis seeks help from multiple doctors, while at the same time, he is trying to shield his dreams from his wife. Jessica Chastain, who has played a supporting role in several films in 2011, is pitch perfect. It's typical for films to sort of blacklist family members that are victim to a crisis caused by their spouse, son, etc. In Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close, the film completely missed its chance to give Sandra Bullock a fantastic performance as the mother. Instead they traded it for more shots of Thomas Horn's autistic character running around aimlessly in New York. Chastain slowly evolves into a true character, compliments of the screenplay. It's nice that the film tries to, not only formulate characters, but showcase their reaction and response to the main events as well.Michael Shannon is terrific. Simply terrific. He plays the role of a delusional man, unable to decipher dreams from reality very well. He slowly goes insane, without ever being too comical, unbelievable, or over the top. Having a delusional character go over the top sometimes works if you have a capable, sophisticated actor, take Nicolas Cage in Vampire's Kiss, who will bring justice to the role. If Shannon tried to go the Nicolas Cage route in Take Shelter, the film would've derailed faster than the storm coming in.Why Take Shelter works so unrealistically well is because it forms sequences of forthcoming dread that can't be ignored. The art direction is some of the best I've seen this year, along with Another Earth (but that didn't succeed in storytelling this well). It also works coherently and wonderfully because Shannon is such a capable actor, always perfectly pulling off the tall, eerie man with pure force. I'll be damned if Take Shelter wasn't the most unsettling movie experiences in the last few years.Starring: Michael Shannon and Jessica Chastain. Directed by: Jeff Nichols.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Betrayal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For 110 minutes "Take Shelter" is a gripping, dread inducing portrait of an average Joe going off the rails. At first there is a certain amount of ambiguity as to whether the main character's nightmares are apocalyptic premonitions or manifestations of creeping anxiety. The plain-spoken naturalism of the script, direction and performances -- especially Michael Shannon's believably unraveling lead -- stack up on the side of a mental breakdown. The details of his crack-up are painfully accurate and he even has a family history of schizophrenia.Then, in the last few minutes, the movie becomes a highfalutin "Twilight Zone" episode, with one of those "gotcha" endings of the "It's a cookbook!" ilk. This would not be so bad if the buildup had not been so tonally different. As it is it's an utter betrayal of everything that preceded it and an insult to audiences' emotional investment in the characters."Take Shelter" is the latest and most egregious example of a distressing trend among filmmakers to take manifestly silly premises and invest them with dour gravity. Nolan, Shymalan, and Singer are the avatars of this style. They try to turn comic book and supermarket tabloid subjects into Ibsen, sucking out the fun as they inflate their stature. Rod Serling is surely rolling in his grave.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film deserves your attention!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the opening moments of this dark, dreamy tale it is clear that we are in for something quite extraordinary. Jeff Nichols' Take Shelter begins with a nightmare and continues as such even after our protagonist Curtis LaForche wakes up. Curtis's nightmare comes in the form of a storm. Ominous clouds roll towards him, black and imposing and spitting greasy, yellow rain. As Curtis panics and goes to get his daughter to safety, he is attacked by the beloved family dog and just as the dog is about to tear his arm off he wakes up. This opening sequence, indicative of the rest of the film, is terrifying, beautiful and full of awe at nature's power. When Curtis wakes up, his arm hurts from where the dog attacked him in his dream but there is no wound. As a result, Curtis has come to distrust the loyal dog around his deaf daughter. When the dreams continue, and start to come in the form of hallucinations, Curtis must decide whether he is a prophet or a lunatic. There is a history of mental illness in Curtis' family and he is terrified that he is starting to lose his grip on reality. However, he takes a "better safe than sorry" approach and begins to obsessively build a storm shelter so that he might keep his family safe if a storm does come. The bulk of the film looks at Curtis' declining mental health. Is he slipping further into psychosis or is he driving himself insane with paranoia. His descent into madness is terrifying to watch and while the film never really quite decides whether he is a prophet or a madman it keeps its feet firmly planted in reality and never loses sight of the true intention of the film, to watch a man as he disintegrates. There is something very Cronenbergian about the crisis of masculinity going on in Take Shelter and the violent way in which it manifests itself. Curtis is a kind, loving husband and father but his paranoia, his fears for his family and his fears for his own sanity drive him to some very erratic behaviour that might have disastrous results for his family, storm or no storm. The relationship between Curtis and his wife and daughter is realistic and Jessica Chastain's earthy beauty compliments the character's strength, trust, intelligence and warmth just perfectly. As they struggle to keep their marriage together despite Curtis's many misadventures, one can feel her shock that something that was once so strong could be taken from her so cruelly. Take Shelter is a beautiful film. It is a lyrical film and it is a poetic film. It is not necessarily a film that provides answers but it is not ever trying to riddle you. The script is tight, pitch-perfect and nicely paced suggesting that Jeff Nichols is as skilled as a writer as he is a director. Shot with unbelievable beauty by lenser Adam Stone, the film looks and feels profoundly alluring and is a pleasure to behold throughout. However, the real heart of the film film rests on the shoulders of one person, Michael Shannon, who is superb here as the desperate Curtis. He is cuddly enough to be sympathetic but giant enough to be terrifying. His performance is a towering achievement and, in my eyes, cements him as one of the most interesting actors working today. This is the kind of performance that rarely comes around. Awards season will be colourful for Michael Shannon if there is any justice in the world. Part family drama, part disaster movie, part psychological thriller and part horror, this truly unique film must be seen on the big screen if at all possible and I can only implore people to make the effort to go out and give this film your money. Take Shelter is a low-budget (not that you can tell) masterpiece that truly deserves your attention. - Charlene Lydon</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Essential Viewing for our Times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hear it so much now. Our national discourse is rich with portent. "It's going to get worse before it gets better", "Something horrible is coming, you'll see", "Soon there will be riots". I'm told these things at conventions and while talking to my neighbors and at breakfast with my mother's old friends. Now Jeff Nichols takes an exhausted phrase in storytelling, ("There's a storm coming") and crafts out of it the movie of the moment. A dark, symbolic mapping of the last five years of the middle-class American experience that's bursting at the mental and financial seams. I have yet to see a finer artistic expression of the current existential crises we face. Michael Shannon is the Noah of our hour, plagued with calamitous visions and barely bearing up under the weight of constant anxiety. In fact, the whole endeavor is buried in quiet distress and prescience. And when the movie finally finds the heart to redeem it's long suffering protagonist, it is through the worst of all possible outcomes. Essential viewing for our times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Take Shelter is a brooding, psychological thriller that does a wonderful job of generating foreboding and unease, while hinting at bigger thematic questions.Curtis is in construction, a steady guy in a steady job taking care of his family. His mate Dewart tells him, kindly and a little enviously, that he has a good life. That comment comes just as nightmares creep into the daytime for Curtis and the pressures of the possible descent of mental illness, and impending catastrophe, seep into his being. He makes the decision to tell no one but medical professionals. He needs help. But that does not mean his fears are unfounded.Michael Shannon is superb as mad-or-is-he? Curtis. When he gives voice to his darkest fears in a very public forum, he is the definition of unhinged. Jessica Chastain plays his put-upon wife Samantha, and gets to test her range in a nightmare sequence where she is tempted by a breadknife and the sight of her husband's exposed neck. The look on her face had me pushing back in my seat.The film opens with big, brooding questions. Is Curtis somehow psychic? Is the approaching doom related to their daughter's illness? Does the ever-present threat of economic ruin somehow inform these impending cataclysmic events? Horror film tropes are employed in the nightmare sequences, as Curtis wakes up just as he is attacked. This becomes slightly predictable at the third dream, and the film sags slightly in the second act. The two-hours plus running time is a tad flabby. But Shannon is commanding, the cinematography eerily beautiful, and the ending deliciously straightforward and ambiguous.We live in uncertain times. Those who carry on blindly and trust it will be okay may be the maddest of us all. Take Shelter shows one man unravelling, and resonates with all our contemporary worries. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most disappointing ending of the year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What I liked about this film was the subtlety. Until a gut-wrenching scene toward the end, Michael Shannon's performance is refreshingly restrained, devoid of the hysterics that often accompany films dealing with this subject matter. The socio-political aspects lurk well under the surface, and the screenwriter never hits the viewer over the head.What I didn't like about the film was the ending. The film should have concluded with Curtis making the choice his mother could not - to put family above his psychology - and open the doors of the shelter, without either Curtis or the viewer knowing what happens next. But the film goes five minutes too long, pulling the rug out from under the viewer as Curtis' premonitions are ultimately validated. (If the Myrtle Beach sequence was intended to be "ambiguous," as some commentators suggest, it didn't work - unlike Curtis' other premonitions, his wife is the one who actually experiences the oily rain, which clearly suggests that the end of the world is in fact being experienced outside of Curtis' head.) I can appreciate an ending like that in the right movie (e.g., Bill Paxton's 'Frailty'). But THIS is not the right movie.</fullReview>

Curtis works with his friend Dewart (Shea Whigham) in his team and his mother Sarah (Kathy Baker) has been interned in a clinic since she was thirty years old with paranoid schizophrenia. Out of the blue, Curtis has nightmares and visions of an apocalyptic storm and he becomes obsessed to build a well equipped storm shelter for his family and him in his backyard. Curtis spends the family savings and gets a loan from the bank to prepare the shelter. His obsession affects his work and his relationship with the locals and Curtis loses his job. Does Curtis have a premonition or is he losing his sanity?"Take Shelter" is an original drama developed in slow pace with magnificent performances. The screenplay is very well written and despite the running time of 120 minutes, the movie keeps the attention of the viewer until the very last ironic scene.

		<fullReview>This is what visionaries throughout our history have left us with: Are they mad, is it truth? The film portrays the fall into madness very well, the pacing, the intensity, the belief yet questioning, if you know of someone or have actually experienced mental illness you will immediately connect to this film, seeing as mental illness is the most common form of illness amongst us, chances are it'll evoke feelings of empathy, sympathy, fear. To actually experience the ever tightening realization that you or a loved one may be being lost to their own destruction due to mental illness is a terrifying journey beset with denial, anger, hope then darkness. This film captures that and some more, a nice hit the face at the end. It reminded a little of Mist, the same loss of hope only to be hit with a bucket of cold water, if we give up hope, if we refuse to try to see others truth, we lose our humanity.

		<fullReview>Let me be frank with you. I began to look at my watch just when only 40 minutes of the movie have passed, and then I began to look at it every 5 minutes to see how long yet it might take! I closed my eyes in parts of the movie, talked to my friend, checked on other guys in the cinema to see how bored they are, and counted every second till the movie finished.. It was extremely boring, and there was no story in it. This was the story: The man continues to see visions, wastes his money to make a shelter, and looses his job. Then the movie finishes showing a storm coming! No conclusion! either if the man had the illusions or not, the storm would have been coming! It could not have been more boring and more "no story to tell". I was wishing in every scene that it would finish, but it would not! It was insisting to continue, because the crew of the movie were in the illusion that they are making a good movie and they are entertaining! WRONG! they just wasted 2 hours of my life. I think this movie is in the genre of BULLSHIT, because I can't imagine any other genre for it.</fullReview>

The idea for the story could have made for a good movie but the way it was done was very boring. It wasn't the worst movie I ever saw and the quality was good, which is why I didn't only give it 1 star. At the rate the movie was going I was expecting to be dropped when he opened the bilco doors and that to be the end, that's as much as I expected from this movie. We were expecting to be disappointed at the rate it was going. And we were. We cannot relate to the 10 star ratings this movie has received from other reviewers. I had to voice our disappointment with the movie so that other IMDb users who may have similar tastes to us are forewarned before wasting their time viewing this movie. The constant droning music was irritating. I think I developed a headache just from that. This movie did not stimulate me in any way - thought, suspense, musically, nothing.

Apparently a family 'admired' by some of the 'brilliant' reviews is the one where nobody even talks to each other normally... but drinking beer scene was going longer than the time that would take to produce that beer, deliver and drink altogether. A father is portrayed like such a defendOr ... can not think about his daughter's health (has money for beer but no wish to flip burgers for surgery) but he's eager to build some super shelter out of a trashed shipping container (that he had to borrow money against the house!!) with cut walls (what for one would ask?) and no supplies WHATSOEVER - like free drinking water. Whoever wrote and directed such a garbage had no clue of a simple survival kit from Walmart :P. Like this loser father could not dig the trench for that junk shipping container himself, had to poop his beer buddy to almost loose his job. Reminds Jerry Springer show just miserably slow. Nothing but promoting idiocy and stupidity. The final scene is a 'masterpiece'. What a waste!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You'll be disappointed even though you start it with low expectation.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first I saw the review, I guess the genre is a bit fantasy, not a pure thriller. But I try to believe that the movie is more to pure thriller than a fantasy crap, according to the movie info. However the movie remind me to such a "Donny Darko' or 'Knowing' type. But I avoid that assumption, and before watching the movie I try to convince myself that there must be something different, and there must be a real reason, a logic one, to explain about these hallucination things. I keep guessing how the ending comes to be, because related to the most helpful reviews at IMDb, our patience on a long and slow moving story will be paid by something invaluable in the end. But I really do not let that statement influences my mind, I don't want to get disappoint, so I keep my low expectation. I just hope there must be a logical explanation about what's going on in the main story. I hope there will not be an unexplained (in a logic way) because I want the movie keep stay on its track, which is a thriller one. I keep guessing. But after watching the very end of the story I don't get this invaluable thing, and I just think that the movie should be categorized as a fantasy one. Even though the acting was great, but I think the story is just too simple, it all can be described in only one sentence such as: "he ***, and the people think ***, but ***". (I don't want to write much spoiler). This one is overrated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. What a beautiful piece of filmmaking that up-and-coming writer/director Jeff Nichols (Shotgun Stories) delivers. Not only will the story grab you and hold tightly, but Michael Shannon's performance will stun your senses. All of that from a film with very few special effects and a story based in a quiet, rural Ohio town? Yes.Shannon (Boardwalk Empire, Revolutionary Road) plays Curtis, a quiet, hard-working husband and father. His friend and co-worker Dewart is played by Shea Whigham (also Boardwalk Empire). Early on, Dewart tells Curtis (with a touch of envy) that he has a good life, and that's about the best thing you can say about a man. It's about this time that all heck breaks loose for Curtis. He has apocalyptic dreams and visions that a world-changing storm is coming.Being the strong man and protective head of the family that he is, Curtis tries to keep this quiet. However, his behavior grows more strange as he builds out a storm shelter in the backyard, gets rid of the family dog, and messes things up at work. Most of this wouldn't stand out for most people, but Curtis is the "normal" guy - the one who is consistent and predictable. At least he once was.Curtis' wife Samantha (Jessica Chastain) and hearing impaired daughter Hannah (Tova Stewart) are supportive and try to give him space, but the family demands are such that a husband and wife confrontation is not long in the making. Turns out Curtis has a family history that drives him to dig a little deeper and even seek help.After much emotional wrangling, there is a scene at a fundraising dinner where Curtis and Dewart have it out. Shannon's rant is one of the more powerful scenes you will ever see on film, and may have just clinched him an Oscar nomination.This is a thought-provoking and emotional film that doesn't beat you over the head. Things unfold at a natural pace, in fact, it may be too slow for some viewers. The score is haunting and never once over-bearing as we battle through these stages with Curtis.The ending may prove controversial, but I just smiled a very satisfied smile in appreciation of one beautiful film. There could be comparisons to Peter Weir's The Last Wave, or even The Coen Brothers' A Serious Man (sans humor), but to me, this one stands on its own as a story of love, support and strength.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A haunting look at our future, and present</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my teaser about Melancholia and Take Shelter, I mentioned being curious about the two films because of their exploration of impending apocalypse and mental illness, and the question of perception vs. reality. As it turns out, I only made it to Take Shelter during the films' runs at The ByTowne, so Melancholia will have to be a rental or On Demand order for me. But Take Shelter absolutely didn't disappoint. It's a fabulous film?one well worth seeing and, if you're into the nerd thing, analyzing.To recap from the teaser, Take Shelter assumes the point of view of Curtis (Michael Shannon), an Ohio construction worker who's beleaguered by the sudden onset of disturbing dreams and visions about a violent storm that promises to bring about murky acid rain and possibly the end of the world, at least as we know it. Curtis' episodes are so powerful that they leave a physical mark that carries over to the rest of his waking life.Making matters more complicated?or perhaps simpler, for everyone but Curtis?is that he has a family history of paranoid schizophrenia, with an onset age right around his. While everyone in his life seems to arrive at the conclusion that he's simply presenting the first symptoms of the disease, Curtis seems to know better; rather than just accepting that medication and therapy are the answers, he begins building a storm shelter, using money his family really can't spare.One of the things I was interested to see in Take Shelter was the treatment of Curtis' perceived reality in contrast to the reality presented through the rest of the characters, and whether it would really matter whether or not Curtis was right or delusional, given that his experience would always be framed by his perspective. As presented in this film, if not everywhere else, the difference between what may "really" be out there and what's in our minds starts to matter when we're no longer able to function alongside the people around us?even when we're right.The film also offers an interesting study from a mental health perspective, both of the symptoms of the disease and of people's tendency to dismiss any difference as something "other"?they'd rather label Curtis as diseased, even without a proper examination, than try to understand what's foreign to them or face something they may not want to.I can't say enough good things about Take Shelter. The script is among the best, with impeccable dialogue that never reveals too much and rings utterly true. The film features a great score that's suitably spare and haunting. Its imagery is demurely beautiful, and its performances are superb. As Curtis' wife Samantha, Jessica Chastain doesn't have a lot to do, but she's lovely in the role and provides a solid platform from which Shannon is able to anchor his exceptional portrayal.Shannon is racking up the Best Actor nominations for his work here, and deservedly so. He's fantastic. From quietly tense moments to those filled with frustration and rage, he's always perfectly on key. There's a scene in the storm shelter when he holds the camera's attention for several beats, and each time, his inner turmoil is so plainly, perfectly conveyed. I'm sure we'll be seeing much more of Shannon after this.Writer/director Jeff Nichols does a formidable job of bringing the viewer into Curtis' world, and then of turning it around and making it our own, giving us something very big to reflect on. It's a deeply impactful film, with wonderful glimpses of the good in humanity (the bond between Curtis and Samantha is especially beautiful, clearly built on trust, respect and kindness), and important questions about the darker choices we've made and continue to make, and what the potential consequences may be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A perfect storm of a movie, so take shelter and watch this film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A very good creepy psychological thriller. Reminds me of the Shining (1980) mixed with the Bible story Noah's Ark. Very accurate comparison. Great film, keeps you hanging by a thread with a feeling of uncertainty. Curtis LaForche (Michael Shannon) had a normal life with his wife Samantha (Jessica Chastain) and six-year-old deaf daughter Hannah. Until one day, he been having chilling nightmares about an oncoming apocalyptic storm that will end up killing his family. Those nightmares are some very terrifying and haunting scenes. I felt the one with him driving in the rain was the scariest. Second one is the birds dropping like flies. The nightmares continue to happen, as Curtis sees it as a sign that he must build a storm shelter. The only problem is money is tight, due to Hannah's health care and special needs education. He try to build it anyways, resulting in strain on his marriage and tension within the community that thinks Curtis is crazy. He starts to question himself, is he trying to protect his family from the storm, or from himself? The acting in the movie are very good. Michael Shannon did a great job. You can see it in his performance, as he fears the unknown, but yet trying really hard to stand up to his fears. Near the end he was also convinced that he was going crazy, but still in doubt. Jessica Chastain is astonishing. She acted beautifully and totally made me feel her pain as the character even though I've never been in her situation or in that kind of relationship. Totally convincing as an actress. The special effects and lighting were both good though as well as his psychological development. The musical score fits the mood perfectly. Beautifully crafted, like every single shot was given careful thought and planning by the director Jeff Nichols. I love the scene with the weird weather patterns. The movie reminded me of the movie, Melancholia (2011). Both characters were dealing with so called "mental conditions" that no one else could understand or believe, both had a feeling of impending doom. Both were excellent movies. In my opinion, I don't think building a tornado shelter is that out there crazy. It's not he was forcing them to live in a cave or in a mine for the rest of their lives. He wasn't forcing his family, but trying to protect them. The town people act like they never heard of bad storms in Ohio. There are always new reports of really bad storms hitting Ohio each year. Here are the faults of the film. The film is depressing. Some people might hate the ending of the film as it doesn't solve anything. There is no conclusion to the film. With the climax of the movie, it was sort of for shock value and not really need to progress the plot. The tone of the film is intensely ominous and I was very satisfied with the ending which came as a revelation to the characters and the viewers. Never have I seen an ending that leaves an impression like that. Incredible. Make you wondered if it was just another dream or real life. Overall: watch it to find out. I recommend it to anyone!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie, great acting Michael Shannon.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like the movies with Michael Shannon in it. He is an underdog when it comes to actors of Hollywood. This man is not an average good looking guy, but he can act like the best. So I'm glad a guy like him gets to act in movies in the leading roles. I have seen him in Bug (2006) and that was a great movie too. You never know what you can expect from this actor, because he shows a different side of him all the time. He's sweet, big guy. I could relate to his character as I am a father of a little girl myself.Now most people have been thinking about taking a shelter because of the stormy weather in America. Hell, I live in Holland and I have been thinking about it too. The whole movie you get thinking about what is real and what is not. It's in the genre of "A beautiful mind". The movie is exciting, it's not standard. Great acting, great story. The whole movie is not boring, you want to find out what the movie is about.The climax goes to the very end of the movie and gives the viewer (for me) a very great ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Take Shelter" transports you to the world of Curtis and Samantha, a blue-collar couple with a deaf daughter. They live in rural Ohio. Curtis is an average, taciturn, down-to-earth man who supports his family by doing manual labour in the oil industry.As the movie progresses, we see that Curtis is having frightening, unusually realistic dreams. These are not ordinary nightmares and they concern him greatly. He tries to cope with them as best as he can, but after a while he comes to realise they are a portent of some unknown disaster.Curtis quietly does what he feels he needs to do to relieve his anxiety about this. Essentially, he starts getting ready for the disaster. Really ready. He can't hide all this for long though, so soon this problem overwhelms him and his family. His wife is shocked that he's spending money needed to help their deaf daughter.Through it all we wonder how much Samantha can put up with. She's a no-nonsense woman, but she seems to love Curtis. And of course we wonder whether he's right. Is something big really going to happen? Or is it just a mental breakdown of some kind? (Like the one his mother had...) Most of us have, at one point or another, been vaguely anxious about what might happen in the future. But this movie takes us expertly to "dread", as if it were a place on the map. Something bad is going to happen. Dread is the opposite of hope really.The sense of place and character development in this film are superb. The acting is also superb. The pace of the movie is slow, but that didn't bother me for some reason. Nor is there much plot development. Man has strange dreams. Man gets ready for the apocalypse. Family tries to cope. These themes reminded me of the madness of Richard Dreyfus in Close Encouters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a leisurely paced film that tests our patience but its rewards are invaluable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On an open property, a construction worker named Curtis (Michael Shannon) is worried about the storm clouds looming over his land. He lives with his wife Samantha (Jessica Chastain) and their young daughter, who is deaf. Curtis starts suffering from reoccurring nightmares, where he and his daughter are being attacked. This is coupled with his increasingly irrational behaviour. He insists on locking his dog outside and is intent on building an outdoor shelter for his family to protect them from when he believes the storm will arise. This is despite how tight their money has become, particularly when they are expecting to pay for their daughter's operation. As Curtis investigates his own health and the medical history of his family, increasing pressure is placed on his relationships with his colleagues and also his wife. She continues to suffer because she cannot keep up with her increasingly distant and distracted husband. A haunting atmosphere dominates this slow burning and methodically produced psycho-thriller. The motif of a storm, as a metaphor for the internal pressure of the mind, is not a new concept. It's a classic Shakespearean symbol, used to evoke physical and emotional tension for the characters. This is precisely the brand of horror that Take Shelter strives for, investing heavily in emotional paranoia, as well as post- 9/11 angst and uncertainty. What is most refreshing for a thriller of this kind is the restraint that director Jeff Nichols brings to the narrative. The start of the picture is the shakiest because it insists on taking us directly into the mind of the character. We're involved with two or three different dream sequences, where birds drop out of the sky, furniture is turned upside down and a dog bites Curtis. The latter is the most rattling because the lines between what is real and imagery are blurred. The other dreams are problematic because they feel like they belong to a separate picture, like a cheesy M. Night Shyamalan horror film. It weakens the realism and the belief in the psychology of the central character Curtis. Thankfully, Nichols lets the tension build slowly but visibly in his characters. His control reminds us that less is more and that the unknown is most frightening. There are scenes in Take Shelter that are achingly slow to unfold but the tension is efficiently realised because of the quality of the direction and the performances. In one late scene, Nichols relies solely on diegetic sound and the reverse camera shots of Curtis and Samantha during a conversation. The quietness here is more unnerving and riveting than anything happening outside of the house. This is a leisurely paced film that tests our patience but its rewards are invaluable. One of other major testing factors in this film is our inaccessibility to the central character. Michael Shannon has face that rarely moves in expression and that alone ask us how much we are going to sympathise with him. The film improves immeasurably, almost to a breaking point of tension, as we become more involved with his irrationality and his fearful uncertainty. The script that Nichols wrote himself is smart because it knows how to raise the stakes for Curtis in an unstable climate but equally unreliable economy too. It's increasingly apparent in Shannon's performance that there's a distant void of a man, who is cold but seemingly ready to explode. Chastain is a perfect contrast because she's far more emotive and sympathetic. She understands the power of a close-up shot like few other actresses. As with The Tree of Life (2011), she shows us how brittle her character is, not through verbal explosiveness, but the most subtle and gentle of facial expressions. She brings so much feeling to this role. I hope she is rewarded early next year for her recent performances. Collectively, both of these tortured characters make us question whether it is better to survive and live in fear or to die peacefully. If this sounds daunting, there's a quietly funny scene where this is humorously visualised. After Curtis purchases several gas masks and an oxygen tank for his daughter, he makes his family sit with him in the shelter. The wide shot of the family mounted up together shows us their isolation but also the occasional absurdity of overt paranoia. Sometimes in the worst situations, all you can do is laugh. And this very rich thriller strikes some painful, nervous laughter. It's one of the most mesmerising thrillers released this year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very sad, special effects poor, character development poor, not chilling, scary, unless you are in second grade and never seen television before. I am more scared to go outside and breath air than watch this movie. It was a waste of time to view. Is the main character going mad or is it a glimpse of the future or is it an art school project, one will never know because the budget ran short and filming stopped. Save yourself time and money and watch a episode of Jersey Shore, it is definitely better written and developed than this flick. I sat though the movie in non-stop and have yet to figure out what I just did. As a side note, I love film, many different genres and I don't know what to call this one. The plot attempts to push the emotion button with the main characters daughter and his bond with her, but wait that actually has nothing to do with the movie. Then there is some mention of the characters mother and mental illness, but thats it folks, just a mention. Now he has nightmares or dreams, but is it possible schizophrenia or visions, uh no, just a mention again, no real development of the plot. Like I said, movie really stinks, but that is just my opinion.</fullReview>

As for the acting I find the subdued acting from both Michael Shannon and Jessica Chastain to be absolutely perfect. The acting is brought out even more by the excellent cinematography. The lighting throughout the movie is beautiful; The vivid colours reminded me of the beautiful sunsets I experienced as a child in the countryside. As for the ending, I do not really see how anyone could have a problem with it. For me, the final scene is what took the movie from being a great movie to being an incredible one.

		<fullReview>"We are being asked to take even larger doses of a medicine that has already proved to be deadly and to undertake commitments that do not solve the problem, but only temporarily postpone the foretold death of our economy." - Hieronymos II Jeff Nichols directs "Take Shelter". The plot? Michael Shannon plays Curtis, a Middle American breadwinner. Working class, blue collar, stoic and strong, Curtis works long hours for a sand-mining company. Free time is spent drinking, chilling with buddies, caring for his family and tending to various domestic duties. It's the American dream, and Curtis ably provides for his wife and child. "You're doing something right," his buddies tell him.Look closer, though, and its clear that Curtis is finding it both increasingly difficult and stressful to provide for his family. Determined to preserve the illusion that his little family unit is not under daily assault, he then makes it his duty to hide from them the lengths to which he quietly suffers. Such pressures eventually lead to Curtis suffering a mental breakdown. He experiences a series of apocalyptic vision, most of which involve his loved ones being physically assaulted and/or threatened by thunderstorms. Curtis responds by becoming obsessively intent on building a tornado shelter, the underground room a manifestation of his feverish desire to lovingly cocoon his family; to provide them shelter.The film ends with Curtis and his family on a beach. Here, for the first time in the film, Curtis' daughter and wife see the storm-clouds which Curtis has been envisioning throughout. This has confused some viewers, but Nichols' intentions are clear, the visions and thunderclouds representative of real life burdens which Curtis, like any good father, anticipates and protects his family from. They are the weights of the father, of the husband, of the lover, of the protector. In the final scene, mother and daughter thus acknowledge these burdens, acknowledge what Curtis has been shielding them from, and so lovingly shoulder some responsibility themselves.The assaults levelled at Curtis' family come from all angles. The family has financial problems, Curtis' daughter needs an operation, Curtis has copious loans and bills to pay, his mother has a history of mental illness and Curtis is himself clearly suffering from an early onset of schizophrenia. On a broader level, Curtis' visions speak to both his private, domestic anxieties (the loss of his working arm, the loss of home furniture, the theft of his child echoing his mother's abandonment of him as a child etc), and a larger, national anxiety. For Curtis, something is becoming increasingly wrong with America. Families are under assault, things are getting worse, its no longer easy to shelter one's loved ones and all illusions of contentment seem over.Unsurprisingly for a film written and released in the midst of a Global Financial Crisis (and escalating poverty, unemployment and homelessness levels in the US), financial concerns are voiced throughout. There is much talk of money, spending, loans, debts, "hard times" and several portentous images of gas meters clicking. The film's shots of agitated birds, oil stained rain and mining operations take Nichols' metaphors further; an environmental, financial, even apocalyptic catastrophe is coming. These are all heralded by massive storm clouds, viscous, oil-like rain, the angry funnels of tornadoes, and ominous clusters of birds, plague-like and seemingly torn from the Bible. These are the anxieties of a very specific age. The age of Fukushima, BP, Bear Stearns, Morgan Chase and Occupy, in which thousands are at the mercy of a diagnosis, pink slip or stock market fluctuations, and in which catastrophes both man-made and natural appear to seriously challenge American prospects for future prosperity. America's woken up to the Faustian conditions of American prosperity and suffering the insecurities engendered by late-capitalism.Of course there have been many films like this released recently ("Company of Men", "Inside Job" etc). Consider too "Melancholia", which likewise explores mental illness against the backdrop of impending annihilation. Most of them, though, have a throughly smug subtext. An unwarranted bemusement, in which confused white characters are shocked that "things are now bad" and "the economy has turned on us". The implication is that "capitlaism is fine when it works for me", problems ignored so long as "they're affecting somebody else". We see hints of this with the climax of "Take Shelter", which arguably displays traces of typical American optimism: "solidarity will help us pull on through", "the storm will blow over", "we're all in this together", "the good times will return" etc etc. Of course American economic prosperity had more to do with other nations being crippled post WW2 than anything else, and this current economic downturn is just another depression predetermined by the inherent contradictions of capitalism. There is something condescending about Curtis' surprise and something dangerous about the family's optimism; capitalism itself runs on psychoses, optimism and quasi-religious faith."Shelter" does one thing very well. People have always applied psychological terms to economics (depressions, down turns, animal spirits etc) ? our economic system is essentially a giant dopamine engine - but then refuse to acknowledge the linkages between mental illness and capitalism itself. In "Shelter", though, social environment and schizophrenia are explicitly, causally linked. The demands of Curtis' environment makes him totally nuts, and Curtis' Mom is herself given a speech in which her schizophrenia is linked to financial and social problems. Today the rise of schizophrenia and psychosis-like experiences in urban and minority populations supports such a stance; genes alone don't account for psychosis, and purely neurological models don't explain all available data on schizophrenia.Aesthetically the film's powerful, aside from two cheesy endings (in a cellar and on a beach) that reek of M. Night Shyamalan. Interestingly, the film manages to belong to the Southern Gothic genre despite being set in the Midwestern state of Ohio. Nichol's was born and raised in Arkansas, so perhaps Southern literature pumps through his veins.8.5/10 - See Steve Kloves' "Flesh and Bone".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, maybe plot-twist hell is a little strong but this is a loong movie with a dirty trick as an ending. The basic premise -- is the guy a true visionary or just nuts? -- is suspenseful, or would be if the plot moved along at anything like a normal pace. The characters get us involved and we want the guy to resolve his all too-real nightmares and take care of his sweet family.He's trying, or is he? Anyone who crosses him in a dream -- his faithful dog, a friend and coworker -- are sacrificed to his crazy fears. He seeks help but no one seems to know how to treat a pre-psychotic patient in this outpost of rural Ohio. For example, he raves like maniac at a community potluck, throwing tables and shouting doomsday curses, but the next scene we see him playing unsupervised with his young daughter.If you are really patient, you will get an epiphany scene at the end and a sliver of hope. Or not.</fullReview>

As we follow the lives of him and his family members, Curtis starts to suffer from apocalyptic dreams and visions. Is Curtis becoming delusional or are these visions the forebodingness of something really waiting to happen. The trouble is, after 40 minutes, you couldn't care less either way.The script is weak and predictable to the extreme, there is no character development and the scenes that eventually make up the story is mostly filler consisting of the most grating dramatic clichs. There's not one bit of dialog that even remotely stands out nor do any of the performances which can't be considered a surprise given the blandness of the characters.The current rating for this film does not give fair representation of the quality and entertainment value it carries. Doing a quick recalculation based on the more current reviews/ratings on this and other websites, the movie, in reality, scores a meager 6.1 And in my humble opinion, that's still being extremely generous.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The performances are flawless. The cinematography is great. The story is multi-layered - and there's an undercurrent of something sublime, prophetic, going on here, in the guise of a film about ordinary people going through difficult times. It's amazing that a low budget film like this can be so much better than many dozens of high budget ones. The texture and feel of it are real and deep. It makes others seem like Styrofoam.I'm absolutely going to be on the lookout for more films written &amp; directed by Jeff Nichols, and acting by Michael Shannon &amp; Jessica Chastain.See this film. It sometimes moves a bit slowly, but ultimately, that's insignificant. Definitely see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael Shannon intensity but just a little too long</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Curtis (Michael Shannon) has visions of impending doom, or is he mentally disturbed. His bad dreams and hallucinations drive him to steal heavy equipment from his work and build a storm shelter in his backyard. Once his supervisor finds out, and he loses his job. His wife Samantha (Jessica Chastain) is at her wit's end. The family is in dire's straits, and he's losing his sanity.Writer/Director Jeff Nichols creates a nightmare without end. But it's the amazing intensity from Michael Shannon that makes it work. His acting and the landscape creates the required atmosphere. However at 2 hours, the movie is a little too long. There are stretches in the middle that are too slow. It definitely needs trimming.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This viewing is far too belated. It always looked like something I'd really like but 2011 just didn't interest me like 2012 did at the time. But damn, I just finished an essay the day before all about mental illness and I should've watched this film and used it as an example - the protagonist even researches from the same book I used. Nevermind. Take Shelter is a story of a man trying to keep hold of his family while his world falls apart. It's a beautiful simplicity and it manages to hold its metaphor throughout the whole film. It's a patient slow-burner, but it gives such integrity to its mental illness film. Although I wasn't too much of a fan of the visions where the protagonist saw mysterious people in them, I loved how they pulled off the world attacking him via nature. It's the powerhouse performances that make it. Michael Shannon is nearly up there with Michael Fassbender in Shame and Joaquin Phoenix in The Master, I know he definitely has the potential for a performance at that level. Jessica Chastain definitely meets his match though. It's extraordinary how this film makes the climax work by being a mere tense conversation between them. Great filmmaking.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first film of 2011 that I was fully invested in!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For quite some time, I wanted to make a start to Michael Shannon's filmography and I heard that starting with Take Shelter is the perfect entrance and exposure to his acting. Now, I am truly convinced he is one of the great actors working today.Michael Shannon plays a father and worker named Curtis who is constantly disturbed by apocalyptic visions of thunder and a tornado. Believing his family to be in danger from either the tornado and thunder or from himself, he attempts to create a shelter for his family as everyone around him believes him to be a madman.The story is simple yet very effective around the fantastic characters created in this film. Director Jeff Nichols allows the story to meet the characters rather than the other way, creating some sympathetic characters especially Shannon's Curtis is brilliant portrayed as a desperate and deeply troubled man. Shannon gives perhaps the most intense performance of the year without ever going over the top and without ever acting out of character. In fact, apart from one scene which Shannon shines more so than in the rest of the film, he is incredibly quiet, giving a very realistic and convincing performance. Subtlety is the key with Shannon.The supporting cast all do a fine job and Jessica Chastain gives a very strong performance as Curtis' wife, Samantha. Their relationship is greatly explored in the film, providing much of the heart of the film. I expected to be intrigued by the story but never did I expect to be emotionally invested in any of the characters. I was so invested that by the end of the film, I was in complete shock and awe as to what has happened and what I have witnessed.The directing in the film by Jeff Nichols is absolutely wonderful, keeping an engaging and simplistic premise active for an entire 2 hours without ever having to resort to violence or any of the modern Hollywood scams. Intensity, mystery, emotion and danger are all powerful presences in the film thanks widely to a great script, fantastic directing and an amazing performance by Michael Shannon. The dream sequences presented in the film, where Curtis receives apocalyptic visions take it to another level of intensity and danger, as we feel more and more pity for Curtis.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my first review, I felt compelled to write it due to this absolutely amazing and thought provoking movie. For me it's a work of art, from the acting to the dialogue to the cinematography but more importantly the subject matter. I have dealt with issues in my own family that relate to this movie so it really hit a raw nerve with me. It actually opened my eyes and mind to my own past.Why this movie has gone under the radar in terms of awards baffles me!? The acting is something I've never seen before and I've watched a lot of movies in my time. It was so real, all the actors were brilliant but Michael Shannon who plays Curtis and Jessica Chastain who plays Sam were outstandingly good. Some of their scenes together had me in tears. The little girl who played their daughter was brilliant to, so believable.You really must see this movie, I'd go as far as saying it's the best movie I've seen for years. Jeff Nichols has an amazing mind! All I can say is WOW!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film begins with horror or sci-fi atmosphere where the male adult in a very established and mid class suburban family starts to have some nightmares or apocalyptic visions. However it shifts from one genre to another, from dramatic triller to sci-fi or fantastic during the whole film. Making the best of two genres, Take Shelter provides a very intense context -with its cinematography- where the general tendencies of both genre are transgressed. It is as if we have to wait for the end to understand if it is dramatic triller or sci-fi. At the end we see the decision of the director. It's a movie which reveals its style where the sci-fi prevails dramatic thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suspenseful and engaging viewing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Right from the off, Take Shelter is an atmospheric experience with long steady shots, sparse dialogue and a musical background that is constantly a step ahead of the visuals building a sense of impending disaster. The general mood of foreboding and unease generated by the style and direction is what makes this movie. I'm not sure I can put my finger on exactly why, but I couldn't shake the feeling throughout that this had a lot in common with Donnie Darko.Michael Shannon is superb as Curtis, an average family man who has the good life but begins to come apart at the seams as we meet him at the beginning of the movie. Is he going mad, or is he having real premonitions of a terrible disaster that will destroy everything? He plays 'unhinged' brilliantly, and is well supported by Jessica Chastain as the wife who is trying to keep him together.If I have a criticism of this movie it's the length. Although it never lost my attention, two hours was pushing it a little, and the is-it-real-or-is-it-a-nightmare sequences got a bit jaded in the middle section. A 100 minute directors cut would make all the difference.All in all though, this was captivating and engaging, and definitely recommended viewing.</fullReview>

Michael Shannon - as well as the supporting cast - give completely grounded, realistic and natural performances - thanks to the director who is able to keep the story tight, focused and again, grounded in the small, simple moments of ordinary life. He allows the tension to build to an almost unbearable level. Is Michael's character a visionary or madman? Should we share his vision, or regard him as a man slowly loosing touch with reality?

The slow building of some terrifying menace is incredibly palpable. So palpable in fact that I could only watch the first half an hour. I relied on my partner's retelling to find out what happened. I managed to watch the last five minutes. A person's descent into paranoid madness is awful to witness and when the paranoia proves to be a premonition it is all the more appalling. I wish I could watch the whole film but it simply is too real for me to deal with. This is what true and brilliant cinematic story telling is all about. Try not to wimp out like I did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Movie for Our Anxious Times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Take Shelter" succeeds in communicating an overall tone to its audience, but the film as a whole is better than any one scene that makes up its parts. It's a movie about the dread of living and waiting for something unknown to happen, a luxury only those who have mostly comfortable, content lives can afford. Michael Shannon plays a family man who's so frightened of the paranoid schizophrenia that landed his mother in an assisted living facility that he brings it on himself in a self-fulfilling prophecy. His particular fear is externalized as a devastating storm that will destroy his home and family. But you could substitute any fear in its place and you'd still have a movie for our unsettled, anxious times."Take Shelter" is a pretty good movie, and it's unsettling in a satisfying way, but it's also a bit overly metaphorical and a little too satisfied with its sense of importance. There's an overly formal air to the film, and other things, like plot logic, individual characters' actions, etc., suffer because of it. But I would certainly recommend it -- it's far more compelling than two-thirds of anything else that's hit movie screens in the past year or so.Jessica Chastain plays Shannon's wife, and while she's a lovely actress, I wasn't convinced by much of anything her character did, because of the way she's written rather than because of the way Chastain acts the part. And Michael Shannon is good as always as a man losing it, but he seriously needs to make a comedy.Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are two sorts of movies in the world of films. One is what we can predict the plot and the other is what we cannot. To me, "Take shelter" is at the latter side. And when the movie I watch is at that side, it gets a "Thing" to me. I mean, that is not just about the ending, but the objective of story teller as well. What is the teller to say with this film at all?? Some could take this movie as narrative about an insane man. But I do not believe Curtis is insane. He really presumed a disaster. But I do not think this film is about "Sixth sense" or "Super intelligence". This movie is incessantly telling about disconnection of human beings. Curtis does not get ANY person to help him literally. Now that he makes a shelter, no one believes him as normal man.. At the ending part, a great storm really comes and the film is at the peak. Background music was very little all during the running time but only at the moment, the movie spits a very drastic music to finish the movie. I think Curtis is NOT mad. He really foresaw something.I really enjoyed this unpredictable film. Wonderful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just finished this movie and I have absolutely no words to describe it. Michael Shannon's apprehensive performance has stolen the show. His character's torrid intimidation towards his own situation and reluctance in sharing his feelings with his wife has been displayed flawlessly by Shannon. Also, Jessica Chastain is transforming into a wonderful actress. I saw her in The Tree of Life as well as The Debt and her performances in both of them have been great. Not to mention, Jeff Nichols has earned himself quite a reputation in directing this masterpiece and this is truly a masterpiece. Now about the movie, a young married man in his early 30's starts having an unshakable premonition about a storm which will destroy everything, especially his loving family. His relentless pursuit of safeguarding his wife and daughter makes him to perform deeds with single-minded determination. He has to build a shelter, he has to fulfill his duties as a husband and a father. Although he experiences unpleasant nightmares and thinks of himself as a mental patient, he still doesn't give up his purport. His young wife endures everything she can, despite the health stipulation of their little daughter and even helps to out ride her husband's extreme behavioral imbalance. The chemistry between the two is magnificent. You should definitely see this movie if you haven't. This is a great piece of work in every format - acting, directing and storytelling.

If he had just ignored it all and kept on he wouldn't have lost his job, took out a loan to build a storm shelter, went to a shrink, and then taken his family directly into the path of danger.

		<shortDescription>Don't take shelter from this one! You might regret it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There was something about Take Shelter that urged me to see it. The whole idea of whether a man is losing his mind, or is actually for-seeing something dreadful is very attractive to me. I'm into ambiguous films with multiple meanings and this seemed like a good premise. The more I watched the trailer, the more it urged me to go and buy the film because it kept looking better by the minute, I was also incredibly anxious to see the ending. Well... As you can tell by my score Take Shelter did certainly not disappoint. In fact it provoked quite a strong emotional reaction from me and I'm surprised at how much talk this film is not getting. It should've definitely been up for a few Oscars (*cough* best actor *cough* *cough*) and it wouldn't surprise me if this film later becomes a cult classic in the vein of The Wicker Man or The Rocky Horror Picture Show (both were flops on release, but are now considered timeless.)Now I have to address the elephant in the room that is that people are complaining that Take Shelter is slow. Painfully slow. So slow that it's boring and snooze-inducing. Now I fail to sympathise with this point of view but my family didn't. When one of the most powerful films I'd witnessed finished, the people around me (my family) proclaimed it as 'very slow' and 'nothing happened!' and 'I had a nap half-way through it!' However, I can kind of understand this reaction because the film is undeniably slow-paced but by no means does that mean it's a bad thing. The word 'slow' gets a bad reaction from people (me often included) but let's not forget those fantastic 'slow' films. Imagine if Audition got into the action 10 minutes in. It would not have the same effect and we wouldn't be hailing it as a classic today.You simply need a good attention span for Take Shelter. You need to care about the characters and actually listen to what they're saying. I found some of the most 'talkiest' scenes to be some of the most gripping, I shan't list examples because I don't wish to spoil it for others. It also helps if you have an interest in mental illness and schizophrenia is a particular disorder which fascinates me, thus I found myself fixated throughout its entire 1hr 50. I found myself becoming incredibly involved with the characters and their position. Curtis is such a tragic character because he's such a simple (not in a nasty way) and ordinary man, who does not deserve the descent into madness he is given. I thought he was a captivating character and Michael Shannon's performance certainly helped!The acting in this film is top-notch. It surprises me greatly that Michael Shannon was not nominated for an Oscar (the film's probably too edgy for Oscar noms, I'm surprised Black Swan was nominated for so many, but unsurprised that it won so few *grumble*) his performance is horribly realistic and I really felt for his characters. There are moments that almost induced tears from me, which few films are able to do. His subtle going round the twist gives the film a realistic edge and makes it all the more gripping. The scene where he completely loses it is so powerful and purposely awkward.The screenplay's realism is quite fabulous. The dream sequences do pack a punch and it helps us to get into Curtis' mind. Although I was under the impression that this was the type of film that you didn't know what was real and what was in his head, for me the film was quite obviously about a man developing paranoid schizophrenia and it was all the more captivating for it. The ending certainly throws a spanner in the works and only heightens my respect for the film as it gives the audience ambiguity, allowing them to make up their own minds and form their own interpretations. The directing and cinematography were also both outstanding, there are some truly memorable images that create a lasting impact on you way after the credits roll (it's almost been 24 hours and I still haven't completely stopped thinking about it).You needn't Take Shelter from a film like Take Shelter. It's a quiet film with a wonderful atmosphere of dread. Its realism adds such power and I found myself compelled. The final 20 minutes (or so) are incredibly suspenseful and almost heat-stopping. There are times where I wanted to cry out for Curtis. I also have to mention the fantastic score. It was subtle yet summed the film up perfectly and was almost chills inducing (actually I'm pretty sure I had a couple of chills). Take Shelter may look like an under-rated film that no one's heard of now, but hopefully in a decade or two, we'll be looking back on this film wondering how we all missed it! It's superb.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>***1/2 Superbly-acted character study as thriller with a TOWERING performance by MICHAEL SHANNON !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the most compelling character studies with some of the best acting I've seen in many years of movie-going. The writer/director, John Nichols,seamlessly and subtly mixes several genres and creates a riveting family drama and psychological thriller about one man's slow, shattering descent into madness.Michael Shannon portrays Curtis, a hard-working family man who slowly unravels because of his nightmarish dreams and his overpowering feelings of a coming apocalypse. Though he's stressed about money, his job, his wife, exquisitely acted by Jessica Chastain, his handicapped daughter, a lovely Tova Stewart, he decides to build a bigger fallout shelter in his backyard to prepare for what he believes is the beginning of the end. We learn that Shannon's character also has a family history of mental illness.Are Curtis's visions actually prophesies of something terrible to come or developing signs of paranoid schizophrenia? One of the film's many strengths is that the audience is never totally sure. The film's ending, which many on this site found tacked on and pointless is as brilliant and subtle as the rest of the film. This is not a shallow Hollywood movie where the writer, director and actors spoon feed the audience.I can't praise enough the vividly-etched portrayals by Michael Shannon, Jessica Chastain, and the majority of the small roles. The acting, writing, directing, cinematography are all superb. Director Nichols sustains a creepy atmosphere that holds you in its grip until it moves inexorably to its stunning and provocative conclusion. "Take Shelter" is a unique vision that challenges its audience. It will surely spark intelligent, mindful discussion for many rewarded viewers long after the film is over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a damn good movie. At one point I found myself checking the DVD player to see how much time had elapsed, in hopes that there remained a lot more of the film to see. The story was that involving, and the characters were that credible.Beginning with an introduction to an ordinary man, his loving wife, and their sweet little deaf daughter, the movie quickly moves on to a series of apocalyptic nightmares and daytime visions that are suddenly experienced by the man, Curtis, an Ohio construction worker. His terror mounts as he tries to determine whether he is going mad or having real premonitions of a disaster to come, one that no one else seems even slightly capable of imagining. We watch as Curtis's obsession with these visions leads him into bizarre behavior, disrupts his family life and friendships, and costs him his job.There is a scene at a Lions club dinner--a most ordinary and comfortable event in the life of the community--in which Curtis finally reveals his terrors publicly, raging before his unknowing friends and neighbors like a prophet. It is a stunning moment.The writing and direction by Jeff Nichols are excellent, as are the performances by Michael Shannon and Jessica Chastain.To say here whether Curtis is truly mad or truly prescient would be the worst of all spoiler alerts. What I can say is that throughout this movie I had a mounting sense of unease and foreboding.This is one of a number of recent apocalyptic films. Is there a gathering sense of foreboding that is generating such movies? Is our anxiety about, say, global warming taking symbolic form in stories about the end of the world? I can't say. But in "Take Shelter" there is an omnipresent sense that something is very, very wrong.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all I'll throw out a little praise for the guys that did the sound design. I only listened to it in stereo and it was nice to actually hear different sounds coming from the two main speakers. It's usually so badly mixed that it just sounds mono, but this was actually thought about and mixed properly (for a change); well done! Now on to the performances, well both Michael Shannon as Curtis and Jessica Chastain as Samantha were truly excellent; I found I could easily connect with both of their characters. They were ably supported by Shea Whigham as Curtis's workmate Dewart and Tova Stewart as their daughter Hannah.The film has a very slow deliberate pace and time is taken to explore all of Curtis's actions. At one point he even sits down with Samantha and fully explains just what has been going on; his fears and frustrations and what he thinks might happen. It's a scene you would never usually get in a film of this type and I'm very glad to see it here. At first I found it quite hard to sympathise with Curtis, but as it went on and we knew more about his thoughts, I came around. It's a film I would certainly like to see again at some point; I'm sure there is much I missed. I know it won't be to everyone's taste, but for those that like this kind of thing I urge you to give it a look; you won't be disappointed.SteelMonster's verdict: HIGHLY RECOMMENDEDMy score: 8.3/10You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In Taking Shelter, a man struggles to understand the meaning of his dreams, which seem to portend a tremendous, calamitous event. Unsure of whether reality or insanity is behind the mess, he builds an elaborate storm shelter, much to the chagrin of his devoted wife and the consternation of his friends and neighbors. But lest you think this is simply another end-of-the-world movie, the focus isn't on what's to come, it's on how one deals with what might come.Curtis (Michael Shannon) wakes up each morning after horrific nightmares. Motor oil drips from the sky. A huge storm cloud approaches. A flock of birds flies in an odd formation and then attacks Curtis and his daughter. The family dog breaks loose and bites Curtis. All of this is in his dreams, he understands, but each seems to have some sort of real-world effect: blood in his mouth, arm pain, and other maladies. Is Curtis crazy? He literally has no idea, and to make things worse, there's a history of mental illness in his family, as his mother (Kathy Baker) has been hospitalized for many years.As the dreams progress and become more terrifying, Curtis decides to go all in and build his shelter. This is a problem, because daughter Hannah (Tova Stewart), who is deaf, is eligible for an expensive procedure, a cochlear implant. Wife Samantha (Jessica Chastain) wonders how Curtis thinks he can afford both the expansive shelter and the medical bills, and I don't blame her.Curtis is at war with himself. Is something coming? He has no idea. He's sensible enough to consult his doctor, who refers him to a therapist and gives him medication to help him sleep. But the dreams are still there, and Curtis is convinced something terrible will happen. In his mind, even if he is ill, he must find a way to protect his family.Shannon shines as the damned Curtis, careening from self-doubt to conviction. He doubts his sanity but is sane enough to seek help. The help isn't quite there, although it's well intentioned. Things snowball when the wife finds out about the money spent on the shelter. But we still don't know if anything's a-coming.Jessica Chastain, so perfect in the flawed The Tree of Life, is absolutely radiant as the determined, understanding spouse. She's not stupid, she's not a pushover, but neither is she the type who sees only the lie (Curtis's hiding the shelter construction from her) instead of the full picture. She loves her husband unconditionally. She is the the true power in this film.The movie exists on two basic levels. There's the visceral, visual level; Curtis's terrifying nightmares, designed to get under your skin more like a Sam Raimi film, or even David Lynch. And there's the subtle dynamic undercurrent of conflict: man versus self. This is especially wonderful to behold, because Curtis doesn't gradually change from Normal Man to Wacked-Out Man, and it's not a drastic transformation, either. Shannon's interpretation allows Curtis to be both normal and not normal, a Schroedinger's character. He knows something's wrong, but is it within him or without him?The ending is almost superfluous, but it is pitch perfect. We truly do not know, along with Curtis and Samantha, if anything is coming. Surely the town thinks him mad, but we the audience have just enough inside information to know that may not be the case. Or it may be. In either event, minus some minor plot quibbles, Take Shelter is a fascinating and compelling psychological drama.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Take Shelter (2011)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film I can't find fault with. Michael Shannon plays Curtis, a man who begins to have very realistic dreams concerning big storms and bizarre goings on. He is scared in case these visions come true, but also terrified that they wont as this means he may be succumbing to paranoid schizophrenia like his mother. This is what makes the film work so well for me. Many times in these films the protagonist immediately believes in the visions or prophecies they are having. Curtis' first act is to find some books on understanding mental illness. At the same time however, he is also planning for the worst by redeveloping an old storm shelter out back. This causes conflict with his wife, best friend, and the community he lives in. It's not only his paranoia of what might happen, but their paranoia over what he may become. Shannon is astonishing in the role, we never once doubt his good intentions, but always question his sanity. The most emotional thing about the film is knowing that if everything turns out OK then that means Curtis isn't OK. It's a Catch-22 that really captivates and involves the audience. The dream sequences play out more successfully than any recent horror, and we're never quite sure of when dreams begin and end. The ending is very powerful and should cause much discussion between film lovers. A wonderful film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael Shannon deals with depression, fear, and all-out paranoia in Jeff Nichols' reality-bending Take Shelter.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in 2011, a little film called Take Shelter made a big splash in the critical world. Starring Michael Shannon (Boardwalk Empire) and Jessica Chastain (The Help, Tree of Life), Take Shelter explores one man's struggle with his responsibilities as a father and a husband. Amidst the drama, a helping of science fiction permeates the landscape and throughout the film, the audience is left wondering about the protagonist's grip on reality. It is this very dichotomy between the real and the unreal that keeps the viewer engaged during Take Shelter. Curtis LaForche is a simple man leading a simple life against the backdrop of a rural town in Ohio. As the movie progresses, we are let into Curtis's mind, and we begin to understand that a penetrating fear has been gnawing at him for some time. As more and more omens seem to appear to him through dreams and visions, it becomes clear to Curtis that a terrible storm is coming that will devastate the lives of everyone he loves. Michael Shannon is cast perfectly as Curtis, taking great efforts to relay very little information in the first half of the film. Without spoiling the movie, I will say that Shannon's extraordinarily quiet, stutter-filled, and altogether dejected take on the character belies the explosive emotional turmoil going on underneath the surface, and it is a pleasure to see that come to fruition. Jessica Chastain, who plays his wife Samantha, is sympathetic and endearing. Her frustration and incredulity at the actions of her husband offer clues to the audience on what is and is not reality by giving us an objective perspective to identify with. The aesthetic of Take Shelter is fairly unique. By choosing a rural setting, writer/director Jeff Nichols gives a sense of foreboding, isolation, and visual splendor to the film. Storms are never quite the same when you can see them approaching from miles away across an entirely flat plain, and Nichols realizes this - every bolt of lightning or strange cloud formation offers wonderful spectacle. This is something I believe Take Shelter has in common with Monsters, another film which had little in the way of funding, but a lot to offer in terms of natural landscapes and beautiful cinematography. Take Shelter is not a film I would recommend going into without first having a solid idea of what it's about. While I enjoyed myself, I had no idea what to expect going in - and I can see how a viewer might enter into this experience without fully understanding that at its heart, Take Shelter is a slow-moving drama. While the level of intrigue is constant throughout the film, and the science fiction elements do periodically spice up the scenery, the two hour runtime and sparse dialogue might turn off folks looking for more thrill-oriented fare (e.g. Moon). On that note, while I thought Jeff Nichols did an excellent job directing Take Shelter by really emphasizing the internal and external conflicts of Curtis and Samantha, I felt that the pacing of the film was a bit off. The first half to three quarters of the film felt a bit bloated to me, dragging when there was no need to drag. Curtis's core emotional state could have been explained quicker and to greater effect in less time. Nevertheless, Take Shelter doesn't overstay its welcome by much, and this is really a minor quibble when compared with the greater whole. As the film comes to a close, we are left wondering - was Curtis crazy? Were his paranoid precautions really necessary? I will not go into detail here about these questions, but I always appreciate when a film offers some nourishing food for thought to the viewer; it is this very idea that makes a film like Donnie Darko so fascinating to its fans. Indeed, Take Shelter is nothing if not at the very least a smart, interesting character study of one man and his struggle with life's responsibilities - but there may be more to it than that. It seems Take Shelter was written off by many potential audience members, myself included, who felt it looked like some sort of ethereal post-apocalyptic film. Rest assured, the minimalistic science fiction in this movie only exists to enhance the drama and illustrate feelings that are normally internalized and hidden from view. The other movie released in 2011 that used science fiction to similar effect was Lars von Trier's Melancholia - but having seen both, Take Shelter is easily the superior film in that does not get lost in its own visuals and instead focuses on the simplicity of good storytelling. The acting is superb, the aesthetics are pure eye candy, and Michael Shannon is a revelation - I'd heartily recommend finding it online or on DVD/Blu-ray and giving it a watch. Verdict: Movie Win IMDb Score: 90% (92%)~ S?ren A Note on Lightning - Be sure to pay attention to Nichols' incredible use of aural and visual parallels. The comparisons of lightning to nervous impulses, garage doors opening to thunder, falling rain to water leaving a shower head, and a sewing machine to a drill give the movie an altogether unique feel and might in fact clue us in to the film's ultimate meaning. A Note on Noah - I can't help but find a parallel here between Curtis and the biblical story of Noah. Noah spends much of his time while building the ark taking flak from his neighbors over his apparent insanity. The joke, of course, is on them when the rains do eventually come. Curtis's obsession with building the storm shelter in this film seems to echo Noah's ark, but the conclusion to this story is much more vague since Curtis never gets any obvious vindication for his efforts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well, first Shannon and Nichols movie I have watched and I loved it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Woah, Roger Ebert giving this movie four stars is no surprise to me after watching this movie. I just finished watching it five minutes ago and I can honestly say that 'Take Shelter', by Jeff Nichols, is one of the best movie I have ever watched. Everything about it is perfect. The art direction, acting, music, and the ominous setting this movie has makes it one of the best movies I have watched so far in 2012.Curtis, a father and husband, is starting to experience bad dreams and hallucinations. Assuming mental illness, he seeks medical help and counseling. However, fearing the worst, he starts building an elaborate and expensive storm shelter in their backyard. This storm shelter threatens to tear apart his family, threatens his sanity and his standing in the community, but he builds it to save his family's life.Take Shelter is probably the best drama-thriller that I can think of. It is the perfect example of what Hollywood can do if they seriously think. With so much crap Hollywood churns out these days, we the people seriously needed something smart to watch. The movie's plot is fairly simple and easy to understand. The acting is really good and Michael Shannon in particular makes this movie memorable. His powerhouse performance as Curtis is just amazing and a thing to watch. He is one of the reasons as to why I love this movie. Jessica Chastain along with the rest of the cast also give strong performances. Throughout the film you'll hear ominous-sounding music that further adds to the mystery of the film. The music is well-done and who ever chose it should be proud. Also, there are some scenes in the movie which can be frightening and add tension to the movie.This film is a sleeper hit and should be viewed by anyone with good taste in films. Trust me, you will be more than satisfied after viewing this gem of a film.10/10 'Over and Out.' 13 April 2012.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Shannon delivers an outstanding performance as Curtis, a working class Midwesterner overcome by a disturbing, foreboding sense of impending doom in "Take Shelter," a menacingly brilliant film in which every scene intensifies the mounting tension of Curtis' life. As horrific dreams disturb Curtis, we witness his devoted wife Samantha (played, in another astounding performance, by Jessica Chastain, who seems to be cornering the market on suffering middle-class wife roles) desperately trying to maintain some sense of normality in their lives by selling her wares at a swap meet and taking care of their young deaf daughter. Curtis witnesses coming storms that only he seems to see. He begins exhibiting bizarre behavior that threatens his relationship with his wife, jeopardizes his job, and undermines his credibility in the community. Writer-director Jeff Nichols masterfully weaves a complex tale of one man's apparent mental collapse and its consequences on those around him?but strong undercurrents of uncertainty permeate throughout this film. Is Curtis really losing his mind? Are his visions and dreams really omens of what is to come? Never before have I rooted so hard for a character's sanity. The tension mounts to an almost unbearable climax?only to yield to a truly remarkable final scene. See this movie?it is a powerful and majestic work of cinematic art.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'TAKE SHELTER': Four Stars (Out of Five) Jeff Nichols wrote and directed this low budget film about mental illness. Michael Shannon stars as a man with apocalyptic visions of a deadly storm as well as people and pets close to him doing him and his family harm. He must decide how to interpret his visions and what to do about them. Jessica Chastain (who had an amazing year in 2011) co-stars as his wife. The movie is subtle, perfectly paced and emotionally involving.The film is set in a small town in Ohio where Curtis LaForche (Shannon) lives with his wife Samantha (Chastain) and daughter Hannah (Tova Stewart), who is deaf. He begins having visions of the family's dog as well as a co-worker harming him and his family. He also has visions of a deadly storm hitting his home town. He takes out a loan and borrows equipment from his work to make a shelter in preparation of the storm but as his visions become worse they begin to take their tole on him, his family and everyone around him. He sees a psychiatrist and gets medication for his problem as we learn that his family has a history of psychological problems including his mother who suffered from paranoid schizophrenia at the same age he is now.The movie is disturbing and painful to watch but all in an emotional and real way. We suffer and feel the same frustration that Curtis and his family do as their problems become very relatable and believable. Michael Shannon is outstanding in the lead role and Chastain is once again topnotch as well. The directing is perfectly subtle yet effective and there's a twist in the ending that definitely leaves the film as one to remember. An experience definitely worth checking out.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rje99p8QSz8</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overrated one act copy of similar big budget flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Had high hopes heading into this one.What is essentially a film about paranoia and the damage it does to the paranoid and their loved ones, turns out, in the end, to be one long drawn out, easily predictable fake out.An average, everyday Joe starts hearing things and seeing crazy visions of super storms ominously heading his way and swarms of locusts and strange creatures coming after his family. He grows progressively more and more paranoid and withdrawn, until he suddenly finds himself building a bunker in his backyard - much to the concern of family and friends.To say that Michael Shannon is a good actor is probably not a controversial position to take. He is. Yet, here, in "Take Shelter", he is asked, for most of the picture, to play a character who, emotionally speaking, keeps everything inside. For the bulk of this picture, because of this extreme emotional restraint, Shannon gives an understandably wooden performance. Not just that, but, a wooden performance that seems forced. The choice of playing the character this way is all done in the service of one scene in particular - a freak out at a packed community centre that comes deep into the picture. It's a powerful scene, but, it left me feeling that the film was more interested in screenplay mechanics and cheap gimmicks than story credibility and emotional authenticity. This delay-delay-delay-big payoff treatment of the central character reminded me of Richard Jenkins' performance in "The Visitor." In that film, Jenkins is similarly playing a character whose emotions are contained until one key scene. His blow up isn't as dramatic, but, nonetheless has a similar effect.On the film making front, the director makes it very clear that he thinks the audience is populated by a bunch of morons. There is a scene where Shannon's character is driving on a country highway late at night - wife and kid by his side. He looks out into the distance and sees one of those crazy-scary super storms heading his way. Pulling over to the side of the road, he gets out and walks towards the storm. Stopping, he looks at it and says, essentially to himself, but, obviously to us as well, "Am I the only one seeing this" or words to that effect. We already knew he was the only one seeing these visions. That much was clear. He, as well, already knew he was the only one seeing this wacky apocalyptic side show. The director, however, was so under confident about his abilities or so under confident about the audiences' intelligence, that he stuck this scene in there to make sure we knew absolutely, without a doubt that Shannon's character was definitely, make not mistake about it, the only one seeing all this crazy, end of world, environmental madness.As you can tell, I didn't much like this film. There were other problems - his wife takes forever to notice he's going bonkers - but, I'm beating a very dead horse.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is just the kind of movie that will appeal to people who like this kind of movie and apparently there are a quite a few that do. It had an interesting storyline but the dialogue dragged along with lots of pauses, words being spoken as slowly and as painfully as if they might be the last the actor got to speak before they got the chop. I watched it for one and a half hours until, finally, something happened - but not much. Believe me, I had no problem with the story but I just didn't like the way it was enacted.Curtis (Michael Shannon) fears there is a mighty storm coming, the likes of which no one has ever seen. He starts to have terrible dreams which are so vivid that he feels they are a premonition and he begins to act upon them. One action is the building of a storm shelter set in the ground near his home where he lives with his wife (Jessica Chastain) and child (who is deaf). The shelter becomes an obsession to the point that he jeopardises his marriage and brings them to the point of financial ruin. Unfortunately for Curtis his mother was diagnosed as being a schizophrenic while still in her 30s and was institutionalised because of it. So, are his dreams premonitions or is Curtis suffering from the same illness as his mother? Sounds great, doesn't it? Well, it wasn't.</fullReview>

The Sound and look is great but I'm a lover of an interesting story to make the atmosphere relevant instead. For all the credit the actors got I felt it was very over-acted and unnatural. Telling you to feel uncomfortable instead of allowing it. If you like low key films in which you see a man have nightmares only to be woken up sweating once every 20 mins, then you'll love this. In between you'll get to see a man look very uncomfortable whilst saying "I'm fine hun". Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This storm is ominous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Shannon is fantastic. So is Jessica Chastain. To be fair, this is Shannon's show. He's character is in 90% of the movie. The audience just follows him around and gets to experience the challenges and isolation of acquiring a "possible" schizophrenia disorder. Last semester at UNI I took Abnormal Psych and discovered there's actually a spectrum for psychotic disorders, from Brief Psychotic Disorder to Delusional Disorder to Schizophreniform Disorder to FULL ON Schizophrenia. It's also common to mistake symptoms for another mental health condition and vice versa. However Shannon's character really does his homework, to the surprise of his Counsellor on his first visit.The supporting characters were solid. I will just mention them briefly. There is their young daughter, who Shannon and Chastain are hopeful will be having a cochlea replacement soon using Shannon's work health insurance. Shannon's work colleague and friend, his boss, and some friends and acquaintances. Shannon is incredibly believable as his condition becomes more obvious to his wife and work, the more he tries to hide it. His anxieties make him behave strangely, the most obvious being the extension of the storm shelter in his backyard. His construction job is compromised by his behaviour, and I will just leave it there.The pace of the movie is extremely well done and the score really pronounces this sense of dread. I felt very uneasy watching Take Shelter. The theme was so serious, and Shannon's nightmares were quite terrifying. Both Shannon and Chastain have incredible emotional acting abilities.The script was well written. Often in movies I think "Well, why didn't s/he say this or do this?" but I never had those thoughts with Take Shelter. I don't know a whole lot about directors but I know they contribute immensely to a movie, so I take my hat off to Jeff Nichols. I think he also wrote the script. What he created was masterful.The ending left me feeling very sad. Before reading ANY reviews I believed the ending to be literal and I was just crushed. The family were so far away from his storm shelter. I just hoped there was one near the holiday home by the beach, not that it would do much good from what I saw. After reading some reviews I had many other ideas about what the ending could have meant. So the ambiguity worked well for me, and to stop the feeling of sadness I decided to go with The Wizard of Oz.Recommended by me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this! It was filmed in a suburb on the east side of Cleveland. There was lots of buzz in the local papers about this locally filmed independent drama. I liked that the community and homes looked familiar.Michael Shannon and Jessica Chastain were wonderful as the Midwestern couple Curtis and Samantha at the center of this story! Their daughter is deaf and while Curtis struggles to participate and communicate with her it is obvious he only wants to keep her safe. Curtis starts to see apocalyptic signs of an oncoming storm. He is worried he might be going crazy. It could just be daydreams or nightmares. Some of these nightmares are quite shocking and you will feel right along with Curtis the absolute panic that he feels. Curtis follows the rational steps that many modern men would to try to deal with his feelings of anxiety and of losing touch with reality. It is equally hard for us, the audience, to tell what is real and what is a dream for awhile. Could it be his family history? Could it be a sleep issue? Could it be stress over his job loss? Could he be a modern day Noah and be seeing some doom that is really coming? Best be prepared for anything! He expands the storm shelter in his back yard. Will anyone stand by his side through all this craziness? Michael Shannon deserves an Oscar nomination for this role as a tormented protective family man. I hope he gets a handful of noms from the various awards organizations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Apocalypse now or later?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jessica Chastain and Michael Shannon seem like the perfect casting choices for Samantha, a luminous but tough Midwestern housewife, and her husband, Curtis, an intense blue-collar guy who's afraid he's losing his mind. Curtis's nightmares and schizoid hallucinations/prophetic visions are standard stuff?catastrophic storms, with lightning flashes and funnel clouds, and zombielike marauders?but w/d Jeff Nichols has a livelier, more detailed sense of what his characters' everyday routines are like than most: Curtis works a drill rig for a sand-and-gravel-operation, Samantha sells handcrafted clothes at a swap meet, they both take their daughter, Hannah, to ASL class. Curtis may be too locked in and obsessive to be a wholly sympathetic character and Samantha seems oddly oblivious while much of this is going on, but the plot pretty much takes care of itself?it has the surefire spookiness of a "Twilight Zone" episode from back in the fallout-shelter era?and the fine performances and sparkling Midwestern landscapes give the film additional indie luster. Curtis's endgame plan to supersize the backyard storm cellar with a buried shipping container and ride out the apocalypse with his family endangers his marriage, his closest friendship (with "B'walk Empire" castmate Shea Wigham), his job, his status in the community, even little Hannah's chances for a cochlear implant on the company health plan, but I wasn't sure if the movie was meant to be an allegory of economic insecurity in contemporary America or if Nichols was trying to make some deeper point. The final, who's-crazy-now? reveal may have seemed like the only way out that's dramatically satisfying, but it leaves the viewer (this one anyway) feeling disappointed; I wondered whether the ending reminded anyone else of the old "appointment in Samarra" story, about the man who tries to escape Death by fleeing to another city. Long story sort?this is an ambitious project that doesn't quite succeed, but still worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Curtis (Michael Shannon) is a loving family man working hard to provide a decent life for his wife and deaf child. When he starts to experience vivid dreams and apocalyptic hallucinations, he worries that he may be suffering from a mental illness.Looking for rational and concrete answers, Curtis takes refuge in science: psychoanalytic books, research and ultimately therapy. He unexpectedly visits his mother to ask about her diagnosis with schizophrenia, which he may be suffering from. His brain is grasping at a medical reality, but the urge to protect his loved ones grows in him like a disease. He must make sure his family can stand strong against the most ferocious of storms.Torn between scientific reality and an interpretation of these visions he can't ignore, Curtis finds himself building an expensive shelter in order to protect his family from an apocalyptic storm. His behavior threatens to alienate him from those he loves the most.The prelude of the film is a succession of surreal events as perceived by Curtis himself: brown-colored rain, constant storms and weird-acting animals. Our perception of reality, like Curtis', is suddenly shattered when we realize that no one else can see what he sees. Now the signs are crawling to his bed in the form of nightmares, leaving him restless, confused and completely unfocused.The sky becomes a lead character, with a symbolic cinematography which is clearly of metaphorical significance. The repetitions, beautifully shot, with different nuances each time are aesthetic and disturbing; interpreting what goes in Curtis' psyche. All he understands from this experience is that he needs to protect his family. These codes, only seen by him, prove once more a la Tarkovsky how nature can become an integral character in understanding what goes beyond what we see, beyond the dialogue.The film triggers interesting points on the meaning of family, the responsibilities laid upon each member and the struggles between the instinct of protection and the pressure to face the greatest dangers of apocalyptic scales.'Take Shelter' is the second feature for Jeff Nichols, a masterpiece of visual poetry and a reflection on life through dreams and symbols. He has created a mood crafted like a rare piece of music, with a crescendo to a unique experience of a hallucination-thriller with philosophical dimensions. Michael Shannon and Jessica Chastain (Tree of Life, The Help) implement his vision with a pair of outstanding performances.Find all of our film and festival coverage, as well as our events and education at www.DohaFilmInstitute.com.

		<fullReview>This is a psychological thriller / drama revolving around a small family living in some awful middle-of-nowhere town somewhere in (possibly the Midwest?) the US. The family is a mother, father, daughter and dog.The dad starts to have nightmares about storms, the people he cares about going crazy, or getting hurt, and other catastrophic situations. The dreams start off bad and become terrible. You feel his tension right from the start and the film builds it beautifully. He decides the dreams must be a foretelling of some sort of an apocalyptic storm so he sets about building a storm shelter. The people around him start to think he's crazy and eventually he thinks he might be too.The movie was a winner at the Cannes film festival, and official selections of the Sundance and Toronto film festivals. The vast majority of critic's reviews have been extremely positive, and I am with them on this.The main character is played by Michael Shannon, who I know from Boardwalk Empire and not a lot else. His less-is-more approach really suited the story and I really felt his sorrow and terror. There's a great scene when he loses his temper and all the other actors in the scene looked as shocked as I felt.It's written and directed by Jeff Nichols, who I don't know much about, but I will be expecting great things from him in future. I'll avoid spoiling things by going in to detail but it had just the exact ending I wanted it to have. It just goes to show that you don't need a huge budget to make an excellent, moody, and engrossing film.more reviews http://claiready.wordpress.com/</fullReview>

Initially I was going to watch the movie and surf the net at the same time. Well, the movie drew me in so much, that surfing the net was not even necessary. It is a movie that demands your attention and deserves it as well. I initially knew Michael Shannon from 'Boardwalk Empire' (among some other small roles I've seen him in) and have always admired his acting. I give him stellar reviews for this role. He made me feel what he was going through, not just that I was watching someone emote. And while the movie does move slowly, it has so much meaning in each and every scene, that it's almost impossible to pull away.

From bad guy, to crazy guy and back again, he can also be quite silent. This role is a turn for him, being really the main actor in this. And he carries the movie with such ease, that you wonder, why there aren't a lot of other movies with him in the main role. The future should change that! Other than that, the story itself is really slow building (which can be taken literally for one of the aspects or more of the movie). There is a few things you can read into this movie, if you want to. On the other hand, you have to be patient with it too. Don't expect this to be "edge of your seat" material or anything else this isn't. Be aware of the movie you are going to watch and enjoy it! :o)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Take shelterFear is a phantasm that hides in the back of our minds, and when out of control it has the power to break even the strongest. This movie is about a man, Curtis, played by Michael Shannon who becomes possessed by his own fears. Curtis finds himself caught in a web of delusional fear brought on by strange dreams ranging from the psychotic to the apocalyptic. The storyline develops as Curtis succumbs to progressively worse nightmares that he soon begins to treat as reality. Curtis's life progressively falls apart in his pursuit to be safe; from squandering his family finances so he can build a storm shelter, to losing his job and best friend. Curtis sinks deeper and deeper into his fears, and if were not for the love of good women, his wife "Samantha" played by Jessica Chastain, then all would be lost. Samantha's commitment to her husband and daughter Hannah, played by "Tova Stewart", is phenomenal. A super mom and a super wife, Samantha stands by her family, and her presence is the calm in the storm. The plot line develops the char of Curtis as being almost certifiably nuts, but the final scene of the movie redeems Curtis as being sane, if not somewhat of a prophet. A huge vicious storm is shown approaching, bringing with it a strange brown rain; just like the rain-storm in Curtis's reoccurring nightmare. What might be some of the meanings associated with Curtis' visions and beliefs? Curtis seems to have a fear of being inadequate brought on by his love for his wife and child. Curtis is portrayed as being a rough and tumble kind of guy, doing things in not so pretty ways, but always getting them done. While Samantha his wife seems to be socially conscious and proper in her ways, and expects the same from Curtis.Curtis who is a man of few words has this family tension winding up inside creating double jeopardy for this already troubled man.On a side note, I think the meanings associated with Curtis's visions and beliefs are divided between the real and the spiritual aspects of Curtis. The reality of a dream or nightmare is expressed well by the following traditional Chinese story,and goes far in explaining certain elements that lay hidden in the plot.Once upon a time, Chuang Tzu dreamed that he was a butterfly, flying about enjoying itself. It did not know that it was Chuang Chou. Suddenly he awoke, and veritably was Chuang Chou again. He did not know whether it was Chuang Chou dreaming that he was a butterfly, or whether it was the butterfly dreaming that it was Chuang Chou. Between Chuang Chou and the butterfly there must be some distinction. THE BUTTERFLY DREAM, C. W. Chan, Url:HTTP://www.the-philosopher.co.uk/butter.htm</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An utter shambles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Looking at the other reviews, I am not sure if we were watching the same movie. With the exception of the dream sequences, which were the only moments of edge-of-the-seat cinema in the excruciating 120 minute running time, this unequivocally terrible portion of force-fed audio-visual drivel was mind-numbingly boring; timed about as well as a bowel movement during a road trip, and acted to a lower standard than a third-world refrigerator advert. In fact, I'm fairly certain that a broader range of emotion is displayed in the yearly nativity play at my local primary school than in the entirety of this two hour long excuse of a picture. There was absolutely nothing special about this movie- to be frank I was more thrilled when I read 'The Very Hungry Caterpillar' than at any point in this film. The mundane twist was so blatantly obvious that even the most primitive of film-goers could have made a decent prediction at the thirty minute mark. Honestly, Chastain should file for a super-injunction to prevent herself ever being associated this this pile of festering hogwash. Yeah, it's that bad.Please, please do not be tempted by the shockingly dubious IMDb score, or by its tempting appearance in your Netflix suggestions, it is a just a couple of hours of your life that you will never get back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really, really good until the ending ruins it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A movie, that for the first 100 minutes is both fascinating and riveting, is spoiled by the contrived ending in the last 20 minutes.Michael Shannon does a superlative job of portraying a man disturbed by nightly dreams of an upcoming apocalypse. He fears that the dreams may be the early symptoms of the same mental illness suffered by his mother. As the dreams increase in intensity, Mr. Shannon's character tries to hide his worries from his family while trying to determine his mental health. Risking his family's tenuous grasp with economic survival, he takes steps to save them from the destruction he fears approaching. The movie (for the most part) wisely leaves the audience free to decide whether Mr. Shannon's character is losing his grasp with reality or the dreams actually foretell an apocalypse. If you want to truly enjoy the movie, do not watch the last 20 minutes.To see my other movie reviews, please visit:https://nomorewastedmovienights.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wish it was a Horror!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A movie lover's must-watch simply due its incomparable quality filmmaking. One of the scariest films I've seen, and horror is my genre. No fights or monsters, but it's got great supernatural visions that remind me of alien abduction films. Though it's not one, if you like those you should like Take Shelter.The visions started right away and kept coming at a nice pace. Identification with the main character was a smashing success. And the whole film was incredibly sincere and true to life, with this effective sense of dread. I thought the pace and flow were masterful and made for a beautiful ride, albeit a tense one.The ending is the most real oh-sh** moment in cinematic history - much deeper than it appears at first. So you have to give it time to sink in.I couldn't tell it wasn't a top dollar production everything was so perfect - acting, script, plot, etc. - but it's definitely not flashy. Don't know if I'd recommend this movie to someone who only likes fantasy or action content. Very "grown up".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shannon Is Outstanding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Take Shelter is a psychological thriller mainly relies on Mr.Shannon's brilliant acting.From one day, a man starts to suffer from nightmares. In that nightmares, a serious storm comes to his town and destroy everything. He believes them and begins to build a storm shelter. However his co-workers, neighbors even his wife don't trust him. Doctors view it as a mental illness. But he continues to build it?Through Shannon's acting, this movie describes anxiety and fear that everyone definitely has. Also this tells a passion for protecting family. But for me, the story is not fresh. I could expect what happens next and ending to some extent.Although the atmosphere is good because of the eerie music, I think this one is a little bit slow-pacing. Sometimes, I became bored.To say nothing of, Shannon is outstanding. The first time I saw him was in Revolutionary Road. At that time, I was astonished by him and thought what a stupid guy he really is! This time, he compiled his career of acting crazy man. Perhaps no one can play this role save him. And now, I'm looking forward to watching Man of Steel because he acts as a villain named General Zod!However, except for him, there aren't any fascinating actors/actresses or characters. Someone should believe him! For me, the most dreadful people aren't someone saying unbelievable things but someone not believe them.I have to admit that the director of this movie is talented but I want tenseness and something moves me from this.</fullReview>

I am going to let a great movie be a great movie and not analyze it for you with my over-inflated opinions.That said, this is a movie definitely worth watching. I also saw Shannon in Bug, a weird head-trip movie and he is an incredible actor. The scenery is beautiful and at times frightening. I could never live in that part of the country, I would be in terror every time the sky darkened.This is about a married man and the slow death of his marriage due to his apparent psychosis and obsession with dreams he is having of the apocalypse. The extent he will go to to insure his family survives while his life collapses around him. The dream sequences are incredible and Shannon is totally into character.This is a great movie and if you liked Fraility, this is right up your alley.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I REALLY liked this movie. I love both good drama and good supernatural horror. While one might argue if there was anything supernatural, the feel of this movie is very unsettling, especially during the dreams.Combine Roman Polanski, Stanley Kubrick, Richard Kelly and Philip Ridley. Polanskis skill of creating effective but simplified drama/horror from mental issues, Kubricks skills for on screen imagery and creating unease with contolled direction, Richard Kellys themes and imagination, Philip Ridleys eye for bizarre and handling of locales, maybe even throw in some David Lynchs. Strip out all excessive stuff and leave only the best, the result is something amazing.This movie grabs you from the start and never lets go, I was completely tied into my seat while watching this, which is a rare thing for a new movie.Acting is top notch, great performances by everyone. The story has heart above all and it's a really good script. It's also very much an image of the time we are living in.My only complaint is that the ending is not necessarily the most gratifying. The rest of the movie being so good, the ending is a bit of a let down, even tho there's nothing really wrong about it. It leaves a lot to discussion, even tho it seems pretty straight forward at first.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A storm is coming!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Take Shelter was considered one of the best films of 2011 and it is a very interesting study of the effects of mental illness, particularly on one's family and personal life. Starring two of the most talented actors around, Michael Shannon and Jessica Chastain, Take Shelter is an engaging experience that will satisfy fans of indie cinema.Curtis (Shannon) is a man with a good job, a good living and is married to Sam (Chastain) and has a young, deaf daughter Hannah (Tova Stewart). But Curtis is a man plagued with apocalyptic visions, from oil raining from the sky to people attacking him and his daughter. As the dreams get worst Curtis starts to rebuild an old storm shelter in his back garden, putting his family, financial and work life at risk, but also acknowledges his mental health problems.Take Shelter was a wonderfully acted film: Shannon and Chastian are two highly talented actors and they give two very natural and believable performances as Curtis descends into madness and Sam not knowing how to react. If you have seen Revolutionary Road or Broadwalk Empire you know Shannon can do crazy and there is a great moment when he does flip his lip, but for the most part he performance is grounded as his condition affects him and his family. The supporting cast were also strong throughout, but for the most part Take Shelter is the Shannon, Chastian show.Doing mental illness is very tricky to do on screen because it is hard to put on the screen visually and everyone who has a mental illness have different symptoms and react differently: some people are open about their condition to people who hide or ignore it. Writer/director Jeff Nichols does a great job showing Curtis' torment through dream sequences, rolling in mental agony and the mini actions that Shannon brings to the performance. Curtis acknowledges' his possible condition but continues with his folly, leading to a possible financial ruin for the family and even his daughter's health. Sam has a dilemma, furious at her husband for what she is doing but also sees the condition he is in.Nichols does a great job making the film visual with excellent imagery in the different sequences, giving the film a creepy feel. For a fairly low budget film the Special Effects that were of a high standard when used, looking at the sky with the clouds, the lightening and especially for the dream at the start of the third act.Take Shelter is a very good drama tackling a difficult subject. Nichols does a great job keeping the film going, being interesting and does not let it drag considering it takes on a sensitive subject. The performances were incredible and Take Shelter is worthy viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was a fantastic film. I particularly liked the ending. My thoughts of the ending having my psychiatrist's hat on; Schizophrenia most of the time starts with what is called primary delusions which is a horrible sense that something is wrong, or something bad is going to happen. At this point, people are very confused and tense, but still have not lost their touch with the reality. They may have some insight into their problems as Curtis had. However as the illness develops to full Psychosis the delusions start to be more convincing and very real. At this point these people are not confused any more, as they know they were right they believe that others have the same beliefs too. At the end what we see is from Curtis eyes, as for the rest of the film, when he believes that finally Samantha and Hannah can see what he has been worried about all the time. This is not necessary happening in his dream, so that is why this is so real. He has lost the touch with the reality!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quietly unnerving look at paranoia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Curtis LaForche keeps staring up at the sky. Whether it's a bank of menacing storm clouds or a flock of birds flying in a strange formation he's looking at, this Ohio construction worker is developing the unnerving sense that something is just not quite right with the world, and that Doom may be just over the horizon. It doesn't help that he's being plagued by a rash of dreams that seem to be reinforcing that conviction. Before you know it, he's building an elaborate underground shelter and stocking it with emergency supplies - bankrupting the family and alienating those closest to him in the process. Throughout, the movie forces us to keep asking the question: is he mentally ill or is there really something to this feeling? Is he perhaps some modern-day Cassandra, cursed with the awareness of impending disaster but powerless to do anything to prevent it?Written and directed by Jeff Nichols, "Take Shelter" is a horror story told with all the quiet spareness of an apocalyptic parable. The rural setting works for two seemingly contradictory reasons. It brings a sense of foreboding to a small-town environment where threats to safety seem few and far between. Yet, at the same time, the stark flatness of the Midwestern plane can make one feel immensely vulnerable against the powerful forces of nature - be it crackling thunderstorms, destructive tornadoes or just an endless sky filled with towering cloud formations that dwarf anything on the earth's surface.What separates "Taking Shelter" from so many other films on the subject of mental illness is that Curtis (the stunning Michael Shannon) is not content to suffer in silence, but rather takes proactive steps to figure out what might be wrong with him on a medical level and to search for solutions. It helps that his mother was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia when she was in her 30s, and so he figures he may be exhibiting symptoms of the same illness.The movie also explores the more mundane reality of working-class folk being just one paycheck away from poverty and loss of health care insurance. That is the REAL doomsday scenario.On the surface, the film hearkens back to those earlier days of atom-bomb scares, then brings it into the present with our current obsession with terrorist attacks.On a deeper level, it's about the Sword of Damacles - that unspecified object of dread - that dangles over our heads at every moment of our lives but which we choose to ignore as the only possible way of getting through life. But Curtis, for whatever reason, is being forced to acknowledge its existence and the ever-present threat it poses to him and his family. Our modern life has become so safety-bound and sanitized that we tend to forget that, through our entire history as a species, we've been confronted with daily threats to survival. And Curtis seems to have somehow reconnected to that truth. Yet, paradoxically, we've also become a people who magnify threats beyond their actual magnitude of probability (terrorism being just one example).The irony is that by focusing so intently on the apocalypse that may or may never come, Curtis is endangering those close to him in far more mundane ways: bankrupting the family, jeopardizing his job, alienating his friends and co-workers, and driving a wedge between himself and his understandably concerned wife (Jessica Chastain) and deaf little daughter (Tova Stewart) with his bizarre and frightening behavior.Featuring a flawless tour-de-force performance by Shannon, "Take Shelter" is a subtle, thoughtful and unnerving film that gets under one's skin - as any fine horror movie should.</fullReview>

His dreams were so weird. Because according to his dream something was going wrong. By the way, there is a storm is closed to the little town. Curtis thought it was related to end of the World. And he started to believe this. But almost no one believes this. For me it is unbelievable situation. At last Curtis decided to dig a shelter. And he did it. But everyone thought that Curtis should be crazy. Though no one knows whether he is right or not. I think the main idea of the film of Take Shelter is indefiniteness.

		<shortDescription>A hidden gem. A slow but effective mystery/suspense film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Take Shelter is a solid film. In nutshell, the story revolves around a small town father and his family struggling to get by in tough times. One day he begins to have apocalyptic visions of of the end of the world. Unfortunately, he's the only one that sees what's coming and he's assumed to be going crazy. Each day he struggles to decipher what is real and what isn't and is too proud to get help. He has to find a way to take care of his family's everyday needs while doing whatever he can to save them (and himself) from the catastrophic event he believes is coming. All while maintaining some sort of sanity. The performances are what takes this over the top. Michael Shannon is excellent as a father trying to do the right thing in incredibly difficult circumstances. I really feel that Michael Shannon got overlooked here for the awards season, as this was a great performance all around and very moving at times. He's the kind of actor that's perfect for this awkward, misunderstood character. Jessica Chastain is very good as the wife trying to support, understand and stand by her husband. Chastain has had 4 great roles in 2011 (the others are The Help, The Tree of Life and The Debt) and other than The Help, this was probably her next best role. Both performances aren't over the top, just quietly strong and effective. The are some very powerful scenes in the film. Be warned, it takes a while to get there as the first two thirds are somewhat slow, but the last third of the film makes it worth it (trust me on this). As the film progresses, there is a sense of impending doom that is ever present and ever growing. The tension builds and builds and builds to an ending that has to be one of the best this year. I found it surprising, satisfying and yet simultaneously sad (but it could be interpreted very differently based on previous events in the film and discussions I've seen on the forum here). I think this is a film I'll have to watch again to fully appreciate. Don't miss this one!http://andretms.blogspot.ca/@the_movie_snob</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should Have Been a Best Picture Nominee</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Plagued by a series of apocalyptic visions, a young husband and father (Michael Shannon) questions whether to shelter his family from a coming storm, or from himself.Let me say this right up front: I think "Take Shelter" got short-changed by the Academy. While I am all for reducing the number of films that receive a best picture nomination, I think this film should have been on the condensed list. Not only is it a great film, but it deals with important issues of our day: mental illness, health care, unemployment and more.Michael Shannon is a vastly underrated actor. While he is not unknown, he also does not have the star power that he deserves -- can one in ten people recognize him? I think not. And that is an injustice. Shannon displayed his chops at portraying the mentally ill in "Bug", going over the top and yet captivating us. Here he does just the opposite -- playing it subtle -- but drawing us in even more.His character is not perfect, he is a flawed human being just like we all are. He makes mistakes, sometimes big ones, and when bad consequences happen to him we might not feel bad for him. We can walk in his shoes, understand his anxiety and fears, but still realize how his actions put himself and his daughter at risk. Do we sympathize or judge him? One aspect of this film that stands out is the apocalyptic nature of the protagonist's visions. Yet, this is not 2012 or a zombie invasion, and more interestingly, he is not a religious man. The "end of the world" scenario might imply a Judgment Day situation, but we never go down that route. Religion is only faintly in the background, and only for the wife (played wonderfully by Jessica Chastain, another big but under-appreciated talent).Coming back to Michael Shannon again for a second, Roger Ebert says "an Oscar nomination for best actor would be well-deserved." And Ebert's wife thinks he has the talent of a young Christopher Walken. I could not agree more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Take Shelter"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Plagued by a series of apocalyptic visions, a young husband and father questions whether to shelter his family from a coming storm, or from himself.Take Shelter is a story where paranoia takes over a man's life. It may be a simple storm in your eyes, but in his, it's a apocalypse. The thing I enjoyed of the film most is the realistic deception of how this guy loses his mind. The movie is a very slow-burner and sometimes sets it off with something horrifyingly real. This is where my only complaint comes in. In the beginning, it worked, but in the middle it seemed to keep dragging on and on and on and on and on, and I sat waiting for something else to happen. Eventually it did, but it wasn't what I expected. Other than that, the film has a Twilight-Zone feel to it. You don't know what to think while watching it, but your thoroughly entertained in how this guy's mind is working. The dream sequences were my favorite. They were real, terrifying and made you feel like you were experiencing the same thing. The soundtrack is actually the best thing the movie can offer. It blends into the man's feelings kind of. When he is thinking, you hear nothing but a tedious note. But when his dreams happen, it shatters into a dark, loud note. It worked in it's process, but again, the slow-burn makes it die down. This movie is supposedly art, and must have some deeper meaning behind all of it. I'm not sure if I completely understood it, but I surely enjoyed. I recommend for people who like to find deeper meaning in films, or even people who like watching people fall in mind's trap. It's a interesting film to instigate, but it's not for everyone. Otherwise, if your an average film-goer, I recommend not. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A near perfect storm, I mean movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stormy-corny puns ahead! Everyone take shelter!!! They are like nothing you have seen before, unless you have read my other movie reviews! Anyways, Writer-Director Jeff Nichols has blown me away with his magnetic theatrical creation of what is the film "Take Shelter". The movie stars a stellar Michael Shannon as Curtis, a construction worker and family man who suffers from schizophrenic delusions and horrific nightmares that a massive storm will be approaching to eradicate all human existence, so therefore he decides to build a grandiose tornado shelter. Jessica Chastain plays Curtis' wife Samantha, who at first is unaware why Curtis lives a "sheltered life"; and is primarily focusing on the upcoming surgery of their deaf child Hannah. Then Hannah and her sisters run away from home due to Curtis' instability; OK, I am kidding, Hannah has no sisters and she did not run away, just wanted to quickly insert a Woody Allen homage. All seriousness, this movie works on all levels especially its take on the very serious subject matter of mental illness. Shannon and Chastain were brilliant! I am still perplexed why Shannon was left out in the cold with no Best Actor Oscar nomination; I guess it was a "no-wind" I mean "no win" situation! Chastain received a very well-deserved Best Supporting Actress nomination for her performance in "The Help" but she was just as good, even better, in her heartfelt work in "Take Shelter". Chastain is a big female star in the making, and I don't think she will be sheltered away from some lucrative acting gigs in the near future. I am glad that the Baker Act was also incorporated in the picture, I am referring to Kathy Baker's astounding supporting performance as Curtis' mentally-ill mother Sarah. "Take Shelter" does move a little slow, but its impending impact will stay in your mind for days; "weather" you like it or not. Nichols subtle but effective screenplay gives "Take Shelter" an insightful perspective on the seriousness of mental illness. Anyone who has had severe mental illness will most certainly relate to Curtis' situation, and empathize with the horror of an obsessive mind's control on someone's life. There are times when "Take Shelter" is uncomfortable to watch, especially for present and past mental illness sufferers; but its force power is one that should not be taken lightly and must be observed. So do not shelter yourself from the gravitas of "Take Shelter". ***** Excellent</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Take Shelter is about a dark, irrational fear of impending weather/environmental disaster. Curtis (the father) must safeguard his family from his fear that they are about to be wiped out. Is this fear and anxiety in Curtis's head or is it real? Is he experiencing delusions or premonitions? Curtis doesn't know, but he must make hard choices: preparing for the disaster means risking losing everything he's built - pets, home, family, job, community etc. Stunning visual effects, great story, wonderfully acted. This is a really suspenseful and outstanding film, sustained by first rate but relatively unknown performers. Directing is first rate. A great lesson on emergency preparedness to boot (plus a surprise ending).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly great filmic metaphor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think a lot of people have missed the real heart of this movie - the fact that it's one long metaphor for counter-culturalism.It's a well written, well shot, well acted film, but it's real strength is the powerful representation of metaphor.Despite the rather odd (in my opinion) debate about the ending, I think it's pretty clear that the storm is real at the end of the film, and that's exactly what makes this film a perfect metaphor.What you are watching here is a modern day retelling of Noah's Ark, the classic commitment to truth even in the face of overwhelming social pressure to reject that truth.At the end of the film I was very much reminded of the famous George Orwell quote: 'in times of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act'.Forget about storms just for a second and consider other issues, such as the struggle for civil rights in the USA last century - the proponents of civil rights became equally consumed by their commitment to this issue, and they were also relegated to the fringes by those in the majority.This film isn't about storms and mental illness, it's about being a dissenting voice in a culture headed in the wrong direction - and it pulls it off with amazing technical proficiency and skill.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A provocative film about differences</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Human beings come in infinitely different packages and yet our collective acceptance of those differences is much, much narrower. Take Shelter is a stark study of a troubled man, Curtis, his wife, Sam, his daughter Hannah and the folk who he works with and who live in the same town. Curtis suddenly suffers from dreams and visions which make him feel something bad is going to happen, and that something is the most violent storm that anyone has ever seen. But Curtis may just be obsessed, possibly having inherited mental illness from his mother. But, no matter what, Curtis believes in protecting his family from anyone who gets in the way of his plan to protect them.The relationship between Curtis and Sam is riveting to watch, full of clues as to the kind of partnership they have and the depth of their understanding. And yet, as this film progresses we see the strengths and weaknesses exposed, and Curtis's behaviour is ever more driven to elaborate plans to survive.The quality of the acting overall is very strong, the quality from Shannon and Chastain exceptionally so, delivered with such convincing love for the art. The plot twists are not delivered with dramatic license but simply interwoven with genuine care. And, at heart, the film allows the cinematography and acting to make up our own minds about Curtis. And Shannon gives us such a lot to take into consideration but then there is Chastain making us wonder how long she can carry on standing by her man.There were touches of pure Spielberg in the direction, giving this film so much purity in its discovery of obsession, in its revelations of humanity at work, and of its ability to give us the scale of our existence. It is a great story, beautifully rendered, putting our differences in their place. Go and see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Many hidden layers make this gem stand out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film might come off as a simple story of a man's decent into madness, but there's more to it. Given that there his mother has a history of schizophrenia, it predicates the behaviour of the protagonist, but what is interesting is the way they treat the premise. He hides it from his family, his friends, his work. Even when people start to notice something is amiss they are judgmental. This threaded in the stigma that surrounds mental health. Furthermore, the way his paranoia was revealed was clever. He slowly pushed away all the thing that frightened him while trying his best to maintain control. The writing along with the superb performance showed you what it was like to feel paranoid by experiencing it with him.Many seemed to gripe about the ending, but I had no problems with it. Having multiple parallels with the story I can fully understand why it was included. I too have a genetic illness. I also carry beliefs that are invisible to most of the public, yet fully believe they are true. While my own theories were developed through thorough research and changes in perspective rather than visions, it does carry the same type of feeling that came off in the movie. That feeling that you know something and sense something so obvious, yet others easily dismiss. It can also feel very isolating to be cast aside as different or strange.I consider this one of those great movies that not everyone can appreciate. Loving film doesn't always mean you love the message, the tone, or the writing underlying the movie. Can't win them all. To me this is a definite gem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great idea. Tedious execution.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS: Great idea. Tedious execution. I have always loved Michael Shannon, but Take Shelter is about 30 minutes too long. While strong in the lead, Shannon's performance cannot patch over the anti-climactic and often redundant build ups. The film also fails to create a point of normalcy from which the characters are detoured and this failure stunts the drama of Shannon's growing paranoia. It's like starting a song in the middle. From the beginning of the film a threat is looming and instead of a normal life gone wrong, the only conflict is whether it is real or not. Missing a beat IMO. I think the score is partly to blame for this. It keeps needlessly telling us something is amiss. And the dream sequences should have been obvious dreams instead of the typical alternate reality tricks. The bait and switch of the conclusion is pulled off well, but about 40 minutes late. The only moment I felt some life in the film was when Shannon explodes in front of his friends and neighbors. That was a relief. Then the storm comes and I said, OK, now we're getting somewhere. But it starts to go to sleep again in the build up to the exit of the storm cellar. During his wife's speech about 'this is how you come back to us', I found myself saying "just take the d*mned key already! There's nothing outside!" And sure enough there wasn't. They used a lot more film than they needed. Still love Shannon though. Not his fault the directors didn't know when to cut a scene.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie will BLOW your mind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow. I already knew Michael Shannon from Boardwalk Empire, and honestly that's the only reason I chose to watch Take Shelter. Because when you are familiar with the main actor, you are more likely to like the movie. But this title isn't just that. I am very happy I decided to watch this, because I thought it was gonna be a slow-paced and boring movie. Only that it was right the opposite. Michael Shannon is perfect for his role and the viewer (at least it worked with me) is almost mesmerized by the atmosphere and the plot. He should have get at least a nomination for Best Actor, and he should have win. Man, I just can't believe George Clooney got nominated and Shannon did not. Anyway, I don't want to spoil you anything, just go and watch this movie (better by your own) and be amazed by its atmosphere and actors. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fear is one of the most basic human emotions, shadowing our most important concerns: health, safety, death, finances, loss, acceptance, and so on. For proof of this you need look no further than ads for insurance companies or negative political ads. Most of us most of the time can keep a reign on this emotion so that is does not consume our lives, but in this movie there is a man who, fearing for the safety and loss of his family, is overwhelmed by fear and anxiety. The man is Curtis (Michael Shannon) who, when we first meet him, seems to have a good life--he has a loving wife, an adorable young child, a steady construction job, a good friend, and a comfortable house. But Curtis starts having anxiety dreams that he can't control, the worst one being of a horrible storm (meteorological in the dream, but symbolic in meaning). For awhile I felt that the pacing was a little slow, but it is effective in showing Curtis gradually succumbing to the terrors he imagines, with a climatic scene having him erupt and warning people that a storm is coming like nothing anyone has ever seen and no one is prepared for it. Shannon is impressive in his ability to portray Curtis' anxiety, he makes you feel for the poor bastard, and makes us see the thin veneer of control that, when stripped away, would allow any uncontrolled emotion to ruin our lives. One of the ways I could identify with Curtis was in having recurrent nightmares during the cold war era--I would wake up in a cold sweat after having imagined nuclear destruction (this was commonly reported during that time). Apropos to the theme of this movie, during the cold war many people bought bomb shelters and buried them in their yards. I am sure Curtis would have been among them had he lived in that era. I think the point being made is that the general feeling of contemporary insecurity is quite believably severe enough to produce a Curtis.Both Shannon, and Jessica Chastain as his wife, give quality performances. Chastain is on a roll and seems to be destined to be one of the great actresses of her generation. She was wonderful in "The Tree of Life."(Spoiler) Initially I was put off by the final scene, but on further reflection I think that scene adds a punctuation mark to what has gone before. Fear is infectious, particularly in a climate of uncertainty.This is a movie of some substance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's difficult to understand how this Take Shelter can be such highly rated by both the press and the public, the latter probably a bit too influenced by the former, because the incredible vacuity emerging from this movie is completely distressing.Yet, the theme of mental illness is interesting and has lead to a few very good productions, but here, Jeff Nichols remained unbelievably shallow on the subject and the different reflections one could have expected, such as the relation to affected people, aren't exploited. Once the base of the plot has been set, you get bored to death for almost two hours because nothing contrasts in this superficial, repetitive, bland script with no stakes and where no empathy emerges towards the characters since they aren't developed at all.Only the photography and Michael Shannon's performance barely save the day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Technically Beautiful But Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The listed genres for this film are "Drama" and "Thriller," but it doesn't really belong to either of these. If there were a category entitled "Self-Obsessed Films by Well-Intentioned and Ambitious Artists Who Obviously Care About Their Craft But Unfortunately Fail Miserably at Telling a Story"--and Heaven knows there should be such a category-- that's the bin into which this film squarely falls with a tragic and unsatisfying thud.On a purely technical level, the film is excellent. All of the details that thoughtful film aesthetes care about, such as lighting, acting, cinematography, and so forth--are very well done. At several points in the story the film depends on special effects, and they are very well-crafted and convincing. Very little of the film is hard on the eyes, and it never fails to suspend one's disbelief. Writer/Director Mike Nichols' efforts are so earnest and well-intentioned that one almost hates to find fault with the film.But, for all its strengths, the film fails to engage the viewer, largely because such story and character development the film is able to manage take place at the speed of drying paint. The characters are likable, sympathetic, and one wants things to turn out well for them; but I found it impossible to stay interested for the two hours that the film takes to slowly, slowly get around to spinning out a conclusion. Students of film will probably have a great time discussing details of the film endlessly. The rest of us can safely bring a stack of paperwork to plow through while just glancing occasionally at the screen; you won't miss much as long as you pay attention during the last couple of minutes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Take Shelter..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Take Shelter" is a heart-rending story of Curtis LaForche (Michael Shannon), who resides with his wife Samantha (Jessica Chastain) and his little daughter Hannah (Tova Stewart) who happens to be deaf. It all begins when Curtis has visions of a storm coming...in the form of dark clouds, whirlwinds, thunderous noises, and a strange looking rain, the water from which resembles motor oil! Some of these visions are extreme and apocalyptic, laden with immense paranoia. He sees himself and his family being stalked and attacked by faceless people....and that is when he realizes that something is amiss with his head. He has these nightmares almost every night, yet withholds them from his family, for he is concerned about them; doesn't want them to feel insecure in the company of a mentally ill man of the house! More so, because apparently there has been a history of paranoid schizophrenia in the family; his mother had it too......! He just goes on with life, looks up books about mental illnesses and starts meeting a counselor at the free clinic.But are these visions actually premonitions of a deadly storm to come (he describes them as "a feeling", not "just dreams")? Or are they merely hallucinations? Regardless, Curtis takes up the task of protecting his family...by building a fully equipped storm shelter underground....."Take Shelter" reminded me of Andrei Tarkovsky's final masterpiece, "The Sacrifice" which also features the central character living in an isolated house with his wife, daughter and a son (who is mute!), and decides to carry out an ultimate sacrifice to save his family from the impending apocalypse by a nuclear holocaust. Only the similarities end right there and this film is in no way a rip-off."Take Shelter", on the outside, may appear like yet another psychological drama about a man suffering from Schizophrenia with all the essential clichs that usually infest such films. Writer-director Jeff Nichols proves this assumption wrong, however, and takes a whole new approach in which the protagonist senses early on that he has a problem and tries his level best to seem normal, so as to not affect his family that he loves so much and ensures that they don't feel unprotected. The idea of delusions of doom clubbed with this fresh new twist work wonders for a tired premise of a schizophrenic protagonist and thus render "Take Shelter" one of the best films dealing with the subject. Nichols handles the story with finesse and takes utmost care to not let it slip into the triteness of melodrama. There is drama alright, but nothing that would seem overdone. Every little bit is realistically done; every scene is carefully thought out, every little character reaction is meticulously written, except for maybe a single scene.Some of Curtis' visions are frightening and Nichols sure knows how to the scare the hell out his audiences! This film could serve to be a perfect blend of the 'psychological thriller' and 'drama' genres and has plenty of moments to please film lovers of both categories. On the technical front, the film excels in most departments, particularly cinematography, sound design and even special visual effects. Just behold those excellent scenes of the storm that could give any big budget disaster movie a run for their money. Or that chilling moment when Curtis and Hannah find themselves in the midst of some birds gone berserk in a frighteningly surreal sequence! The acting is marvelous all along...Jessica Chastain is brilliant as the caring wife distressed upon not knowing what exactly is going through her husband's head, yet trying to manage the family and making some modest money by selling in a local flea market. The little daughter Hannah is superb as the deaf daughter. Even though she has precious little to do, she has a presence that is endearing! Robert Longstreet and Shea Whigham make an impression in their small acting parts in the roles of Jim and Dewart respectively. Which brings us to the lead performer, Michael Shannon. Now, his performance is definitely solid. Shannon practically lives the character and makes it his own. The realization, the helplessness, the anxiety, the sadness...all pulled off masterfully. Only I didn't see anything significantly different from what I saw in "Revolutionary Road" in which he played a similar character. Only Curtis of "Take Shelter" is a little more compassionate than John Givings of "Revolutionary Road", but essentially he seemed like the extension of the same person! Now this leads Shannon into an even greater danger of being type-casted, because even if he attempts something different, we are bound to see a mentally unstable character, and that's not a good thing. One can just hope Shannon is more careful while choosing his next big role if he wants to show if he is versatile enough.Jeff Nichols has crafted a real fine film. This is only his second venture and he has already mastered the art. Some may complain that the film slows down at intervals, but it is the kind of screenplay that is best savored at a steady pace rather than in a hurried manner. In spite of the slow place, the film is engaging enough and never lets up, thanks to the fine acting and plenty of great moments to fill the running time of 120 minutes.This is yet another example of a great film that was sadly overlooked by the Academy. I can just hope that this review and many others reach out to film lovers all around and they take notice of "Take Shelter".Score: 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow paced, great performances, wouldn't recommend</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie works for 90 percent of its running time, depicting a family enduring terrible emotional hardship because of the isolated and peculiar behaviour of the father figure. For most of the film those hardships are well displayed, filled with dread and uncertainty over the main character's strange behaviour, triggered by his apocalyptic visions and dreams. The pace is almost too slow but it seems to be just enough to maintain that level of tension where you almost can't stand it and in the climactic bunker scene, it worked to a "T". Unfortunately all the depth and intricacies of emotion that evolved over the course of the film are flushed down the toilet by an ending that betrays all of the emotional investment that we made into all the characters and their struggles. I've tried to work it out in my head that his wife is only "seeing" the storm as some sort of reflection of her desire to keep her family together and thus bypassing the treatment that he needs, but if that was the case then none of the other metaphors or even simple story elements (her not hearing the storm outside the bunker, no one else seeing or hearing anything he sees, the dream elements that were exclusive to him etc. etc.), none of those thing make sense then either, except as some elaborate trick where the meaning of these element isn't really established at all. It all just seems like some whim to pull off an "AHA" ending. Either that or its just a poorly executed ending. The big problem with the ending is that the whole movie is about this man and woman trying to keep their family together, staying together through struggle (with his hallucinations and the subsequent chaos they cause), raising a child and then after the bunker scene it stops being about the family and turns into 2012.The intricate struggles of dealing with mental illness, its effect on family, friends, and workplace are all wonderfully displayed and I don't think I'm alone in thinking that that was the intent of the first 7/8 of the film. To have it all become a "see you were wrong" thing is cheap and crappy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A perfect metaphor for our anxious times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the most powerful of several family dramas this year (2011), and the best husband-wife drama in many years. It's a film of uncommon power and insight, written and directed by Jeff Nichols, who shows us the anxiety so many Americans are feeling in the wake of the financial crisis and recession. Michael Shannon, an actor of extraordinary skill, plays Curtis LaForche, an Ohio family man who's managed to hang on to a construction job with decent health care insurance. He's married to a good woman, Samantha, played by Jessica Chastain, who's dressed down here as a small-town wife and mother. The pair have a modest home that they share with their young daughter, Hannah (Tova Stewart) and dog, Red. Hanna is deaf, needs an expensive operation, and fortunately Curtis's health insurance will pay for it. This is a true picture of American family life ? a good marriage, a good home, a good job with insurance, all made possible by hard work and the values Americans have long held dear. Still, money is tight: much is expected of Curtis at work, and Samantha sells her hand-sewn crafts at the local swap meet to make ends meet. Curtis is content with the life he's built. And his best friend at work, Duart (Shia Whigham), tells him with envy: "You've got a good life, Curtis." We agree, until Curtis starts having a series of bad dreams that threaten everything he has. In the first of many dreams, or visions of impending doom as he thinks they are, a bad storm scares the family dog into viciously biting him. The next day, the pain is so real he builds an outdoor pen for him. This mystifies Samantha and Hanna because Red has always lived indoors and is quite docile. Curtis offers no explanation. He continues to dream of horrific storms, preceded by giant swarms of ominous blackbirds and sinister greasy rain. At first, he tries to hide this from everyone, including Samantha, because he suspects the onset of mental illness. He's just turned 35, the same age his mother was diagnosed with schizophrenia, from which she never recovered. He reads books on mental illness and seeks counseling at a community health center. He's entirely rational about taking steps to correct his problem, believing it's his duty as a husband and father. Still, he can't shake the feeling that a doomsday storm is coming, and he may not be mentally ill at all, but just prescient. If he's right, he must protect his family. Nothing is more important, and thus he embarks on enlarging a backyard storm shelter. But improving the shelter requires a bank loan he can ill afford, as well borrowing heavy construction equipment from work, which is prohibited. Curtis presses ahead, anyway, because he's convinced the apocalypse is coming. Curtis and Samantha live in a small town, and soon everyone is abuzz with gossip: what's wrong with Curtis? Samantha can't fathom it, but her love for her husband comes first. Chastain's performance here may seem small and subtle at first, but soon we see she's a partner of extraordinary emotional strength, and every thing she says and does rings true. As Curtis's symptoms (or prescient visions) worsen, he's focused only on completing the storm shelter, but Samantha insists they have a normal family outing and attend a community barbecue. He doesn't want to go, but does so to please her. Circumstances are stacked against him, however, due to a misunderstanding with Duart, and he's pushed into a violent exchange that ends in him screaming at all in attendance that they have no idea what's coming. Samantha is heartbroken, not only because of this outburst but because she realizes her husband is in great pain. And then to our surprise, the tornado comes, and it's so big it could wipe the town off the map. Unlike many others, Curtis is prepared, and he takes his family into his well-built shelter that now has electricity, ventilation, food, cots, and plumbing. What transpires inside during the storm is frightening. The dramatics between husband and wife reach a near unbearable intensity. And this is where Shannon and Chastain shine, delivering performances that match the best couples in film history. Shannon, in particular, proves he should have been nominated for an Oscar for his performance (note how perfectly he handles the nuance and cadence of the most difficult scenes). This is the electrifying climax, but not the end. And when the end comes a few minutes later, it will stun you. It's the best ending of any film this year, and it's not a gimmick or a cop-out, as some mistakenly believe. I was fortunate to attend a screening that included a Q&amp;A with Michael Shannon. One audience member asked the question you will surely ask, and that audiences everywhere debated: "Is Curtis this, or is he that?" But avoid the trap of a literal interpretation because the meaning is not in that answer, which Shannon confirmed at the Q&amp;A. Pay close attention to the subtle communication between Hanna, Curtis and Samantha in the final breathtaking scene that will put a chill on your spine. The meaning is in what they are experiencing, together, as a family, and it's an affirmation that they will survive. This film, along with Margin Call, are the two best movies of the year. And both go together, hand and glove, as cause and effect. The two films give us the big picture of America today: the history of the last 4 years, the events that dramatically changed our lives, and the stakes we now face. In one heartbreaking scene when Curtis finally confides to Samantha about his dreams, he tells her, "It's not just a dream, it's a feeling, that something is coming, something that's not right." This is a perfect metaphor for our anxious times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant in every way.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jeff Nichols made his writing and directing debut in 2008 with the intense and very underseen Shotgun Stories, starring Michael Shannon in a role more quiet and natural than audiences are used to seeing him play. His follow-up Take Shelter, again starring Shannon, is proof that an independent filmmaker can stick to his roots while still providing a much larger stake. The background of the story is a domestic drama, with a husband (Shannon) and wife (Jessica Chastain) in middle America raising their deaf daughter, but it has one distinct twist; the husband is plagued by apocalyptic visions that are bleeding over from his dreams into the real life.On paper it's a very interesting premise, but there are a thousand ways for it to go wrong when coming to the screen. Thankfully, someone as talented as Nichols is responsible for bringing it there and as a result this one doesn't miss a beat. As an exploration into the mind of a man dealing with a potential psychotic break, it's fascinating. At first I was a little critical about how far he shuts himself off from the world, not even telling his wife about his episodes, but as more about the character comes to our attention, we begin to understand and see that the world coming to an end might not be the thing he fears most. Shannon's Curtis is a hardworking family man who is trying to do right by his wife and daughter, but these visions are consuming him and so he goes to work on putting together a storm shelter in their backyard.Nichols' script and Shannon's performance strike this impressive crisis within Curtis' mind; he sees these horrific visions of the end of days and he is caught in a turmoil over whether he has to protect his family from the coming storm...or from his own mind slipping away from sanity. It's a difficult mix to pull off, especially with an actor as physically intimidating as Shannon who faces the same problems as Jack Nicholson had when doing The Shining, where the actor is generally associated as someone with a loose grip on reality and could be hard to believe as someone gradually slipping from sanity.Shannon has for years been an underrated actor as a result of this unique appearance, but this is the finest example yet of his natural ability to portray human characters. For most of the film he doesn't shout or portray Curtis as a psychotic man; he's a very real person dealing with an extraordinary situation. At first he is frightened by these visions, but gradually he starts to accept them as part of his daily routine and it's remarkable the way that Shannon plays this; no longer is he paranoid at every turn, but instead there's a weight on his shoulders that is slowly breaking him but he knows he can't fight. It's absolutely heartbreaking. Although there are some moments where everything becomes too much for him and he lets loose in grand and absolutely shattering fashion, there's a delicacy in his portrayal that makes you sympathize with him and desperately root for visions to not drive away everything he loves.For a little while I was frustrated by how his wife Samantha was being portrayed; the very standard and thinly written nagging wife of a psychotic man. However around the halfway mark of the film there is a turn, which I won't spoil, that takes this dynamic into a whole new area; one that impressed me a great deal. Nichols fleshes out the character much more than I was anticipating from the early scenes, and Jessica Chastain plays her with a combination of exhaustion, concern and futile attempts at understanding that is strikingly honest.There's a scene where Curtis asks Samantha if she's going to leave him, and instead of shouting at him or breaking down she just grabs him by the hand and tells him what they are going to do in order to get back on the right track. It's a soft moment, but it brought me to tears in it's beauty and honesty. Shannon and Chastain have a wonderfully chemistry together and it really gives the film a human touch that is able to make the stakes feel important. I cared deeply about these characters and as a result had my own emotional investment in what the outcome was going to be.Then, of course, come the visions themselves. Again, there's potential here for Nichols to go the way of strict horror and make madhouse nightmares of epic proportions, but instead he plays everything a lot closer to the chest. He grounds each moment in realism and many times I found myself caught in a question of whether what was happening was really happening or not. There were only a few times where things started out clearly as a dream and the rest began the same as any other moment; an interesting and absorbing technique.With the help of a hypnotizing score and a way of shooting that is very claustrophobic and tight on the actors, Nichols is able to bring us right into the mindset of this man and we feel every one of his fears. The ending is one that is sure to be hotly discussed by those who have seen the film, but personally I'm glad that Nichols ended it the way he did and I don't think that there could have been any other way to properly conclude this journey; it's a film that is sure to haunt those who are as hypnotized by it as I was and one that cements Jeff Nichols as one of the most promising American filmmakers today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Post-Apocalyptic Mid-Western Nightmare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While this is not one of those movies you necessarily seek out, Jeff Nichols' Take Shelter is one of those post-apocalyptic absurdist psychological thrillers that you don't see coming.Take Shelter is by far the most original case of paranoid schizophrenia I've ever seen filmed in the mid-west. While the problems Curtis (Michael Shannon) is having with his nightmares seems almost trivial, the length to which he is taking these problems is what is most unbelievable about the character of Take Shelter. And a nice touch to this mid-western drama is the interplay Nichols shoots between Curtis' realities, and his post-apocalyptic nightmares, because until you are used to Nichols' scheme you can never tell which is which.Having nightmares, waking up, and talking about them with your loved ones is one thing, but to involve other people in your reactions to the nightmares you've been having is just plain psychotic, a nightmare in itself, and that is exactly what's happening in Take Shelter. Curtis doesn't discuss the nightmares he's been having with people. Instead, Curtis is making drastic decisions that directly affect the lives of his loved ones based on his own nightmares.Also for those that have not ever seen Shannon act, Take Shelter is definitely a great place to start. The transition Shannon's character Curtis makes from traditional family man to a paranoid schizophrenic is immediate, yet casual, in a way that is almost funny. In Take Shelter, Shannon as Curtis, embodies all of the characteristics you could see in your neighbor organizing his garage, or working on his car at 2:30 in the morning. The writing of Curtis' character feels like it was written for Shannon.The long-term decisions Curtis is making throughout Take Shelter are affecting his personal life, not only mentally, and physically but financially, and that is in fact the most horrifying quality of Take Shelter. Jessica Chastain as Samantha plays as a compliment to Curtis' self-destructive behavior. If it weren't for the nightmares provided by Nichols and Chastain's presence as Curtis' tolerant wife, then I'm afraid the character of Take Shelter would've lost all of its' credibility.Where we do not want this beautiful marriage to be broken up by these post-apocalyptic visionary nightmares, we cannot help but to feel like we are just waiting for it to happen. If not the divorce of his marriage, at least the storm he's been seeing in his nightmares must. Wondering which out of these two things are going to happen in Take Shelter is the largest suspense factor being played throughout this picture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Take Shelter? More like I wanna take a damn nap! I am in agreement for the most part with the rest of the reviews for this film about the acting being tolerable almost good during certain scenes. That being said the film itself is excruciatingly S L O W and there really is nothing that makes you latch onto or keep you wanting more. Is he a schizophrenic or is this some sort of existential parable or is this indeed a disaster film? Whatever the case I really don't care because its too damn long and boring. It would have been awesome to see some sort of ultimate battle between Curtis and his underling Dewart or his wife or...what the hell, the Devil hisself! Something to make this movie a bit more interesting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"he starts building an elaborate and expensive storm shelter in their backyard".sensationalizing the story with this line. the storm shelter was neither elaborate nor that expensive. He bought a shipping container to extend the existing storm shelter, I was expecting something more. The ending was a let down, I could not tell if it was a dream or real. It should have ended with his vindication by having he and his family leaving the shelter only to find devastation around them. a good movie just the same</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unbelievable emotional power</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Take Shelter" was described to me as a character-driven indie movie with a twist ending, which immediately made me think of something like "Another Earth". And most of the time (for me, at least) a controversial ending is just something that torpedoes the rest of the movie; a "gotcha" that undermines a movie's defining qualities and retains notoriety based simply on that cheat. "Take Shelter" is the undeniable exception.Everything here rests on the shoulders of Michael Shannon. He embodies some pretty universal fears (the economy, job security, protecting one's family) while staring down the barrel of a family history of mental illness. Is there really a storm coming or is it just in his head? And that sounds like a low-grade plot gimmick, but it's the treatment thereof that's anything but. And that's key, because this is driven by character and his tremendous talent. We're never really sure what the answer is, but his suffering and descent are slow and painful.And that's another thing: given the leisurely pacing, you'd think this would be a complete snore. But one thing this movie does very well (among others) is ratchet the dread. There's only one violent altercation in this story, but you always fear a quiet moment between Shannon's family - a meal at the table, a conversation in the bedroom - as they struggle to deal with this endurance test. I have nothing but good things to say about this film; gripping, unusually sensitive and speaks to the love and support of family.9/10 And as for the ending; it's deliberately ambiguous, but seems to work no matter what you take from this. That's impressive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful metaphor of the American working class family insecurity today</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my personal interpretation. I know I am flying high, but this what I felt at the end of the movie.There is a father being afraid of a coming storm (economy recession?) and not being able to protect his own family. A big storm where rain is like oil: well oil is the disaster of the American economy since 60 years (oil wars/terrorism).In the past year there has a growing number of American people who get more and more conscious of the coming recession of the American economy and the consequent insecurity of the American style of life. The first ones to be "under attack" era the working class. Check how many things this family is going through: losing job, losing welfare... I don't really focus on what is real and what is fake in a movie: a movie is a story telling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely mesmerizing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All the details aside, the movie as a whole is just mesmerizing.I can understand why some people find it (really) boring. After all it's no roller-coaster ride. No, it's a totally different kind of thrill. It's that kind that captivates you so slowly that you don't realize it. In my opinion this is the best kind of suspense.This mood has been achieved by outstanding acting performances, by an amazing cinematography, by a perfect fitting score, by an excellent direction and editing, by a fascinating story and basically by everything else I forgot to mention.This movie is for everyone who enjoys movies with a slow, natural pace.E.g. if you love the pace of Tarkovski, of "2001", "Fitzcarraldo" and "Paris,Texas", this movie is for you. If you prefer the Extended Editions of "Lord of the Rings" to the standard versions and the Redux version of "Apocalypse Now" to the original one - this movie is for you. If you rather lie on a hill and watch people and animals, when you're visiting a foreign country, instead of partying in the biggest club in town - this movie is for you.This is the first movie by Jeff Nichols that I've watched and I'm really looking forward to watching everything else made by him.Thank you, Jeff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I stumbled across this movie by just scrolling while on a streaming website and am I ever glad I stopped and clicked 'play'. Too often I end up spoiling movies and TV shows for myself by coming here and reading up on them, but this time I didn't. Not surprisingly I was thrilled I did it that way. From the very minute this movie started I was swept up in the building suspense. The man who played the dad was fantastic. His facial expressions were spot on. You could literally see inside his mind as the emotions worked their way through his brain. The mom was great too. I could feel her fear of her husband as his growing paranoia (or was it?) took over their lives. This is the kind of movie I would rave about to anyone who would listen, and even though I just watched it this afternoon, I want to watch it again right away. I think there are many pieces I missed. Great movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Curtis is a middle class American, not living a lavish lifestyle but getting by. He has a loving family that is determined to look at the bright side even with his daughter's deafness; they are making progress through therapy, and have a cochlear implant surgery lined up. But his life begins to deteriorate when he begins having visions of a raging impending storm, dreams of an apocalyptic nightmare. These consume his life. Nichols retains his distance and vagueness; we don't fully have an answer to why these visions inflict Curtis, nor are we sure of what is reality in those tense last few scenes. This allows audiences a myriad of interpretations and suggestions of subtext. But it is also a double edged sword because be too vague and it allows validation of crockpot and unsubstantial theories, or cries of anti- climatic. Then again, it is all personal subjective opinion. Nichols doesn't delve too deeply into that end; it is the slow burn of the suspense and thrill of Curtis' demise that this film will be remembered for. Michael Shannon is impeccable - his ability to feign comfort, his wayward glances, his mumbled and stuttered speech. It is agonising for the audience as his family and work relations break down, even as the staccato visions and dreams plague him. Nichols' pacing augments this apprehension. This quite dread climaxes in that Lions Club Dinner scene where he explodes in a maniacal rage and forewarning. We've had plenty of these outbursts before, but Shannon makes it terrifying and almost believable. I wonder if Noah was ever faced with such social ramifications. The reaction of Sam (Jessica Chastain) is a touch that I enjoyed, where most films would have the wife and daughter slowly backing away in horror and recognition of the madness. Chastain will be overshadowed, but her performance is magnificently subtle; in her relief of the good health insurance news, in her panic and fear as Curtis has an apparent seizure, in her steadfast willingness to stick by him even as he blows their financial hopes and embarrasses himself in public. Her trembling hands provide more comfort than he thinks he deserves. She is stronger than CUrtis, and realises the need for her to let him open the door for himself. This is a film about mental illness, but also about the financial anxiety of modern America. We cringe but watch on intently as Curtis blows money on gas masks, construction equipment and a crude storm shelter, but we sympathise with how his life has been taken over. We see the clear ineptitude of the mental health services and how unequiped they are to deal with Curtis' situation, as he jumps through hoops and payments. So the ending may be a powerful statement about the paranoia and confusion that mental illness may bring; the opening of the door as a admittance of a problem, and the impending storm as a metaphoric challenge for the young family. This interpretation is just one of many, but fits with the increasingly dread and hostility as Curtis alienates everyone around him. The initial aural parallels foreshadow this and use sound bridges elegantly; the dirty brown rain shares the morning shower of a weary Curtis, and the construction drill to Sam's sewing machine. Credit must be given to the score by Wingo, which personifies dread and fear in its frenzied strings, but backs away during moments of intense emotion before building for that inevitable explosion (or lack of it). This is most evident in the storm shelter scene and that teary-eyed plea from Chastain to Curtis to take his dilemma into his own hands. The editing is tight but revealing. No better scene illustrates this than the final one, where we are aware of what is to come long before the money shot, through close-ups of terror and disbelief, of innocent sand castles hurriedly abandoned, of a murky yet very clear reflection in the window of a gigantic and monstrous storm approaching. Nichols' use of sparse yet foreboding special effects of oily rain and the possessed flight of birds makes the ending that much more intense; he is able to milk the emotional dread as much as possible until he finally cuts to the wide shot. But in this storm, they stand together.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just finished watching "Take Shelter".....and I agree it was a sleeper hit of 2011. I rented it from our local library......and actually I almost didn't. I'm very glad I did. The movie deals with a hard working husband/father....who starts being effected by mental problems. For me.....this was a direct connection....cause I suffer with depression and anxiety....so when he was going through certain episodes......I was shaking my head.....yep....been there. Michael Shannon plays Curtis....and hits the nail squarely on the head...thinking he's dreaming of signs of a bad storm coming. He sets out to building a heavy duty storm shelter....which causes stress with his wife (played by Jessica Chastain) and special needs daughter whose deaf (played by Tova Stewart). I would have definitely nominated Michael Shannon for an Academy Award for his portrayal of this hurting stressed out character. I would have bet on him winning also. I won't tell anymore about this film......but it's a must see. Find it.....rent it......and watch it. Stick with it cause it's truly an AWESOME film!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable, but Drags in Spots</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Browsing through the local Family Video store yesterday, this was on the rack as a two for a dollar rental special. Being a fan of Michael Shannon and Boardwalk Empire, it only makes sense that I rent this immediately. I mean, it was only fifty cents, so what did I have to lose. Anyway, on to the review.The premise is simple: a working-class family man has dreams of an oncoming apocalypse, and this leads to increasingly erratic behavior and has our hero questioning his own sanity. It's essentially a re-telling of Noah's Ark with an element of mental illness thrown in. The nightmare sequences are beautifully filmed, and made better by Shannon's intense acting style. Jessica Chastain plays the wife, a character type that almost seems to be a typecast for her these days (see A Most Violent Year or Mama for further evidence), and she does her job well. Shea Whigham and Katy Mixon are also in the film, but they are criminally underused. The rest of the cast does their jobs well.The problem with the film is that it is way too long. I'm not the type to complain about running times, but there is one scene towards the end that just drags on forever. In fact, the whole middle section of the film just drags. The acting is great, but nothing really happens in these scenes. I'm from the Midwest, and it is quite boring, but the scenery alone in the film proves that point. I don't want a completely accurate depiction of the region I grew up in. A good half-hour could have been cut out of the film, and it would have been just as satisfying. Another gripe I have is the fact that some of the special effects during the movie are extremely distracting and fake looking. I realize that the budget was limited, but come on.Overall, this film is worth seeing just for Michael Shannon's performance alone. Take Shelter is long. Too long. So long I felt tempted to fast forward one of the final scenes. I can sit through Casino without any problems, so the issue is with the pacing of the film itself. If you don't mind an inflated middle half, Take Shelter is a diamond in the rough.</fullReview>

Even though i have read and talked to him about it this film helped me more fully understand exactly what he might be seeing, what hes feeling when he knows no one can understand what he sees. OK so aside from the fact that they nailed that part i have to say this film was really well developed, yes it was abit long and slow as some might mention but you see in order for this film to really affect you ( touch your heart as some might say) you need every one of those seconds, to get closer to Curtis and his family.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The paranoia of the man- the father, the husband !!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Take Shelter starts with a scene where we see Curtis i.e. Michael Shannon's character standing outdoors and looking at a very ominous looking cloudy sky. Suddenly it starts to rain, but instead of water, it's motor oil that's being poured down from the heavens and we see Shannon getting drenched. Immediately we cut to a scene of him in the shower getting drenched by the water flow of the shower. This was a very eerie and idiosyncratic start to the film, but it sets the platform and gives the viewer an idea of the film he/she is about to watch. What follows is at times scary, other times profound, but always very engaging.Take Shelter is a character study of the highest order that delves deep inside Curtis'(Shannon) head. We are shown that Curtis is a family man with a wife named Samantha played by Jessica Chastain and a deaf daughter named Hannah. Based on the scenes involving all of them, we see that Curtis really loves his wife and kid and earns an honest living. However it is also revealed that he has been having some disturbing dreams/nightmares that have kept him really concerned. The film uses the commonly employed technique used in psychological horror/thriller films which relates to the blurring of the distinctions between real time scenes and the dream sequences. So in Take Shelter also, the director asks the viewer himself/herself to distinguish between what's real and what's not. But this fortunately is not used as a gimmick, instead the director and writer Jeff Nichols uses this as a tool to assist the character study of Curtis. Although the dream sequences are brilliantly filmed and thrilling, but clearly Nichols is more interested in the root cause of these dreams rather than the dreams themselves. After watching the whole film, I feel like I know a lot about the character of Curtis. We are given hints and signs about Curtis' mother and his upbringing and that gives us an idea as to why he grew up to be a man who is so uptight, under-spoken and someone who doesn't share his problems with his wife and family and doesn't emote due to a misplaced sense of embarrassment. With that, in a way Jeff Nichols in a tangential manner somewhat critiques the conventionally expected male and masculine behavioral traits. For me, I think the central theme of the film is the fear and paranoia surrounding a mentally vulnerable person who is scared of what the future holds for him with the cards that he has been dealt. He is clearly concerned about the prospect of having to provide for his family and having to raise a differently abled young girl and this pressure slowly takes a toll on him mentally.Although Curtis is the main character in the film, but Jessica Chastain's character of Samantha is also of extreme importance in the film. The conversations that Samantha has with Curtis are very insightful and believable. Throughout the film, she acts as a huge support source for Curtis, tensions rise and fall, but the chemistry that she shares with Curtis is undeniable. She is a strong and a caring woman who loves her family unconditionally. The cinematography is at times awe-inspiring. The outdoor scenes sometimes made me almost lose my breath due to the beauty of the natural surroundings that was on show. The fields, the grass and the semi rural surroundings in the film and the style of shooting them reminded me of Terrence Malick's 'Days of Heaven'. Take Shelter along with its cerebral elements, is also a visual film.The direction is meticulous. Jeff Nichols actually takes time and uses patience to tackle the characters on screen. He does use breathtaking dream sequences, but the quiet conversation scenes between Shannon and Chastain are pure gold. This was one of Jessica Chastain's first on-screen performances and she kills it. She shows range and emotion. Michael Shannon is however the heartbeat of the film. He delivers a performance that is nuanced in one hand and devastating on the other. You can feel and see the paranoia on his face and his gestures and he conveys his emotions beautifully. The screenplay is for the most part perfect. But there are two specific big, intense and loud scenes in the film that feel a bit out of place and sort of underwritten specially in comparison to the rest of the film. But nit-picking aside, the screenplay is also very good.Take Shelter is a great character study of a troubled, yet very likable person. The film ends on a thematically beautiful note which oozes the concepts of togetherness and helping each other. I loved the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Plagued by a series of apocalyptic visions, a young husband and father questions whether to shelter his family from a coming storm, or from himself. Curtis, a father and husband, is starting to experience bad dreams and hallucinations. Assuming mental illness, he seeks medical help and counselling. However, fearing the worst, he starts building an elaborate and expensive storm shelter in their backyard. This storm shelter threatens to tear apart his family, threatens his sanity and his standing in the community, but he builds it to save his family's life. Take Shelter is an intelligent, thought provoking and compelling film about mental illness. It is a supremely suspenseful character- driven drama depicting a person's descent into madness.

		<shortDescription>Great acting in a movie spoiled by some ho-hum special effects</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes when watching a movie you get so caught up with the characters and situations that all else becomes secondary. This is the case with 'Take Shelter' where one is so drawn into the emotional world of Curtis, Samantha and Hannah that what takes place outside their home and yard becomes almost unimportant. The three leads give some incredible performances. Good performances are when you don't believe the actors are actually acting, the same also goes for the costumes and art direction. Everything is played 'low-key'. It is emotionally quite draining and we certainly sympathize with Michael Shannon and his family. However the effects are shoddy. The rising furniture is well done but the strange flocks of birds look as if someone has taken a black pen to the print. The looming clouds look unnatural. The effects work better when they are off-screen or like when the storm is reflected in the window.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Curtis, played by Michael Shannon, is slowly losing his mind. His Mother was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia when she was 30 and now Curtis, at 35, is seeing strange things with the weather. He becomes obsessed with the idea that a 100 year storm is coming and he begins preparations to protect his wife (Jessica Chastain) and his deaf daughter by adding on to their long neglected storm shelter in their yard. Unfortunately he does not explain himself to anyone, and everyone thinks he, like his Mother, is losing his mind. His obsession has grave consequences for his relationship with his wife, his best friend,his job and his finances. As his life unravels, he cannot shake the assurance that something very bad is coming, nor can he shake the frightening nightmares he is having.Surrounding this compelling plot is some outstanding acting and special effects. Both Michael Shannon and Jessica Chastain turn is stellar performances in their lead roles - and the supporting cast is also very well placed in their roles. The movie is tense - is he losing his mind? or is he really seeing prophetic visions? Is he a modern day Noah?But the reason this movie receives a "9" from me is the love story. Throughout this story, Curtis' wife, Samantha (Jessics C) demonstrates unconditional love for her husband (even though he is acting in a reckless and incomprehensible manner). He must tell her "I'm sorry" 20 times in the movie. She always shows love for her husband, even when she suspects that he is nuts. I was very touched by this display of love. Fortunately I have experienced that from my wife and my family (albeit my actions were not as whacked out as Curtis) but you get the point.Finally the special effects with the approaching storm are not over done (like about a thousand recent comic book hero movies - can you say Man of Steel?). The storms really look real and are very scary.So - I do not believe you will go wrong with this movie. Well worth the time. DonB</fullReview>

I would not say it was a complete thriller, suspense and horror but it was somewhere in between. A movie with subtle touches to variety of real life things including love, family, friends, fear, ignorance, and overall trying to balance everything one got in his or her life.Michael and Jessica both have played a superb role in this movie. Especially Michael who seem be to the best fit for his role and I can not imagine anyone else playing this role better than him. Jessica has very well complimented him throughout the movie. Well done, both! Jeff has done a great job directing this movie and creating this master piece by getting the best out of the actors and adding a sense of fear and eagerness to find "what next".Overall, a must watch for anyone who likes suspense, love and thriller and wouldn't mind a story rolling on its own in a bit slow mode.

Beautifully understated performances from both Michael Shannon and Jessica Chastain, with solid support from the rest of the cast. The dream sequences were chilling without being gratuitous, leaving much to the interpretation of the viewer. This was an interesting character study following an ordinary person trying to make sense of extraordinary circumstances - a person trying to piece together his past and the possible future without totally losing everything he has in the present - his life. The film has a pedestrian pace, but rarely felt slow; this allows you follow this character and unambiguously side with him, irrespective of the possible outcomes of his impending prophecies or probable madness. Very worth watching and the director is a huge prospect for the future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's a storm coming.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In director Jeff Nichol's second film, a family man tries to hold his life and his family together while he has visions of a coming apocalypse. As he gets more and more drawn into his fear of impending doom he loses touch with the outside world. Jeff Nichols is less interested in whether or not these apocalyptic visions will come true or not but instead focuses on the impact they have on this family man's life. Throughout the film there's a mysterious sense of detachment and confusion with the stormy clouds taking Michael Shannon's character out of the real world and into a realm of fear and anticipation. The beautiful cinematography of stormy weather and doom, coupled with an amazing slow moving camera that captures the domestic life in rural America create a fantastic atmosphere that carries Take Shelter. Michael Shannon gives an excellent portrayal of a man who's deeply afraid in anticipation of something bad coming but who tries to do the best to protect himself and his family of the impending doom. His facial expressions say everything about how he feels and it's almost unbearably believable. Jessica Chastain is great at being not just "the crazy guy's wife" but a well designed character who's terrified but full of commitment and love at the same time.There is a constant sense of anticipation and terror and it's all designed with acting, sound design and cinematography without relying on explanatory dialogue. It's a slow burn, a build up to an ending that's unfortunately unsatisfactory, but that doesn't matter because the wait for it is the actual attraction of the film</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting view on mental illness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was really excited when I heard of this movie, I only heard good things about the director, plus, I'm a great Michael Shannon fan and will watch basically anything he's in. I thought it was a very well written story, a compelling plot, some suspense and an interesting point of view on mental illness. Can't say I liked the ending, though, I think it controverted everything that was built throughout the movie.I had a feeling the ending was leaning towards that way, of all of Curtis' ideas coming true, but I kept watching and hoping the director wouldn't do that to us. I would be okay with that idea if his paranoia was indeed focused on the coming of the storm, but it clearly was not. Taking on a more psychological approach, which I choose to believe the movie is about, I would say his mental illness was starting off from some kind of repression and dissatisfaction over his suburban life (nothing ground-breaking to that explanation, but oh well), plus, an inheritance from his mother. This is all supported by his nightmares, so frightening and real, all of them showing some kind of catastrophe that would ruin his placid family life. I thought the movie was going to end in that scene where he has to open the shelter door, it wouldn't be the best ending, that's for sure, but it would be better because it would mean he was ready to start dealing with his fears.That is why I disliked the ending, because it seemed like everything was reduced to some kind of simplistic, almost religious explanation. I am aware of the director's commentaries on that scene being a metaphor or a dream, although there are various clues that say otherwise. Even if it is so, it's not the best ending, seeing that it doesn't leave you wondering what you've just watched (like Kubrick used to do so well), only feeling betrayed and confused. Anyway, I figure it's the best ending the director could come up with, I couldn't have thought any better than that, so I'll just say it doesn't invalidate the whole picture. It's still an awesome movie, with a terrific performance by Michael Shannon, and I look forward to checking some other Jeff Nichols film.</fullReview>

This movie really does make you question reality. Michael Shannon is brilliant, Jessica Chastain is out of this world. The cinematography creates a terrifying set up when it needs to. This film makes you question your own sanity and its brilliant. Basically a don't cry wolf kind of story, but it has so much more depth. Why this film was paid closer attention to when it came out baffles me. What a wild ride, it can be so dark and disturbing and then again at other times so real. Brilliantly, brilliantly directed. Watch out for Nichols', hes got serious talent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flocking towards your fears</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Curtis (Michael Shannon) is a dedicated father and loving husband with a well-paid gas-drilling manual job offering good health care coverage for his deaf-and-dumb daughter. When dark dreams start invading his sleep, slowly seeping seeds of fear that these are more than what the seem - they are in fact premonitions. Given his mother was hospitalised due to schizophrenia, Curtis attempts to seek counsel and medical help for his dark hallucinations. Nonetheless slowly he begins working on building a shelter for his family, as the visions claw underneath his skin - visions of a imminent apocalypse forebode by dark lingering clouds. Is he creeping into madness or is this a prophetic phenomenon? At risk of losing his family, his job and the acceptance of his community, Curtis is forced to take hard choices."Take Shelter" is one of those unique art-house features, that slowly creep up on you and take by surprise, as to the inherent depth, thoughtfulness and tenacity of vision. In itself it functions perfectly as a gripping thriller with a building tension, balancing on the boundaries of the horror genre, with darkly lit faces, flocking birds blotting out the sun and dark moments filled with dreaded uncertainty. However within these confines comes a thoughtful story with more than one simple reading.On the one hand director Jeff Nichols brings about questions of perseverance and offering a harrowing account of one man's fight to overcome his psychological frailty for the sake of his family. Increasingly falling into his obsession the journey is so agonisingly real in its simplicity, a spiral down which any man can venture, the inner fight and the thoughtful care of his wife creates a superb, if simple, dramatic denouement. On the other comes a subversive take on the biblical Noah, whose prophetic visions allowed for his entire family to be saved. Here however the myth take a wicked turn, as the modern day Noah is thrown into the systemic cogs of credit crunch, job safety and social acceptance, seemingly making a similar cognitive journey all the more perilous and impossible. Laden with expectations and idiosyncratic reality of mortgage and health insurance bondage, we can feel and deeply understand the harrowing journey that Curtis must undertake, even more so that the distinction between madness and premonition is impossible to resolve.Possibly a step away from perfection is the double ending - as if the director wanted too much to show the implications of both eventualities, letting them seep in separately, instead of trying for a more open ended conclusion. On the other hand the finality of presenting both options allows the audience to emotionally capture the separate experience, instead of being left lingering with a uncertainty as to what comes next. In hindsight the issue seems minor as both scenes are incredible and deliver a emotional punch, lingering in the memory for days on end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simple but great story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching a few effects-rich, over-clever films, this was a breath of fresh air. Simple story-telling that keeps you guessing. Sure for folks who like action movies this'll probably run too "slow" but for anyone interested in a good unpretentious story you should definitely check this out.I personally really like the two lead actors - Michael Shannon and Jessica Chastain. Did not disappoint here either. How to underplay a character 101. This guy's such an awesome talent - how does he not get better parts. Would love to see him and Ben Foster do Of Mice and Men. Anyway I massively digress!It's filmed simply and solidly throughout, and deals with a small-town family-guy facing a brutally tough issue that threatens to tear his whole life apart piece by piece. I won't say any more for fear of spoiling it ... suffice to say you've got to watch the movie(all of it).Hard to categorise this film - elements of Close Encounters, Phenomenon, Field of Dreams, but with more of a Straight Story tempo ... and with a kick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Shannon excels in this gripping story that seems to chronicle a man's descent into paranoid schizophrenia. There is more to the story, much more and in the end we are left wondering whether anyone can prepare for impending disaster. this is a haunting study - of a life, of the frailty of the nation's economy, of missed opportunities to communicate, and of a marriage that mirrors the great instability of its environment. I missed this in the theaters, unfortunately. Jessica chastain excels, as do all of the supporting actors.One of the best movies of 2011 and highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Well Done Movie. Jeff Nicholls As Director And Michael Shannon As Star Deserve A Lot Of Credit For Fine Work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought that this movie offered a brilliant portrayal of mental illness (in this case, paranoid schizophrenia), its impacts on friendships and family and, ultimately, managed to offer hope for how it can be managed. There's some debate or even dispute about whether or not this movie is about mental illness. Regardless of the debate, mental illness is at the root of the movie's story and it certainly can't be overlooked.Michael Shannon put on a brilliant performance as Curtis. There's a history of paranoid schizophrenia in Curtis's family, his mother having suffered from it and having lived in assisted living for many years. Curtis is apparently "normal," he's a husband and father, he holds down a responsible job. Everything is going well for Curtis until he starts believing that a massive storm is going to hit the area. He becomes fixated on the idea. He begins having bad dreams and acting strangely without any reason. As one example, he banishes the friendly family dog to an outdoor pen because he had a nightmare about the dog biting him. The dreams are a bit disorienting to the viewer - and perhaps they're meant to be. It difficult sometimes to sort out from scene to scene what's real and what's a dream. You only find out if and when Curtis jerks awake. Because he believes the storm is coming he begins expanding a small underground storm shelter in the yard of the family home. He borrows money recklessly to finance the project; he "borrows" equipment from work without permission. He knows he has a problem. He sees his doctor; he sees a counsellor, but he can't get these strange thoughts out of his head. Meanwhile, his wife Samantha (Jessica Chastain) knows something is wrong and that Curtis seems to be losing his grip on reality. She tries to bring him back, and the climax of the story is her trying to reason Curtis into trusting her after he's locked the family inside the massive new storm shelter.Director Jeff Nicholls did a marvellous job of building this story. It starts slowly. Curtis is having some problems; we get that clearly enough. But they don't seem extreme. He comes across as eccentric more than ill. But because of the slow build of the story, we get a real sense of the gradual changes in Curtis, which illustrate how mental illness can take hold of a person: slowly, gradually, almost imperceptibly at first, until it's out of control. This was a fine job by both Nicholls as the director and Shannon as the lead.The title left me wondering for the longest time. From what did people have to "take shelter?" For a while you at least think that maybe - just maybe - there is a real storm coming. Maybe Curtis isn't mentally ill; maybe he's a modern day Noah! Then, at the same time, you wonder if it isn't Curtis himself who's the storm, ready to blow, ready to do something awful. There's actually a real creepiness to this movie by the time Curtis locks his family inside the storm shelter. Is he going to let them go? Are they effectively prisoners in this underground cage? That was very effective.The ending seemed a bit ambiguous. We don't really know what happened to Curtis. Did he go for treatment, or did he totally fall apart? It's probably best that the movie was left that way, because that pretty much sums up the reality behind mental illness. Very, very well done.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jeff Nichols is taking us by storm!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You think I'm crazy? Well, listen up, there's a storm coming like nothing you've ever seen, and not a one of you is prepared for it. I finally was able to catch up with this film which I was anticipating for quite some time now but never had a chance to see it since it wasn't released where I live. I was really excited that I finally got to see it because it was really worth the wait. It was better than I anticipated and I really loved how young director Jeff Nichols slowly built the tension in this film. For many viewers Take Shelter may feel like it is slow paced at times, but I was so into the film that I loved how the movie was unfolding before my eyes. I had no problem with the slow buildup because the movie was just so beautiful to watch and the hallucination sequences were really strong thanks to an incredible performance from Michael Shannon. This isn't your typical thriller where all of a sudden you experience a surprise twist, but it is more like a dramatic thriller where you have the tension slowly building and growing. That is exactly what Michael Shannon's character goes through as he becomes more and more immersed into this world of trying to figure out what is real and what is hallucination. It is not like if from one moment to the next he just automatically changed, but more like a slow progressive change which begins to unfold before the eyes of his family and community. Jeff Nichols is one to keep an eye considering he not only directed this great film, but wrote it as well. This is just his second film, his first, Shotgun Stories, also starred Shannon, and his third film, Mud, has recently been released in the Cannes film festival receiving a lot of praise.Curtis (Michael Shannon) lives in a nice small home with his wife, Samantha (Jessica Chastain) and young daughter, Hannah (Tova Stewart), who's deaf. Everyone in the community looks up to them, but Curtis begins to experience some strange hallucinations about a storm. These are no ordinary hallucinations, as he has trouble sleeping and wakes up sweating. The first dream had to do with a storm coming and all of a sudden his dog bites his arm. When he awakes from the nightmare the pain in his arm doesn't go away and he begins to worry something bad is going to happen. He ends up locking his dog in the backyard and decides he should build a sort of shelter in his yard. He doesn't tell Samantha about his problem, but keeps to himself trying to find some help by reading mental illness books and seeking advice from professional councilors. The hallucinations become stronger and stronger and his friends begin to worry about him. The dreams push Curtis further and further away from his friends and family as he keeps to himself and doesn't try to communicate his problems. We discover he has family history after he visits his mother who suffered from schizophrenia when she was 30. Curtis fears the worst, but also decides to prepare in case his dreams become true. These constant hallucinations and dreams have us the viewers questioning ourselves whether what Curtis is actually experiencing is a hallucination or some sort of prophesy. We do not know what to believe, but evidently something is wrong with Curtis. What Nichols does well is make the issue not only a personal one, but one that affects the entire family. That is where Jessica Chastain's character comes in as she plays an important role in trying to keep the family together and trying to help her husband with his mental illness. She is excellent in her role and received a lot of critical acclaim as Michael Shannon did. They both won several awards for their roles in this film, although Chastain did have a bigger year with other films like The Help and The Tree of Life. I had seen Shannon in several smaller roles in the past, but this was the first time that I actually got to see him in the lead role, and he was just brilliant. I absolutely loved this film and the ambiguous ending also played out really well in my opinion. I will definitely be looking out for Nichols's next film, Mud. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Take Shelter is a building psychological thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Take Shelter is a psychological thriller about a man's increasingly intense nightmares about an impending destructive storm. Michael Shannon plays Curtis, a blue-collared construction worker, whose mother was diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic in her early thirties, and at the age of only 35, Curtis begins to have dark nightmares and delusions during the day. Not only does Curtis experience the nightmares in his dreams, his feelings from the horrific visions continue long after the nightmares. Curtis, afraid of nightmares becoming a reality, takes out a loan without his wife's knowledge to expand their storm shelter. Missing days of working and distancing himself from friends and co-workers, Curtis loses his job as his mind begins to spiral out of control. Jessica Chastain stars as Curtis' wife, Samantha, who is concerned about her husband's mental state and the safety of her daughter played by Tova Stewart, who is deaf.

		<shortDescription>"Compelling and mindful..."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American screenwriter and director Jeff Nichols second feature film which he wrote, premiered at the 27th Sundance Film Festival in 2011, was shot on location in Grafton, LaGrange and Elyria, Ohio in USA and is an American production which was produced by producers Tyler Davidson and Sophia Lin. It tells the story about 35-year-old Curtis LaForche who lives in a small town in Ohio with his wife Samantha and their adolescent daughter Hannah who is learning sign languages due to her inability to speak. The family is doing fine, but all of the sudden Curtis begins to experience apocalyptic visions and bad dreams. Knowing that his mother was diagnosed with Schizophrenia when he was ten years old, Curtis decides not to tell anyone about the things that are happening to him, but as the visions and dreams increases his personality changes and he becomes so convinced that something bad is going to happen where he lives that he begins to build a tornado shelter.Finely and engagingly directed by second-time American filmmaker Jeff Nichols, this finely paced fictional tale which is narrated mostly from the protagonist's point of view, draws a gripping portrayal of an ordinary man who is so certain that his town is going to be struck by a disaster that he becomes detached from his family. While notable for it's naturalistic milieu depictions, fine cinematography by cinematographer Adam Stone and efficient use of sound, this character-driven, humane, atmospheric and foreboding mystery depicts an incisive study of character and a compassionate love-story.This invariably intriguing and cogently narrated psychological drama about a man's unsettling premonitions and the way they affect his personality and his relations with other people, is impelled and reinforced by it's commendable and involving acting performances by American actor Michael Shannon, American actress Jessica Chastain and the fine supporting acting performances by American actor Shia Whigham and Tova Stewart in her debut feature film role. A compelling and mindful indie which gained, among numerous other awards, the International Critics' Week Grand Prix, the Prix SACD and the FIPRESCI Prize in the Directors' Fortnight section at the 64th Cannes Film Festival in 2011.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Divine punishment or true madness?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The storm and more generally the psychological climbing around these natural events may evoke a violent punishment that the father wishes to impose to himself. His daughter became deaf recently as we learn that the parents kept their habits. I do not think we know the cause of her deafness, but the father probably couldn't forgive himself easily The storm and the clouds of birds, also have a biblical sense. A divine punishment because the men had behaved badly? For what offense? Speaking of the train accident and the gas cloud, the film also shows that we are daily assailed by devastating news via media and we can hardly escape from that. And this can help to create a kind of paranoia, a certain fear of the end of the world due to polluting pictures and news. Yes, "prevention is better than cure" and any kind of insurance likes to remind it to us today especially in our western society. This sometimes leads to gorging on drugs including antidepressants but we also need to remind us that fear does not avoid danger. And the final storm probably shows that despite our convictions we're all able to succumb to a moment of madness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful and haunting story with a truly masterful performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Take Shelter is just an all around incredibly unique, beautiful and haunting film. Essentially it is a drama but there is so many layers to this film. A lot of reviewers have said it was a travesty this film was not noticed for Academy Awards especially for its lead performance and I wholeheartedly agree. This is the type of film that critics should be raving about. It is beautifully shot, some really stunning cinematography, it tells a story that has a post apocalyptic undertone but does so without flashy special effects or a big budget. Honestly Take Shelter must be seen to be believed. In many ways it is slow paced, a character study of a family moving towards crisis but the performances are so riveting and the concept of the film so fascinating that you literally can't take your eyes off of it.Michael Shannon is absolutely brilliant. His performance is one of the best I have seen in months, at least. You watch his entire life break down and you will feel so much empathy for him as he moves towards a complete mental breakdown but you will also hope and wonder for him whether what he is experiencing is real. By the end of the film he has turned in an Oscar worthy performance. Jessica Chastain is also excellent as his devoted but concerned wife. Her character too goes through a lot in the course of the film and her and Shannon have really great chemistry. There is something very real about their marriage, not a timeless romance, but just very real and this circumstance threatens to tear them apart. Tova Stewart has a small but extremely important role and does very good as their deaf daughter who often seems disconnected from her peers.Keep your eyes open for director and writer Jeff Nichols because after this I think it will gain popularity and word of mouth and he will become sought after in Hollywood. Film goers are always saying there isn't any new ideas, or anything unique and while this film plays on familiar themes like family, and mental breakdowns and even post-apocalyptic visions...they are brought together in an entire unique, creative and thought provoking way. This is a powerful drama by sheer definition and a performance not to be missed by Shannon. 9/10</fullReview>

If I may speak for us all, we're tired of the instant gratification of apocalyptic CGI imagery that seems to be spawning across the cinemas of the world. I admit that at times all I wanted is for something big and stupid to happen but thankfully I was rewarded with suspense and a fantastic performance from Michael Shannon. Watching Jessica Chastain on screen I was reminded of her performance in The Tree of Life. The pace and imagery (minus the dinosaurs!) of the two are similar at times.

		<fullReview>Jeff Nichols' story and direction are somewhat uneven in the film Take Shelter. Headed by a powerful performance by Academy Award nominee Michael Shannon, the film tells the story of a man who feels a very powerful storm is coming his way. Is it delusion or something painfully real? As the film keeps the main question on its edge, the narrative does tend to keep the viewer at arm's distance and doesn't invite us to walk along. Shannon declares himself as one of the finest character actors working today and delivers a near terrifying and shuttering performance. As the suffering wife, Jessica Chastain enables the viewer to find emotion in this tale and showing chilling depth. Chastain is a force to reckoned with in what is sure to be a long and illustrious career. The rest of the ensemble is fully capable but withholding any standouts worth mentioning. The star of this film is Michael Shannon, no doubt about it.**?/****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredible Performance, Tense Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Curtis (Michael Shannon) is the prototypical working-class American male. He is a good husband to his wife, Samantha (Jessica Chastain), a caring father to his deaf daughter, Hannah (Tova Stewart), and a dependable employee. Curtis' life starts to unravel, however, when he begins to have disturbing dreams. Nightmares which always revolve around a storm and always involve someone close to him trying to kill him plague his every sleep and soon Curtis becomes a paranoid, distracted man. As the dreams increase in frequency and intensity, Curtis becomes convinced that he is being given visions of the future. He puts aside all other responsibilities to build a shelter that will protect his family from their impending doom. But as he slips further and further from reality, it becomes more and more unclear as to whether these dreams are actually visions or the first signs of the mental illness that runs in his family. Take Shelter is a prime example of independent filmmaking at its finest. Writer/director Jeff Nichols has crafted a brilliant, completely organic thriller that creates more heart-pounding drama than I would have ever imagined. Nothing about Take Shelter is overstated or flashy; rather, it is a workmanlike film that starts with one dramatic crossbeam and builds upon itself in deliberate, well-paced fashion. No time is wasted, no side-plot is elaborated upon unnecessarily, and no scene fails to deliver. Nichols drops us into Curtis' life, quickly gives us a glimpse into his situation, and then begins the process of creating a tense, riveting environment that continues to grow until the final credits roll.But with all due respect to Nichols (whom I suspect we'll hear a great deal more from in the future), the immense value of Take Shelter comes as a result of the work of Michael Shannon. Though he is an outstanding actor, my complaint about Shannon has always been that he generally chooses difficult, inaccessible roles that are difficult to relate with. As a result, he often gives performances that are excellent but which fail to strike much of an emotional chord with me. Not so with Take Shelter. Beyond the sheer quality of his acting ability which is most certainly on full display here, Shannon empowers Curtis with an incredible believability. You're never sure if Curtis is going crazy or not, just as Curtis himself isn't sure, and that, for me at least, is what truly makes Take Shelter work. Above all else, Curtis wants to protect his family but at times, you're not sure whether he means to protect them from the horrible future he sees in his visions or from himself. Shannon exemplifies this conundrum with as few words as possible, lending serious weight to an already dense role. This is unmistakably Shannon's finest moment to date. It's just a shame that his film happened to drop during a year that was dominated by outstanding male performances. His portrayal deserved FAR more attention than it received and it is this powerful work that makes Take Shelter a true achievement in filmmaking.Please see my reviews at thesoapboxoffice.blogspot.com</fullReview>

The ending, which several reviewers found too "science fictional" or too unrealistic,is the core of the film, and makes it all come together. Curtis is troubled, but also necessarily prescient. And, to be prescient in these very dire times is to be cast out--to be the one nobody wants to hear, the one everyone wants to silence. I gave this film 10 our of 10 because it is an important film for all of us, not just a very good film for film fans and the film industry to consider for awards.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Oooh, a storm is threat'nin'.. my very life today... If I don't get some shelter, oh yeah, I'm gonna fade away..."Amidst the accolades for this film, I have noticed several reviews that state that it is following some formulaic apocalypse format while trying to bring gravity to the situation with its dialogue, etc. etc. I can't seem to see this film in that light at all. While the end of days premise has never been totally new, this film is less about the end and more about the basic logical, and/or illogical attributes of the human mind.It deals with one of humanities basic defense mechanisms, fear. The film then places it under siege, bombarding it with questions of rationality and context. When a species can rely on a basic instinct like fear, its chances of survival are increased. However, as we have advanced in intellect we have become increasingly dependent on logic and science to the point where even basic instincts, like fear, are questioned depending on a given situation. The film also places other emotions/instincts like trust, and love, into the fray allowing the audience to observe how these can become intertwined, and equally confused, as our magnificent brains struggle to come to terms with how to deal with reality or perceived reality.I found this film to be gripping, not because of the apocalyptic premise but rather because the acting was fantastic and the dialogue, or lack of it in some instances, helped to tell a thought provoking story of a man struggling to decide whether to trust in instinct or in logic.If you invest yourself into the characters like I did, you will not be disappointed.Definitely worth a viewing as Michael Shannon and Jessica Chastain (she's got the golden touch these days) put on a great performance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I suppose "the storm" from which the Michael Shannon as the young, God-fearing son of the soil in Ohio, wants to take ultimate shelter is metaphorical. That is, we see storms of various kinds and other threats but what's really being projected are the jihadists, the commies in Washington, the New World Order with its black helicopters, the illegals storming across the border with their assault weapons, and so forth. We don't have the Soviet Union anymore, otherwise this would all fit neatly into a Cold War package, all wrapped up in red ribbons.Yet, Jeff Nichols has written and directed a gripping story of one man's storm that takes the form of paranoid schizophrenia and, until the last few minutes, is aimed at a normal adult audience, not a gaggle of teens anxious to see somebody's head wrenched off.It's a little slow, a little routine, as life in the small-town Midwest is likely to be. Shannon is the thirtyish husband of the pale and slender redhead, Jessica Chastain, and the father of a mute little girl. He has a hard-hat job with a company that drills for gravel. He's indistinguishable from all the other indistinguishable men of the village, but then the working men of Ohio aren't noted for their gabbiness.Then things begin to go wrong. First, little things. A distant storm produces a tornado. It prompts him to start thinking about the tiny storm shelter in his back yard. It's all rusted. Maybe it needs expansion and some stocks of food, water, electricity, and sewage. He takes out a home improvement loan without telling his wife.Then he's tormented by nightmares in which friends and relatives and even his dog attack him. His behavior acquires a bizarre tinge. He gives his beloved dog away. He loses interest in his work and illegally makes off with equipment to improve his shelter. He begins to draw attention to himself but no one knows what he's about. He's expressionless throughout and, if anyone asks, he's "just fine." But he's not stupid. Mental illness may be a weakness among Midwestern men but he has insight and knows something is wrong with him, so he seeks out whatever facilities the community has to offer -- not much.The script has its weaknesses. Shannon loses his job and owes money, but they're able to afford to see a psychiatrist in Columbus and take a beach vacation in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, where the movie suddenly reveals that it has no clear idea of what it's doing. Until then, it's close to achieving precisely what it set out to do.One psychiatrist has described the family of a schizophrenic as having been "struck by lightning." It's not an inept metaphor, except that it doesn't always happen at once. Sometimes, as in this case, it's insidious. Shannon's mother was hospitalized with paranoid schizophrenia in her thirties. It runs in families and has a high genetic loading. One or two out of every hundred of us will "get it" in one form or another. Calling somebody "nuts" and laughing about it is whistling through a cemetery filled with open graves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Halfway around. The film is half way around, is halfway to a treatise on madness, midway in the family relationship to treat a psychotic character, midway on apocalyptic predictions, halfway to being a social criticism of the condemnation of the insane in our society (Michel Foucault sideways smile). Only moments where you have made &#x200b;&#x200b;and dreams are well worth a look but then remain inarticulate in a vague psychological treatise. The performances are fine but if you see no subtitles, the accent of the characters is very forced and very Midwest, making it difficult to understand perfectly what they say. One last point, the movie is long. It's like getting into a swamp with a bike, you can speed it up but you are looking for in a very dense sludge which is difficult to get out of sticky mud of boredom.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Take Shelter is a beautiful sad gem.It shows the heavy price one has to pay defending one's own beliefs against society, how painful it is to be outcast and judged crazy, how hurtful it is to see the doubt growing in one's own wife and daughter and how heartbreaking it is to begin to accept that one may indeed become insane and a danger to one's family.Michael Shannon doesn't disappoint in the role of the father, delivering an outstanding performance as the troubled soul and I expected no less having seen his fantastic performance in Boardwalk Empire.Jessica Chastain, who I really appreciated in the Help, brings her unconventional beauty and charm to the role of a mother in doubt and a wife than never abandons her husband. In the midst of the crisis, where her husband loses his job and can't afford anymore their child's treatment, where she faces the reality that her husband may need intensive psychiatric help she is the rock that will save the family. Chastain performs admirably in this supporting role and one can feel all the emotions that she goes through.Shea Whigham doesn't have much screen time, but he points every second of it, one sees a depth that could have been told in another story.The cinematography is beautiful and never showy. The FXs are decent except in one shot that reeks of blue screen.The music is haunting and translates unease really well.I think the movie would have been even better 5-10 minutes shorter, but all in all highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Film of 2011</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cutting to the chase, "Take Shelter" is an amazing film.The Chicken Little story is an apt metaphor for Shannon's mania in preparing for a coming storm; unspoken (except for constantly apologizing) actions solely undertaken to save his family. This potent allegory places under a powerful microscope the head-in-sand mentality perpetuated by this dying American society. With multiple references to fiscal responsibility, the film bows to the courageous few whose vocal warnings about the pending economic collapse were unheard, and exposes the forced solitude of the single-minded messenger. Sadly, "Take Shelter" also points to individuals as the sole caretakers of their survival - authority is wrong, inept and, ultimately, uncaring. (Note the Government sponsored Self-Plan For Disaster Public Service Announcements. They air every 5 minutes.)Shannon is an object of derision to the people of the small Ohio town in which he lives. Except to his wife. It's rare for a contemporary film to portray a woman in such an authentic and flattering way. (Ms. Chastain knocks it outta the park.) She unconditionally loves him. Her loyalty, understanding and compassion lifts this film. While she does become appropriately angry at some of hubby's crazy behavior, she never loses sight of the commitment to him. As an audience there's a "why doesn't she rage?" notion. The answer is "Take Shelter" never approaches tired dramaturgy: shrill marital screamfests meant to manipulate a partner toward the screamer's viewpoint. Instead there's calm and heartfelt communication. What a concept! (Are you listening American couples?)The cute as a button Ms. Chastain and the always great Mr.Shannon give better than Oscar-worthy performances. Joy Behar on "The View" caustically opined the morning the Oscar noms were announced, "These are the best films of the year?!?!" Yes, Ms. Behar. The august Academy members chose not to recognize the brilliant "Take Shelter." Not one damned nod, much like 2004 with Kevin Bacon in the equally amazing "The Woodsman." (Another wholehearted recommendation.)Egregious award snubs aside, writer/director Jeff Nichols' crafted an intense tale of a man under stress beset by apocalyptic dreams. Concerned with hallucinations spilling into the waking world, Shannon seeks help in fear of a repeat of his mother's institutionalization for schizophrenia at 35, his current age. He spends the family nest egg, loses job and health coverage desperately needed for an operation to recover his deaf daughter's hearing. He becomes obsessed with constructing a backyard shelter no one - including wife - believes in.In many ways (but not immediately obvious), "Take Shelter" also avoids the overused plot device of wise, quiet and patient female superiority in response to abysmal male behavior. (See most contemporary films and TV commercials incorrectly painting men as boobs.) The typical story arc of a man becoming sensitive to his women's needs is short circuited here. In this film both men and women have dignity. With nothing pat, this film successfully walks a high wire. There's no religious wrapping on the apocalyptic vision, and the wife, while holding dear Christian mores, does not beat the Bible. "Take Shelter" sails in rare cinematic waters: an honest and sleek Liner in a sea packed with phony and trivial Junks.Throughout one feels sympathy for Shannon. Until a conclusion not to be spoiled herein. Suffice to say the ending flips the story on its head and offers a needed laugh of relief from the previous 150 minutes.Nothing but kudo upon kudo for Mr. Nichols, Mr. Shannon and Ms. Chastain. As "Take Shelter" is only his second film, Mr. Nichols is indeed a filmmaker to watch. And watch "Take Shelter" you should. And while you watch remember this film cost $1 Million.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the crowning achievements of the year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I felt my heart gripping tighter and tighter throughout this film. To call it one of the best films of the year is something of which, I would usually just categorize other films in a pile of other films worthy of awards, and although this is worthy in ever way of any award nomination it receives, it is not something that ever feels like a scripted film. Although, it is about the best realism script writing I have seen in recent memory. What director Jeff Nichols, does here is he crafts something that feels so genuine and smooth, that it doesn't feel like most films we watch. Everything here feels genuine and at best times, terrifying in the psychological sense. We are never forced into something pretentious, and there are no cheap thrills. When we get these thrilling moments they actually hold our attention and we feel something real for the characters and fear for their lives. Mostly what we get is the realism of a man who is...on the verge of something. We get transported to his world and we feel we are apart of it. To categorize this film would be to give too much away. In what will most likely be one of the few overlooked films of the year due to it's poor marketing, I must suggest that you go out and watch this film if it in your area. Michael Shannon also gives the best male performance of the year by far and I can say that this is one of my top 5 films of the year so far, and a pitch perfect one at that. Jessica Chastain is also something to be reckoned with here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the most thoughtful portrayals of mental illness, and the destructive power of fear, that I have ever seen. Shannon and Chastain both give powerful and honest performances of a married couple being driven apart by the husband's increasing disconnect from reality. It is truly a parable for our times, which questions the merit and value of the fears we experience in our contemporary lives. Some of the other reviewers have discussed the dubious nature of the epilogue for the film, which I can understand, as I felt it detracted to some degree from the themes developed throughout the movie. But, taken as a whole, the excellence of the movie is still evident. It is rare to see such effective yet simple acting in contemporary movies. To quote the great American President, 'We have nothing to fear, but fear itself.' A message seldom heard.</fullReview>

Particular note should be made of the haunting music and the equally haunting landscapes, though the flocking birds CGI wasn't quite spot on. If I had one criticism of the story, it is that I expected it to end with ambiguity, as the doors to the shelter were thrown open to reveal... the finishing credits...! As such, it does feel slightly overlong, and with too much of a tease of the viewers to end, but it's compelling viewing all the way. If only all apocalyptic stories were so good... It is a shame, but this probably won't get the audiences it deserves, lacking big name actors and being almost too thought provoking for it's own good.

		<fullReview>..."Take Shelter" is a fine example of how the best of films so aptly reflect and comment on the times in which they're made. It's a shame, really, that it hasn't gotten wider release so far (as of this writing anyway); I suspect it would resonate with a large portion of the movie-going population. Basically a character study of Curtis, a man careening toward the edge of disintegration, beautifully portrayed by Michael "Bug" Shannon (who obviously is a favored collaborator with writer/director, Jeff "Shotgun Stories" Nichols) with a remarkable understatement punctuated with explosive intensity, "Take Shelter" also features sterling support from Jessica "The Tree of Life" Chastain as Curtis' beleaguered, loving wife, Samantha, as well as a number of choice supports from the likes of the inimitable Kathy "The Right Stuff" Baker as Curtis' lost-at-sea mother, Shea "Tigerland" Wigham as the co-worker/friend, a sadly under-utilized Lisa Gay "The Practice" Hamilton as his counselor, the likable Katy "The Quiet" Mixon as the wife's best friend, and another (relatively) unheralded favorite of mine, Ray "Deadwood" McKinnon, as Curtis' concerned brother. Also deserving mention is the precociously effective Tova Stewart as Curtis and Sam's deaf child whose upcoming surgery catalyzes the roiling tempest of their marital discord.Impeccably shot by Nichols collaborator, Adam "Shotgun Stories" Stone, and moodily scored by David "Ola Podrida" Wingo, "Take Shelter" taps into a vein of subtly rising tension that keeps its audience shifting a bit apprehensively even as the story carefully, slowly builds rumbling thunderclouds toward its final cataclysmic resolution. Many on this site have reacted negatively with regard to the "trick" ending, but in this case I think they've missed the metaphorical point. "Take Shelter" taps into the current zeitgeist in so many small but telling ways that the denouement serves more to underscore those connections than to uproot them. "Take Shelter" is about loss and how we strive to deal with it: loss of health and home, loss of loved ones, and most of all, loss of control, loss of self and sanity. Shannon's performance is Oscar-worthy, unquestionably, and Chastain's is of a kind. This film should do much better on video and broadcast that it has so far in the cinema; it certainly deserves that.Sure, it's an art-house film, not really intended for hoi polloi audiences, but I suspect that if they do manage to steel themselves to watch it, it'll shake them up more than some of the worst storms they've ever lived through. Highly recommended.7.10.12 post-DVD viewing edit: the disc features an okay commentary track with Shannon and Nichols, a few deleted scenes, and several featurettes. I stand by the rest of my comments above, with the addition that I did not interpret the ending as a dream sequence, although I can see how it could be taken that way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A strong feeling of foreboding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Take Shelter is a difficult film classify. Part thriller, part drama and part social commentary, it is certainly a film that will have you thinking. It also features beautiful cinematography and strong performances with a few twists thrown in for good measure.Curtis (Michael Shannon) is a blue-collar worker in a small town, where he lives with his wife (Jessica Chastain) and their deaf daughter, Hannah. He begins to have violent dreams and hallucinations which convince him that an apocalyptic storm is approaching. As his fear and paranoia increases, he becomes withdrawn from his family, and becomes obsessed with completing a storm shelter in his backyard to protect them.The mystery as to whether the threat is real or just a manifestation of Curtis' increasingly unstable mental state, is the central premise of the movie. Curtis becomes increasingly concerned about the safety of his family, but is also consumed by the fear that he may be succumbing to schizophrenia, of which his mother also suffers. The audience is never quite sure which is true, and with this uncertainty and the slow pace of the film, director Jeff Nichols has created a deeply unsettling movie, where the tension really sneaks up on you. I found myself feeling quite uneasy at points, as the film builds a strong sense of foreboding throughout.To his credit Nichols treats the mental illness theme of the film with great respect and restraint. Indeed it's the treatment of a family in crisis that is the films strong point, due in no small part to outstanding performances from it's leads. Michael Shannon is excellent. You really feel his fear and confusion, often just by facial expressions. And Jessica Chastain continues to impress.Take Shelter is not an explosive blockbuster, it's more of a slow burn that really leaves a lasting impression on you. It will keep you guessing until the end, so if you can handle the slow pace, it is quite rewarding</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first half of this movie was great with a strange threatening atmosphere and a rising sense of tension. The second half was way too long - the tension drawn out to the point of ridiculousness. This type of movie relies on the protagonist not being able to verbalise their anxieties. What about just saying - "I'm having these terrible dreams and don't know whether I'm going round the bend or am the next Noah - hey, call me crazy".Nope, the hero has to hold everything inside so driving everybody else crazy. The inevitable long suffering wife - the best friend (betrayed of course) The road to ruin..I also loved the way all the characters were talking about potential economic difficulties and driving petrol hogging trucksNot that I didn't enjoy the movie, or at least the first half, I would have preferred the director to shave 30 minutes off and ratchet up the tension to a more satisfying climax (And I don't mean a Hollywood style climax with the house and garden being invaded and everything blowing up.)Verdict: Wait for the DVD</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sorry, just wasn't good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like so many others, I saw this film for three reasons: 1) I've been a longtime Michael Shannon fan and am excited to see he's finally getting bigger roles for himself ("My Son, My Son..." being one of my favorite recent films), 2) The trailer made the film look astounding, and, of course, 3) The movie has been receiving great plaudits and reviews.You can imagine my disappointment then when almost right away I realized what a mistake I had made in spending the $10.50 on a film that clearly wouldn't hold muster. Almost immediately, I realized I was watching some kind of M. Night Shyamalan film at its worst (which is saying a lot). "Take Shelter" indulges in a protracted and achingly dull build tinctured by religious subtext that leads to what is inarguably a hackneyed ending with no substance. The entire film might as well have been one big "nightmare"; the ending was that clich and obvious. I've been particularly disappointed lately with similar films that appear to have something going for them in the trailer and concept -- "Source Code," "Inception" -- but on actual viewing, turn out to be TV show fare invoking the garden variety plots and uninteresting twists that anyone who is a reader or film fan has grown tired of being lived out over and over again in recent cinema. I thought this movie would be calculus, but really it was just algebra... maybe basic arithmetic. And much like other contemporary films like "Donnie Darko" that have been pitched as new or even "cult classics," it's not a matter of "not getting it," it's a matter of simply having seen it too many times before. These are not vibrant and innovative indie films; these are poorly made movies that because of budget constraints and inexperience of the writer/directors, simply look and seem bad enough to be "indie," when in fact they're no different than the crap spewed by larger studios. I guarantee after this, we'll see the director trying his hand at a "Spider-Man" movie or "Twilight" or god-knows-what, and that'll be the last you'll see of his more "inventive" independent films...Ultimately, "Take Shelter" is boring, pointless, and confusing/unrealistic in its character's motivations. The rigidly formulaic script seems like it was written with a chart, which wouldn't surprise me at all. The acting is probably the only decent part of the movie, but -- again -- as the writer/director chose to marinate the project in soap opera melodrama, that too is not saying much.If you're a fan of films like "Darko" and just can't get enough of your "Lost" or "24" box sets, maybe you'll dig this film. For everyone else, ignore the hype. This one's another sheep in wolf's clothing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great acting, cinematography and special effects, but a story that's so stupid it ruins it all. What a waste of talent, technology and money.A steady, plodding descent into insanity, with what must be the dumbest ending in the history of the movies tacked on out of nowhere. Sloppy direction doesn't help, with stupid, avoidable goofs like vehicles parked where nobody would park them; a Midwestern small-town library open on a Sunday morning; a large, energetic male dog who has never been confined but stays inside a tiny fence so flimsy a rabbit could knock it down; and other trivial mistakes happen so often that they become a serious distraction.One huge mistake that's not trivial at all is the unbelievable married couple at the center of this movie. It's absurd that a lovely, intelligent, emotionally balanced woman like Samantha ever looked twice at a surly, egocentric nut like Curtis, much less married him.Unlike similar movies in which the protagonist does alarming things no one else can understand, like Close Encounters, Curtis is never shown here as a normal person, as a character we get to know a little bit and therefore care about. From the very beginning, he's sullen and introverted, completely closed down emotionally and inaccessible not only to his wife and child but to us. Of course a person so profoundly crippled is going to fall apart, but he's so remote and unappealing that it's hard to care.So the overriding question in this suspense thriller is not "What is really happening?" or "How will this end?" but "Why should we care?" I didn't. Despite very strong acting and visuals, Take Shelter is tedious and unbelievable for almost two hours, and then infuriating at the end.</fullReview>

It's unfortunate, because there's a lot to like here.Michael Shannon is always a force to be reckoned with, but never more so than he is here. He has to carry the bulk of the film on his lanky shoulders and he gives a performance that likely would've garnered him an Oscar nomination had the film been higher profile/more successful. Equally good is Jessica Chastain, who plays her role with zero affectations. She keeps the movie grounded even as Shannon delves deeper and deeper into the abyss, and together they almost lift this movie into something special.Unfortunately they're betrayed by a script that didn't seem to know how to make all of the intriguing setup payoff. I'm not sure what to make of the ending, and I have no doubt most viewers will feel the same way. I certainly don't need to be spoon-fed everything from a writer/director, but here the ambiguity felt like a cop-out to mask the fact that they really didn't know what do.</fullReview>

He acknowledges to himself and his wife that he has a problem, and seeks medical help, but he's never able to get the treatment he needs because he refuses to release control over his life.The struggle between control and the need to give it up continues to an ending which provides a redemption which some may find a bit inappropriate, but not a letdown.Performances by Michael Shannon and Jessica Chastain are excellent along with a charming turn by Shea Wigham as their deaf daughter. There are flashy but not too flashy FX scenes near the end, employing swarms of digital birds, but there is also a brief but stunning dream effect early on that looks like it was cleverly done in-camera.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Take Shelter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This doomsday psycho-drama is a precious gem from indie director Jeff Nichols, boosted by an extraordinary acting impetus from Michael Shannon and Jessica Chastain pair. A working class point-of-view towards the Armageddon has been laboriously concocted through an ordinary worker's psychosis degeneration and the clashes between him and the mundane world. Comparison with last year's another high-profile end-of-the-world allegory upon mental predicament, Lars von Trier's MELANCHOLIA (2011), which certainly falls into a more glossy bourgeois temperament, TAKE SHELTER cannily skimps on its spectacular paranormal visual exploit, which competently generates a suspenseful circumstance curbs its audience firmly sitting in their seats. A jaded Michael Shannon gives not only his career best but also the optimum performance of the year inside out. This is a once-a-lifetime chance for any actor to revel in his own flair while the script affluently proffer both awards-baiting, stoic struggle inside and the more explosive outburst, which are all being accomplished by Mr. Shannon in his strongest suit! (who sits comfily at my No. 2 male leading performance of the year).Jessica Chastain, ranks now my current No. 1 in the supporting actress category for this film (prolifically she occupies 3 spots in my top 10 list), the good-wife image may overlap with THE TREE OF LIFE (2011), but here she is granted more spacious and substantial work to render, particularly from the latter half, her tension between Michael Shannon is the key point to grab all the highly-suspended attentions, which delivers a miraculous rapport until the portentous culmination. The finale seems like a belated condolence for the distressful soul being denied by all the sources, and its ambiguous interpretation also casts an impressive mental impact to those who are bemused meanwhile it is lingering with a poignant aftertaste. A significant job from Jeff Nichols, he is now my No. 5 in BEST DIRECTOR and the film obtains my bronze medal of the year 2011, so far (following SHAME and HUGO), just like SHAME, its downright shut-off by the academy awards is an unapologetic faux pas since it is thecr?me de la cr?met of the output from Indiewood in 2011.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Curtis (Michael Shannon) is suffering from apocalyptic nightmares that foresees a huge storm encroaching the area. He also dreams of his wife Samantha (Jessica Chastain) and his dead daughter Hannah (Tova Stewart) trying to harm him, along with his best friend and work colleague Dewart (Shea Whigham). Fearing his visions are true, Curtis starts to build a huge underground shelter in his yard, taking out a massive loan he can't afford and borrowing work equipment from his job. Knowing that his mother suffers from paranoid schizophrenia, Curtis and the dedicated Samantha worry that he is in fact losing his mind, as his behaviour becomes more unpredictable and erratic.Working on two levels, Take Shelter works both as a character drama that creates a realistic and slightly disturbing portrayal of mental disease, and as an apocalyptic thriller. America is known as one of the most paranoid and high-anxiety countries in the world, with areas of near- fanatical religious and political beliefs, high gun crime, the threat of terrorism, and most recently, financial gloom with the recession. Curtis seems to embody these fears. His nightmares don't reveal too much about what he thinks may happen - there's a storm, murderous attacks by his loved ones, a petrol-like substance falling from the sky - so he is essentially terrified of the unknown. Like Lars von Trier's Melancholia (2011), the film is very much the thinking-man's vision of the apocalypse, and rather than action scenes and cities being destroyed in CGI, it is the psychological meltdown of its protagonist that it is more interested in.If he were younger and better-looking, Michael Shannon would have been a superstar years ago. Instead, he is seen all too little on the big screen, and is currently stealing HBO's Boardwalk Empire as religious fanatic FBI agent Val Alden. Here, he even betters his Oscar-nominated 5-minute cameo in the criminally underrated Revolutionary Road (2008), giving a towering performance as a man slowly tearing himself apart. Chastain and Whigham (also star of Boardwalk Empire) offer admirable support as the supportive wife and best friend respectively. Although the climax is somewhat predictable, it has power nonetheless, thanks to Jeff Nichols' unfussy direction and the fact that the journey there is so riveting.

He becomes obsessed to built a shelter for his family to escape what be believes is an apocalyptic yet-to-come storm. It's not clear if this is tornado country and people already have storm cellars, but apparently not.After a series of events, Curtis' obsession intensifies to the point where he takes out a loan to buy and provision a shipping container, and "borrows" work equipment to facilitate burying the thing, thereby losing his job.It is beautifully photographed, but all that scenery doesn't make up for a flawed plot.In the end, the family are holidaying at Myrtle Beach, and - told you so - a gargantuan storm is brewing. At this point the film ends, but it's not clear how far Myrtle Beach is from Home and Curtis carefully constructed shelter.

Despite the tornado of birds on the cover there are no such terrors except in dreams.It is a downer about a taciturn construction worker whose life gets gradually worse as surrealistic nightmares beset him that he believes to be prophetic. His finances fall apart. He loses his job. His marriage fails, mostly because he is too shy or stubborn to tell anyone anything.He is even too inhibited to do ASL to communicate properly with his deaf daughter.He builds a tornado shelter with food, toilet, batteries and gas masks. His neighbours think him mad. This did not ring true for me since that would not be that much fancier than what others built.He slowly descends into a psychotic break.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not too sure why this movie is receiving such high praise. I agree there are compelling performances and it's certainly different, however when i start thinking a film is a bit on the long side I know it hasn't grasped me convincingly. I cannot fault anything particular in this film however as an avid movie watcher of open mind I struggled to find what exactly the point was, well I think I know what it was however it was a tad laborious in getting there. Nonetheless I wouldn't go as far as not recommending this movie, in the right mind set I'm sure its quite enjoyable, however for me, no not the corker everyone is describing it as.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been haunted by this movie ever since I saw it on demand. Wow! It blew me away. So quiet...and thoughtful. A real feast for the soul. I was really focused on the marriage between the main characters and their faith and trust in each other. At times I was on pins and needles and the suspense was killing me. Nothing surprises me much so that's a big compliment! Just when I feel jaded a movie like this comes along. I sure hope everyone involved gets nominate for a Golden Globe/Oscar and wins something! I look forward to more from this cast and crew in the future. I was really captivated by the music and photography too. And delighted that there were very few special affects with most things being left up to the imagination!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gimme More Take Shelter: Best Scary Movie of the Past Five Years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Take Shelter is the most frightening movie of the year. Here are movies that have seriously scared me.The Silence of the Lambs: Serial killers, cannibals, guys with moving vans, night-vision goggles, and a sense of methodical purpose.The Exorcist: Demonic possession, little kids spewing vomit and hatred, battle between good and evil.Scream: Unkillable, unstoppable, undeniable Ghostface killer with his sharp knives, deadly garage doors, and cell phone torments.Let The Right One In: A realistic, cold, and scary vampire movie set in Sweden. Martha Marcy May Marlene: Cults, family conflict, your family is a cult, and dissolving reality.Signs: A sonic nightmare of claws and alien clicks, a father furiously hammering wood over his home's windows, a family terrorized by an unknown force. Pan's Labyrinth: The Pale Man is a singularly terrifying creature.Halloween: A supernatural, spooky, silent killer in a William Shatner mask spray painted white. Babysitting gone wrong. The Ring: Little girl coming out of the television. Rainy Seattle. Grainy, eerie VHS tape. Enough said. The Shining: A movie that felt wrong when I watched it in high school, and I still think it would feel wrong now at 33; elevators of blood, twins, hotel rooms with unspeakable images. Jaws: Undeniably effective and psychically scarring for me; there is no point in stepping into a lake, river, pond, or ocean where I don't think about its apex predator gone mad with human blood. And now, Take Shelter. I want to write as little as possible about this movie because I'm still wrestling with it in my mind, and I think that you should go into the film knowing very little. I need to see the film again, but I think it has something profound to say about mental illness and families, as well as the fragility of a person who knows their own background and makeup. The underrated and under-appreciated Michael Shannon plays Curtis, a working- class guy in small town America (southern Ohio) who works on a construction crew, tries his best, saves his money, and then starts seeing visions. Horrifying, visceral, realistic scenes best left undescribed. Curtis lives with his wife Samantha (Jessica Chastain, again brilliant) and their daughter Hannah (Tova Stewart) who happens to be deaf. They are a family struggling to pay bills, to cover health costs for a cochlear implant for their daughter, strains with both sets of their parents. And then, there's Curtis's visions or revelations or hallucinations which threaten the very fabric of their family and relationships with each other. Shannon and Chastain are both so good here as a couple under duress, and the sense of small town life seems spot-on. I won't say more. For me, cinematic fright takes many forms as you can see from my list above: serial killers, aliens, elevators of blood, creepy little long-haired girls, great white sharks, lethal vampires, the unkillable, etc... Now, add losing one's mind, family, home, and existence to that list. Take Shelter is a horror film for our times, a film that delves deep into a community, faith, and a family, and its answers are never simple. A phenomenal achievement. Please go see it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Average film, great performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Slow paced character study is at times obscure in purpose and tries your patience but is worth sticking with if for nothing else the amazing performance by Michael Shannon as a man trying hard to keep himself together as he feels things slipping away. He reveals himself as an actor of tremendous skill, that this performance wasn't nominated for every award possible is a real shame. Jessica Chastain also demonstrates she is an actress of wide scope, she has been in a lot of films lately but unlike many actresses that seem to be the flavor of the moment there is a great deal of talent to be mined in her case. I didn't particularly care for the film but the talent on display makes it worth catching this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great acting, poor writing, directing and editing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just saw the movie. It held my interest, but I was disappointed at the ending.The character was not supposed to be very bright, so most of the stupid ways he reacted to situations presented in the movie are acceptable. The fact that he got no reasonable help from the doctors or any of his friends is pushing it. Are they all as dull as he is? The wife got help from a rather intelligent woman, knowledgeable in the benefits of the families insurance. Faced with losing the chance at the implant for her child, don't you think she would have gone back to her for advice, at which point she would have advised her that her husband could not be so easily fired and lose benefits if he was diagnosed with mental illness which caused the erratic behavior he was fired for?If you had a premonition that your dog was going to go crazy and attack you, would you give it to your brother to take home to his family? Even if you were an idiot?The scene at the end is not a confirmation of anything. Each hallucination became more realistic and always had his wife and daughter seeing the things he saw within the hallucination. Not surprising he would imagine them seeing the storm. This was immediately after the doctor recommended the trip to the beach and could have been the next time he slept in reaction to the thought of going to the beach. They certainly could not have afforded the trip now, so it doesn't make much sense to assume they were actually there.Either the film ran out of money, and never got to filming the ending the director envisioned. Or this was just another "I am so artistic that I am leaving the interpretation of the ending to you" movie, which I find insulting, and lazy. I don't require open ended questions to stimulate my imagination. Being alive in the world is enough. I read books and watch films to see others interpretations, visions and conclusions. I may not agree with an author's conclusions, but if none are even made it is generally due to a poorly developed scenario, not a true attempt to stimulate thought. Of course I also find paint randomly thrown at a canvas, or smeared around in a manner that required no skill, not even remotely art, and an insult as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Geez, another 'non ending.' Great acting ruined by bad ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, I will spell it out for youHaving lived in the Mid West, Tornado Alley USA for 25 years and having spent 15 years on an Atlantic beach, I can tell you that tornadoes pop up very quickly and unexpectedly where hurricanes and Atlantic storms have a TON of warning time. The idea that they were surprised by a giant storm in Myrtle Beach is hogwash. Also, the movie sets us up wanting us to believe that the main character is going to have an 'I told you so' moment with the townspeople is totally lost here. Instead of being Noah and the Ark this movie is a retread of the 'Death in Teheren' story where the protagonist thinks he is escaping Death by moving to Teheren and we find out Death had planned to collect him in Teheran all of the time and that he was doomed by his own self fulfilling prophecy. But what REALLY enrages me about this film is the ambiguous ending. There is a trend in film writing today where the writer wimps out and does not write a true, comprehensive ending and 'wants us to fill in the blanks.' This is just lazy writing and actually makes the movie unpalatable. A perfect example of this is 'Kill List.' Worst of all, both of the movies were GREAT until the nebulous endings. The lead actors in Take Shelter were amazing. The cinematography was gorgeous, the pacing was slow but forgivable. But the ending sank it. What a shame. The people who rave about this movie come off like pedantic, film school drop outs. It's like the townspeople in The Emperor has no clothes. Take Shelter looks like an art house movie, but in reality the ending makes it as legit as a floating crap game in a county jail house.Lastly, even if you explore the multiple endings the writer is trying to foist upon us, there are plot holes everywhere. What about the dog? Was that just an example of foreboding doom? What about the dream with his wife, the knife and a fly? Was that supposed to represent the beach? Why did all of his dreams take place in Ohio and not an alternate location? What was up with the birds? They weren't seagulls.If you REALLY want to see where this idiot writer (Yes, idiot and I'll say it to his face) got his idea, check out the VASTLY superior Twilight Zone episode called 'Twenty Two.'I hate that I mostly write reviews of movies that disappoint, but I was a fool and read the reviews of this movie and fell prey to self important film snobs. When will this lousy trend of non endings stop? Dammit, Dammit, Dammit! The writer urinated in the champagne punch. WHAT A WASTE!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'One flew over the Cuckoo's Nest' mashed up with '2012'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Curtis is a man living with his wife and deaf daughter in rural America. Haunted by visions of an apocalyptic storm he is driven to insanity. Or is he?The acting by Michael Shannon as Curtis, Jessica Chasain as his wife and Tova Stewart as his daughter is uniformly strong. Cinematography and production values are good. CGI is only occasionally used, but when it is it is used well. Even though it was produced for a relatively low budget of $5M, it looks like a far grander production.Unfortunately the film is let down by its plodding pace. It feels like a one or two scenes were stretched out to fill up the entire movie. Unlike Richard Dreyfus' downward spiral in CE3K, here Curtis' relationship with his wife, his daughter and his coworkers remains more or less static. Apart from one brief outburst at a dinner table, they get neither better nor worse. The subplot about getting a cochlear ear implant for his daughter and the counselor scenes should have us emotionally invested, but ends up being filler material to pad the movie out to two hours. The recurring apocalyptic visions are essentially re- runs which tell us nothing new. The plodding pace had me looking at my watch halfway through; Not a good sign. Director Jeff Nichols really should have taken to the film with a pair of scissors. It's two hours long, but there is perhaps 40 minutes of story in here at best.There are quite a few plot holes. His shelter has no food, and covered only by a thin layer of topsoil with ventilation cowls to the surface. It wouldn't resist a flood or a tree falling on top of it. Inside the shelter he brings a fuel lantern, then puts an oxygen mask on his daughter. He and his wife then don gas masks. This makes no sense.Curtis apparent descent into insanity and the effect it has on his relationships makes for a good story. By itself, this would have made a good movie and is perhaps why critics lavished it with praise. The problem with heaping such praise on a movie is it sets expectations the movie doesn't live up to.Nichols also adds a shock ending, perhaps to try and generate 'buzz' about the movie on the net. The thing about shock endings is they need to be consistent with the rest of the movie. 'The Usual Suspects', 'The Sixth Sense' and even the Indie film 'Another Earth' are all good examples of how to do this. The same isn't true of 'Take Shelter' which backfires by reversing over the plot and leaving the audience feeling cheated. Add to that the critics over-hyping of the movie, and you have a box office disaster movie of a different kind.The movie should have ended when Curtis and his family emerged from the shelter after the minor storm. I presume when Ebert watched this scene he stood up, applauded and thinking that was it left the theater. This explains the four stars.Despite all this Nichols shows great promise. He needs to learn what to leave out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a movie about a man who dreams about a storm, so he actually go and build a storm shelter in his backyard. Of course other people think he's crazy.I'm expecting a clever ending that explains everything. Like, is he sick, and what kind of sickness? But even though there's an ending, it does not explain anything.The movie spends a lot of time showing how he builds the storm shelter. This gives the impression the movie has run out of material and is padding to make it a movie-length movie.It's unbelievable this movie got a 7.x rating. I'd rather watch a horror movie rated 6 than this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>doubt, fear and dread</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>doubt, fear and dread are the driving force for this wickedly precise film that refuses cynicism and limitations of genres. comprising a story of a working family man and his exceptional end of days catastrophe premonitions, Take Shelter opts not to go with the common vision and portray the main character as a schizophrenic person that, at one time or another, becomes a real danger to the people around him. Curtis takes each decision to protect his family, always; with fear to subject his own family to the obstacles he went through in his life because of his mother's illness. and the viewer is constantly wondering whether he's a madman or not, thus Jeff Nichols maintains the doubt. blessed by an inhabited performance from Michael Shannon and a radiant performance from Jessica Chastain to counterpart it, what this film scrutinize is not so much the resolution of a mystery in a thrilling manner, but the loyalty and trust of a wife to her husband; because even in times of extreme doubt and confusion, she stay married to his rationale. in large part, the ending act, carried by lasting urgency and instinct for survival, plays easily into the marriage of these two characters, making Take Shelter pretty much a total success</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is recommended.A man sees the world coming to an end. Should he believe in these prophetic visions or realize that he is slowly losing his mind? Curtis is a hard-working husband and loving father, a common everyman eking out a meager living and providing for his family in these challenging economic times. Yet all is good in his middle class world, until suddenly, his sense of reality begins to unhinged when he encounters ominous signs and troubling dreams. These continuing hallucinations perpetuate more bizarre behavior leading him to question his own sanity or take those omens seriously and build a storm shelter to protect his family from the coming apocalypse.Take Shelter is a film that deals with one man struggling to come to terms with the conflicting issues of reality and illusion. As Curtis secretively depletes his family's savings and becomes more paranoid with each occurring nightmarish vision, Samantha, his loyal and supportive wife, and their deaf daughter, Hannah, try to make sense of this erratic behavior. Schizophrenia may be the cause of his possible mental disorder, as Curtis' mother suffers from this disorder herself. As he withdraws more and more from his friends and loved ones, the movie-going audience wonders if he is truly becoming delusional or if the visions are really a foreshadowing of events yet to come. Jeff Nichols wrote and directed this small leisurely-paced independent film and uses all of his resources, creative and otherwise, to create a gripping and compelling drama. While some of the special effects seems a tad artificial due to budgetary restraints ( and, truthfully, the contrived CGI does directly dissipate the impact that a bigger studio budget would have greatly enhanced ), the essential core of the film is still there and carries the viewer into Curtis' troubled life. Nichols also wisely casts his film with actors that flesh out his well- drawn characters.Take Shelter is a showcase for two of the finest young actors in film today. Michael Shannon as Curtis and Jessica Chastain as Samantha share a completely natural bonding as the couple. Their compatibility and rapport comes off as very genuine and credible. Shannon has a knack for playing characters slightly off-kilter and this role works as an advantage to his screen persona. His breakdown scene is honestly heartbreaking and his emotional mood swing is quite frightening in its power. In her contrasting role, Chastain must play the subtle reactor, motherly figure, and dutiful wife. She radiates an steely reserve, and at times, projects a helplessness and fear that is pervasive and all encompassing. Their stellar performances will hopefully not go unnoticed this award season. As their daughter, Tova Stewart conveys that perfect childhood innocence so well.Take Shelter is a well made and absorbing film that takes its time to develop its characters and their dilemmas. To its credit, the moviegoer automatically cares about this family and their insurmountable problems. However, the film's climactic ending with its important final shot never resonates as it should due to the unconvincing visuals. There is also an inconsistency and illogic to some of Curtis' hallucinations with the real world that fail to materialize and are never referred to again, becoming sins of omission within the final script. Still, it's refreshing to see a film that is unafraid to tackle the serious topics of mental illness, economic hardships, and family issues without becoming maudlin and sentimental. The film does not insulate itself from those hard truths, and that's is something to admire and respect when experiencing Take Shelter.

		<fullReview>Seeing the trailer for the first time this is a movie that appealed to me as something a bit different, and it didn't disappoint.I found it to be a thought-provoking and sympathetic (without being condescending) look at the effects of mental illness on the person affected and the people closest to them. I felt Michael Shannon did a great job conveying how much people are almost embarrassed to go and seek help because of the stigma associated with mental illness. The character is aware that things aren't like they should be, but he's supposed to be the strong family guy who doesn't talk about feelings and deals with his problems by himself. Jessica Chastain was excellent as the wife trying to stand by her troubled man.The only negatives for me were that things move really slowly for the first hour and I thought the ending wasn't where the story should have ended up. Almost like it was trying to answer the viewers questions when it didn't have to. Sometimes you can't wrap a story or topic up neatly in a little box and I wish directors and producers would remember that more often.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Take Shelter" spends an hour and 59 minutes showing the struggle of a paranoid man to return to reality with the help of his wife and seems like a sensitive explication of mental illness, only to throw it all away in the last minute. Jessica Chastain manages the role of loving but lied-to and frustrated wife brilliantly, though her character may seem much too good and patient to be humanly possible. She and Shannon manage to show the excruciating pain of real relationships burdened with mental illness. But instead of an independent film with real integrity, "Take Shelter" becomes a cheap Hollywood-wannabe. Rarely have I felt so betrayed by a film. Phil Steele</fullReview>

Again he is tormented with the dreams and decides to borrow some heavy equipment from his workplace and invests all the savings in order to build a storm shelter is his yard. Samantha and all others thinks that he is going mad but will his dreams come true? I don't understand how a movie like this is so praised and well seen?

		<fullReview>I found this movie very interesting. I was in awe of Michael Shannon. Curtis seemed to me to be the typical emotionally-closed off man that cared about his family. Like him, I kept wondering if he was developing schizophrenia, or if his dreams were premonitions. His dreams varied so much though that you almost disregard his initial dream where some sort of gas is falling from the sky. I was convinced he may have been developing schizophrenia and I kept wanting him to tell his wife. Jessica Chastain is fantastic in this film, as well as, hauntingly amazing in Curtis' dream. When finally Curtis told her, and it seemed like he was seeking help, I wanted to see more done about it. I'm still questioning the ending of the film. If Curtis' initial dream was in fact a premonition, and the gas storm is real, then were all his other dreams part of the disease, or are they premonitions of more bad things to come? A strong film, a very deep film, slow pacing, beautiful shots...and I just want more concrete details.</fullReview>

At least 15 to 20 minutes could have been taken out, and the film would have flowed better and not have so many slow points.This guy, Curtis, begins to have visions about a terrible storm and other strange things, like his dog and best friend attacking him. He's really scared because he as a mom that was diagnosed with schizophrenia years ago. He fears he may be showing symptoms. No one else seems to notice the storms or lightening. So, he builds a storm shelter, using money he doesn't have.The main point of the movie is is Curtis actually seeing what may happen in the future, or is he going crazy? And the last scene was just too blunt, I didn't like the way it ended.FINAL VERDICT: It's a good OK, just needed to be more fast paced.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not one for slow-moving movies unless I'm in the mood. Greatest example was a too-long Vegas trip once, most likely because my money was gone on day 2 of 4, and while my friends wanted to walk up/down the strip shopping and I was too pooped, I chose to see The Horse Whisperer. Since it was hot out, I was deliciously transported back to the 1930s and saw thee perfect 3-hour air-conditioned slow-moving horsey movie. That was nice.After long days at work, I was in the mood for the same, only I was at home this time. I took shelter with Take Shelter, which, given my frame of mind, I appreciated this 2-hour slow roast more.I wanted to see it anyways, and what I heard previously was promising: Great cinematography (always a plus in my book), original story (huge in said book) and great acting (Read chapter 2.) And after my viewing, I concur.Michael Shannon isn't the most pleasant person to look at, probably because he always looks constipated, but damn he can show those tense moments a thing or three. In fact, because of his "condition" throughout the film, he's definitely the reason the movie's thoroughly suspenseful.Curtis (Shannon) is a hard-working construction father who's supporting his stay-at-home wife, recently deaf daughter and an upcoming beach vacation when he starts getting these "visions/hallucinations/dreams/feelings" of a pending doom of an apocalyptic storm. Scared these are early signs of his mother who got diagnosed with Schizophrenia around the same age. When it becomes too much to hide from either his wife or small Ohioan community, he's deemed crazy.Much like what I said about slow-moving movies not being part of my tastes in cinema, I did enjoy more when something happened in the film, like the few, but deep, scenes of said "storm of the century." But, that said, Shannon, again, keeps the pace going for two hours with his sad downturn as his visions overshadow his reality.The rest of the cast did particularly well, namely the good wife, Sam (Chastain,) the rich landscapes ? which, by the way, looked more like Texas or the southern/mid-west than Ohio, were beautiful and the original script was decent. But, the finale was worth the 2-hour timeframe ? I thoroughly was looking forward to it and was NOT disappointed, even though I flip-flopped throughout on how it was going to play out.I have heard that the ending is ambiguous and left open for discussion. I believe it is as straightforward as possible?even when the movie, itself, is not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reduces its power by providing mixed messages</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jeff Nichols' Take Shelter has mounting tension, an unpredictable plot, and riveting performances by Michael Shannon and Jessica Chastain, but what it's about is open to the viewer's interpretation. Is it a film about anxiety caused by the current social, political, and economic uncertainty, a treatise on mental illness and the need for family support, a warning of a coming global super storm, a Biblical prophecy, or just an entertaining horror film with no message? The film's uncertainty is both its strength and its weakness. While it keeps us engaged and avoids being too literal, it reduces its power by providing mixed messages.Set in a working class neighborhood in Ohio, Curtis (Shannon) is a construction worker who is told by long-time co-worker Dewart (Shea Whigham) that he has a good life, everything a man could ask for, a devoted wife, a loving child, and a secure future. "I think that's the best compliment you can give a man: take a look at his life and say, 'That's good," he tells him. On the surface, Curtis knows that it is true, that he is lucky to have a devoted wife in Samantha (Chastain) who cares deeply for their deaf six-year-old daughter Hannah (Toya Stewart).Underneath, however, he is plagued by recurrent nightmares and apocalyptic visions in which he is attacked by the family dog and wakes up with pains in his arm. Eventually, the dreams begin to include his co-worker and eventually his wife. He sees ominous clouds gathering on the horizon, hears loud bursts of thunder, and is drenched by oil-soaked yellow rain. The thunder, however, is not limited to his dreams and he hears them clearly even on a sunny day. Fearful of the schizophrenia that plagued his mother (Kathy Baker) in her thirties and of losing the medical insurance that will cover Hannah's medical treatment, he keeps his experiences to himself and pretends to his family and co-worker that everything is fine.It is only after he takes it upon himself without discussing it with Sam to take out a loan and build a storm shelter in his backyard complete with gas masks and other survival paraphernalia that his family becomes involved. This, however, does not stop his continuing mental deterioration, and his visits to a free counselor do not arrest it, putting his livelihood in jeopardy. As his visions become more frequent, Curtis gives away his dog, requests that his co-worker be transferred out of his supervision, and has a meltdown at a fund raising dinner.Take Shelter is an emotionally powerful experience that becomes more engrossing as it moves along, gradually building its sense of foreboding, yet its repetition of dream sequences that are designed more to shock than illuminate become tiresome before we get to the half-way point, and the events that occur during the family's long-awaited summer vacation, while thought-provoking, dilute our investment in the characters, call into question what we have been seeing for the last two hours, and ultimately serve to negate the film's psychological insights.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warning - bad ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It could have been a contender! Tight, gripping performances by the principals. The actors really do hook you in here - or at least, they really did hook me in. The story was working for the most part, too, although tighter editing and cutting redundant scenes would have improved matters. So as the ending approached I thought, okay, pretty good, maybe even excellent but for a couple of flaws. And then ... an ending that is both trite and inconsistent with things that we have witnessed happening in the movie. To explain fully this would have to contain spoilers but I want to warn those who have yet to see the film to be wary of the Metacritic reviews. The movie has merit but it's ending, simply put, is poorly written and disappointing. You've been warned.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overblown storm scenes with a cast you don't care about.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the risk of being seen as "unartistic", Alfred Hitchcock would turn over in his grave at this laughable mess. It had so much potential, but the totally unlikable Mike Shannon did little to elicit anything but boredom. The direction the film was headed was so obvious that the repeated pained stares into the sky made me wish someone would spray him with the garden hose. Also, let me get this straight. The wife went nuts when she found out he borrowed money for the shelter, but is totally okay with a beach vacation AFTER he loses his job? Not in my lifetime's experience. OK -- SPOILER ALERT: The film should have terminated with the tornado shelter scene. By the time the film crawled to the Myrtle Beach shore for the "real" storm, I no longer cared. The claustrophobic shelter scene had me gasping for air and hungry for a properly developed conclusion which included his retribution. What was served up instead? Tree branches on the ground? Elemental concepts such as story and pacing were totally secondary to the storm special effects. My advice? Watch "Twister" instead. At least it was well paced and built to a proper conclusion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weaknesses in narrative for sure, but the sense of Curtis is strong and is what makes the film work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Take Shelter seems to be one of those films that one either likes or dislikes, even a casual glance at the message board on IMDb shows you a series of threads where those that "get it" seem to love it while those that didn't "get it" seem to have done so in an intensely angry way. Of course, the boards here are hardly a good measure of real feeling, but this is how it seems and watching it for myself I can sort of see why. The plot here is that working man Curtis starts experiencing intense dreams and also seeing signs of a great storm heading his way. While others look on in worry, he sets about renovating the old storm shelter in back of the house despite the expense involved, all the time gripped by a fear of what is coming, even if he cannot quite put his hand on it.I describe this as the plot but to cling to this too closely is a mistake but this is not really a film to come to for a traditional narration or hoping for everything to be tied up at the end; indeed many angry posts about this film seem to be about getting answers and having everything explained. Although I think this is missing the point of the film, I will also say that there is a certain amount of ambiguity in regards the ending that I found a little annoying in regards the flow of it. It wasn't a deal breaker (because I was happy with my interpretation of it in relation to the rest of the film) but it could have been better if it hadn't been quite so open to opinion. That said, I didn't think that plotting was either the focus nor the strength of the film but rather the feeling and atmosphere was pretty much the all.I say this because whether you read it as a film on mental illness or a film on the general sense of worry and stress that many experience in this time of financial hardship and uncertainty, the film does do a great job of capturing that sense that something isn't right and that worse is coming. Nichols' direction leads on this as he moves between visions, dreams and feeling but the film really plays out best on leading man Shannon. I know him from Broadway Empire and here he plays an equally odd character but he does so with such commitment and understanding that he makes it work. While I may not be sure what he is dealing with, that he is dealing with something goes without question as he presents his fear, his confusion but yet his attempts to deal with it. He is great in the lead and he makes the film work better than it would have in someone else's hands. Chastain, Whigham and a few others are good in support but this is Shannon's film.Take Shelter is not perfect ? if you love it then great, but it could have been stronger in regards a little bit more hand-holding for the viewer. Shannon is strong throughout and his performance is complimented well by Nichols' general presentation of the story. More a sensation than a film, this is still worth seeing for the feelings and the experience that it gives as well as Shannon's performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Potentially great psychological drama ruined by a gratuitous "Twist"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This could be a very powerful and moving drama if it weren't for the childish "I told you so" ending. The virtuoso performance by Michael Shannon is a thing to behold. His fragility as "Curtis" and the barely below the surface violence is wrenching as a character study. Curtis is a man stressed. He has a mortgage. He has a volatile work environment. He also has a hearing impaired daughter. The latter day stressors are presented in a gritty and unflinching way. The Familiar ties are a stress on Curtis as well. He has a distant and runaway older brother, a deceased father and a mother descended into a well of mental illness. The illness- Schizophrenia- may be overtaking Curtis. He is having nightmares and sleep disorders. He has a persecution complex. He is having some embarrassing physical symptoms. I was empathetic to the character and the familial characters he wreaked his tantrums on. the pacing and the set-ups are gorgeous. Iwas drawn in completely with this world. I was reminded of European filmic character studies. And then there was the twist. yes, the "Twilight Zone" and Shyamalan Twist. It is cheap. it is belittling to the effort the cast put in that the writers and director had to deflate the masterful performances with the puerile "I told you so" ending. If the last ten minutes were excised from the film, we'd have a superb psychological character study. instead, we get a cheap made for TV quality "Shocker".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well made movie with great performances from Shannon and Chastain.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I was watching Take Shelter (From writer/director Jeff Nichols), I couldn't help but get a certain feeling about it. In some ways, I'd actually consider this a sort of horror film. That doesn't mean it has to resort to cheap "Boo" scares seen in most recent horror films in order to send shivers up a viewer's spine, in fact, the chills are actually more subtle, and more disturbing. The film touches on some very uneasy themes of mental illness, and walks back and forth neatly between the line of reality and mind tricks in Aronofsky style.Our lead character is essential to the film's ever building sense of dread, and Michael Shannon is fully up to the task. His performance is quiet, but one with tremendous emotion beneath the surface, as is such in the case of Jessica Chastain (In the best of her 2011 performances), perfectly playing her character with layer upon layer of emotional range. All of this culminates in the film's fantastic ending, which I'd dare to call one of the best endings of any 2011 movie I've seen (Heck, maybe even THE best), capped off by Ben Nichol's fantastic end credits song "Shelter".Oh, and I almost forgot. For some reason, Shea Whigham is in this movie.*** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not a movie Buff or someone who sits and watches TV or films all day long I've simply got better things to do with my time, HOWEVER! i feel the need to review this film as its really interesting &amp; out of respect to the actors &amp; such like, with my review/s they are not smothered with over tedious cryptic words its just plain all English &amp; here goes, "Take Shelter" is a film about a man mid 30's (Looks older) who is having visions of a near apocalyptic event/s he has a daughter who for some reasons maybe contributing to his visions due to possible mid life stress, He is a quiet guy that goes around doing his everyday life with a no questions asked approach, The film goes one and I've got to be honest about 30 mins into it my wife went to bed either from been tired or that the film was like watching paint dry? i have to admit the words "Omg nothing is happening" came to mind a few times in it BUT this is one of them films where you would have to watch a second time to link events in it, IF you are a "Final Destination" fan the avoid this at all costs as its not to be compared to it! this film offers almost no action and no ghost jumping at the camera scenes..But what it does offer is a decent story of how once in a while there is a person man or woman that is different to us all someone that see's between the lines of our ordinary lives.. There is people alive today that have a 6th Sense and this is kinda linked to that Phenomenon, the only thing i wished would of been changed would of been the ending! ( DO NOT READ ON IF YOU Don't WANT WANT ME TO SPOIL IT) But the film makers should of put more emphasis into the end &amp; instead of having a 30 second "Oh he was right" script i would of liked to of seen more of the storm &amp; seen them manage to get home in the shelter to open it the next day &amp; EVERYTHING was flattened proving him right &amp; so he then becomes somewhat of a hero as so many people listened to him...BUT no the film crew went with the idea of letting us decide with the reflections on a window/door what was happening &amp; then to rob us all of been able to see the aftermath...an equivalent scenario would be of lets say Terminator (1984) where the big steel press comes down and squashed the robot freeing John connor's future and his mother..take it back a few minutes to where the robot is climbing inside the press &amp; just as his mother is about to press the green button the film ends...thats what happened with "Take Shelter" i felt anyway....i did like it though i just wished for a longer more in depth ending? cause when the screen went black &amp; the credits came down i was like "Hey? thats it?" but there was a storm brewing we need to see what happened and that this man is given his sanity back?? having read some other reviews on here some of them are stating its almost perfect?...i beg to differ!</fullReview>

The film delivered touching aspect of familial relationships but failed to deliver on doomsday cgi sequences. It was severely disappointing in that department of the film. I was stumped by the ending of this movie. I couldn't tell what was going on. Was he crazy, or was everyone else crazy? Who knows... The only watchable part of this film was when you closed your eyes and feel asleep because this movie was by far the most boring movie ever produced. This was a great movie with splendid acting directed by a art-house director. Save your money and watch this film in 3D. It's much more entertaining and captivating.

		<shortDescription>Shelter in the face of insanity versus reality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Curtis (Michael Shannon) is having bad dreams and hallucinations. He's likely just going crazy, but if he is in fact having visions of the future end of the world, then he might as well "Take Shelter". With Curtis's dreams turning into nightmares turning into a possible reality, he needs to keep himself safe and his wife (Jessica Chastain) and their young, deaf daughter.Curtis seems to be falling under the influence of a slowly absorbing mental illness. He does try to diagnose himself and cure it, but instead of fighting it, he does whatever "it" tells him to. The film is a powerful, slowly absorbing piece of extreme reactions to an unidentified source. I fell into this trance where I couldn't wait to see what the next scene would bring, even though it would rarely be any more revealing than the previous one.The cleverness of "Take Shelter" is that it takes paths that you wouldn't quite expect, unless, of course, you're trying to figure out the most brilliant possible ending and directions it can take. For those of us in love with this creative dramatic thriller genre, it accomplishes what we've always wanted.Here, Michael Shannon has taken on another role where he plays the insane one, but where he also might be the one who can really see what's going on in the world. But it's a subtle crazy, with more quiet fear rather than violence. It's a powerful role, and "Take Shelter" is a powerful film that draws you in and keeps you sheltered as it and the world around burns new avenues.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A riveting performance from Michael Shannon and a unique plot makes Take Shelter a must see</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Take Shelter" written and directed by Jeff Nichols is a fantastic movie. It's full of great dialogue, disturbing nightmare sequences, and it is lead by a powerhouse performance by Michael Shannon.The film follows Curtis (Michael Shannon) who is recently having painful nightmares that all follow a storm and how everything turns crazy. These dreams impact his regular life, from sealing his dog in a fenced area to asking his best friend/co-worker Dewart (Shea Whigham) to not work with him anymore. But more importantly, he begins to expand on his tornado shelter in his backyard that leads to complications between his wife Samantha (Jessica Chastain) and his little deaf daughter Hanna.The film works perfectly by its great pace. The film is about two hours long but it never feels boring. The dialogue is great, and the nightmare scenes break up the talking and create a more scary and suspenseful mood. The film moves between Curtis at work as a construction worker to the tornado shelter and how it impacts his family's life.The film is also backed up by Michael Shannon's extraordinary performance. He fits the role of Curtis perfectly: a loving man who is trying to protect his family from a storm he believes is coming as well as a man who is defending himself from his co-workers and family whom think that he is crazy. Michael Shannon delivers in one particular scene at a dinner later in the film with a bravo speech to neighboring families and co-workers; he's angry, emotional and above all powerful in this scene."Take Shelter" is a contender for the 2011 Academy Awards so far. It is riveting, emotionally charged and a powerful film. Michael Shannon has delivered his best performance in his acting career with "Take Shelter." The movie asks a pretty tough question about Curtis: is he mentally ill or is he a prophet? This questioned is answered within the film to a certain extent but it is up to the viewer to decide for themselves. And it is one of the strong points of the film. "Take Shelter" is a superb film that anyone who is looking for something original and great performances should watch. It is one of the best films of the year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am putting a 6 only because the movie has had an ambiance and it was a decent result in every part as long as you leave out the scenario.All these praises about Shanon's performance would stand a valid ground if only the PLOT was even a little helpful.The movie length would justify its cause, if only there was some plot that would keep you there till the end and the 135 mins of movie would turn to be a sweet "suffering".Of course when you watch it, you 'll notice that a plot exists. Right after you 'll notice that the performances, heavy ambiance, movie length are wasted because of that plot.I am also angry with the tricky usage of the word "apocalyptic" concerning the visions of Shannon. In the past it would be "psychotic", "strange" etc. , now the trend orders "apocalyptic".Also the trend orders "shelter" (underground by preference). Really, if it was a house "basement" or something would it matter? No, it had to be "shelter" because that's the trend now in the movies.We 've been tricked. And the rest of you who aren't feeling tricked, you surely witnessed a (decent to say so) imitation of European cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Start - What a Cop Out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of buildup for nothing ? and what a cop out ending! Yes, excellent acting?on a very thin script. See this movie just to watch Michael Shannon develop an engrossing character. My question ? what was the point? Again, I cannot write about this movie without referring to the ending so, if you haven't seen it, DON'T READ THIS REVIEW.First, there is the build up as a possible sci-fi thriller with beautiful and terrifying scenes of freak storms in dream sequences juxtaposed with a possible psychological drama. Curtis's mother is hospitalized as a schizophrenic and his own research into mental illness seems to point to his incipient illness. This is fine ? and wonderful use of creative tension. You're left wondering whether he's actually prescient and his dreams are informed by a higher source or he's just dealing with the beginnings of his craziness. Added to this is the obvious Biblical reference to a deluge, and, by the way, many other ancient myths that use the cleansing waters of a flood or storm in some way. So, there's a lot to think about and truly excellent acting by the two leads as the husband, Curtis, struggles to make sense of the dreams and the wife, Samantha, tries to find a way to stay with him.BUT, somewhere along the way, the story moves step by step away from considering the sci-fi aspect ? no more dream sequences of storms, etc. And we are left to assume the husband is in the beginning stages of craziness. Even the dreams become more oriented toward pathology (the wife looking at the kitchen knife). Then the husband's ranting at the church social dinner sounds more like a man unhinged than a prophet, and uncharacteristic of the husband's character to that point. I had about given up on seeing him turn out to be 'right' about the coming storm or any plot about cleansing a wicked world or sinful humanity (even if we feel that to be true). And then, in the last few seconds of the film, we are jerked back to the original theme of (perhaps) divine intervention in the affairs of men with the coming storm, the look from husband to wife and her nod of, yes, you're really seeing a monumental storm coming.What are we to think of this last moment 'correction' or shift? What message are we supposed to get from this? Is it to listen to crazy people because they might be right? No matter how bizarre their behavior? Is it to consider the evil of our ways, even though the movie hasn't prepped us for this ? there's no exposition about what's wrong with society or the world. Or is it possibly that we should believe in ourselves, no matter how bizarre our dreams and delusions may be nor how incapable we are of making others 'see' what we see? And if he was right, so what? It seems there is no significance to his being right. We haven't been prepped for that outcome.Actually, however, the psychological buildup is much stronger and it's why I inclined to that 'take' toward the end of the film. And why I was very disappointed to see the 'Biblical' storm coming right at the end. What an amateurish cop out! Honestly, what was then the point of the film with that ending?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spooky, ambiguous ending saves slow-moving narrative from total mediocrity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Take Shelter' is a part horror, part psychological drama starring the always excellent Michael Shannon, as an Ohio construction worker who has a history of mental illness in his family, and is now plagued by disturbing visions himself. The question arises whether these visions are portents of things to come or merely the hallucinations of a man gradually experiencing a complete mental breakdown. The entire film is dependent on the big 'payoff' at the end, which turns out to be intentionally ambiguous according to writer/director Jeff Nichols, and has sparked a great deal of controversy over the internet, as to how to interpret such an ambiguous denouement.Nichols presents his story more as a parable than a drama about real life people. Most of the characters are referred to by first names only, such as Michael Shannon's 'Curtis' and his wife 'Samantha' (also well-played by Jessica Chastain). Curtis is sort of an everyman, distinguished only by the fact that his daughter, Hannah, is deaf, and that his mother is a schizophrenic, now living in an assisted living facility. Everyone in Nichols' rural Ohio community, seems to be overly grim and lacking any kind of sense of humor. What's more, there are few discussions by any of the characters that would ground them in any particular place and time.A good part of the film is taken up with depicting all of the alarming visions Curtis is experiencing. The visions run the gamut from Curtis being attacked by his dog, zombie-like people attempting to break into his house and his car while he's driving with his daughter, as well as a giant flock of birds that seemingly hone in on Curtis as a target.Curtis becomes convinced that the visions he experiences, are real, and as a result decides to build a shelter to protect his family from an oncoming apocalyptic storm. His co-worker buddy, Dewart, decides to help him as they borrow their company's heavy digging machinery without authorization and use it to construct the shelter. It's Dewart's devotion to Curtis that causes him to use poor judgment in allowing Curtis to use the machinery without permission. I found Dewart's capitulation to Curtis' request, still a bit too easy as of course such an action could place both their jobs in jeopardy. As it turns out, that's exactly what happens: Curtis is fired and Dewart is suspended for two weeks.For those who were satisfied with the machinations of Nichols' grim characters for most of the film, I can only say that everyone's concept of suspense is different. My feeling was that by the end of the film, the payoff had to be pretty darn good, since the events leading up to it were markedly slow-going, a bit repetitious and not all that absorbing. Nevertheless, I will concede that the ambiguity of the film's ending is food for thought?although ultimately, not as profound as many would like to believe.The film's ending can be interpreted in two distinct ways. The first interpretation is that Curtis' visions were real and his warnings to his community about an impending apocalypse, fell on deaf ears. The storm can be seen as the ultimate result of global warming, with Nichols criticizing those unconcerned about environmental disaster preparedness as well as a general critique on those who rely solely on rationalism as a guide through life. Ironically (with Interpretation #1), it's Samantha, Curtis' well-meaning, 'rational' wife, who gets the shock of her life when she looks out toward the horizon at the beach and sees the 'apocalypse' bearing down on her and her family. Some internet posters argue that since the storm is seen in the reflection of the beach house window (and not from Curtis' point of view which we had always seen before), this is proof that the storm is meant to be real. Interpretation #1 believers hold that when Curtis calls out to Sam at the end, and she responds, "Ok", that's her frozen in fear, acknowledging that she was wrong and Curtis was right all along.Interpretation #2 holds that the climax is another one of Curtis' hallucinations, albeit more benign and optimistic than those that have come before. In this interpretation, the family wouldn't have taken this trip since Curtis had lost his job and they could not afford it (Interpretation #1 believers point out that Samantha had extra money stashed away and would have used it to make the trip, as part of Curtis' ongoing rehabilitation). When Sam says "okay", she's accepting Curtis' continuing mental illness but is glad that the family is still together. The final scene is in contrast to an earlier one of Curtis' hallucinations, where he perceives his wife as hostile, on the verge of grabbing a knife and perhaps attacking him. Instead of Curtis as doomed seer, he's merely a victim of mental illness, whose wife has made the commitment to stay and support him as he tries to recover.I believe that writer/director Nichols threw in the 'Twilight Zone ending' (where Curtis' prophecy is realized), by directing Jessica Chastain to display a look of dread as she stares out at the impending storm. But overall, if one looks at the nature of Curtis' hallucinations (which include zombie-like creatures), I'm in the camp of Interpretation #2, which believes that Curtis is mentally ill.Most of 'Take Shelter', with its generic characters and slow-moving plot, feels derivative. Only the clever, ambiguous ending, which has sparked endless discussion, is enough to save it from total mediocrity. Nonetheless, my feeling is that this probably could have worked better as a one hour, Twilight Zone-like episode, than a full-length feature.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like the recent "Contagion," "Take Shelter" presents a civilizational doom scenario. In the former the threat is an actual global pandemic; in the latter it's a series of powerful visions and dreams experienced by a working-class man (Michael Shannon) in northeastern Ohio. A sort of construction engineer, he lives in a dead-quiet suburb with his pretty, pleasant wife (Jessica Chastain, in a role very similar to the one she played opposite Brad Pitt in "Tree of Life") and their 8-year-old-ish daughter who is afflicted with deafness of apparently recent, but never-explained, origin. Out of nowhere he starts having weird dreams: he is standing in a rain that has the consistency of motor oil; his dog goes berserk, breaks free from his chain and tries to gnaw his arm off; shadowy figures break into his car and yank his daughter out, then try to yank him out. Eventually he begins having waking visions of vast flocks of birds in bizarre formations, explosions of thunder that no one else hears, crows dropping dead from the sky. Suddenly we learn that his mother developed paranoid schizophrenia when he was 10 years old and has been in an assisted living facility ever since. He visits her once and she does indeed behave strangely. He is now the age she was when her illness manifested itself, so perhaps he too is entering into full-blown schizophrenia. His doctor puts him on medications. Worried that his visions portend the end of the world, he starts taking radical actions that alienate him from his family and his community at large. His wife and everyone who knows him thinks he is insane. The audience begins to wonder also: Is he crazy or is he a prophet of doom? Shannon is one of the more forceful actors on the screen today. He handily stole "Revolutionary Road" right out from under Kate Winslet, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kathy Bates. His imposing height, craggy features and lazy right eye enable him to project menace without even trying. Putting him at the center of a feature-length film is not a bad idea at all, but even he can't make "Take Shelter" entirely absorbing. The leaden pace, the lack of humor, the insistently grim, static and depressing ordinariness of the setting all wear down the viewer's patience. The way the material is organized suggests that we are building up to some mysterious, dreadful outcome and Shannon certainly does work himself up to a memorable pitch in support of that notion. But the outcome ? which I won't reveal ? disappoints.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tad disappointing for me but still a decent watch.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not sure why exactly, but I was a little disappointed with Take Shelter, I think it's just my own silliness though because this movie has gotten a generally positive response from all aspects. I was looking very forward to this movie after viewing the trailer and reading some stellar reviews, and also because it boasted two of the best actors working today, Michael Shannon and Jessica Chastain. Parts of the movie I enjoyed a lot , particularly the storm scenes, they built a great sense of dread throughout the film and right up until the end the special effects were impressive. However throughout the middle section of the movie and partly at the end I found it to be just scene after scene of nothing. I know this isn't a disaster film and I wasn't going into it expecting that, I went in knowing it was a character study of a deeply troubled man and the effect his mind has on his life, but for me I just couldn't get fully involved in the story, I think I was in the wrong state of mind when watching it.There are still a lot of terrific things about Take Shelter, it's two leads both give wonderful performances, Michael Shannon is one of those powerhouse actors who is incapable of giving a bad or even average performance, with each performance he gives it his all and he does an amazing job in this, the same can be said about the excellent excellent excellent Jessica Chastain, she is just a young Meryl Streep in the making, I like her more and more with each movie I see her, a real chameleon.I think I would like to watch this again just to see if I missed something, I'm sure I did because I so wanted to love this movie, my partner who saw it with me loved it so I'm sure it's just me. So don't take this review too seriously, see it fir yourself and make up your own mind. I am silly for not getting wrapped up in this flick. I'm Sure I will one day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A remarkable performance from Michael Shannon does not pick up what the script lacks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Curtis (Michael Shannon) is having bad dreams. Bad dreams are a bit low key to accurately describe what he dreams at night; absolute night terrors works better. He dreams his faithful dog suddenly attacks him and takes a chunk out of his arm and later he dreams his best buddy stabs him with a pickax. There is no warning these events would ever occur in reality, but for some reason, Curtis's arm still aches the rest of the day after the dog dream.This sounds like the setup to a horror film but Take Shelter is far from that genre. Curtis has more than a stirring suspicion at what is really going on in his head. When his mother was his age, she was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and has spent the rest of her life in assisted living because of it. This scenario scares Curtis more than anything in the world because just before these dreams, he was a very happy and loving family man.His wife, Samantha (Jessica Chastain) spends the majority of her time taking care of their deaf daughter and creating handicrafts to sell at the local neighborhood yard sale. Their family is not rich, but Curtis has a steady job in drilling and they get by. However, these sudden dreams and later on hallucinations are starting to take their toll on the family harmony. Curtis feels something is coming. He does not know exactly what it is, but he tries to describe it as the ultimate storm anyone has ever seen.To prepare, he starts renovating an old storm shelter in the backyard, at significant cost. Most of these things he does without informing his wife which upsets her even more. Samantha is well aware of what happened to Curtis's mother and just like his friends and neighbors, and even Curtis himself, starts to worry just how far down the rabbit hole these actions are going to go.Take Shelter smartly takes into account the current life and times of its rural Ohio setting. Curtis knows he is lucky to have a job because a lot of people do not and times are rough out there for the unemployed. They show how hard it is to muddle through the healthcare bureaucracy to see the correct doctor signed off by the insurance company for the correct procedure they are willing to pay for. They are just as shocked at pharmacy co-pays as everyone else is.What does not work and sets the film back is its pacing. I do not shy away from what some folks refer to as 'slow' cinema but Take Shelter can really test your patience and stamina. There is not a lot of action and movement here and there is no increased amount of dialogue to make up for it. There is a huge amount of time devoted to watching Curtis's face, wincing cheekbones, and the troubling weather on the horizon which may or may not be real.This is a huge burden for actor Michael Shannon but as he usually does, he provides a remarkable performance. I would support his name being mentioned around Oscar time for his work here. He has been outstanding before, especially in Revolutionary Road, and his Curtis character here is somewhat reminiscent of other characters he has played with mental issues in Bug and My Son, My Son, What Have Ye Done. Jessica Chastain does not have near as many sustained one on one solo shots with the camera but she shows once again why she has come out of nowhere to be this year's breakthrough actress. It seems she is in a film once a month nowadays with The Tree of Life, The Help, The Debt, and now Take Shelter. I had never heard her name before May of this year and now she is showing up everywhere.Take Shelter is also getting rave reviews from the established critics. Ebert gave it four stars and it won the Critics Week Grand Prize at the Cannes Film Festival. What am I missing? The acting is top notch but the script is sparse, the pacing is snail-paced, and there is not much else to make up for that. I do not recommend anyone go see this because it more than just feels empty, it really is. There is no substance to wrap yourself around. There is Michael Sheen of course, but he just cannot shoulder the weight all by himself without some additional help from the writer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Longest Short Film I have Ever Seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Undoubtedly this film is very slow. Towards the end the slow pace almost.... almost became unbearable. I get the film - well at least I feel I do - I almost get the point of it...what I don't get is why there had to be so much of it. For me, this would have been a great short, as it happens it ends up being a watered down version of a brilliant short stretched into a long - never ending movie. At one point I was trying to piece together what my life was like outside of watching this film ..'did I have a life outside of this film?'...I'm not sure because I think I've been watching this film all my life. The acting is brilliant, the premise...very good. The shots/images - well executed. I wasn't angry about it as I usually am when I am made to pay extortionate prices to watch films in the cinema and they disappoint me on some level...but I was a bit bored and after I left with my group of friends we talked about other films that we had seen the previous week...not a good sign.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this last week and can't criticise the acting or premise. However it was a very slow build up and at times and I found I had to bear with the film.The subject was delicately handled and you did sympathise with the protagonists. However I felt not enough time was invested in the peripheral characters which could have added much more. However I suppose the subject matter would not allow this as we see the action from the main characters point of view as he becomes more and more detached from those around him. Quiet desperation and a feeling of dread countered by economic realities of trying to hold it together and provide for his family at the same time.You do leave thinking about the film over the next few days as it is quite open ended leaving you to make your own conclusions. Not one to watch if you don't want to be challenged and just want a fun movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Take Shelter- ...And After Take Cover &amp; Run **</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terribly depressing film is "Take Shelter." Why? We're into it for about 1/2 an hour before the subject line becomes schizophrenia. A 35 year old married man with a deaf mute daughter begins to have unusual dreams and correspondingly acts in an odd-ball manner. As his mother, a one scene stealer by Kathy Bakes, has been institutionalized with the same disease, he feels the same fate shall befall him.We see the effects of what is going on here with his illness. His marriage is suffering, he loses his job and all other things we would expect from such a mess.I believe that the ending detracts from the main story line in the film.The two leads are quite good here. I only hope that up and coming actress Jessica Chastain ("The Maid") doesn't get into the habit of making bombs like this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this is the first time I've reviewed a film on IMDb and I am only doing so because I was shocked to see the reviews here were not exemplary. This movie is one of my five favorites of the year. Michael Shannon and Jessica Chastain are both spellbinding. A very close examination of a marriage confronted by mental illness, I literally gasped at certain moments and I can't remember when that happened last. Perhaps some may find it slow, but I thought the pace built it up and made it even more riveting. 8 or 9 out of 10. I am no expert on mental illness so I can't speak to the accuracy of the film in this area but based on what I have seen, heard and read before, TAKE SHELTER is the finest film depiction I can remember of schizophrenia. At different times, thrilling, heartbreaking and poignant and often at the same time as well. See this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most certainly enjoyable and thought provoking, but not as magnificent as some reviews claim</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching this film, I allowed Myself to mull over the various aspects of its production, from script to final cut, for several days. I do not feel compelled to praise anything specific, nor do I find this particular film to be an "undiscovered jewel". I found many traits similar to the film "Another Earth", just with less monumental visual effects. Whether you prefer one over the other is a matter of personal taste. Overall, the film wasn't cheesy nor hokey. I half expected it to be so, yet I was pleased to discover that it was actually credible and thoughtful.The best scenes of the film, in my opinion, were: 1) When our lead was resistant against opening the storm shelter. 2) The closing scene.Since most of of the "reality" of the story relies on our lead characters dream imagery, I applied a bit of dream interpretation. Storms, particularly tornadoes, do symbolize uncontrolled, violent emotions being set free. Water (as demonstrated in a scene with his wife) is a symbol welling of demonstrated emotions. She was drenched in this scene and it was quite frightening. Using just this basic understanding of dream interpretation one can hypothesize a number of underlying truths that this film is aching to reveal. It was clever of the film makers to include these interpretive scenes. With an understanding of dream interpretation, one can easily surmise that his dream correlates to his reality. This is not excluding the dream (which we don't see) where he's being attacked by his friend and gets slain. If you've the ability, compare your interpretations of his "visions" to that which shortly follows within his reality, quite fun!The effects weren't spectacular, nor was the set. The sets left something to be desired, as did wardrobe. In general, the acting was quite decent, but relied heavily upon the acting skills of Shannon. Shannon was certainly believable in his role as a dedicated, loving blue-collar family man. I found Jessica's performance a bit superficial. The soundtrack is perfectly complimentary it merely enhances a scenes mood rather than overpower it, so subtle and well blended that you probably wont notice it. The story is well written and certainly has its feet on the ground. I believe most viewers will be able to relate to the characters and their plight(s)and enjoy it. easily. Nice, but no masterpiece.All in all, this is a movie that will have the "thinkers" thinking and the mindless masses left a bit unsatisfied... especially at the end. Certainly worth renting to watch alone or with your special someone. It's *not* one you'd want to watch with a larger gathering or watch on movie night with the family, despite it being void of abrasive language and provocative behaviors. The material is a bit too profound to be appreciated by these sorts of viewers. There's total attention required, and quite a bit of mental elements to consider.If you go into this film expecting amazing CGI and 2012-esque destruction, you will be sorely disappointed. If you have any knowledge of dream interpretation and/or psychology, you will be particularly intrigued.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>exploiting superb actors and generic permutation for thrills</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Boardwalk Empire's Michael Shannon is captivating in his lead role and subtly conveys the effects of increasing mental instability in an all-American man. Despite a script that is, at times, synthetically dramatic, Shannon and Jessica Chastain provide intense performances which really carry this film. Chastain's character, Samantha, is particularly attractive in that she embodies a sense of marital trust and compassion that is sadly absent in a considerable section of modern cinema's heroines.Due to Jeff Nichols' auteur approach, though, all minor characters are underwritten, contrived and marginalized to mere narrative function and there is a distinct lack of subtext and subplot that gives the film a stifled air of artifice. Nichols has perhaps over-simplified elements of the film in order to concentrate on his tendency to switch between genres. Take Shelter is quite a straight character drama, in the first instance, but progresses into borrowing heavily from psychological thriller and, more interestingly, apocalyptic horror.The ending gives the entire film a new meaning, but at the expense of inflicting serious detriment to plausibility, suspension of disbelief and, subsequently, appreciation of the whole film. As enjoyable as the performances are, the blending of genres and the technical elements of the film, Nichols writes quite thinly and has a tendency for intermittent sensationalism that is somewhat contradictory to the films otherwise naturalistic feel. Jeff Nichols can write a film as a whole, but it seems he needs to work on making his minor characters more real and his stories more multidimensional. Either that, or fully realise his desire for sensationalism and step away from the more delicate realm of art-house-esque character drama.Check out the full review on my blog: http://ionlyaskedwhatyouthought.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>NOT schizophrenia!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One thing irks me about this movie: It does NOT accurately portray schizophrenia. I write as someone who grew up with a schizophrenic sibling, and I have studied the topic. I also have a schizoid friend.1. The movie's character mostly has waking visual hallucinations (the storm, the birds) although keeps hearing thunder. Schizophrenics usually have no visual hallucinations, and their auditory hallucinations involve voices talking to them, or about them.2. He has nightmares, but is still able to sleep a little every night. The movie focuses more on his nightmares. Active decompensated schizophrenics have long periods of mania and sleeplessness, even for days at a time.3. He is able to function normally at his job until he's fired for using the company's equipment on a weekend (an error in judgment, not work performance). For most schizophrenics, the ability to hold down a job is one of the first thing to go.4. Schizophrenics (especially paranoiacs) will not seek treatment or counseling, as a rule. They don't think there's anything wrong with them.5. Positive: The character's obsession with the fixed idea of the coming Storm, and his compulsion to upgrade his storm shelter, is accurate with regard to the obsessive/compulsive and delusional aspects of schizophrenia. His irrational need for gas masks in the shelter (based on a single news story early in the movie) is also good.6. Positive: The character is emotionally flat and distant in his conversations with others (except for his daughter, and his outburst after he's assaulted by a former friend). "Flat affect" is a common symptom of schizophrenia. Then again, maybe it was just bad acting...Well, that's my two cents about the so-called schizophrenia in this movie. However, I was also disappointed with that stupid ending. It resolved nothing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"You think I'm crazy? Well, listen up, there's a storm coming like nothing you've ever seen, and not a one of you is prepared for it." After a series of nightmares and hallucinations Curtis (Shannon) thinks that he is going insane. After beginning counseling he isn't seeing the effect he wants. Fearing the worst he begins to build a storm shelter for his family. When this causes tension he tries to convince everyone that he is not crazy. This is a very interesting movie. It is a very neat and disturbing idea but at the same time so incredibly slow moving that it is hard to stay interested for most of it. Watching Shannon go from a "normal" father and husband into what he becomes is very interesting to watch but again seems to take forever to get there. The acting by Shannon is so good that you really begin to feel for him and by the end you actually are hoping he is right. Overall, a movie that has a neat idea but needed something else to make the movie as good as the idea. I do have to say that the ending makes watching the movie worth it though. I give it a B-.</fullReview>

Michael Shannon is compelling, and Jessica Chastain is simply wonderful. Shea Whigham is fantastic as Curtis's work buddy; the dialogue between those two at work is hyper-real. The entire film feels like a slice of reality -- excellent casting, dialogue, and production design no doubt account for this.The host of CSC said he enjoyed the score -- can't wait to see it again so I can hear the score. It certainly worked on me, even if I "heard" only a little of it.The little girl who plays the deaf daughter, Tova Stewart, centers the picture -- it wouldn't have worked without her, and with her it works -- man, does it work. Much of what I've seen and heard in the real world since watching it has reminded me of the film. Not easy to watch, but very rewarding</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a simply magnificent film. The acting is top notch, the effects practical, and the cinematography is stunning. Michael Shannon gives a brilliant performance as Curtis and feels so real. He is for the most part calm, but when he flips out it is unreal how tense Shannon can make you feel. Jessica Chastain does her job and the supporting cast is just as great. But you know what? Every other actor could suck in this movie and it would still be great just because of Michael Shannon. We follow him the whole film and we come to realize that while the things he's doing are rather crazy and desperate, we know what he's going through and the audience can tell he's just trying to do the right thing. The script is tight knit and well thought out. It does start and end somewhat slow, which is the movie's only real weakness, but as the film progresses we become more and more invested in the story and we want to know if Curtis is going crazy or he's right and the storms are coming. The camera-work here is breathtaking. Like this shot right here. It's too good. It's a pretty haunting image. Unfortunately I can only show you what I can scrap up online, but trust me, it's some great stuff The whole feel of this movie is chilling as the musical score constantly jangles in the background. It's quiet, but noticeable. Take Shelter is a top of the line kind of movie, with a haunting feel and a genuine sense of paranoia. You will feel like your there, with Curtis, as the anxiety and tension builds. If it weren't for the extra few minutes that made the movie more dragged out, it would probably get a perfect 10. My favourite film of the year so far, 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For starters, it seems that Boardwalk Empire's "dynamic duo" (Shannon &amp; Wingham) are quite a pair stuck in their typical roles, never seem to leave them for anything else. Well, if that's OK with them...The movie itself is slow but it should be, considering the...hmmm...plot. The problem is I didn't find the plot here. No beginning and no end, with something vague in the middle. For such a confusing and understated "story" it's pretty well directed. One should find his way through this maze of "what-did-I-really-want-to-say-with-this-movie?". The movie is presumably (not sure yet) about mental illness and the doctors say that every madness has its coherent inner logical structure. Well, this movie does not, but the attempt is notable. So many questions, no answers at all. Don't get me wrong here: the movie is bearable to watch but don't expect any action, emotions, horror elements, spectacular sfx or... don't expect anything. Maybe then you'll like it. I didn't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Depends on Whether You Like Ambiguousness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Take Shelter" is probably another one of those controversial films for its courageous take on ambiguousness. One moment you think you know where the plot's headed, the next second you find yourself still deep in the pool of ambiguousness and confusion.It is true that the film is rather slow-paced and suspenseful but if you're enjoying every minute of it, it doesn't matter. This is the kind of film that involves or even demands a lot of imagination for your own version of interpretation of everything going on. There's no correct answer and no correct explanation. The reasons behind the events that take place in "Take Shelter" are what you want them to be, and the ending can mean different things from different viewpoints. What matters most is that the ending does mean a conclusion to things, though it can be one that differs in everyone's eyes.Two elements are found most valuable. The first is the mystery, and the second are the amazing performances from Chastain and Shannon.When it comes down to liking this or not, it certainly differs even more. For the ones that love it, they enjoy the ambiguousness in this suspenseful thriller. For the ones that hate it, it has to be the nature of it being slow-moving, which will directly translated into boredom.I am not a big fan of works of ambiguousness but I find the suspense element very well-organized throughout and I just love the strong acting, but frankly speaking, I do find the film boring at times.</fullReview>

Like if nature was warning him, but his mind bullying him. On family, the burden of your past (mother): how you recognize your parent's weaknesses in yourself. Then the support of the present (wife); helping him to overcome his illness but believing him at the same time, as she hopes for a public vindication.Then his own relationship with the nightmares and the visions: he understands they are not normal, tries to control himself, to find help, But at the same time, they are the major determinant of his behavior. There is an unbelievable scene where Shannon is in the shelter while trying to self-diagnose the problem he might have</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Take Shelter's plot summary sounds like a film that could easily go off the tracks. Apocalyptic visions, hallucinations, psychological madness? All three are interesting scenarios, but all three together could be helmed in the wrong way. Thankfully, Take Shelter isn't, and instead is a atmospheric, slowly-paced ride through our own disturbing dreams.The film is simple enough, but its mood is what sets it apart. There are several instances where a quiet and rhythmic score plays under the visions of Curtis. We know what's going on, and his visions could easily become repetitive and stale, but instead each one brings even more uneasiness to the viewer. The carefully structured cinematography carefully places itself in the middle of both reality and dream, so it feels realistic and yet horrific at the same time. There's one dream in particular that sent chills down my spine, and its one featuring Curtis' wife Samantha. This is perhaps one of the creepiest and most elegantly filmed scenes of 2011. However, for all of the instances where we feel like we are in Curtis' head, it's very much a drama. The film is never over the top and plays out these scenarios in ways that we can empathize with this family. Michael Shannon is used to playing a certain type of character, and I'm not sure how much this differs from the characters he plays. I have only seen him in both television and films in the last two or three years so I can't judge him based on other things, but here he plays two sides of the spectrum. There are moments when he has gone over the edge, but also times where he quietly plays out everything that has happened. There is a scene in the middle of the film where he explains to his wife one of his dreams, and this is the first time that the viewers don't see it. The way Shannon carefully explains it is chilling and effective, and because of what we have seen before we feel horrified at what it is. It paints a clear picture in our head not just because of the way Shannon describes it but because of what Nichols has showed us before. The quiet nature in which he shows us the dreams and how he paces them allows us to be hypnotized by them even when we aren't experiencing it with Curtis, and instead when we are taking the listener position alongside Samantha. This is the first time where we really start to think how this is affecting Samantha and not just Curtis. Jessica Chastain is brilliant. Having seen two previous films with her in 2011, here she plays a more natural role after The tree of Life and The Help. Even while Shannon is brilliant playing his character, we also see Chastain's reactions to everything she has heard. A simple expression along her face is enough to show us what she is really feeling and how confused she is. Take Shelter is a brilliant film. It doesn't feel heavily uncomfortable or disturbing, but it does feel moody and subtle. It doesn't have anything that you perhaps wouldn't expect in a film like this, and yet still feels like a fresh piece of filmmaking. The ending is fantastic as well, but not in a way that feels out of the blue. It's entirely satisfying just like the rest of the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie wasn't worth the 2 hours I wasted watching it.I saw the trailer a while back and thought that it looked as if it might be a good flick.....but I was wrong. The movie started off well enough in the beginning but then it began it's trudge through the tar pit..... SUPER....and I mean SUPER slow moving. I was constantly waiting for something to happen that was actually going to define the film......but nothing ever did.It was one of those movies where you keep thinking that something exciting is about to happen yet you're only let down because whatever was in the making simply fizzled out and vanished.Don't get me wrong because the acting wasn't bad at all. The acting was actually really quite good and the characters were well defined and very likable. Both Michael Shannon and Jessica Chastain (who I think is a hottie :)) did a great job with the movie, it was the plot that sucked.The last quarter of the movie seemed as if they ran out of cash so had to throw it all together to see if it would stick and in my opinion it didn't....it merely fell apart making me wonder why I stayed up till 2 in the morning to watch it when I could have been sleeping creating my own B rated movie staring right beside the lovely Jessica Chastain ;)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I gave this movie a 7 but if the ending had been different I would have given it a 10! The ending was totally inadequate. More poetic license should have been used. The ending IS real in the movie and not a dream as the girl and wife are seeing what he is seeing and the scene is treated in that way as opposed to how the dreams are treated in the rest of the movie. However, as I said, I would have been much more dramatic with the ending, after all it is fiction, right? I would have stayed on the scene of the storm out to sea and have the water spouts grow exponentially, doubling every couple of seconds and getting progressively larger and finally combining into one gigantic mega spout and a 1000 foot high tsunami coming ashore and the camera now above Myrtle Beach and panning back as the wave totally destroyed the entire city. That would be an ending worth the rest of the movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Interpretation of Dreams</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Shannon has a reputation for playing oddballs, which is why I like him. His name isn't that familiar to most, but you may remember him from titles as diverse as 'Bug' and 'Revolutionary Road'. Here he leads a cast in a film which won a top prize at Cannes and at Sundance. Curtis LaForche (Shannon) lives in rural America with his wife Samantha (Jessica Chastain) and their daughter. They appear to be an idyllic family. Everyone keeps telling them how lucky they are. He has a steady job as a sand man and she is a hardworking housewife. But Curtis has been having these nightmares which begin with raging storms and end with him being attacked in some brutal manner. He wakes from these dreams choking with fear and paralysed with shock. 'Take Shelter' is unusual. It looks and feels more European than American. It has the European trademark of 'less is more' and many of the central themes are open to wide interpretation. The unravelling of the story is noticeably slow. I felt at times it was leading either nowhere or in a direction which would disappoint me. But when the credits came up, I was in no doubt that I had just witnessed an extraordinary picture. Although Curtis knows he is a paranoid schizophrenic, he is also convinced that his apocalyptic visions, whose intensity are by now increasing, are real. He busily plans for the end of days without informing anyone. He dismisses all else in his life to concentrate on building a tornado shelter in his garden. It becomes his raison d'?tre. I was slow to see the genius of the film. Then it hit me about thirty minutes in. Of course Curtis can't tell anyone about his problem, including his wife. Director Jeff Nichols knows how credulous people are in movies. That's why he has the foresight to not give his characters this characteristic. Chastain brings depth to an otherwise hollow role. So much emotiveness comes through on her jet-white face. I was moved almost to tears by her desperation and anxiety. Shannon's performance is also wonderful. His handling of a climactic paroxysm pulverised me. People are describing 'Take Shelter' as a metaphor for financial strife and post-9/11 angst. That's not my interpretation. Aside from mental illness, I think Nichols's film is about love, though not a traditional love story. Does Samantha love Curtis enough to trust him despite his illness? To what extent will she compromise her life for him? Does she believe her husband has a sixth sense? There's still a stigma around mental illness. It could be down to human understanding not being what it should. But I think the paucity of films covering mental illness is down to there not being enough filmmakers brave enough to broach the subject. Or perhaps they just don't care enough to explore this fascinating area of human nature. www.moseleyb13.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had been wanting to see "Take Shelter" ever since I first saw the trailer for it, months ago. And now I just had the privilege of seeing it at the Zrich Film Festival. It turned out be to be even better than I was expecting and in fact, everyone in the audience seemed to be captivated and completely absorbed by the film. What I found most refreshing about "Take Shelter" is that, unlike so many films, it did not resort to cheesy scare tactics in order to keep the viewers' attention. Instead, it moves at a nice, steady pace and really allows the viewers to get to know and perhaps even identify with the two main characters. What I also found refreshing about this film is that there is nothing pretentious about it, and (in my opinion) it was surprisingly quite unpredictable. It kept me guessing until the very end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>TAKE SHELTER (2011) **** Michael Shannon, Jessica Chastain, Tova Stewart, Shea Whigham, Katy Mixon, Kathy Baker. Shannon gives a devastating, pitch-perfect performance ? a career high for the journeyman character actor of his generation ? and if there's any justice an Oscar nod ? as a loving family man suddenly plagued with doomsday nightmares and hallucinations that suggest familial mental illness..or something far more foreboding. Filmmaker Jeff Nichols ? who collaborated with Shannon on the equally fine "SHOTGUN STORIES" ? expertly blends state-of-the-art CGI sequences of disaster impending while still maintaining the truth/reality of his protagonist and Shannon's Curtis is a decent man (a rare thing on screen these days) whose only flaw is the Achilles' heel of keeping his family (and his wits) about him. Shannon's stoic demeanor is only betrayed by the fantastic body language (a seemingly imposing man slowly imploding) and when Nichols allows one 'showy' showcase of Curtis' rage at a a community supperhall it is with defining merit of a good man pushed to his limits. Not only is the mental health theme prominent but faith in general (God, fellow human beings, self, and of course, family) is questioned with the two at logger-heads in trying to steal Curtis in the process of his dignity and ultimately, his sanity. One of the year's very best and an indie gem; I Urge You To Buy This ? Not Rent It when it comes out on DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an asinine film that takes two hours to deal superficially with the idiotic questions it raises (Wow, what if people we think are crazy are really prophets???!!? Oooh, what is the nature of reality??!?!?). If you didn't deal sufficiently with such deep and existential queries back in your 8th grade psych class ? and if you really think a MOVIE is the medium that will finally provide the illumination you've been seeking ?Jeff Nichols' meaningless exploration of meaningless ambiguities will have you close to the Big O, psychologically speaking. For everybody else, this film will seem slow ? the way continental drift is slow ? and about as riveting as watching water evaporate. Michael Shannon, meanwhile, holds back not a single element of his vast repertory of grimaces, lip twitches, frowns, and bug-eyed stares (I'm quite sure his face must have its own membership to Gold's Gym). With all those contortions going on, the viewer may lose sight of the fact that Shannon can't actually act, unless looking as though your hemorrhoids are killing you can be called acting. (He can't act in _Boardwalk Empire,_ either, but surely no one else in Hollywood pouts and moues with more conviction than he does.) In short, Nichols plods doggedly ahead in this film as though he's working out one of those fascinating ideas that come to potheads about 20 minutes into a decent high but which most people are smart enough to abandon the moment they sober up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Missed its mark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film did not fulfill its potential at all, IMO. Other than the terrific performance of Jessica Chastain as the protagonist's wife, this story was slow, uneven, predictable, without adequate dramatic tension and insufficiently detailed as a mental health story of what the tragedy of the onset of hereditary mental illness can do to a previously typical person and family. And, it even made it oddly justifiable at the end, as we could easily see coming much earlier. This never happens in real life so thumbs way down on that false step.Michael Shannon, the actor playing the protagonist and husband, does not have the emotional range(talent)to adequately portray the lead role effectively and most truthfully, but he seems to have lately assumed some of those "disturbed person" roles that used to go to John Turturro or Gary Oldman, both of whom are far superior actors.The very predictable ending was also a letdown, as I expected more risk-taking. All in all, the film was not special or innovative, other than for Chastain's outstanding performance, and the ending was pure Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Waste of time- better wait for sequel! :)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I mean, the acting was great, but the movie it self SUCK big time! Unbelievable boring and stretching. This is not the movie about catastrophe- this is the catastrophic movie! The story is interesting and I feel- no, I know the movie should be much much better. It's one of those movies where you wish you can enter into it and kick ass the main character for being so stupid and slow. Like this is just an intro of the main movie or the director just prepared us for the sequel of it. Anyone should rather wait for sequel. There's nothing else to say about it, but I have to write few more lines so my review can be posted. Sorry people. Anyway,I was expecting much more from it, and when you watch the trailer you can easily get belief that will be movie with some action, some disaster scenes, and much more of everything. The movie delivers only frustrations. Lots of it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The standards have significantly dropped! I could easily dig out similar movies from 40s and 50s which are more exciting, interesting and artistic. Even Donie Darko has its correlate in Harvey, though R. Kelly neglected he saw Harvey.Essentially, Take Shelter is a story about a man who takes care of his family. And he does that in a strange way...While the acting is not bad, as well as score and cinematography, the dialogs, the plot, character development etc. are pretty much clich. Completely unoriginal. Most of the scenes look too realistic but not in an interesting way. It's like someone shot ordinary people doing ordinary things during the day. And that is not cinema. So I don't understand all the fascination with Jeff Nichols, he's comparable to M. N. Shyamalan (in his bad phase, which begun with Signs and unfortunately never ended).This is a watchable movie, a solid 6/10. After more people see Take Shelter, it will settle down around 7.0 or lower.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The performances mitigate the disappointment of this attempt at a modern parable. What they can't do is patch over Jeff Nichols' less than rigorous film. The general sense of portent is in the content and dream-reality cross-cutting but not the tone. No amount of furrow-browed intensity from Michael Shannon is going to help elucidate the plastic clouds of computer generated birds that pop up, nor the cartoon storm backdrops. Exactly how the fragile world of men trying to hold onto their jobs in a shrinking market and the turbulent visions that pepper Shannon's never-off-screen, first person account of the world dovetail is not even signposted; the place of a working man's neurosis barely investigated. The end is crass, patronising. 3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tense Look at a Disturbing Subject</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Take Shelter (2011) **** (out of 4) Intense psychological thriller about a man from Ohio named Curtis (Michael Shannon) who appears to have everything he'd want. He has a loving wife (Jessica Chastain), a young daughter and a great paying job. Curtis begins to see apocalyptic signs in his dreams and soon he begins to build a storm shelter as his life starts to spin out of control. Soon Curtis is wondering if he's actually seeing future events or if he is slowly losing his mind. TAKE SHELTER is a pretty disturbing film to watch as it deals with some rather ugly subjects but writer-director Jeff Nichols takes his time in building up the characters and the atmosphere and in the end you get a surreal look at mental illness. This really isn't an easy story to pull off for a couple reasons. For starters, the director selects to tell the story in a very slow fashion and I'm sure this might turn off some viewers but it actually helps and shows the mind frame of the main character. The film never gives any clear answers as to whether he's really sick or if perhaps he is seeing a future event. I think the screenplay is very honest in the questions it asks and the various turns in the story feel very real and not just some plot point to move the film along. The atmosphere almost feels like one you'd see in a horror movie and I'd say that the apocalyptic images are some of the most chilling ever put on screen. It also doesn't hurt that you get a marvelous performances by Shannon who can play this type of character like no other. There wasn't a single second in the film where you didn't believe him in the part. He perfectly pulls off the workingman aspect of the part but what he really excels out is when it's time for the character to lose his mind. The way Shannon plays fear is so real that you almost feel claustrophobic like his character. Chastain is also very effective in her part. In these type of movies the wife character is usually just some sort of stepping stone but the screenplay doesn't allow that and the actress is really able to shine and expand the character into someone you can feel for. Kathy Baker also comes off very impressive in her one scene. TAKE SHELTER is a film that's going to rub some people the wrong way but there's no question that it's an extremely well-made picture with some terrific performances and some startling images.</fullReview>
