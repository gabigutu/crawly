		<fullReview>I first saw this film in the early 80's on cable. It was unique as a statement about the sixties, culture, war, music, race, and a bunch of things I'm certain I missed. However about a year ago it came back into my life as I started enjoying it with my son. He's a little young (9) for a lot of the themes in it, but he understands dancing hippies are fun to watch, and he gets the idea that end is ironic. While I can't think of other films in this genre, it does have a stand alone genius I love. It also does a unique justice to Central Park. Most musicals are lost on me, one way or another. "Tommy" was over the top and heavy handed in direction, "Oliver" seemed like crowd control on the silver screen, "The Wall" was so much abstract self important and indulgent dribble, but listening to "Failure of the Flesh" from Hair sounds right for our times today, as it did in the eighties, as it must have in the sixties...truly Timeless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now more than ever we need Peace &amp; Love in this world!This film really showcases the wonderful music of the Broadway show, and the fabulous Choreography of the legendary Twila Tharp! I saw it again after many years, and it still holds up well.Thank you, MGM/UA for putting this on DVD! I love the option of seeing in Widescreen. MGM rocks for doing this on many of their DVD releases.Ya gotta love Treat Williams as Berger and John Savage as Claude. They couldn't have picked better actors &amp; actresses for this film! Beverly D'Angelo is such a 'hot mama' in this film--I had forgotten just how hot! WOW!The supporting cast is absolutely great,with the late great Nell Carter making a singing cameo in a couple of scenes, as well as the kooky Charlotte Ray (Mrs. Garrett on 'Facts Of Life')The story gets a little weak toward the end, but the anti-war sentiment of the late 60's still holds up, and is relevant today. It's beautifully filmed (quite a bit on location) and is so colorful and lovely and really brings the spirit of 1968 back on the big screen.I saw this movie when it was released in 1979 when I was 15, and was moved by it then, and it still moves me now at 40. Some other reviews on here say they think it should have been made sooner--I don't think Hollywood was ready to make such a movie back in the late 60's-early 70's.The Vietnam War ended in 1975, and the whole thing hit a little too close to home, I think for this story to be filmed before it was (like in 1969, 70, 71)Bravo to Director Milos Foreman! I love this film!!!!!!!It's nice to see it again, this time on DVD. It never looked better!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen this movie more than 50 times in my life, and each time I watch it the movie is just as entertaining as it was the first time! George Berger (played by Treat Williams) leads a small group of 1960's-1970's era anti-war "hippies" living at large in New York City. This small group happens upon a young man, Claude Bukowski (played by John Savage) who has been drafted into the US Army for service in Vietnam. Despite their best efforts to dissuade him, Claude does eventually report for basic training in the Army. Still distressed over his having left them, the hippie group steal a car and travel across the USA to visit Claude "...for a couple of hours," in the words of George Berger (to an M.P. stationed at the entry gate of the Army base Claude is temporarily stationed at in Nevada). The outcome is truly touching, so I won't spoil it for those who have not yet seen this fantastic movie. The musical score is equally fantastic! Don Dacus (of the rock group Chicago), who plays the part of "Woof" - one of the hippies, is a not a key character, but the movie wouldn't have been the same without him. Beverly D'Angelo (who plays Sheila Franklin, an uptown girl who is befriended by the hippie group) is sensational in her role! A MUST SEE film!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, HAIR came out in the late 70's. But please don't call it a "disco-era" musical; there isn't a single thing in it that would suggest any detraction from its 1968 period. Judge it on its own merit; too often, a movie is compared to its stage roots and is inevitably crucified. As it is, the film plays out like one long, fantasy trip (whether that trip is substance-enhanced or not is your call)- starting with the "Aquarius" sequence and continuing on to the marvelous set pieces for "Manchester England," "Ain't Got No," "I Got Life," and best of all, the "Electric Blues"/"Hare Krishna" fantasy which shows lovers John Savage and Beverly D'Angelo literally flying through their own wedding ceremony. (BTW, the woman singing "Aquarius" in the film's opening is not Melba Moore, but Ren Woods- a wonderful singer-actress seen a lot on TV in the 70's, and star of the Los Angeles production of "The Wiz.") The opening Twyla Tharp corps-de-ballet shot right on the Central Park grounds- with Woods' solo in a dizzying 360 camera pan- is an awesome start to a rock-infested musical. Ms. Moore (who performed in the original Broadway HAIR) appears later in the film singing "3-5-0-0" with Ronnie Dyson in the war protest scene shot in Washington, DC. And there are moments- like the "Walking In Space" basic training sequence or the simple close-up on Cheryl Barnes's torch solo "Easy To Be Hard-" which are just plain astonishing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I ever saw this movie was when I was four years old. I remember loving it and everything about it. 13 years later, I am now 17, and decided to watch it about a month ago because I am taking a 1960's class in school. I didn't really know what to expect, since it had been 13 years since I last saw it, but I was completely blown away by it. The actors were amazing, the music was so fun, and I now find myself singing along to every song. Treat Williams is great as Berger, the "leader" of the hippie group, who always gets what he wants, one way or another (except for at the very end, of course). John Savage is actually very convincing as Claude, the Oklahoma draftee who falls in love with Sheila (Beverly D'Angelo). D'Angelo is lovely as the prim and proper rich girl who eventually rebels against her upbringing and joins the hippies. The other hippies are played by Annie Golden, Don Dacus, and Dorsey Wright. Annie Golden is just adorable as Jeannie, the girl who is pregnant but still as cute and innocent as a child. Don Dacus and Dorsey Wright are good as Woof and Hud, the other two members of the group, and Cheryl Barnes, who plays Hud's fiancée, has an amazing voice. The only problem I have with this movie, however, is that the relationship between Claude and Sheila is not very convincing. They are barely ever shown together, and when they are, they fight (remember the skinny dipping scene?). It seems as though their relationship is very weak, and by the end of the movie we are supposed to believe they are madly in love, only based on the few meetings they had. I also see that many people writing reviews here are upset by the PG rating this movie has. I personally would raise the rating up to a PG-13, only because there is some drug use... but remember in 1979, PG-13 didn't exist. I don't think the nudity is bad at all, it is in no way sexual (in fact, there isn't really any sex at all in this movie), and it is only to show the childlike innocence that the group maintains. In most European countries, nudity isn't regarded as something bad, and I don't see why it is here in the US. Anyways, I give this movie a high rating, and I'm glad it was made back then, because in the insanely "politically correct" world of today, they wouldn't even think of making it, and even if they did, it would be a very "watered down" version, and I'm sure you wouldn't get the full effect. In conclusion, this is a very underrated film that is definitely worth checking out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sketchy Broadway musical becomes an amazing screen musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1979 film musical of HAIR was loosely based on the infamous 1960's Broadway musical that became famous because of its infamous nude scene. The stage musical isn't really much more than a group of skits strung together with some amusing musical numbers; however for the film director Milos Foreman (who won an Oscar for directing ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST) and the writers have taken the basic premise of the play and the score and constructed a real story to make the show more "user friendly" for the big screen. In the film, naive farm boy Claude Hooper Buchowski (John Savage) is about to go into the army and decides to spend a couple of days in New York where he meets a group of aging hippies (Treat Williams, Dorsey Wright, Annie Golden, Don Dacus)who get him involved in a group of nutty misadventures, including the pursuit of a snooty society girl (Beverly D'Angelo). The story divides into a series of vignettes that range from the ridiculous to the sublime, but it is all gorgeously photographed with a clever use of NYC locations and imaginatively staged musical numbers (outstandingly choreographed by the legendary Twyla Tharp). Treat Williams lights up the screen as Berger, the unconventional and free-spirited hippie who does his best to get Claude to loosen up and is matched scene for scene by Savage as Claude, who brings a lovely sweetness to the role of Claude. Annie Golden is a charmer as Jeannie, the pregnant hippie who is pregnant by Wright or Dacus, doesn't know which one is the father and doesn't seem to care. There is one outstanding musical number after another here..."Aquarius" is a tour through Central Park which includes dancing horses...Treat Williams disrupts a fancy dinner party in "I Got Life"..."Black Boys/White Boys" features the late Nell Carter and Ellen Foley extolling the ethnic virtues of men and "Easy to be Hard" is a powerful rendering of one of the best songs in the show by original cast member Cheryl Barnes, who plays Wright's ex-girlfriend and mother of his child. This is a beautifully photographed, well-acted sung, and danced psychedelic acid trip of a movie that must be seen and once seen, will initiate multiple viewings as this dazzler has to much to offer to catch it all in one showing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warning: Highly Addictive, You May even find yourself singing along!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One night at home I had nothing to do, and I saw that Hair was on t.v. later. I was curious about it, I mean I had no idea what to expect. I had heard people make fun of it, and I had heard people praise it. So I had to watch, I had to have an opinion.At the beginning of the film, I enjoyed The Age of Aquarius number, and was intrigued. However, when the number Hair came on, I didn't know how to react. I wanted to laugh at it and change the channel, I didn't want my siblings to make fun of me. Yet the song, though a little stupid, was also catchy. I kept watching. After I was finished watching the entire film, I had no idea what had just happened. I didn't know if I liked it or not, I did know that I wanted to see it again.This is a strangely addicting film. I watched it three more times in the days following, and my final verdict is, I love it! I can't help it. It's just so fun! The fist time I watched it I was mocking it, but by the third time viewing it I was in anticipation over when the number Hair would come on so I could sing along. I especially loved the song, How Can People Be So Hard, it's a different pace from the majority of the film. What can I say, when it was over I was singing the songs in my head for weeks. I just have to buy it. I highly recommend this film to musical lovers (especially if you love musicals like The Who's Tommy). And although I know I would never be a hippie, this film makes me want to say "Heck with work, I'm going to grow out my hair so fleas can live in it!" Watch it, but beware, I think it just might do the same for you!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly underrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(May contain spoilers) I find myself disappointed with the criticism this movie receives. While it is most certainly not perfect, it is much better than it is given credit for. The acting and photography are excellent. Some of the musical numbers are great; including the title number, "Where Do I Go?", "Easy to be Hard", and "Black Boys/White Boys". While I have not seen the stage musical, I think that it clouds the judgement of many. This is not the musical you see in theatres. Do not attempt to compare them. The theatrical musical might have been sensational to watch, but it would never have had the same effect on film, so a plot had to be added. And the ending that has been added is just amazing. The movie left me feeling like I had actually watched something important, unlike most of today's movies, which only satisfy on one level.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This seems to be a love-it-or-hate-it film; I'm one of those who love it. Other commenters have said most of what I'd want to say about the movie, but I did want to add one thing:A couple of people here have complained that the relationship between Claude and Sheila wasn't documented well enough to explain "the great love they're supposed to have at the end of the movie" (to paraphrase one reviewer here).I would like to respectfully suggest that they didn't have any such "great love;" instead, Claude had a crush on Sheila, which she didn't reciprocate (or at least not to the same degree). Instead, she came along on the road trip to spend the time with Berger, whom she found far more interesting than Claude - you can see that from the time she meets him.Doesn't that make more sense, now? Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Number One Cult-Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The antiwar musical "Hair" is my number one cult-movie. I do not know how many time I have seen this film in the movie-theaters and on VHS, or how many times I have listened the CD with the stunning soundtrack, and now, this masterpiece has been finally released on DVD in Brazil.The pacifist and touching story is still amazing, a hymn of freedom, friendship and liberty of choices, and pictures the resistance of a generation against the stupidity of war. I do not know what happened to this wonderful generation of the counterculture of the 70's and their dreams, since the present world is probably worse than in the 70's. I do not recall who won the Oscar in 1979, but Treat Williams and John Savage deserved at least a nomination for their awesome performances. Beverly D'Angelo is extremely gorgeous in the role of a hypocrite spoiled upper-class teenager. I have seen "Hair" probably more than twelve times, and my eyes always get wet while Berger walks to the airplane singing "That's me, that's me, that's me", and I start crying with his gravestone in the cemetery. I believe this is one of the most beautiful, sad and touching conclusions of the cinema history. My wife, my daughter and my son also love this film; therefore I can guarantee that "Hair" is timeless and recommended for any audience. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): "Hair"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the stage show, but a fun musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original stage show was a gem, but there was no practical way of reproducing its essence on film, so it appears the story was almost completely rewritten and the staging redone for the film version.What was filmed is lively and a fun depiction of the hippie movement as it never was. Then again, most musicals reach into fantasy just a bit to give the audience the escapism reason for wanting to see movies. The movie of Hair is presented in a very main-streamed format (unlike the stage show) and leaves out the major protests of the stage show against pollution (I understand that DOW Chemicals was a major financial backer of the movie, so that might explain the omission of all pollution references and songs - although they are on the soundtrack) as well as most references to the politics of the era or the plight of black soldiers in combat. Gone, too, are most of the conflicts between the younger and older generations. This film, however, works for what it is: a musical fantasy that should not be taken seriously or as a depiction of real history. The songs that made it to the film are just as full of energy as they were on the stage, and the new story line (for the most part) is well done. The ending, sadly, goes over the top and alters the whole focus of what had been the building conflict within the plot. Overall, it is an enjoyable musical involving a very sad time in this nation's history. Unfortunately, the profundity of the stage show is lost, and most people will only ever know the frivolity of this film rather than the beauty and depth of the original musical.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A different "Hair"-style than the stage version, but still good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The stage play "Hair" is primarily remembered now for two things....its shocking frankness and its music. In bringing the musical to the big screen (belatedly), the bulk of the stage version's loose plot was discarded and a more conventional storyline was created to link the songs together. This seems to either please or alienate people, depending on their relationship to the original show. In any case, the great majority of the songs are retained in this filmization which is more than can be said for many, many stage to screen adaptations. And what music! In most cases, the vocalizing even exceeds the quality of what could be found onstage, though the authenticity of the performers is obviously forsaken somewhat as the original cast was LIVING this at the time they were in the show. The film's plot concerns an Oklahoma farm boy (Savage) who's on his way to report for active military duty during Vietnam. He is waylaid in Central Park by a clatch of hippies led by Williams. He also spies the girl of his dreams (D'Angelo), a debutante who rides by on horseback in the midst of all the free love gyrations taking place in the park. The rest of the movie concerns the connections of these characters as they experience culture clash, sharing, understanding and even love. There is copious drug use and rebellion against the wealthy along with hallucinogenic dancing and skinny dipping. Eventually, one character makes a gesture for another which winds up costing more than could ever have been imagined. This moment makes for a hugely poignant ending to what is mostly a light-hearted and ebullient film. True, more than a little of the original subject matter has been tossed aside, but the filmmakers must be credited for (almost) successfully weaving a story around the songs (which are quite varied in their style and content.) The story fails with regard to creating a believable bond between Savage and D'Angelo that would endure the way it does in the story. They hardly spend any time together in the bulk of the film (and quarrel a lot during that!), yet supposedly have this amazing love. "Aquarius" gets the movie to a rousing, eye-opening start and it's just the beginning of many striking, effervescent musical moments in the show. Oddly, the one song that is badly arranged, poorly sung and just basically mangled is the title number! Most of the rest are excellent. NOTHING is better than complete unknown Barnes' rendition of "Easy to be Hard". She knocks the song completely out of the ball park and, sadly and inexplicably, her career went nowhere. Williams is, at times, deliriously sexy here. He comes off as annoyingly arrogant and stubborn at first, but eventually wins the audience over with his innate charm and vibrant talent. As the movie nears it's close, he soars into the hunk stratosphere when, ironically, he cuts his hair. Savage doesn't come off at all like an Oklahoman, but manages to display the contrast of his and Williams' characters. He does an adequate job in all departments throughout. D'Angelo (two years after her jaw-dropping role in "The Sentinel"!) is hardly debutante material and comes off as icy much of the time, but she has her moments as well. Chapin does a bang up job as her brother. The remainder of the hippie gang are acquired tastes. Wright does pretty well, but went nowhere after this. Golden just looks dazed and chews gum incessantly. Dacus is quite weak and does little to enhance the film. What's surprising is how a film that contains lengthy shots of bare breasts, male rear ends (and even split second male frontal nudity) was considered benign enough to warrant a PG rating, yet now, nearly 25 years later, America seems to still have a Puritanical viewpoint towards the human body when compared to other countries. The tide has turned backward from the free love and self-expression era (except in trash like "The Jerry Springer Show" and "Howard Stern".)</fullReview>

This movie is against the Vietnam war and shows how people should be united independent of the color,origins, religions and classes. I love the characters Berger and Woof and I think Central Park of the 70's one of the most beautiful places I already saw in my life.By the way,I still have this music in my mind:When the moon is in the Seventh House And Jupiter aligns with Mars Then peace will guide the planets And love will steer the starsThis is the dawning of the age of Aquarius The age of Aquarius Aquarius!

		<shortDescription>Not really half as interesting as the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are some wonderful visuals and musical numbers in this film version of HAIR, but unfortunately the subversiveness of the original has been almost totally lost. For those of you who don't realize it, this film is almost nothing like the original play; Claude was more or less the leader of the tribe, not Berger. And Claude was bisexual. Most of the plot in the film was totally fabricated by Milos Forman, the director. Among other things, he left out some of the more interesting songs, including one (My Conviction) that was sung by a transvestite, long before most people were even aware that such people existed. The anti-war sentiment was much stronger in the original...etc etc etc.All this does not mean that the film version of HAIR isn't interesting - obviously many people like it. But I thought you should know that it is a pale substitute for the original. For those who liked the film it might be worthwhile buying the play and discovering just how different the two versions are.I would like to say one thing here that I found extraordinary. I live in Paris, and when this film opened I went to one of the largest cinemas in Paris to see it. At that time, the French were a very controlled people in general. Despite this, something quite extraordinary (for its time) happened in the cinema the day I was there. At the point in the film where Hud's wife is angry for having been deserted by him, she sings "How Can People Be So Heartless?"... and she did such a wonderful job of it that the entire theatre burst into spontaneous applause. In the middle of a movie theatre, this was unheard of behaviour for the French, So I guess Milos Forman did something right!</fullReview>

For most hair production it's a golden opportunity to do nude, but my production was fully dressed... I don't think full frontal nudity in a movie or a play guarantees artistic quality... And so did the creators of the movie. The movie version is great with classic hits following each other while letting the plot develop to the chilling climax. A great cast of actors, dancers and singers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie is decent, but so different from the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember listening to a radio reading of the play when I was 11 or 12 years old; early 70's. Not long after that, I got the record album of the original. Compared to the movie, it was truly rebellious and touched upon some 'forbidden' subjects that Hollywood still downplays and stereotypes; trannies, draft-card burners, college students who are vocally in opposition with the politics of the day and those who are in power, and the list goes further. The stage version doesn't portray Claude as a ridiculously naive Okie, but as a young draftie of the US Army who feels unsettled and is wavering in thought about what he's going to do with his life. Sheila isn't some aloof blue-blood snob who's never been exposed to the rebellion that was building up in the 1960's. And Berger wasn't the absolute KING of the nowhere druggies in Central Park. Although Cheryl Barnes was a godsend to the movie with her mind-numbing performance of "Easy to Be Hard"; in the play, Hud didn't ditch his pregnant fiancée to go live in the streets with those - commune-like, free loving, drug experimenting, believers in freedom of speech, anti-war protesters - . The movie backed away from the original play where the orgy was concerned and the ending of the movie was so altered from the play, that I have trouble relating the plots. The unspoken leader, Berger, takes the place of Claude and goes to die in Vietnam. The movie was fun to watch, with the dancing and the songs, but it's plot is so sanitized in relation to the political world of the '60's and early '70's anti-war movement, that it almost looks like censorship. The fact that it avoids sexuality is also a major departure from the theme of the original play. I liked the movie somewhat, but it's not the "Hair" I remember.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some call this "the last great movie musical"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was one of the biggest movie surprises of the late 70s. It's absolutely incredible, the scope of a director who can follow up the cramped quarters &amp; pent-up energies of "One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest," with the explosion of the psychedelic generation in "Hair." But Milos Forman accomplished just that.Forman imbues this movie musical with distinctive touches all his own: particularly the dizzying 360-degree spin around the lead singer in the opening "Age Of Aquarius" number; the endearing comedy of the "Black Boys/White Boys" number; protagonist Bukowski's drug initiation in the extended "Hare Krishna" number; and (my very favorite) the unexplainable warmth and human celebration of the "Good Morning, Starshine" number (shot entirely in close-ups and medium shots, in a convertible car!). The emotional lift experienced when the camera finally trucks back from a group of characters we've come to know &amp; love, is beyond words.Twyla Tharp adds her renowned choreography to all songs; director Forman gave her a free rein on all of them.It'll be fascinating to many who've only been familiar with Treat Williams, John Savage &amp; Beverly D'Angelo through their subsequent work, that they're ALL terrific singers &amp; dancers!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not a big musical fan, but this is one of the few I really love. Unlike many other musicals, such as "The Sound of Music," none of the songs are about gratuitous stuff. Each song is social commentary, acumen on war, sexuality, recalcitrance, spirituality, and freedom. Especially amazing songs are "Easy To Be Hard," "Age of Aquarius," "Hair," "Flesh Failures/3-5-0-0," "Walking In Space," and "Hare Krishna." Totally revolutionary and wonderful. I can't wait to someday see it live!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't usually comment on movies that already have lots of reviews. But when I read through the reviews written by viewers who didn't like Hair I felt that my disenchantment with the film was a bit different from that expressed by other people. I saw the original stage production when I was very young, and grew up listening to the lp, from age 5 to 15. I loved Hair, both the music and the story. And when the movie first came out I saw it. I didn't like it. Now, 25 years later I have tried to watch it again, thinking that with the passage of time, Hair the Movie might have qualities I didn't notice then. No. That is not the case. If you like The Wiz then Hair the Movie might be up your alley. But if you are expecting it to let the spirit of the songs and story emerge, forget it. Watch the original Jesus Christ Superstar or watch a movie made in the 60s or early 70s, like a Cassavettes or Jodorowksy movie (or anything). But I'll try to tell you why Hair the Movie is such a disappointment.Several reviewers have complained that the movie is dated. I agree - but it is dated, not because it is about the 60s, but because it is about the late-70s. Watch Micheal Jackson's Thriller and you'll have pretty much seen the "authentic" 60s dance sequences. Tharp or no Tharp. Make-up, coifs, clothes, jewelry, all remind me of the cheesy late disco/early New Wave style.The producers went out of their way to flatten the significance of the songs. We can still hear the taboo words, but gone is their force, and gone are the dark insinuations the writers made about a society torn apart by racial hatred, economic inequality, and confusion over a war we were fighting for murky reasons. Hair the Play asked questions like: what does it mean to die for your country? what does it mean to be free? what does it mean to be hated? what does it mean to love? Hair the Movie doesn't ask anything. It shows us some stock characters, with easily identifiable clichéd qualities, and runs them through a predictable story. At least one reviewer complained that Hair is about a bunch of drug taking hippies, etc. etc. Sadly, that is exactly what this movie is about - cheerful, vacuous, stereotyped characters. Hair the Movie is not about humans struggling with hate, death, love; struggling with their own values and those of their families, friends, and people who they may never know but who they are told to hate. In fifty years, film critics may look back on Hair the Movie and be able to say something interesting about the fetish of the 60s, the shallowness of the late-70s, or something. For now, this movie sucks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A musical, and a great one at that</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Claude, a country boy with a solid sense of duty, is drafted and meets Berger, his hippie family and a beautiful rich girl on his way to join the army. Berger decides to show Claude the easier side of life and to help him win the love of the girl. Quite a lot of material for any movie to explore. However, this is a musical so Milos Forman wisely avoids going too deeply into the underlying subjects (hippie &amp; antiwar movement, free love, civil rights movement, rich/poor, love/duty etc.) It is all part of the musical, but sometimes only hinted at. Instead he concentrates on giving us the feelings of the era in a brilliant, enchanting and engaging story accentuated by fantastic music.The movie is so powerful that I find it hard to watch Hair, not wishing I was a part of Bergers hippie family. However, as I'm old enough to have caught the edge of the hippie era, I know there was a dark side to it too, so in reality I'd never wish to be a part of it.If you're the kind of movie fan who watches for details, accuracy and a complete picture, then you're probably better of with another movie. But if you want a warm movie with the 60's feel, lots of great music even if plot and characters sometimes get a bit sketchy, then this is the one for you. Pay attention to the beginning of the movie and then when the song Aquarius begins, you can lean back and just let the movie engulf you. Consider buying this one, as you'll probably want to see it again and again... and again !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a fun movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was one of my favorite musicals, so free, so sweet, and just plain fun! I was only 14 when I first saw this movie in the theater in 1979, and just recently bought the DVD, and now my 15 year old and my 10 year old love it! the music is wonderful, the actors, I even thought sang great, Treat Williams was fabulous as the leader of the tribe, Berger, and his scene with him dancing on the table singing "I Got Life" was one of the best scenes in it, sure there is a few butt and boob scenes, nothing X-rated, no sex scenes or anything, but aside from that and me telling the girls to close their eyes, they keep watching this movie over and over and over.But this movie made me want to see Treat Williams in almost everything, he was charming, and brilliant, as was the rest of the cast, Beverly singing "Good Morning Sunshine" was also really good, and Cheryl Barnes rendition of "Easy to be Hard" was beautiful, it is too bad she stopped acting after this movie, she was very talented, yet just wasn't interested in being in any more movies.. and she was actually a hotel maid while she auditioned for this role! I recommend to anyone who is a fan of the 60's and just want to watch something fun! I remember when I was 14 and watching, the face of Treat Williams as Berger getting on that plane singing his part of "I believe in Claude, that's me" stuck with me for a long time! it still makes me bawl, I will never forget his face getting on that plane. Makes my heart beat faster each time I see that scene..And from what I read, the part where John Savage is running to the plane, and saying "Berger"...as we see the plane in the air, is actually Treat Williams flying that plane, as they had no other pilot on the set that day, and Treat has a pilot's license. :)Sure, it was weird the first couple times I seen it, but for some reason, I still loved it..and still do!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Never thought I'd be so entertained and provoked to thought by a "juvenile" musical. Treat Williams and Co. Milos Forman's astute and witty direction and Twyla Tharpe's choreography had me rolling in the aisles in fits and starts. Fresh visuals (the dancing horses were "far out" and "groovy"), the juxtaposition of the hippy kids and the rich "broads" in the park and at the party (especially the table top routine by Williams where some of the older supposedly "uptight" gals) enjoyed the boy a lot. It was a circus of characters all working separately and together to send out some multicolored "vibes" that mixed with the "smoke" and brought you into the "sky with diamonds." No way could the stage production have compared (I didn't see it, but I can just hear the thud of bare feet and smell the sweat of naked (definitiely not a minus, though) bodies. Jaime humbly awards this picture an 8.</fullReview>

And I guess this spiritual state is desperately needed and missing in the former country of liberty. Well, the line is at least being kept by films like Point break, although the music is the best part of Hair (have you listened to more oldies than the Beatles' ones and the Hair ones?).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>in-your-face theatrics of the period- and of the split between rigid organization and rebellion- and a wondrously filmed musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hair, at its best, has the same directorial energy that made Milos Forman's previous work, One Flew Over the Cuckcoo's Nest, and like that film it reflects quite well the tensions of a period. This time with more at stake with sex, race, war, the bourgeois, drugs, and all done to some of the most popping pop songs one could ever hear on a musical stage. In the translation from stage to screen Forman transforms the story of Bukowski from out in Oklahoma coming to New York City for two days before heading out to the army on draft into something that is too joyous to be full on farce or parody, yet with some of the stinging satire underneath like in much of his best work. It's a vibrant and alive work, even in the songs that, personally, didn't quite make it as far as being very memorable, and it's not too hard to see why it's admired a lot by musical fans today.The songs veer between real hair-raising (some pun intended) and heart-rending, cheerfully outrageous and almost in the fold of classic 50s musicals. I liked the little wink and nod during certain songs (the names spouted during Sodomy and Colored Spade), the vocal force in Easy to be Hard, Old Fashioned Melody, and the bravado in I Got a Life, the title song, Going Down and the opening and closing numbers. Forman also has the good sense to not populate his film with many real stars- more so they're up and comers, people one might see soon get some fame (Beverly D'Angelo and Treat Williams), particularly in having the quiet, reserved, and soon "freed" Bukowski with John Savage, who has a true fresh off-the-bus quality for the part.The spirits are high for a lot of it, with an interesting contrast formed from time to time about the opposing stubbornness on both sides (the little arguments that Berger has with authority figures), that leads to the more 'heavy' topics raised throughout. Some are, naturally, banged over the head- and I mean that almost as something of a compliment in this context- in class breaks and bonds and free love, et all. It's not exactly subversive as it could be, but then again Forman's ambitions aren't to make a totally definitive statement on the period, per-say, as there is a lot of the little drama and characters as in any musical-tragic/comedy, but at the same time there is a course taken to prevent any sappy nostalgia.It's as good as a Hair musical-movie can be (with a PG rating anyway, though for its period it got away with more than it would today with the rating), which means that it's very good, near great in-fact (some scenes are actually very great, or just in a weird level where you can't quite believe you're seeing, then accept it a few seconds later, and laugh).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Timing is everything</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This smash stage hit took ten years to reach the big screen and that spelled doom -- it died big at the box office. In '79, Vietnam was five years over, the original hippies were pushing middle age and gone mainstream, students had nothing to protest even if they wanted to, disco and punk were the rage. There was no audience for this film. I wore the grooves out of the Broadway cast album as a high school student in the late '60s but had zero interest in seeing the movie when released.About eight years ago I finally rented the video and was staggered by how fresh and full of life it was. I'm not alone. Bruce Williamson, the former longtime A-list critic for Playboy and current professor of film studies at Columbia University, has for years screened "Hair" for his students and loves the reaction it always gets: the college kids rave and can't believe how, for most of them, they hadn't even known it existed. In today's suffocating politically correct environment, this movie could never get made. The songs "Sodomy," "I'm Black" and the hilarious "Black Boys/White Boys" would bring more than a few advocacy groups out of the woodwork. The original score spawned an amazing five hit singles with "Hair," "Aquarius," "Good Morning Starshine," "Let the Sunshine In" and "Easy to be Hard" (the last powerfully performed by Cheryl Barnes in the film). For me the true test of a film is, did I care about anyone? Here, I cared about all of the characters I was supposed to.I watched the DVD the other day and, as the U.S. readies for battle with Iraq, its anti-war message resonates anew. If there was ever a timely moment to see "Hair," it's now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although it is not like the musical, the movie HAIR is beautifully done. I understand a lot of people were disappointed that many of the characters were altered and the plot was different, but what did they expect? The original musical didn't even have a plot, it didn't need one. However, as a movie, HAIR definately needed a plot to keep the audience interested, and I think that Milos Forman did a great job with it. No other director could have done better. It was his interpretation of the original musical and that era and I don't believe the movie deserves so much criticism. The acting and singing was excellent, especially John Savage, Treat Williams, Annie Golden, and Beverly D'Angelo. Her performance of "Good Morning Starshine" was beautiful, as well as Cheryl Barnes' performance of "Easy to be Hard." The acting in this movie was simple and realistic, never overdone. The choreography by Twila Tharp was amazing. The whole movie was very energetic and lively. I also disagree with what some people are saying about its rating of PG. I think this is an acceptable rating because the nudity is not meant to be sexual or erotic. It's supposed to represent the youth and innocence of these children. A rating of R would make the movie out to be scandalous, which it is not. It's a beautiful story, both in the musical form and the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not just a musical, but a strong, poignant bitter-sweet movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Hair was released in 1979, I told myself: `You really love each song of the musical, and now it's adapted for the screen by one of your favorite film-maker. So hurry up! The show starts in twenty minutes!' That afternoon, I saw what I consider one of the best movies ever made. Everything is just perfect in it. The casting, the choregraphy, the screenplay, the mise en sc?ne. Although the film depicts a period very limited in time (the end of the sixties and the Hippie movement), its message is universal. Hair, the film, is about the meanness of the riches, the absurdity of war, the naivety (and selfishness) of the youth and the power of love. The main quality of this film is that it leads you where you don't expect to go. Each scene is an amazement. Even after seeing it over and over, I'm still surprised by its originality. The funny number called `White Boys/Black Boys' that is sung jointly by trios of girls and army officers, is a pure jewel of sexual ambiguity. This uses beautifully the elliptical editing. A good example of this being the scene that shows Claude in his barrack's bed writing a letter to Sheila and then, cut to Sheila running to show the letter to Berger and his gang. And what can I add that hasn't been told about the poignant final scene? It summarizes the genius of this bitter-sweet film that makes you laugh and cry, that is both charming and revolting, just like all the other Milos Forman's movies. Summing up, it's a great film, one of those we can discuss endlessly</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Tooby ooby wala/nooby aba naba/early morning singing song..."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Butler's Broadway musical "Hair" from 1967 was an unqualified success which spawned pop-oriented hit singles from its score. Milos Forman's movie version was critically-acclaimed (Roger Ebert named it the best film of the year), but it looked out of place in 1979. With disco fading and punk rock and New Wave moving in, not many moviegoers were interested in harking back to "The Age of Aquarius". A pity, since Forman's movie shows that there was something deeper and more meaningful to the show than what was initially publicized (the hippies, the nudity, etc.). A straight-arrow on his way into the Army is befriended by a gang of free-living, free-loving young people; their leader, a rebellious, incredulous sort who doesn't understand the purpose of (or need for) authority, tries to open his new friend's mind. Forman doesn't shape individual scenes to get an impact--he's always looking at the big picture. This approach backfires in regards to some of the musical numbers, which either aren't well edited ("Hair"), feel incongruous ("Black Boys/White Boys"), or don't seem to have a great deal of relevancy ("Walking in Space"). Screenwriter Michael Weller occasionally pushes everyone aside in order to invent new dramatic situations, which leaves the middle portion of the film feeling a little draggy. Still, the cast (albeit a much older group of actors than one might hope for) is solid, and the film's art direction is uncannily accurate. The LSD/wedding-fantasy sequence misfires, and the anti-war performance piece held near the Washington Monument fails to make much of an impression. Yet the tricky irony of the finale is rather well-done, and when a musical moment is welcomed (such as "Good Morning Starshine"), it can work brilliantly. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie when I was 17, back in 1980, when it was first exhibited in Rio de Janeiro, where I used to live. Well, I grew up, moved to another town (Brasilia), had two children, my kids grew up and they always listened to my comments about "Hair". Now I am 42 and this year (2006), at last, "Hair" was released on DVD. I immediately bought it and played at home, with my wife, Fernanda, and kids (Arthur, 17, and Maria Clara, 15), after telling them they should get back in time and imagine they were in the sixties, to completely understand the film. They simply loved it. Soon after, I bought the soundtrack in CD. We can't stop listening to it. The songs are great and the movie really portraits the ideas of a time. Sex, drugs, freedom of expression, homosexuality in the Army, black people and white people, religion stuff, war, all wrapped up in a story that shows exactly what can happen when you decide to make your own rules... Things that up to now make us stop and think. After all, an incredible ending. A great movie with great songs and great actors!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>unsatisfying (spoilers contained)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(ONCE AGAIN SPOILERS CONTAINED FOR BOTH THE MOVIE AND SHOW)I am currently involved in a production of Hair as Claude Bukowski. I had never seen the movie before until after we started rehearsals. The movie is good in it's own right but bears NO resemblance to the show. The show tries to capture the 60's hippie life and is about Claude's journey to find himself (eventually dead in Vietnam). The movie is more like a comedy of errors and hardly sends through the message of peace and freedom through the way the show does. Whenever I hear the Broadway CD and I hear Let the Sunshine In I get really choked up, meanwhile when this occurred in the movie I could've care less since the characters are more cartoons then real people. The movie is also very 1979, not only in the way it looked but in the musical arrangements, all the songs were made into disco numbers. Some of the basic differences (VERY BASIC) from the show to the movie are that, in the show, Claude and Sheila are hippies, roomates with Berger and all three are part of a love triangle. Sheila is the head of their tribes war protests, they cut the role of Crissy who sings Frank Mills in the show, the expanded the role of Dionne (the smallest role in the show) to be Hud's wife. Hud is a small part in the show and he serves as someone to represent the civil rights movement in the 60's (which was completely taken out for the movie). Jeanie is obsessed with Claude and MAY be carrying his baby (the audience never finds out. Also only three songs in the movie version of Hair are sung by the same characters as in the show. They gave most of Claude's songs to Berger and made the movie about him. The movie is more a comedy of errors then an accurate representation of the 60's and the show in itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many people have raved about the film version of the acclaimed Broadway musical here on IMDb. That being said, I went in to watching this film with a very open mind. Having seen the play only a few nights before viewing the film, I couldn't wait to see the same amazing songs and the same poignant storyline done on the big screen.However, from the get-go I was rather disappointed. Not only was the story almost completely rewritten, important pieces were omitted and songs assigned to specific characters in the play were completely reassigned to other characters (with seemingly no rhyme or reason). I was especially disappointed in the representation of Hud. In the play he (and all the other characters) are harmless, peace loving hippies but this movie makes him an arrogant and absent father of a child who then proceeds to scream at and be abusive towards the mother of the child (two characters not even included in the play in the first place).Sadly, the vocal "chops" of the stars in the film just didn't match the caliber of the current Broadway cast either.Someone else said it very well in one of their reviews, this movie just did not capture the spirit and real message of the play for me. A lot of people scoff at the nude scene that is in the play, but it actually holds very important symbolism and in actuality, is a pivotal moment in the plot. Obviously at the time, a full nude scene was out of the question for films, but I think the issue could have still been dealt with in the movie in one way or another. I can also say that I can only imagine what a monumental task it had to be to turn a play that revolves around only one set and its cast of characters into a feature film, but it has been achieved successfully in the past and I think it still could have been done with this play as well. Some might say you have to separate the play and just appreciate it as a film, and that may be true. But for me personally, the play is such a gem and such an important political and historical artifact that it was just impossible to separate the two.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disgrace to the original musical -- shoddy cash-in</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So this movie itself isn't really that bad -- in a vacuum. However, it is pathetically terrible in comparison to the musical it's based, and it is a real disgrace to be called "Hair." It is absolutely nothing like the stage show whatsoever. And I'm not talking about re-arrangement of the tunes (which, yes, is there in spades), MAJOR changes of the characters (big time) or individual scenes. The whole vibe of the show is changed.The stage show Hair was pretty cutting-edge in its time. Yes, it made news and was notorious for the nude "be-in" scene, but that was just the flashy part (excuse the pun). Frankly, the stage show was basically just a conglomeration of a bunch of different songs, each expressing a different theme of the times, with only the loosest of thread of plot connecting them. In fact, I don't even think there was much of a plot of the musical -- it was basically a few days in the life of this group of friends ("tribal" group / cooperative of hippies / youth) which was I guess supposed to represent a microcosm of different types of people in society, singing songs to each other about major issues of the day, with each humorously acting out various parts (The Government, The Parents, The Capitalists, etc.) In fact, I remember there being only one or two different things happen in the show -- the group sings songs to each other, they go to the be-in, there is some major massive drug trip, there is a bust, and Claude decides to leave the group and go to war. Yes Claude. I don't remember the whole Berger/Claude mixup thing in the show. Of course, that whole goofy element of the gang going to visit Claude at the base wasn't in the stage show -- the entire show took place in I think one spot where the hippies all lived.The thing about the stage show which was so great, but which is so completely missing from the movie is a certain sense of formlessness, surrealism, abstraction / symbolism and defying of convention. To me that was the whole meaning behind "Hair" -- not any kind of cobbled-together story. While watching the show, you could never really tell whether something was "really happening" or whether it was just some sort of crazy symbolic allegory that one character was doing to prove some point to one of the other characters (or to the audience) or maybe just some random hallucination. There was a lot of ambiguity, and you were never really absolutely sure what was happening. Through the whole thing was sort of an underlying sense of dread and uncertainty, lurking underneath the happy hippy surface. A whole lot of social issues were addressed by the songs...which seems really missing from the music video-type delivery of the songs in the movie.The show, I think really tried to play with a lot of the (then) conventions of musical theater -- besides just using rock songs and electric guitars and starring hippies. The sets were stark and symbolic, the actors were originally not professional actors or singers, there was no real three-act structure, there was a lot of breaking down of the third wall -- characters talking to and singing directly to the audience, etc. In fact, one of the productions that I saw had the characters from the show sitting in seats and chatting with audience members before the show started -- when the music started playing, they all slowly started walking towards the stage and hopped up on to it.All this cool stuff and what makes hair "Hair" is wholly missing from the movie, which is nothing more than a straightforward attempt to make a conventional movie musical. Somebody decided that some sort of real story had to be written to link the songs together. Somebody decided to try and make it in a "realistic style" with no surrealistic elements (where are the jump-cuts, the time-slowing, the crazy-colors?) As a result, yes, all the songs are there, the characters are there, the "show" is there, but its not really "Hair." Besides, the whole re-tooling of the Claude character is annoying and takes away some real depth. In the show, Claude was always another one of the hippies, not some square outsider Okie that the tribe adopted for a couple of days. Claude represented an opposing philosophy in the group from Berger's. That way there was always a symbolic tension between the "Berger" way and the "Claude" way, that explained why some of the characters acted as they did and gave the audience two alternate ways of viewing the issues. That whole conflict exposed the irony that even within a group of supposedly love-all idyllic hippies there was an "us" vs. "them" element, that was the hallmark of the 70's. The movie jettisons that whole conflict and really does the themes of the show a disservice.And yes, the arrangements of the songs in the movie just about eliminates all of the "60s-edge" of the soundrack. The trippy, Cream-like electric guitars are neutered, the edges are smoothed so that the songs sound sanitized and there is too much consistency in the way the songs sound to one another. One of the revolutionary (for the time) things about the music in the original show was that it incorporated songs from so many different genres -- straight rock, country, gospel, etc. -- each used for different effect and in doing so, needed to sound quite different from each other. This again, is eliminated in the movie.So, in summary -- not a entirely bad movie in and of itself. The songs are fun. The problem is -- it's not "Hair." Instead, its really just an expensive toupee that hides a comb-over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the Broadway production of "Hair" in 1968 on a night when Diane Keaton was on stage. "Hair" really worked on Broadway (and no doubt in the earlier off-Broadway run as well). For one thing, it was a part of the 60's cultural movement itself. It was immediate and alive. A great production.I cannot say the same for the film, which was produced a decade later after the 60's were dead. There is really no similarity between the film and the musical stage play. Only the songs are the same. Yes, the songs and some of the performances in the film are good, but I certainly hope that the film's cast has had better platforms for their talents, because this film is a turkey, a real raspberry. It just doesn't pull it off. It does not recreate the 60's at all. If you want to see that, to see how people really dressed and danced and behaved in the 60's, watch the film "Woodstock" (director's cut or longer version) and also "Jimi Hendrix: Live at Woodstock", the 2 DVD set. The film "Hair" does pick up a bit at the end, but I don't know if it was worth all the cringing that led up to that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Hair DVD was my first viewing of this musical. Having heard many of the songs in my early adulthood, I was disappointed by the difference in the musical arrangements. The movie script had flaws, but there are good scenes: Berger asking his folks for money, and the scene cuts between basic training and the hippie group, for example. The irreverence of Berger reminded me of today's youth, with one hand out and a smart-ass retort to any authority.For me, the surprise ending upgraded this movie from average to good. I watched the last five minutes over and over. The symbolism of the lines of soldiers being sent through the gates of darkness to an unknown fate was moving.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Music and the anti-war feeling regarding Vietnam is marvelously staged in this 1979 film.Treat Williams is way-out and way-too-good as a hippie caught up in the period.The musical production numbers are marvelously staged in a film attempted to draw rebellious America with the establishment. I think that Damon Runyan would have had a ball with this excellent film.I wish that Charlotte Rae had had a speaking part in the film. When the hippie culture invades the well-off people's party, Rae as a guest of the elite, dances on the table thereby showing that she is willing and able to follow a different way of thinking as well as life.The integration of the army brass at the induction center participating in the singing is well done and shooting down the tower that produced the anti-establishment songs being sung over it were memorable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I honestly have never ever heard of this musical before! The song I only know is "Let the Sunshine In", which I've first heard on the radio and no I'm not an 80's kid but I think MTV got a chance to show it on the telly at one time. Anyways, my memories have faded on that notion, I actually enjoyed myself watching this the first time last night! There are words to describe this and that is:- quirky,stupid,funny, silly, and god knows, more I can't name out! The songs were catchy and easy to listen. However, I thought the story line was rather dull in some scenes. I think it would be easier if there was a narrator in the background and we could be able to find out whats going on. Maybe its just me, but I think its because every actor were hooping all over the place that it made it difficult to find out what the hell they are doing , and why they were doing it? It was very sad that Berger was killed at sea, I wish he didn't have to be killed off this musical. It would've made it more brighter in which the story actually isn't. Anyways nothing we can do about that!If you are a big fan of musicals like myself, give this a watch!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Politically &amp; Literally Incorrect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This might be one of the more over rated films on IMDb. For some reason this film was made with no connections to the original play. The 3 writers who worked on this do not have any really great work and 2 of them did no writing credits except the musical book on this film. That work is straight from a play with great music. The play was 1967 and this film is 12 years later. The writers who did work on the original play made changes in the plays characters which make little sense.That gap is an issue. While the film does keep the Vietnam Anti-War theme intact, though it really mentions it very little, it tries to take the hippie movement and make it mainstream in 1979. It was not even mainstream in 1967. Hippies were created by the media to influence a generation of teenagers to try and expand their horizons by tuning in a dropping out. While the media image has an iconic value, a lot of what is presented here is just incorrect.This is not your present Democratic view, as a lot of the music in this one is now considered politically incorrect by modern Democrats. In the 1967 it is not even right. Democrats in 1967 and 1968 were protesting Vietnam, but they were not accepting diversity as this movie portrays. About half the party was supporting George Wallace and segregation then and would continue to do so until Wallace was shot in 1972. Even after that modern Democrats would use racism to divide Americans, rich from poor. Hippies that existed were people who were liberated, which early on in this film is shown, but then there is little in common with these characters and what was the real world. Central Park in the 1960's was full of crime and muggers. They would have eaten these hippies in the park alive. Hippies were more of a reality on the West Coast as California had much less poverty in the 1960's. Cute though is the sequence with the police horses legs, and the other horsing around.The skinny dipping sequence is strange in that several people strip and go in the water, but only the last 2 people in actually come out of the water with their clothes having been stolen.The music is the best thing about this film, as several songs are now golden oldies from the era. The PC people must cringe though at the songs referring to Sodomy, Masterbation, White People, and Black People. The plot towards the end of the film of the Military swaps and road trip of the stolen car to get there are kind of absurd. So is the character whose extremely pregnant at the beginning of the movie and looks less so at the end of the film.This film should have a warning that it tries to reflect the 1960's reality, but instead creates a fantasy 1960's that has almost nothing to do with what was real then. There is only a little of the war protests, and no real peace movement stuff here.Once again, the 12 year gap here has created a movie that you have to try to accept as reality, but needs a reality check. Enjoy the music here and wish that the original message of the stage play survived.That message is not here, and is so removed now it might never be found.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember loving this movie so much I made rare, repeat visits to the theater to see it time and again.Viewing it today, through 59-year-old eyes, it's far less satisfying but remains interesting as a period piece.Here we have the story of some aimless, homeless teenagers who reject responsibility. They mainly prefer to hang together and stick it to the establishment. This all takes place against the backdrop of the Vietnam War, to which Oklahoma-born, clean-cut Claude (John Savage) is heading within days.The movie begins and ends on particularly strong notes. It's quite moving to see Claude say goodbye to his father in the mist of a country field."Just the smart people you got to worry about," Dad advises. "The Lord'll take care of the ignorant ones." This movie takes pleasure in using bawdy language and broaching topics that were less approachable decades ago, including homosexuality and harmony between the races. There's a truly bizarre scene in which a draft board makes a lot of gay-related insinuations. Huh? At any rate, our motley crew of hippies does all manner of offensive things that in the ethos of this film might be viewed as charmingly sticking-it-to-the-man. They challenge some debutantes riding horseback through Central Park, including Sheila (Beverly D'Angelo), crash a society party given by Sheila's family, and, in a stunningly scary scene that seems out-of-sync with the tenor of the rest of the movie, send one of their own -- Berger (Treat Williams) -- to impersonate Claude so the latter can steal some pre-deployment love moments with Sheila. The music in this film is wonderful, most especially the wistful tune "Where Do I Go?", a timeless song about finding meaning that will appeal to people of all generations.Some of the characterizations here are just plain dumb. Both Sheila and Jeannie (a perpetually gum-chewing Annie Golden) seem pathetically unintelligent and shallow. (There are also gratuitous shots of a topless Ms. D'Angelo.) This movie ends on a powerful note, as we watch columns of US soldiers march into their cargo plane for Vietnam. It's shattering to see the endless stretches of a military cemetery in the following frame.I'm glad I saw "Hair" again, but it left me less than satisfied. The world has changed in a myriad ways and we humans remain seriously divided and disturbed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just watched the movie Hair in TCM, for the first time since I saw after its original release. The musical was already past its prime when it was released in 1979 and Treat Williams was already a little old for the title role. What strikes me now is how well, sexist it is; the female characters are just appendages to the men. They're passive and soft-spoken and just go along with whatever the guys want. "Women's lib" was not on the agenda here. The draft and the war in Vietnam were the impetus for this film and that's what contemporary audiences reacted to.The movie, about a lovable group of ragtag hippies in Central Park has a frenetic quality to it; Milos Forman was the middle-aged director. This film isn't about the young as they were, it reflects Forman's middle-aged male longing for the energy and sexuality of youth. Living on the West Side at the time, I was struck that they cleaned up Central Park for the film. The park was in awful shape. You can see it in the film where the dust rises from the bare dirt in the Great Meadow during the "be-in." The eventual value of this film may lie in its documentary value because it was shot on location in late 1970s Manhattan,</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the play production of Hair shortly after the revival. I was pumped to see it was a movie. My first problem is they only used the parts of the play they wanted to. Killing Berger, while a change, was not needed. The original ending was fine. My biggest problem is I feel like this movie makes hippies out to be these terrible people. And they really aren't. My other problem is the wrong people are singing. Woof did NOT sing Hair in the play. It was Berger and Claude. There was a connection with the characters and the audience. You wanted to see what happened. It was weird and crazy and sad and inspiring. But this movie is poorly put together. I'd rather they just film a production of the stage play and sell it on DVD. That would be amazing. Don't waste your time. It isn't worth it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This IMO is the best anti-war movie that has ever been made. Because it is so full of LIFE! It shows how wonderful life can be! I don't care about the drugs or that typical 70th polygamy stuff but about all these warm hearted very modest people who care for each other. Who live their lifes - no matter what - with everything they have and are. So I've never seen a better approach for an anti-war movie. Usually it's all about watching people getting killed. Which - for me - is staying within the logic of war instead of showing what life can be...It is somehow a very simple and naive and moral look at things - but exactly because of that it is a very strong reminder of what makes life worth living.Not to mention how beautiful some songs have been performed - it is such a shame that Cheryl Barnes never tried to develop a career worthy of her incredible talent!This movie although the costumes are so very typical 70ig is timeless.Also - every time I watch it I get excited and even happy!</fullReview>

It invites you to understand the struggles of that time and how the "free love hippies" dealt with peace. It is a timeless message and one you cannot help but become attached to the destiny of each character. Treat Williams is phenomenal!!!!!! That boy can MOVE!! =) I think everyone should watch this and understand the belief of infusing peace not war. I think signing the message sends more of an impact and embraces the message in a gentle way. Because, even tho I did not live during this era, the world continues to struggle with using violence to solve it's problems. I think this movie is a delight to watch and evoke smiles, laughter, tears and so much more. The table dance scene is hysterically funny and the I GOT LIFE song shows we are all human.

		<fullReview>I remember i watched this movie some years ago and i didn't remember it except the ending. When i watched it a second time, it was like i discovered the movie. I liked the songs because they talk about many life things like equality between peoples of different colors, the real face of the war, sex and of course the hair. I was surprised as there is a song which talk about drugs. I don't think it was common in the 70's to talk about drugs like this. The movie has some boring scenes like when they take a bath in a river. The last twenty minutes help the film to be better because there is a kind of message about solidarity between friends and i think Milos Forman wanted to tell us as your friends are important and can help you. I remembered only the ending because it was very emotional and it's an ending as you can't forget.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the hospitable openness of New York City's Central Park, Milos Forman recreated HAIR along with it's anti-war hippie ness combated by a society that remained hardened and ironically untouched by the Summer of Love. Gardens can be beautiful but only when weeded and Twyla Thorpes' masterpiece of semi-free lance expressionistic dance needed some serious gardening, as it is a bit gangly. There are sequences that look like the actual on stage personas had not regenerated for the big screen as the drama outplays the musical. Treat Williams and John Savage cover their opposing dogmas both brilliantly and lovingly. I go hot and cold over the overall production when watching in parts, but when the flow of the whole film is uninterrupted, the agenda seems more periodic than suffocating. Overall, the musical numbers are hit or miss but the message reigns.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't really have much to say about Hair except that it made for quite a bizarre experience and yet it was engaging and enjoyable. It revels in its own chaos and craziness. Of course, very significantly, the music was very good and generally speaking, the way the musical scenes were staged was effective. Furthermore, some of the non-musical scenes were actually quite dramatic and affecting, probably because you care about the characters. There was very little exposition which makes for less boring parts. Probably the best thing about the movie I felt was the sense of freedom and rebellion it created. Perhaps the biggest weakness is that it didn't seem to have much of a focus at all.One nice "theme" that came up if you want to call it that was the idea that craziness is subjective; that everyone is crazy from someone's point of view. Of course, there was also the idea of freedom and of individuality which was nice as well. Although these weren't really explored at depth, they were certainly present and I thought one of the strengths of the movie was that it managed to establish a tone where it could change from ridiculously silly to relatively serious without falling apart. So, you can appreciate the movie for both its silliness and for any messages it might be conveying.So, anyway, I don't think Hair is a masterpiece in any way, but it is certainly worth a watch just for its crazy energy and originality. Just make sure you don't take any of it too literally.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I got hooked on "Hair" after seeing the play in Seattle earlier this year. The movie is quite a bit different from the play, mainly in that it adds more plot. Treat Williams is letter-perfect as the charismatic Berger, making you believe that he really can get whatever he wants. John Savage and Beverly D'Angelo are fine as Claude and Sheila, although their characters are rather bland compared with the same characters in the play. The score is very well-performed. Adding more of a plot for the movie may have been a good idea, but it seems unnecessary, and even seems to make the movie drag. Having Berger go to Vietnam in Claude's place is stretching the credulity a bit. But the impressive score and good performances make this fun to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I really enjoyed this fun filled musical.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hair is a musical made into a movie about late teens growing up in the sixties and dealing with issues such as; parents, the Vietnam War, and where they fit in socially. The movie is comical but also topical, so people are both entertained, and at the same time they are learning about a serious issue. This movie is different from most other war movies I have seen. Usually, in movies about war, the focus is on the actual combat and what the battles are like in war. In Hair there are no explosions, no blood and guts, but what is most important is what effect the war had on the people at home. Even though there is nothing being blown up, you still get a feel for the hardship and how painful the war was. So I think that by displaying war in a comical yet appropriate manner, is far superior to the display of carnage and drama typical in most war movies. I did not identify with one character in particular, but with them all in different ways. It was more the general picture that I identified with. The idea of teenagers growing up and dealing with complicated issues on their own. I feel the same way that it is hard to be independent and at the same time feel like you're making the right decisions. I am in a situation far different from the characters in Hair because I am not doing everything on my own and living in the streets of a big city. But I am dealing with the same issues of discovering where I fit in and what I want to do with my life at this point. The film is trying to get across that teens can have a voice too and that being a teen is not easy. The teens in the movie are radical and a little extreme. I don't think the majority of teens act as freely and as independently as the characters of Hair, but you get the general idea that being a teenager inherently means more the acquisition of more freedom, and it's your choice how you use your independence. At the time of the Vietnam War, teenagers did act more independently than they do now, and that there was more freedom then for teens then now in some ways.Even though small minorities of today's teens are hippies, most of the ideas and concepts about being a teen that are represented in the movie are still relevant in today's youth culture. This movie did a good job of capturing teen life and the hardships of freedom that were associated with being a teen during the Vietnam War. I think most of the ideas presented in Hair about being a teen are cross-generational and the youth of America will always be able to relate. I really enjoyed this film and I recommend it to all, especially those who are coping with the crossroads of adulthood. There is a great soundtrack and the characters are quite amusing as well. If you don't like musicals I recommend that while you're watching, try to look beyond the musical part, because you might see yourself and the crises of today's youth ingrained in the message of youth culture in the 1960's, embodied in the excellent movie, Hair.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Have you not seen the stage version on Hair ? Seen it and loved it ? In any case run down to your local video store and rent it.Few plays have ever been transferred to the big screen with such success, and it's a must see.The plot: It's the 70s, and America is on the verge of intervention in the Vietnam conflict. Claude, a cornfed, true blue American country boy leaves his parent's farm to join the army, and pays a visit to NY, where he meets a group of hippies. He is introduced to a world, a way of thinking and of living which are completely alien to him. At the same time he meets the woman of his dreams at the opposite end of the social scale, a rich young girl. As Claude becomes closer and closer to the group of free-thinkers, they will in turn show him the true nature of love and friendship, with... quite unexpected consequences.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad, but I wish I could have seen the play!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hair was a film directed by 2-time Oscar winning director Milos Forman, at the time, the musical film was having a resurgence in Hollywood. John Travolta's two musicals (Saturday Night Fever &amp; Grease) were still fresh in the minds of the public. So they decided to do a film version of the controversial play.Hair is the story of a man who is planning to enlist in the army to go to Vietnam, but is waylaid by hippies who are trying to change his mind, as well as enlist him and others in their "commune". Sadly, all the hippies have to deal with personal problems, and it all comes to a head.The music and dance numbers in "Hair" are spectacular. All the great songs from the play are there, my favorite being the title track. However, when the non-musical scenes come in, the film ccccrrrrraaawlllls. It is so slow going, even though the acting is decent. This is an inconsistent film. This film probably is better to watch on DVD or VHS instead of on T.V., just to speed things up.And yes, although the movie is rated PG, it would be more of a PG-13, or considering the types running the MPAA, an R due to content.</fullReview>

I am disappointed that so many people have put-down this movie without fully understanding it. Yes, it is alot different from the play, but that doesn't mean it was a bad movie.The thing I like the most about this movie BESIDES the music and dancing is the characters. I love everything about them. Their distinct personalities to their looks. Who doesn't love Woof's (Donnie Dacus) long, blonde hair?While I'm not going to go into details about the Film's plot, I would recommend either purchasing or renting it on DVD rather than VHS.

		<fullReview>My grade 12 drama class did a 25 minute long version of Hair. We were trying to capture the of the 1960's. There is no way we can make a serious storyline. Only a couple of people in the class had stared in musical productions, I was not one of them. I played Claude Bukowski I only had to sing during one song which Manchester England. The first performance was good, the second wasn't so good, the last performance kind of suck. Oh well were not professional actors like the actors in the Hair movie. The film version had all the songs from the original Broadway production. I payed attention to the movie and I did enjoy it. The movie can keep you interested and entertains. The plot is good for a musical, it has good story about Claude going off to war before that meeting Berger and the tribe, falling in love with Sheila and what happens at the end of the movie. (I like as little as possible so I don't spoil things.) I thought that Hair was better then that movie Grease. Despite the fact I got to see John Travolta sing a number of times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Claude Hooper Bukowski (John Savage) leaves his Oklahoma family farm to go to NYC. He's a draftee ready to go to the Vietnam War. He encounters a group of hippie led by George Berger (Treat Williams). Sheila Franklin (Beverly D'Angelo) is from the stiff upper class riding a horse in Central Park. Claude is enticed by the free-spirited hippies. They crash Sheila's coming out party. Sheila and Claude fall in love with a lot of help from George. Eventually Claude goes to training in Nevada followed by Berger, Sheila and the hippies.This has a few iconic songs. The movie takes too much time in Central Park at the beginning. Treat Williams is great but the movie meanders. The cinematic style from Milos Forman is pretty weak. It's probably a much better musical play than a movie. The hippies aren't necessarily portrayed in the most positive light. There are some pretty harsh digs. The movie also feels dated without being a period piece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Something had to change in the translation of the hit cult musical "Hair" from stage to screen, and the producers made the right decisions in slightly altering the story to suit the needs for the movie version. The original musical is a vaudeville like story of a group of New York hippies protesting the war in Vietnam while keeping their joy alive under the influence of various chemical substances. Each character's politics are described through their moments in the spotlight, and a slight storyline brings them all together in a common goal-to have peace to guide the planets and find love while steering the stars.For the movie, however, it had to be more grounded down to have a plot, and it surrounds two completely different men-country bumpkin John Savage (in New York to answer his draft notice) and long-time hippie Treat Williams. Hippy meets hick, hippie helps hick get laid, hick still goes off to war, and hippie gets hick and chick back together. There's comedy, music, protest, lots of LSD, and ultimately tragedy. Under the direction of Oscar winning director Milos Foreman, "Hair" ends up being an unforgettable movie. The wonderful Beverly D'Angelo is the lovely débutante who goes from Park Avenue to Bethesda Terrace and gives draftee Savage a beautiful night before he goes off to war. Annie Golden is also very good as the hippie who isn't sure if the black Hud or the blonde Wolf is the father of her baby.Some of the show's most memorable songs, all now standards, include "Aquarius", "Good Morning Starshine", and "Let the Sunshine In". Vaudeville type musical numbers include the dirty but amusing "Sodomy", the hippie anthem "Ain't Got No", the mixed race show-stopper "Black Boys/White Boys" (in which both male and females sing of their attraction to men of the opposite race), and the very moving "Easy to Be Hard", sung by Hud's long-suffering wife (Cheryl Barnes). The last quarter gets more political and serious, with the very sad "Walking Through Space" expressing the sorrow of an innocent Vietnamese woman.Some memorable faces in cameos or walk-ons include Melba Moore, Charlotte Rae, a very svelte Nell Carter, and future sitcom star Michael Jeter (as a draftee with an amusing secret). Some critics felt the film was a ghost story with its look at life only a decade before, but when a Broadway revival 30 years later proved to be a smash hit, those critics were proved wrong. Some ghost story, right?</fullReview>

The filmmakers do a good job of making a coherent plot out of a stage show that was not so, but the characters are one-dimensional and it is very much a product of its time. Despite the shortcomings, the film works because of the music, highlighted by "Aquarius," "Manchester, England," the hilarious "Black Boys"/"White Boys," the beautiful "Easy to be Hard," and the title song. Forman infuses the film with energy and Tharp provides the invigorating choreography. The "Flesh Failures (Let the Sun Shine In)" finale packs a punch. Williams is terrific.</fullReview>

This movie I believe is still relevant up to our recent useless war and other prevalent issues. The social commentary still seems to resonate with our current issues. The only difference I see is that people have lost the ability to see the big picture. Our society only seems to care about the me me me aspect, which really in my eyes puts the 90's to shame. this movie reminds me that life is worth the efforts we put into it, love and freedom mean more than 401's and the like.

		<shortDescription>A cult film that can still teach us a lesson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a cult film for many reasons. First because of the phenomenal success as a musical both in Broadway and London, then as a musical film. The film is close to the play and some of the provocation of the play is no longer provocative twelve years later. The discourse against the Vietnam war is no longer a protest song against the war itself, but a strong song demonstrating how the young people of these late 60s managed to bring the political establishment down. Milos Forman play with some situations at the end of the 70s like the narrow minded justice, the self-centered umbilical righteousness of the rich or of the little ones who have just one rank of power more than the powerless. He also heavily plays with the racial element and the sexual ambiguity he builds all the time. The film remains pleasant and thoughtful. And of course it is a tremendous thrill to remember these years when we have had the privilege, and that was not a chance, to live them. November 11, 1969, Nixon ordering mass celebration for the 1918 armistice, which became the order for teachers at all levels to take their students to the celebration and the march, supporting thus the invasion of Cambodia that was in full swing. And some dare give lessons in democracy to foreign countries. I also remember the long campaign for the impeachment of Nixon in 1973-1974 that will eventually lead to his resignation and the swearing in of Gerald Ford, the first Vice President, and eventually President, of the US who had not been elected, since he was appointed Vice President by the Senate after Spiro Agnew had to resign to face trial, conviction and sentence for embezzlement. Of course that makes us think of today when in 2000 a president of the US was not elected by the people but by the Supreme Court, or of a war that was rejected by millions world wide from the very start, and even before the start, and was started against the better judgment of the United Nations and of three permanent members of the Security Council. And some speak of a new world order based on the respect of others. Modern Western man seems to have some problems understanding that the world is changing and has already widely and wisely changed. Modern Western man seems to be kind of out of sync and to need special evening classes to learn that democracy wants the majority in the world to be the majority, and the West is far from that majority, and that if the Soviet block had been able to understand that market economy is not capitalism but that market economy can be either socialist or capitalist the Berlin Wall would have fallen, but the other way round, and that China has learned that lesson marvelously well and is at the foot of the wall they have to climb over to learn that their socialist market economy has to lead to political democracy, but they will, just like Vietnam was able to reconstruct itself after thirty years of vicious war aggression and damage. In other words, Hair is a perfect food for thought.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne &amp; University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Milos Forman took the music of Hair, but kept very little of the story line. I was expecting that he does something else, he is after all an artist and an important creator by his own. The result is however somehow disappointing.All the message of the 60s is sanitized and filtered through the style of a musical made at the end of the 70s. Sure this is not a bad musical at all, actually is one of the most palatable in this genre which is not my preferred. The music is certainly fantastic and all hits are in place. Yet, whoever lived the period and remembers what 'Hair' was in a time of rebellion and controversy cannot be but somehow unhappy with this film which is nicely made, but lacks the flame and the spirit of the original creation.</fullReview>

Several songs were big hits. Berger and his hippie friends revel in peace and love. They take on a young soldier and drive west to see him. We envy their freedom as they drive through the desert singing "Good Morning, Starshine." Berger takes the soldier's place on the base so he can have time with his girl. He is whisked away to Vietnam and killed. We are shown his grave in a veterans cemetery. The mindlessness of Vietnam is driven home in the most powerful anti-war piece ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the five best movie musicals.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the great mistakes in commenting on HAIR has been to judge it as a "statement" or a portrait of an era. This is particularly so when the verdict is that it's a period piece whose time has passed. That approach is as misplaced as judging MY FAIR LADY or THE MUSIC MAN on the validity of their depiction of their social eras. HAIR is hugely, constantly vivacious (never more so than when Treat Williams is on the screen), immensely inventive in its presentation of the songs -- often ingeniously blending four or five scenes into one seven or eight minute piece -- and the music itself is seizing. For me, perhaps the best movie musical of all was CABARET, but even it did not equal Forman's imagination in his creation of the music scenes. And Twyla Tharp's choreography is as uniquely her own as Fosse's ever was his own.(Many films have moving after-stories, but few are more memorable than this: Cheryl Barnes was a hotel maid when she was asked to audition for the part of Hud's former girl friend with their child. Her solo was astonishing. But after the final shooting in a Nevada (?) location, she never left town. I believe she went to work in a restaurant there, and dropped out of show business forever.)</fullReview>

I love Treat Williams and Beverly D'Angelo, but it seems lacking. It's what I would call a good "starter film," in that it introduces you to the content, but really doesn't actually show just how shocking this musical really was when it was first shown on Broadway.

		<shortDescription>This film STILL gets to me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just came home from a special showing of "Hair" in NY. But first a little history:I saw this film when i was 18, (a pivotal time of life to watch this film) when it was first released in spring of 1979. Knowing the history of the groundbreaking stage show, but never seeing it, i was interested to see that the movie critics were near unanimous about how good this film was (and still is...the mark of true film classics) and really liking film musicals but aware they're just not filmed as much as they should be...i set out to see the film within its first month.Knowing it takes place a lot in Central Park, I walked with some friends through it before seeing it at the large Ziegfeld movie theater, then and now, one of the few single screen theaters in Manhattan. Once the film began...seeing Central Park again after having just walked through in on a lovely spring afternoon...made me connect with the film strongly.As the critics said, it was a more plot-driven story than the stage show, with dazzling choreography, editing, and acting. I was simply blown away by it. (I painted a denim jacket duplicating the original poster art!) Through the years, i turn on people to this film (no pun intended), and every single one of them says "That was a GREAT film!" Even meeting and getting to know Annie Golden, who plays Jeannie in the film, was fruit borne by this movie. (She invited me to see her last "Cheers" episode, she did four of them as Cliff's girlfriend.) And yeah, she is cute and tough, like in the film.I've met Michael Weller too, praising him on his screenplay (note to other IMDBers...Milos Forman did not write the script, you gotta give Michael Weller his props). And i asked him and Milos Forman at a DGA screening whether there are deleted musical segments...the soundtrack album has Charlotte Rae singing "My Conviction" and someone else singing "Frank Mills". I believe they said yes. Can someone say "future DVD extras??" But Milos still was the driving force behind this film, and God love him. The film still gets to me. Like tonight:I just came from a free outdoor showing IN CENTRAL PARK of the film. Twyla Tharp, the great choreographer for the film, gave the introduction, saying that Milos loved the park once he got successful with "...Cuckoo's Nest", so i wonder if he prodded Michael Weller to write the script that he did, with so much Central Park in it. And earlier in the glorious sunshine, i walked just down the hill from where the film was later shown, and i saw the bandshell where Berger and Claude wake up, and the steps-and-tunnel where the songs "Manchester, England", "Colored Spade" and "Ain't Got No" were shot. I can't think of a more perfect place to see this film. (It was a pristine print!)Lastly (y'all still with me?), the film choked me up all over again. Maybe it was the location of Central Park at dusk. Maybe it's because we're in a questionable war situation again. But i gotta say: the creativity in this film, where most of the songs give me a high each time i see their film segments, to just the touching way these characters from 3 different backgrounds (urban hippies, cowboy, and rich debutante) can form an incredible friendship, to the "Tale of Two Cities"/"Star Trek 2: Wrath of Khan" ending, where one gives his life for another...what's not to get choked up about? Throw in that last shot of the "Let The Sunshine In" chorus swelling and the film freezes into sepia history......I'll never stop recommending this film. It's timeless, about a period in time. It's entertaining. It's thought-provoking. It's never dull. (I know: some people disagree. But ten minutes after any part of this film, you're in a different moment.)So keep spreading the word, folks. Just like the young woman who came with me and having seen it for the first time, LOVED it tonight...like all true classics, it'll sadden and delight people for years to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The growth of Hair</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Filmed in 1979 and based on a theatrical version from the previous decade, Hair uses the cinema to capture the spirit of the 1960's and allowed future generations to appreciate the vivacity of the era. Set in the late 60's in Central Park, the film tells a tale of a tribe of free-spirited youths in a turbulent time of war, Cultural Revolution, and sexual ambiguity. During their journey they meet a young man who changes the tribe and himself by opening each other's eyes to a new way of life. In the beginning, the tribe consists of three hippie men and one woman. It becomes apparent early on that George Berger (the handsome Treat Williams) acts as ringleader and directs the group through their carefree lifestyle. He personified the hippie counterculture through his rebellion against old traditions and authority figures. Upon meeting Claude, a newcomer to New York City and the Movement, Berger immediately takes him under his wing and teaches him the ways of the hippie culture. While this is occurring, Claude becomes intimate with the whole tribe as well as their newest member, Sheila, the suburban pristine debutante who gets caught up in their adventure. Determined to change Claude's decision to enter the army, the tribe sets out to show him what being young is really about.Each character represents a new idea of that generation and helps Claude absorb it. Jeanie, the single pregnant female of the group, represents the free love sentiment and the new acceptance of interracial relations. Hud, a possible father of the child and the lone black member of the group, furthers the message of the need for a colorblind society. Woof, the possible white father of the child, displayed gender ambiguity and was the quintessential youth due to his flashy ladylike long hair. Sheila, the newest member of the tribe and Claude and Berger's love interest, depicts how the culture has expanded beyond the class barriers. Together this diverse group defines the generation. This movie can still be considered controversial in the year 2001. As children of the 1980's, who were not even alive for this era, we found Hair eye-opening and shocking, but also a movie we could relate to. The incorporation of the musical numbers into the storyline engulfs you into the spirit of the 60's. The directors, choreographers, and screenwriters created a film that jumps off the screen and into your heart. Since its release, Hair has grown to capture audiences young and old. The movie's message of glorification of life remains timeless. So `Let the Sunshine In!'</fullReview>

Here we have a look at 60s antiwar and antiestablishment feelings in the post-Watergate era.So the great music from the original gets a new setting. Lending visual flair to numbers like "The Age of Aquarius" is provided by the choreography of Twyla Tharp. (Ms Tharp also makes a brief appearance in the film as a high priestess) How she managed to get those horses to dance, though, is anyones guess!So that's why this film was one of the first DVDs I got. If I ever feel blue, I just put on "I've Got Life". The sight of Treat Williams dancing on that dinner table picks me right up again.Eight stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie Musical, Better Stage Musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the catch: if you fell in love with this musical by seeing it on the stage first, you won't enjoy the movie version as much. I did this (and am thankful), but something just didn't click with me during the movie. First of all, there are differences. I won't give away the ending but, the ending of the movie is COMPLETELY different from the stage version. Beverly D'Angelo is great and so is a very young Treat Williams. This is a fine movie, but PLEASE, if you ever have the chance... SEE IT ON THE STAGE!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Take a lot of great songs, add up some exciting choreography, and mix this with very good acting and lots of humor, and what you get is: Hair!The plot of this movie isn't very special, but that really doesn't matter. There's so much else to enjoy. Listen to the fantastic soundtrack, to songs like "Walking in Space" and "The Flesh Failures". And pay special attention when the first song "Aquarius" is sung. What a great voice this woman has (and I don't even know her name!). Another absolute musical highlight is Cheryl Barnes' performance of "Easy to be Hard". Listen how this woman accuses people who don't seem to care about others, at first she's sad and modest, but later on she gets more passionate and powerful. Experience her cry for real friendship.And watch those thrilling, marvellous choreographed dances, performed by a group of fantastic dancers. Even the policehorses join in, during "Aquarius"! The choreography of "White Boys" is exhilarating, don't miss it!Treat Williams is responsible for another fantastic moment, when he astonishes everyone as he starts dancing on the table at the rich people's party. I adored how he played Berger, the charismatic leader of the hippies. The other hippies, Don Dacus, Dorsey Wright and Annie Golden, were very good as well. I especially liked Annie Golden, she made pregnant Jeannie such a lovable, kind-hearted girl. I saw two different versions of the 30th anniversary-play on stage, but the two Jeannies I saw there didn't even come close to Annie Golden's performance.Casting John Savage as the shy farmboy who came to New York and became friends with the hippies, was another perfect choice. Through his eyes, you see and feel how close disapproval and attraction lie together. Berger and his friends do everything he believes is wrong, and yet part of him wants to join them. Savage plays Claude exactly right, it couldn't have been done better.Hair can't beat my favorite musicals "Singin' in the Rain" and "West Side Story", whom I both voted 10 out of 10 for. But it does come close: for Hair I voted a well-deserved 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was never going to be easy adapting a stage production with such a colourful history to the screen, and the great director Milos Forman received his fair share of criticism when "Hair" was released in 1979. On reflection the criticism may have been somewhat unfair. It must be remembered that the film version was released a decade after the era in which Rado and Ragni's story was set. In the post-Vietnam era Hair's message was probably no longer that relevant. And, while, the free availability of sex and drugs of the 60's was no doubt fondly remembered by many film patrons, the innocence of that decade had given way to a certain cynicism and, certainly, a greater decadence. It is often said that what people thought happend in the 60's really happened in the 70's. It should also be borne in mind that attending a stage production of Hair was an experience, in which cast members interacted with theatregoers (often sharing some weed and acid with them).In truth, it is not a great film. And, ironically, the best thing about it hails from the original stage production; the songs. But, having said that, it is still hugely enjoyable and special mention must be made of the choreography of Twyla Tharpe. Good viewing as a period piece.</fullReview>

But there is not a single musical number in the film that doesn't work. From the title song to the bittersweet Let the Sunshine In that comes at what is a very surprising, very touching conclusion. A must for ANY fan of musicals.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good movie musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As with most musicals, much of whether you enjoy Hair will depend simply on whether you like the music. I think it's great, from the exuberant choreography of the opening "Aquarius" number to the silliness of "Black Boys/ White Boys" to the stunning finale. Also of note is the "Be In" sequence. It's extremely difficult to depict subjective, drug-induced mental states on film, and this one does it well.In general, the adaptation to the screen is excellent, primarily because it adds a story to build the songs around. Additionally, the movie wisely cuts out most of the shocking-for-the-sake-of-shock-value aspects of the stage version (including the cast-call nude scene). And the decision to film several of the musical scenes outdoors rather than on a set was excellent. I do think a couple more of the weaker songs could have been axed, however.If you supported the Viet Nam War, you probably won't appreciate the depiction of military officers or the general tone of the film. But a strength of Hair is that it doesn't romanticize its hippie characters. They are mostly depicted as immature and irresponsible. In a strange way, this is also the movie's central weakness, as it is often very difficult to root for some of the would-be protagonists. Fortunately, the decision to build the story around Claude and his dilemma makes Hair much more than a collection of good song-and-dance numbers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should've stuck to the original script and characters...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My biggest problem with the movie version of Hair is simple: It doesn't follow the original storyline. I watched it several times and always thought something was inherently wrong with it.After having recently seen the revival performed twice at the Delacorte Theatre in NYC as part of the Shakespeare in the Park production, I now understand what's wrong.Any effort to modernize this production or adjust it for a movie audience is a mistake. It's such a well timed and tested play that it needs to be performed on film as it's performed in the play. Without revealing anything, the extreme change to the characters perspective damaged the impact this film could've have and is why it was such a bomb at the box office.With all the collective talent and amazing performances this film had going for it, it's just unbelievable that the powers that be came up with the idea to mess with the success of the Broadway version. If could be they didn't learn the lesson of the '77 revival which tried to modernize it 10 years later on Broadway and watched it completely flop in less than a month.Hair, 41 years later, contains topics that are still amazingly relevant in today's world and is a film musical that deserves a re-make only if it sticks to the original story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An honest stab with a dull butter knife at a stageplay that should have been filmed 10 years earlier. Not the fault of Milos Forman and whoever made this flick in '79 (not '69, '70,'71...etc.) 1979 (five years AFTER Americans "knew" Vietnam was over). Anyway, Treat Williams (very talented guy..seen him on stage) is well-cast with the energy and life-spark that Berger embodies, and John Savage (wonderful actor - saw him on stage in American Buffallo Before this film) is Mr. Mid-West to the tee, Beverly D'Angelo I also liked (a great Patsy Clilne in COALMINER'S Daughter in '80), and the rest. Good singers, nice opening shot in CENTRAL PARK, but nobody cared, even me and tose people by 1979 because the NEW WAY (REAGAN) was already on top of the pile. A 5 out of 10. Best performance = John Savage. I'm not into musicals (even hippie '60s stuff which I'm into when it's cool), but it didn't open doors like the Broadway show did (as astringent as that sounds).It just didn't! Check it out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is an insult to the play upon which it is based. The character of Claude has been warped beyond recognition leaving a painful performance that does not even vaguely resemble the original plot. Shame, shame, shame. They have also cut a fair number of the original score of change the context in which the songs are sung. This warps the air of the film and causes the viewer who is aware of how this should be to wince as the writer of this screen play gives Hud a wife,turns Sheila into a spoiled rich girl, characterizes Claude as a cowboy, and kills Burger by sending him to Vietnam instead. If one is not familiar with the original plot I assure you this is not a bad film for you to see, but if you ever wish to see the original or are, as I am, a die-hard fan of the classic play, you would do best to avoid the film altogether. One really must stick to one or the other.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was a hippie age 22 in 1965, have seen the play 5 times, have 2 versions of the music, and have read the script many times. Maybe taken as an separate thing, the movie is OK, but as an adoption of the play, it's terrible.First the good. The songs are sung well, and the production values are pretty good. The homosexual implications in Black Boys, White Boys is cute. The Claude/Berger switch was interesting. Hair is a fluid production, and constant changes in it are inherent provided the basic spirit of it is retained.But the basic spirit was very much distorted. It seemed like all the producer wanted was to sing certain songs, and fit the story-line to them regardless of what that did to the original intent of the play.Claude, Sheila, and Hud were presented as a selfish brats who could care less about anyone outside their tribe. Claude destroyed Sheila's parents party (it's hard to believe that she smiled while her parents were being hurt), and repeatedly stole cars. Sheila stole the soldier's clothes and car. Then she left him in the middle of the desert where he would certainly sunburn badly, probably be busted in rank, and could likely die on that lonely Nevada road. Good fun. And Hud found it fine to break his son's heart while yelling at his ex. This is not what hippies were like, not what the play described, and is directly opposite to a love generation.I've never seen a hippie beg for money. The point was to be self-sufficient outside the capitalist system, not beg from it.After Berger is thrown in jail for ruining Sheila's party and Claude offers to bail some out, Berger insists on being bailed instead, with no better plan for bailing the rest that hitting on Sheila's parents, and then hitting on his own mommy."Be In" has always been a very spiritual point, but here it is wasted on silly brides floating around. Even if this is part of his trip, it ruins a beautiful song. I know they're contrasting "Floating In Space" with the Army. But again, it totally ruins a beautiful song.While Sheila and Claude are skinny dipping, Berger steals their clothes, laughing "it was fun man" even after he could see both were very annoyed. Then a little later, Berger does one thing that no hippie ever does. He hits Claude. Terrible.Then they have the perfect opportunity to sing "Starshine" at night in some beautiful SF spot with the stars twinkling down, maybe working into an inventive duet. Instead, the whole tribe sings it in the blazing sun speeding down the road in a convertible (stolen of course).I was vastly disappointed with the movie in 1979, and I like it even less now. I think it would have been possible to do a reasonably close adoption of the show, but this ain't it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb Forman Adaptation of Legendary Vietnam Era New York Show</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Milos Forman celebrates the hippies: people should be able to remember with this how beautifully right they often were. They are still usually put down as much as they were when they were operational.The best "HAIR" is beautiful Beverly D'Angelo's, blowing in the wind as she sings "Good Morning, Starshine" in the Pontiac convertible with her new friends as they zoom across the Nevada desert to find Claude (John Savage.)Berger (Treat Williams) has two fabulous arguments with "the authorities," both of which are very painful to watch, because you can feel the military-social force over what is considered to be his irresponsibility and paltriness. The first time is at Sheila's wedding party when he resists eviction from the party, and ends up mostly prevailing by dancing on the table--although he and all of his friends end up in jail for it. The second time, at the army base, he does not prevail and the other well-known solution is arrived at. But both times you can feel the quiet violence of authorities against gypsies.Actually, society tells you to be like the Flower Children, then punishes you if you actually do it.Just because a lot of the original Flower Children became Yuppies doesn't mean they didn't do anything important when they were hippies.The 60's were NOT over because of what some otherwise fine writers have "authoritatively" said had already begun to occur before the Manson murders. Anything artistically beautiful leaves living traces that endure forever: this film documents one of those movements that mattered.They called this writer "media poison" and she wasn't always that. She just called them "children" who she more or less said were just "living this way" and left it at that. They had been smart not to tell her everything in Haight-Ashbury when she drank gin and took ups to do the story.In the same group of essays, she claims not be interested in "paradises, real or artificial." Well, that explains a lot.She said she was too unstable to take acid when they offered it to her; but this was only partially true: It was fear of paradises.Otherwise, it is impossible to miss how this extraordinary film, made almost 15 years after Haight-Ashbury and the East Village would cease to exist as they had (remaining primarily only as weak mutations reduced to unspeakable New Age ashrams, where the pot was all gone and heavily enforced k.p. duty--vilely called "karma-yoga things"--was prevalent) captures so much of the happiness that some of us remember so well still as we continue on as kinds of older hippies...Twyla Tharp's choreography and Ann Roth's colours are all that that strange moment was and is supposed to be--I remember the way people who had used LSD drew stars; you could always tell a psychedelic star, a psychedelic moon, a psychedelic sun. I went to a New York head shop where I was referred to an "84-year-old morphine addict" who lived in Paris, who I was to look up as I bought two velvet hats.Some hippies lasted. I saw Adam Purple at the Union Square Market in 1996 riding a bicycle festooned with many balloons and told him how much I had loved his tulip garden in concentric circles grown in a vacant lot in what was then a wino neighborhood on Eldridge Street, about 1977--and then razed for high-rise apartments. He said "yeah, if it's good it won't last..."Well, that's not exactly true, of course, but he wouldn't have been a pure hippie artist if he hadn't been able to put it that way, and not try to see it another way.His wife was Eve Purple. I hope he hadn't really married her. They obviously wouldn't have needed to.Beautiful Beverly D'Angelo seems to love Berger and Claude and Hud (Dorsey Wright) and she is never corny about it. Nobody is corny.Corniness has little to do with love.Hud's fiancee is Cheryl Barnes and she sings "Easy to Be Hard" full of deep Gospel that resonates dark sounds in Central Park. It is this song that proves the comprehensive intelligence of the show: Hud has just tried to shirk his responsibilities to Cheryl and their young boy. He wants to "wish them away." In this song she talks about how easy it is to be hard, "especially people who care about strangers...who care about evil and social injustice.." those same people who will walk away from those close to them when they get in the way of their easy time of it. Gradually, Jeannie and Sheila and Berger and Woof make Hud go back and gather Cheryl and the boy up. Even the hippies were being given a strict test for hypocrisy; the beauty of this is that they pass the test so we can love the hippies. The 'carpool' going across the desert would never have been possible if Cheryl and the baby hadn't been part of the "mornin' singin' song."Central Park has never been more of a movie star than it is in this one, and New York is sure *lookin' good* in this memoir of collective rapture.That same essayist said "New York was no mere city" and that she would always have the feeling toward it as of "the first person who touched you."She was often right, of course. It's not my fault she wouldn't give the hippies a break. They had time to help bring on the resistance to the Vietnam War that forever changed the course of what America could then be, no matter how hard it tries to forget it."Let the Sunshine In" makes it impossible for the song in the Pontiac Bonneville convertible to be called "Good Mornin' Sunshine," and that is a true blessing, it goes without saying.It's about those psychedelic stars even though they are under the sun in the morning in Nevada and this moment in the film is like a magic carpet ride all its own. This is where the hippies just get to be hippies (like in THE NIGHT OF THE IGUANA when Mrs. Faulk (Ava Gardner) says when Richard Burton finally lets loose "That's Shannon bein' Shannon!"):"Good mornin', Starshine...the earth says 'hello'...you twinkle up above..we twinkle below..."Good mornin,' Starshine...you lead us along...My love and me as we sing...our early mornin' singin' song..."Glitty clup cluby...libbee lubbee loobee..oh la la la lo.."Saba sibbie saba...Dooby aba naba.. lily lo lo.."Dooby ooby wama...Nooby aba naba.. early mornin' singin' song...""Singin' a song, song to sing..."Song song song, si-ing sing sing sing-song... "Song song song, si-ing sing sing sing-song... Song song song, si-ing sing sing sing-song.."(This is not a cereal song, but it would make cereal seem okay and even macrobiotic food more bearable if one remembers beautiful Beverly D'Angelo and beautiful Treat Williams-it wouldn't even hurt Anita Bryant and Pat Boone and other Baptists, but they couldn't sing it either.)A song about song. Very perfect singin' song, I'd say.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun and exciting musical about freedom, love, rebellion, individuality and life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hair is a musical about the hippie counterculture. Hippies generally are pacifists; they're against established institutions, parental values, war, pollution, and they live for drugs, free love (as much sex as possible) and peace on earth. For the most part they were just a lot of kids who wanted to try new things and make a difference. Well, they didn't succeed in creating world peace or ending war forever, but they did have quite an impact on society. Because they were against racism, sexism and homophobia, people learned a lot around that time about how people are all the same regardless of their race, gender or orientation. Hippies brought in new clothing styles and hair styles that on occasion are still worn today. They influenced music and books, movies and television. Not like the lazy, texting zombies of 2015 at all. They were the revolutionary generation, whereas today's generation is the couch potato generation.One of the many reasons people, mainly guys, became hippies was to avoid being drafted into the war. That's what happened to Claude, the main character of Hair. He soon makes friends with a hippie group in New York City (for the most part they look like hobos in flamboyant clothes). The leader of the group, George Burger, becomes his best friend and the hippie group crashes a party, sings about getting their hair cut and Claude gets stoned. After a falling out between Claude and the hippies, Claude joins the army after all, but when the hippies visit him and he goes AWOL, George gets on the plane going to Vietnam to take his place instead... getting killed overseas.Hair isn't just about hippies, it's a timeless message about how the world needs to learn to get along. We don't need to stop pollution or take drugs or have casual sex, we just need to learn to live together, everyone on the planet. Hopefully someday a generation like this one will come around again, hopefully kids will turn off their cellphones and glowing screens and wake up, try to make a difference in the world. Hair is one of the most interesting movies I've ever seen, it's been performed live as a play recently as well, and if you ever get the chance to see either version, don't pass it up.I also recommend Running With Scissors (2006), Pay It Forward (2000) and Harold &amp; Maude (1971).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Musical is completely different category in the cinematography. It's really hard to create a work of art which do not affect by some catchphrases part of the best screen writing but with the whole magic of music that let people's mind fly through the movie make audience entertain. But Hair is not that musical it doesn't let people relax while watching it but make them think and pondering over questions deeply stuck in the human's history of the civilization. The war, and most specially Vietnam War, the consequences after it, the inner shaking that it provokes in human's soul lead Mr. Milos Forman to the path of making that extraordinary piece of pure cinema. A rollicking musical memoir. Affecting drama, exhilarating spectacle, provocative social observer. Fantastic musical, I highly recommend it. We all have to let the sun shine in our souls and realize that from the war nothing good may be borne - if we want to leave a better life we can just if we live in harmony with everything which means to leave in peace firstly with ourselves, and secondly with the others living creatures. What the phenomenal Mr. Forman wants to show us are exactly the ugly faces of the war but by the tragic finale to provoke a feeling of real catharsis that the good will always prevail over the evil.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"This is the dawning of the Age of Aquarius?" perhaps the most memorable singing moment of "Hair" praying for a new age to come, an age with more "harmony and understanding, sympathy and trust abounding?" Like so many great musicals, the essence of the film is present all through the magic of the songs and their penetrating lyrics, like many classics, no singing part feels unnecessary, each one has a beautiful, sincere and gutsy message to convey, something we all owe to the generation that grew during the most troubled times of our modern history. For someone who was born in the 1980's, and missed a lot from the world's history, I grew with the idea of "Hair" being a sort of hymn of the hippie-movement, with hairy teenagers singing for the peace in the world, and a never-ending communion between nature and humanity ? that was 1967, the world was living a series of revolution that could have painted it in red, USA were embarked in the hellish Vietnamese crusade, the baby-boom generation was becoming adult, and constituted a political and social force that could have unbalanced the whole system. Indeed, in 1967, the future of the worlds was at stakes, everything was possible, the arts were boiling in the minds of talented newcomers, even Hollywood was enduring a revolution ? the song "Where Do I Go?" was the spirit that inhabited the hearts of many people in the world, the hippies and the other revolutionists could never have become "has been" simply because their minds were constantly turned to the future, but 1969 and the 70's crisis came and all they could do next was to mourn the dead dream of what the world "could have been": a beautiful utopia ?Now, the question would be why a film adaptation of "Hair" in 1979, 12 years after the original play, when the Vietnam war became a painful memory, when the Manson crimes in a tragic August summer killed all the dreams of harmony and fraternity and showed how the degeneracy that could inspire some crimes couldn't ask for a flower in a gun, but for real bullets, when Nixon had already resigned, when people were living in their everyday life the consequences of the Oil Crisis, when even artistically, the Disco was the new trend, the Punk movement was shouting the anger of a generation with no future, and families were back to a new consumerist era, why making this cinematic anachronism? The idea is probably behind the fact that the movie didn't follow the original story, and Milos Forman allowed himself some liberties that probably served "Hair" by extending its spirit over the setting of 1967 and elevating to a more subversive area where even the hippies are portrayed with objective flawed? always politically correcting, but never gratuitously subversive, the film carries an inspiring message with an exciting entertaining value.Milos Forman had a unique talent to portray irreverent characters with a heart burning inside them, rather it's genius, or faithfulness to their convictions, whether they're named McMurphy, Flynt, Mozart or Kaufman, never had rebellion been so cinematically flamboyant, so able to touch our hearts and our souls. In "Hair", this irreverence isn't carried by a name, but a group, to call them "hippies" is just a convenient wording, the group only shines through its contrast with the two main characters, Claude Bukowski, a new draftee about to go to Nam, played by a convincing John Savage and Sheila Franklin an upper-class free- spirited girl, played by Beverley D'Angelo. The evolution of their romance is so sweetly handled that it never feels forced or stereotypical, and it allows them to behave as the straight men of character who rather look or feel crazy, among them, Treat Williams, the real star of the show, portraying Berger, a man who like the others, chose to live, according to his beliefs. In the original, from what I read, they were all rebellious, while in "Hair" we're allowed to have glimpses of normality, until being disturbed by the path where 'our' normality leads to, indeed we'd rather be crazy like Berger or Hud, than brainwashed like the check-point guard or castrated like Sheila's friend.Like in "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" or "The People vs. Larry Flynt", the antagonists or the villains are transcended by much more global entities, call them system, establishment, government, it's a mighty power that belittles us. In "Hair", all the songs work like rally cries of defenses against this society where the group, the solidarity, is the only force than can prevail. In the film, almost all the taboos are broken, sexual, racial, but never with a polemical tone, rebellion doesn't forbid style and flashiness, the crude words, the profanities, the racial slurs or stereotypes are mocked with a delighted humor that transcend their taboos with a poetic beauty. A song makes a comparison between white and black men from the point of view of libidinous women, the titular song "Hair" is introduced when a character refuses to get his haircut, like an illustration of the ultimate source of freedom: to let them grow like we would for a plant. "Hair" is part of a sacred body, and body isn't a taboo anymore ? Never ostentatious, the movie celebrates this wind of liberty with joy, anger, sadness and a sincerity of heart, culminating with the "Let the Sunshine In" song with all the people joined in Washington.Whether this heritage is still valued or followed might not be the point, after all, many hippies were finally engulfed in the same establishment they denounced, the point is simply that the message of "Hair", its pacifism, environmentalism, sexually and socially exhilarating truth, were sung once, and who knows, maybe one day, will come another "Age of Aquarius"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably the last great musical from Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When director Milos Forman's film-version of the Broadway musical hair came out, I was 11. I'd not seen the Broadway production, so I couldn't refer to it.I was familiar with the basics, and - not seeing the Broadway show, let me see this Hair with a clear, unvarnished view.I know that one complaint of people familiar with the show, was the original's 'story,' or, lack thereof was changed. It now being the late 70's, I think that Mr. Forman putting in a central plot allowed HAIR to be seen by viewers - old &amp; new - with much more clarity.The simple story is about Claude Bukowski - a farm boy who is drafted into the US army, with the very real probability he'll then be shipped off to Vietnam - where the stagnated (non) war was raging.Claude comes to NYC, which is where the story begins. And, what a beginning.The amazing choreographer, Twyla Tharp is in charge of bringing life to the many musical numbers, and, she does so with a brilliant eye, that works beautifully with the camera's eye - and ours.The first number is the well-known AQUARIUS, set in Central Park, as the sun is just breaking, and Claude watches exuberant hippies, move, dance, in a flowing style that expresses their love of life, youth, freedom and hope.It's so overwhelming, that even the cops on horseback become partners - to their horses, as they are pulled in to the rhythm.Most of the music in HAIR is well known, but, with Forman's direction, and Tharp's choreography, it's like seeing classic painting, under layers of varnish, and wear - but seeing it beautifully restored and looking at it anew.I cannot think of another choreographer, who so used the REAL world of New York City, and, the lens of the camera, to such brilliant effect (in fact, one moments love, is during AIN'T GOT NO, when one of the dancers is so into it, that he lets out an audible 'yeah).There's a cameo by Charlotte (FACTS OF LIFE's Mrs. Garrett) as a celebrant at an upscale reception, who becomes entranced with Berger (Treat Williams in his first starring role), and begins to dance with him.Amongst the performances - most of the cast are unknowns - are a powerful number by Cheryl Barnes (prior to this, I saw Ms. Barnes in the Broadway musical, THE MAGIC SHOW). Her rendition of EASY TO BE HARD is sung with power, and soaring melisma (a skill that many of today's 'singers' try to do, but, end up sounding like they're in pain), that had the audience I originally saw it with cheering.Critics at the time were on the fence about this film, as many were familiar with the Broadway show. I think that time's have improved the film's audience, and I recommend it to For those who saw the show on Broadway (originally), HAIR was famous for it's NON structure (as well as the nudity).Milos took this sprawling kaleidoscope, and made a film that stays true to the original HAIR, but, opens it up to a much broader audience.One thing most people might not know, but, most of the cast had worked in either musicals, or, in rock bands, but, all-in-all, the music of the '60's did beat true them.At a love-in, in Central Park on Sheeps' Meadow, the 'tribe' succumbs to the hits of acid they're give, while thestrains of OLD FASHIONED LOVE SONG/ELECTRIC BLUES transport us, to Claude's hallucinatory visions.The still stabbing THREE-FIVE-ZERO-ZERO (which is still sometimes censored (?!?!) because of the 'n' word, is sung by Ms. Melba Moore, who was in the Broadway original.Another beautiful numbers that send chills through me is the hauntingly beautiful WALKING IN SPACE.This film leaves you drained. It is so poignant, so well-crafted, I really don't have a word to describe it, as I've never seen anything similar to itIn this day and age, it should stand as a totem, to what happened before, to the sons of this country, who went off and fought a senseless war. It should be a reminder to all, of the senselessness of such folly, and the value of love, as well as what this country CAN be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Hair" Is A Bit Too Headstrong At Times, But Is Catchy &amp; Energetic Overall</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Broadway musical "Hair" needs no introduction. It revolutionized Broadway musicals, and perhaps paved the way for future unorthodox Broadway shows like "Annie", "Rent", "Bring In Da Noise, Bring In Da Funk", and "Avenue Q" to name a few. Since it made such a big splash from its 1967 debut, a film adaptation was probably inevitable.Having not seen any stage production of "Hair" to date, and only knowing it by reputation, I am not one to make comparisons to the original musical. Judging "Hair" as a stand-alone movie, it is very energetic, takes full advantage of its on-location shooting in New York City, and the musical numbers are brilliantly over the top. Its main weaknesses involved its fractured sense of storytelling, some musical numbers feeling out of place and not contributing well to the story, some underdeveloped characters, and an ending that felt like a giant thud.These weaknesses probably made the film an odd duck on director Milos Foreman's filmography. Foreman directed "Hair" after the far- superior "One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest" (1975) and prior to the critically-acclaimed "Ragtime" (1981) and "Amadeus" (1984). "Hair" is not a bad movie, but its inability to stand the test of time, unlike the aforementioned films, speaks volumes about its legacy, or lack thereof.The performances by the main cast, however, are actually good. Treat Williams puts a lot of energy behind homeless but high-spirited hippie George Berger, and effectively makes him a clown-like character with an edge. John Savage is believable as Claude Bukowski, a down-home country boy who ventures into the Central Park hippie scene within days of registering for the Army.However, it's not clear if Bukowski enlists by choice or is drafted against his will. All you see of him before the exciting musical numbers is his getting on a bus in Oklahoma and being seen off by his father. If we had seen more of Bukowski at home, and had an idea of some of his feelings towards going off to Vietnam, it would have made him a stronger character.John Savage, however, did what he could with what was given to him. I especially liked how he ventured upon this extremely liberal underworld as a supposedly more conservative outsider. In a way, he's a lot like the people who see this film who did not live through the late '60's, like myself.However, the love story between Bukowski and wealthy socialite Shiela Franklin (Beverly D'Angelo) could have used more work. Although D'Angelo made a strong supporting character, it seemed as though the chemistry between her and Bukowski was on again, then off again, and back &amp; forth for no particular reason.In fact, their ambiguous relationship made one of the most bizarre and off-putting scenes in the film even stranger. Bukowski gets a free dose of LSD from a hippie in Central Park that is passing them out, and goes on a trip that is part fantasy (involving him marrying Shiela) and part sheer hallucination with no rhyme or reason. The scene that results is just plain weird and actually quite scary for a PG-rated movie. Of course, not mentioning LSD or any other drugs in a movie that takes place in the late '60's is like not mentioning the word "cowboy" in a paragraph about John Wayne. Still, though, this "trip" scene felt so out of place, and did not actually contribute to the story at all. When it ends, it is never brought up again.As far as the songs go, many of them worked in the context of the movie. For instance, the song that probably worked best was "Easy To Be Hard", sung in this movie by Cheryl Barnes. Barnes plays the ex-fiancé of Hud (Dorsey Wright), whose real name is actually Lafayette. The reasons Hud refuses to marry this woman, even though he bore a son with her, are not explained well, but the hurt and rejection that comes from her singing are well understood.I also liked the interpretations of "Age of Aquarius" and "Manchester, England". Other songs like "Sodomy" and "Black Boys/White Boys" were what they were supposed to be: jaw- droppingly shocking and offensive at first, but clever and funny as the songs progressive. In the latter song, I especially liked the scenes that cut back and forth between girls in Central Park, and decorated military men on the draft board.Among the songs that did not work, but should have, was the song "Hair". It started out well with fellow Hippie Woof (Don Dacus) being asked by a prison psychiatrist why his hair was so long. However, the scene shot to prisoners rioting, and the camera angles and lighting could have brought out so much more of the song. Plus, for a song called "Hair", I felt as though more hair could have been emphasized. The Cowsills did a better job with their iconic music video for this song.Last but not least, the closing song "Let The Sunshine In" felt strangely out of place given the tragic fate of one of the main characters. The twist ending was clever, but the other characters' reaction to it was underplayed, and the closing song, not to mention the hippie scene on the White House lawn, seemed more ostentatious than authentic. As a storytelling point, the ending feels so hollow and uncertain that no amount of sunshine can make it any better.I credit "Hair" for many things: its energy, its '60's spirit that makes you forget it came out in 1979 as opposed to 1969, and its great songs. The story needed some more polishing, and many of the supporting characters needed to be fleshed out more. As it is, it's good, but does not hold a candle to other Milos Foreman films or even similar movies like "Godspell" (1973).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sex, Drugs, Rock &amp; Roll v/s War</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Forman brilliantly captures the essence of the 60s/70s hippie culture in this poignant but funny musical. At first it appears to be just another silly movie of the musical genre but as the story develops, its layers unravel and the conflict between the characters such as choosing to stay 'loyal to your country' by fighting the war or opposing this unjust war. Moreover, those who opposed the war were treated and seen under a different light because they were seen as being unpatriotic.The placing of the songs are a little awkward (then again so is the entire film). The lyrics are hilarious and controversial. At first Forman focuses on showing the crazy hippie culture that may appear shallow on the surface. For example the girl getting pregnant and not knowing who the father is may suggest a shallow relationship between her and her partners but we see that the group of friends really do care about one another. After all, it's free love.'Hair' is a colourful movie. The colour of the actors' costume contracts well with the background. The department of makeup and costume have done a great job. The cinematography and editing are good and the film flows well leading to a powerful end.All the actors do at least a brilliant job. John Savage does well as Hooper, an aspiring soldier who has just been introduced to the hippie culture. Beverly D'Angelo oozes sensuality and she's funny too. A laidback Treat Williams steals the show with a natural performance that only reminds one of what an underrated actor he is today.Today, after decades, 'Hair' still looks fresh. Infusing fun, humour, energy and sarcasm to tell a story of sex, drugs and rock and roll vs war, it succeeds in winning the viewer's appreciation and respect, especially for those people who stood up against the Vietnam war.</fullReview>

I mean back then they didn't have amazing hair products and hair tools so I think they do really well with the styling. As for the songs, they are just addictive, we always end up singing them through the say and our hair clients think we are crazy until we explain its from the movie hair! OK, we are hair addicts at www.headkandy.com this film is played over and over in our hair salon. The staff just love it, I know the title hair is a bit of a contradiction but it works for us hair stylists. I would probably give hair a 10 out of 10.

		<fullReview>....and that's why the message board for the movie "Across The Universe" is breaking my heart and spirit.Someone began a thread stating that Across The Universe "ripped off Hair, a highly superior movie".Now, I doubt that was the intent of their writers and I wrote my 2 cents on their message boards. I wrote the similarities (with ALL spoilers hidden) and complimented the director of Across the Universe but stated I'd always have a special bias for Hair because I grew up watching it almost every weekend during summer vacations with my older sister.Well, the Across The Universe fans didn't take kindly to my innocent posts. One fan even stated she/he thought about taking the time to change my thoughts! WHY? What is with these fans? It seems as though nobody can have an opinion of their own on that message board.So fine, I won't post on there. But what upsets me is that "Across The Universe" is a recommendation for viewers on THIS site but when I recommended "HAIR" as a film to watch on the "Across The Universe" site, I was attacked - one person even said if she watched HAIR it would ruin her "Across The Universe" experience.My question is, why keep a movie loved by haters on this site in the recommendations section? I just can't believe people who supposedly are into "peace" and "love" can be so cruel and closed minded. They remind me of modern-day communists.Anyway, I will always love and support HAIR. I'm permanently disabled from an accident with a semi-truck and my life has been filled with depression and lost hope for years now......then I remembered I had the HAIR DVD. I've been popping it in my DVD player every night because it puts a smile on my face - something I haven't done in years.I've only seen the movie and I hope one day to see the Broadway version.</fullReview>

Bathed in raw 60's goodness, it is extremely entertaining, with funny dialog and excellent psychedelic rock music to the whole thing.The plot is farely simple, with a farm boy who is drafted going to new york before he gets shipped off to war, and falling in with a bunch of hippies.It remains witty throughout the entire movie, and has a care-free spirit appropriate to the era.Unfortunetely all the songs from the play were not included in the movie, such as "The Bed", which is quite fun, and others were rushed through or drowned out ("Electric Blues").Still, all the favorites are there, such as Aquarius, Manchester England, and Hair. On the topic of music, it remains excellent, and such to the extent that you will probably want to pick up the soundtrack.All in all, see it, have a good time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>HAIR's Impression on My Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was exposed to the musical HAIR at the very early age of 6, a testament to my free-thinking parents. At the time, I absorbed none of the themes of the film, but I loved the music, and would often sing the sexually explicit "Sodomy" around the house, without knowing what I was saying. Now, at the age of 18, I can truly appreciate this film's poignant themes of self-expression, non-conformity, and self-sacrifice. As some of my fellow peers are being shipped off to war in a foreign land, much like Claude Bukowski's character was destined, I find myself asking those same questions that were posed to the anti-war and hippie counter-cultures of the 1960s. I am positive that my growing up with the influence of HAIR in my life has made me a more liberal, and definitely more open-minded citizen, and no, I don't think that's such a bad thing.Beads, flowers, freedom, happiness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was in High School when this film came out and I was anticipating it because when I was a child, I was singing the songs to "Hair" in my school choir. I never saw the play so to me, this film was the next best thing.It was alight. The story is always a good one. The choreographed dance numbers by the great Twyla Tharp was a nice touch. But back then I had a few problems with the casting they were too 70's for the 60's. (but look for a very young Nell Carter in this film--way before "Ain't Misbehaven", excellent!) And I was upset with the Director and his style, but Milos kinda pulled it out. You can just look at "Hair" NOW and see much more potential. But this one was a nice effort, a nice musical. Maybe a longer wait from film to screen would have done it better justice.What I liked better than the film was the Soundtrack to the Film. I own the vinyl version, a cassette tape and now the CD. It's 2003 and I still love to hear the opening track "Aquarius", and "3-5-0-0". currently listening to "The Flesh Failures/Let the Sunshine" makes me cry. To be honest, that last scene in the film made me cry, made me angry and made me want to speak out against unnecessary war of any kind.Imagine what "Hair" would be like if they would have waited 20 more years to stage it on film. I think right now, it would be welcomed, and better understood...especially looking back at that time and comparing it to this. It's time for us to see that no matter how things supposedly change, they always remain the same.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hair isn't for me one of the my favourite film musicals(excluding animated films for now, West Side Story, Singin' in the Rain, The Wizard of Oz, My Fair Lady, Mary Poppins, The Sound of Music, Meet Me in St Louis) nor do I think is one of Milos Forman's best films(Amadeus and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest). It is much better than it's given credit for though, true it is inferior to the stage show and has its problems, but there are far worse film musicals out there(Xanadu, Can't Stop the Music, Mame, Grease 2, Across the Universe The Wiz, A Chorus Line) and for me it ties with Annie(1982, I know lots of people hate it but I love it and have done since childhood) as one of the most underrated.The story(the stage show does have a stronger one but not with its disjointed moments) does get weaker towards the end with an ending that is rather over-the-top, and the sequence with Claude's hallucination bogged things down a bit.It does however do a more than commendable job turning the stage show into something coherent and something that is still of relevant value now. Most of the story is good though even if re-written, with some well-explored, relevant themes of poverty, homosexuality and racism, even if these themes are closer to the 70s period rather than late 60s but I don't think it mattered too much. It is also successful in being not just tragic and poignant but also thoughtful and funny. The film looks wonderful, with the era detail, cinematography and colour a colourful and beautiful feast for the eye. The music is also fantastic, there are catchy numbers like Aquarious, Sodomy and Flesh Failures but also some really powerful ones like Walking in Space and Easy to Be Hard.The choreography looks dazzling and is danced and paced with sheer infectious energy, while the stage show has even more energy the film comes very close to matching it. Who can forget Treat Williams' table top dance? I can't. Forman I have always considered one of the most intelligent and underrated directors, while Cuckoo's Nest and Amadeus are very well regarded and deservedly, few of his others have matched that, and it is a shame but movies like Fireman's Ball are also very good. And he doesn't undermine the energy, music, choreography or performances in any way, if anything he accommodates them while phoning it in. And of course the performances are just great. I don't think Treat Williams has been better, and he certainly hasn't been in a better film since Hair, while John Savage and Don Dacus are equally terrific and Beverly D'Angelo is smoking hot. Cheryl Barnes deserves a mention as well, as her Easy to be Hard rendition is one of the most powerful and heart-wrenching scenes of any film musical to me and what an entrance.All in all, not without flaws but much better than it's gotten credit for and deserving of being judged on its own terms. 8/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

They sing and dance. The two men form an ill-defined bond, then Mr. Williams decides to help Mr. Savage thaw snooty débutante Beverly D'Angelo (as Sheila Franklin). She has a topless swim scene and Williams occasionally shows off his buttocks. Meanwhile pregnant Annie Golden (as Jeannie Ryan) wonders if her baby's father is Dorsey Wright (as LaFayette) or Don Dacus (as Woof). You're obviously meant to hope Mr. Dacus is the daddy...The familiar songs ("Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In", "Hair", "Good Morning Starshine" and "Easy To Be Hard") are here - but be advised to check out the original Broadway cast album and compliment it by adding the individual "hit" arrangements by The 5th Dimension, The Cowsills, Oliver and Three Dog Night...This is a major departure from "The American Tribal Love-Rock Musical", although you can see how director Milos Forman and team are trying to include original themes. The relationship between the lead characters is discarded in favor of traditional nonsense, missing points completely; original co-starring writers James Rado and Gerome Ragni had trouble even seeing this film as a version of their show. There is a good supporting role for Miles Chaplin (as Steve Franklin) and a last appearance from famed 1950s director Nicholas Ray (as "The General"). Oddly enough, the surprise Nevada plot switch at the end is effective, and would have provided the original work with a good cinematic conclusion.***** Hair (3/14/79) Milos Forman ~ John Savage, Treat Williams, Beverly D'Angelo, Annie Golden</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This musical is fun. To be honest, I put off watching it because I like really in-depth musicals. I thought that this would be about hippies, and drugs, and generally grate on my nerves. I didn't expect anything profound. Well, I just finished watching it for the first time five minutes ago. It's playing on my television for a second time right now. I will agree with Hair-buffs that there are some great points in this movie (that I have yet to fully understand, because I can't say I caught everything upon my first viewing), however, it is just plain fun for the average viewer. It is completely brainless (I do not mean that in an insulting way) *if you want it to be*. I can see why it's a cult classic and a legend. I suggest that everyone, no matter their opinion, keep an open mind and watch this movie once they are old enough for the nudity and basic themes. As for me, not only will I watch the movie a few more times, I will pay the money to go see it on Broadway (2009 revival) as soon as I can. My pre-formed opinion was not only disproved, but completely reversed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hollywood ignored the fact that the cult classic musical was virtually unfilmable (not to mention the fact that by 1979 it was already outdated) and made it into a movie anyway. The results are predictably mixed. It's not a disaster, but it's no classic. It suffers from having a strong narrative forced on it, whereas the stage version felt organic and like it was being made up as the actors went along. The music sounds pretty good, but the whole movie has the taint of the unnecessary.Treat Williams is pretty good, and Nell Carter shows up in a cameo and knocks one out of the park with the "White Boys/Black Boys" number.

It drops some of the songs (The Bed, My Conviction, Frank Mills) and cuts others (Walking in Space). However, what is left is presented very well indeed. All the singers and dancers are excellent, and the key performers (especially Treat Williams as Berger, Beverley D'Angelo as Sheila, John Savage as Claude) are memorable.As a hippy celebration and anthem, 'Hair' manages to be remain potent even in a film made ten years too late. It was no longer the era of peace, love, and Biba, but the time of punk rock ... although watching this film now, in the time of Iraqi problems, gives a new resonance to the Vietnam issues of the 1960s.Milos Forman, who also made 'Amadeus', did a good job on directing. In its scope and feel it reminds me of Norman Jewison's 'Jesus Christ Superstar', especially with the joy of the 'Aquarius' scene and the intimacy of 'Easy To Be Hard'.I really enjoyed this film and consider it a good representation of a musical born out of the first truly hedonistic era.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stunning, touching, spectacular; Treat Williams actually in a good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Treat Williams reached a degree of stardom with this movie, and really squandered it. Don't be led astray by his poor movie choices since. This movie really stands out. "Hair" is a musical that really deals with the attitude, and probably more so with the persona, of the famed peace movement of the 60's. There is a lot of spectacular music done in spectacular fashion. Unlike the music videos of the late 70's, 80's, and 90's, the video flashes coincide with the subject matter of the music. In other words, the video makes sense when matched with the songs, so you know it never could've made it on MTV. The subject matter dwells on drugs and being hippies, but it mostly an anti war movie dealing with the senseless tragedies of Viet Nam. One of the protagonists is an Oklahoma boy intent on making a difference, believing all the patriotic dribble he is spoon fed, and he happens upon a gang in New York, who are more or less glorified hoodlums; their characters are very unique, and probably wouldn't make sense today, but this bunch bands together by burning their draft cards. What ensues in some spectacular scenery and mesmerizing scenes involving not only the three leads, but the other 3 gang members, as well as a newcomer with a small child, whose entrance is easily one of the ten grandest entrances of all time in cinema, partly because she sings one of the greatest songs of that generation. Despite their faults, you come to love these people, a cinematic triumph with a heart felt and grand finale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hippie Chic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thank god for this movie. It's a document of talent that, three decades later, seems even more unique and rare in retrospect.The music is just extraordinary, packed with so much talent in writing, performance, arrangement and production that it's absolutely infectious. The lyrics and vocal arrangements are incredible. The performances by under-appreciated talents like Nell Carter and Ren Woods uplift my spirit every time I hear them. While the film may be different from the stage version, I prefer the soundtrack to the cast album, which I find truly grating and under-developed. Here the arrangements are filled out and expanded into dynamic pieces that couldn't have been produced in a stage setting.But the music isn't the only thing extraordinary about this movie. The juxtaposition of almost hyper-realist dialog scenes (reminds me of Altman films) intercut with exuberant musical and dance numbers, really works. All the talent in this movie--directing, writing, photography, editing, music, choreography, casting, acting, costuming, art direction--merge perfectly into one of the best musical films I've seen.I think it's amazing how much we know about the characters in "Hair," based on very little information or plot. They're not drawn as caricatures, but as realistic and very human people. We see little glimpses of where they come from, but the portrait is completed by vignettes that draw the characters to the surface through accomplished acting, directing and editing. There's an undercurrent theme of the misogyny of Berger and Hud which colors their characters by exposing their reckless macho-hippie ideology. The scene of Berger's home life reveals important details about his psychology, and the brief glimpse of Claude's home tells us volumes about his background through the simple, realistic and genuine interaction between Claude and (presumably) his father.I love the fashion in this movie. It defiantly mixes sixties ideas with VERY seventies looks (one does have to overlook Treat Williams' hair extensions...). It's a document of how chic much of the late-seventies was, contrary to the conventional wisdom that the era was all about bad taste. Claude's beige knitted tie was a hot trend of 1979, and the hair and clothing of the singers and dancers (particularly those in white during the Central Park scene) mixes up the decades in a way that suggests the timelessness of the musical's themes. These elements merge with Twyla Tharpe's extraordinary state-of-the-art choreography in a way that enhances the artistry of both."Hair"isn't a film that rewards cynicism. If you come to it with expectations, then you're most likely going to be held captive by artists who aren't bound by your rules. For me, it opened my eyes and ears and spirit to an insightful and passionate musical dialog about war, friendship and family that transcends its time and is still meaningful and relevant to me to this day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw the movie in a theater the month it came out, I loved it. I still do. Good music, good cast, no attempt at adapting a stage play that wouldn't have worked on screen (and rarely enough works on stage). My main problem was that there were too many kids in the audience laughing at the wrong things. See, the Vietnam draft ended the year I turned 18, so I spent my teens assuming that I had the choices of going to prison, fleeing my country, or being sent to die in a swamp. (I spent four years in the USAF between then and the movie coming out for unrelated reasons). The teenagers in the audience of "Hair" hadn't grown up under that sentence. It made me so depressed, I went across the street and saw "Superman" a second time just to cheer up.</fullReview>

It got no word of mouth, and opened poorly. The studio ditched it. But Hair is possibly the best musical ever made--with Forman directing and Tharpe choreographing, it's a startlingly beautiful, well-acted, well-written triumph that few people remember. The casting is perfect, the musical numbers unforgettable, and even the downer of an ending doesn't diminish the film's indomitable spirit.If you haven't see this movie, you haven't seen the best musical of all time.

		<fullReview>Milos Forman's original HAIR was the perfect movie that actually revealed how life was changing in those years, not only in the USA, but especially in this country. One of the plots in the film was to be used in other films to come after Hair, for example, in American Graffitti, etc. It was an original story with a touch of generational sadness in it. The characters in the film were like lonely "cells" in a "body" that was changing all over. Overall, a very good film, perhaps a little underrated though. Annie Golden's role was minor but she acted very well. It was the film that practically launched John Savage as an actor. One of the members of the Chicago played his role well even though it was a minor role.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>HAIR the movie has taken great "artistic" liberties with the scripted Tams stage version. There is no comparison between the two; in fact they bear no resemblance to one another except for the songs. In the movie Berger dies; in the play Claude dies. Sheila in the movie is presented as a debutante; in the staged performance she is a hippie activist. John Savage's film character of Claude is Oklahoma farm boy; on stage Claude is already the spiritual leader of the tribe. Need I say more? I was very disappointed with the movie as it simply doesn't capture the essence of what HAIR is all about; but, since it is HAIR, I recommend it. The more people who turn on to HAIR, the better! The stage version is more enriching. I know this because I'm currently (July/August 2003) directing HAIR in Maine for the third time. PEACE.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lackluster, untimely version of a late 60's happening.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film presentation of "Hair," which glorified the ?flower power' movement that grew out of the turbulent Vietnam war years, came out smack dab in the middle of 'disco fever' in 1979. Whatever were the producers thinking? Bad, bad mistake. Even the similarly radical, peace-sign relic "Godspell", which came out much earlier (1973) had an uncomfortable, dated feel by the time of its release. This movie six years later had no chance whatsoever.The original Broadway version made the scene and created quite a stir in 1968 at the height of the movement. I saw a fantastic theatrical touring production in St. Petersburg, Florida in 1971. What I remember most is the power and significance of that particular evening, and how it generated the same kind of high the midnight crowds elicited in "The Rocky Horror Picture Show." It was a true happening!No metaphysical experience here. Just a feeling that one is caught in a bad time warp. The movie is not only completely misinterpreted by foreign director Milos Forman, it is inundated with 70s influences that constantly weakens the spiritual framework of the piece. And in its singing cast it opted to hire the latest Hollywood "rages" who fail to inspire, vocally and otherwise. John Savage, fresh from his success in "The Deer Hunter", was brought in for the pivotal role of the naive, flag-waving, mid-western draftee (Claude)who stumbles upon a tribe of draft-card burning hippies led by Treat Williams' Berger, as the ultimate non-conformist. Williams was also a burgeoning Hollywood star/hunk at the time. Though the story's fascination lies in the divergent paths these two take, the two lackluster leads seem more uncomfortable than "with it." Understandably.Moreover, the weaving of songs and story make for a very disjointed, "Hollywood-ized" film here. It just doesn't gel. And while Twyla Tharp's arty, expressive choreography may be stylish and inventive with its fluid, free-floating movement, it is woefully inaccurate for the time.One revelation, however, is singer Cheryl Barnes' soaring version of "Easy to Be Hard." Again, I don't care for the visual interpretation or styling of the song, but this woman's voice is a godsend. Whatever happened to her? Sprinkled throughout in minor parts are a number of "hip" singer/actors whose time would come in better projects -- Nell Carter and Charlayne Woodard (both from Ain't Misbehavin'), and dynamic Melba Moore from the original Broadway show. Singing sensations Ren Woods and the late Ronnie Dyson (he also from the original) are surprisingly underused here."Hair" is a definite curio piece but that's about it. Had it been made a decade earlier ? at the height of radicalism ? or cryogenically frozen in time until a rush of baby-boomer nostalgia set in, it just might have worked.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Sixties As Viewed Through 1979</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie version of the 60s-era musical suffers greatly from time. The movie is a time capsule to the late 60's as seen through the eyes of the late 70's. This is likely a reason Hair was not successful in its initial release. Too little time had passed, and most people had little desire to relive the era. Unlike other period musicals such as Grease, this movie is not an especially nostalgic or fun look at the past. Rather, it is more of a protest against the war and a look at the hippie culture so it was instantly dated by the changing times. While some may view this movie as having allusions to today, it still reads more as a time capsule to a specific era, rather than anything more substantial. As far as the movie goes it has high points and low points. Some spots move slowly and the acting is sometimes weak, but some of the songs such as "Age of Aquarius" and "Hair" show what the play must have been like in its heyday, vibrant and colorful.</fullReview>

But all the same there's a strange quality to this musical.The plot doesn't quite hold together, which is not surprising considering that the original musical had a different plot and omits several songs. There are similarities, but the main characters are viewed now with the benefit of hindsight and while the film seems sympathetic, many of the characters seem shallow.And it does have a very down ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I Won't say anything about music, because this topic can be so deep that it can become one huge separate review, so let's concentrate on movie that is brilliant... No doubt, one of the best works of Forman.The simple story about love, friendship, freedom and ideals... oh yes, the ideals for which even pacifists are ready to go in war...There is not a single fake word, single fake character, single fake feeling in the story, because the love, freedom and friendship isn't something complicated for the characters of movie. These things aren't something that "everyone can view from different angle" These aren't things that need much thinking to understand... their love is simple, their friendship is simple, their ideals are as simple as the word "simple" itself and that's why these characters are so deep.Berger, the leader of a hippie played by Treat Williams is a guy who lives to live and that's the biggest happiness for him... he has his ass - (as he sings in one of the scenes in the movie) and that's enough to make him happy with his property...Berger never accepts that something can't be done... and his right... If he wants to go to some rich guys' banquet in his dirty old clothes and huge long hair, he will do it... if he want's to go to another state to just see his friend, he'll do it... he never thinks twice... he just do it.How? why is he so powerful? the answer is simple: because he is FREE.Just watch how the wind makes the hair wave in this movie and you will understand it all, maybe you will even free yourself too.</fullReview>

"Hair" presents one point of view from that divisive time and I think it does it well. My main reason for adding another review is that Hair's PG rating seems totally inappropriate. There is a lot of sex and nudity in this film. I strongly believe this movie would receive at least a PG-13 today and probably an R.

		<shortDescription>A painful perspective on the antiwar and hippie movement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film Hair was a part of the post-68 rebellion, and at the same time has made its own impact on the contemporary generation. Notably it pictures the American anti-war and hippie movement. Although at the time I was a college student, it was a bit too bold for me. Many years later I lost myself in the backgrounds that triggered this amazing life style. The motive of the film is the complete denial of any authority other than respect for sensuality and play. The story introduces us to a bunch of those unbound youths in the city of New York. They stumble upon a farmers son, Bukowski, who has traveled to New York in order to fulfill his military duty in Vietnam. The informal leader Berger of the hippie bunch tries to keep Bukowski out of the army, and as a result is forced to take his place. Subsequently he is killed in combat. There can be no doubt that the resistance against the Vietnam war was fully justified, and this creates feelings of empathy and even sympathy for the experiences of the hippie group. On the other hand, it seems hardly honest to abandon all respect for the institutions of our civilization. Real freedom requires the exercise of a certain selfdiscipline, especially if you aim to keep up the rights of others. To be sure, the main philosopher of that time, Herbert Marcuse, advocated a certain amount of selfrepression - although he also suggested to explore its boundaries. I guess this discipline is too absent in the behavior of the main characters, and consequently they become rather pitiful to watch. They live day by day, and seem to forget the future (a similar attitude can be observed in the film Strawberry Statement - actually I can not remember any Hollywood film that shows the good sides of the 68-rebellion). Eventually, the observer comes to the conclusion that his/her first impression was actually right: the hippies indeed have a psychic disorder. Of course this perspective completely changes the interpretation of the film. It raises the question why one should spend more than two hours watching the misbehavior of lunatics. Hair is in fact an anti-film, and that is not my thing. If you appreciate films about social conflict, you might consider reading my other reviews.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just watched Hair after a lapse of 20 years. It struck home. For those of us who tried to stand on the shoulders of the civil rights movement and fight the rule of privilege and power; who resisted the fascism of the Johnson/Nixon administrations; who now as veterans of civil wars fought the war in Vietnam every single day until finally the US beast died and fled; for all who said no in many different ways -- it's remarkable how unsuccessful we were. How large the real table was on which Treat danced. How driven the wizard behind the curtain. We were 20, 22, 24. We didn't know the nature of the enemy. The size of the monster who for the next thirty years and counting would continue to eat the world. How could we? Even with smoke and the bat (the bat!) in our hand, like Treat, we were too young, too middle class, too invested, too much a part of the actions we hated.But there was a moment. As Andre Gregory observes in My Dinner With. . . , there was a moment or two somewhere back there in the late 60's and early 70's when perhaps we could have found something besides the yellow brick road. Something not fueled by Bechtel, prisons, Enron, and Dick. Something collaborative. Something innocent and critical at once. Something with dance.But we missed it. Like Kong bending a girder, the "revolution" was turned in on itself. Into sexism. Racism. Homophobia. And class crushing politics. Until we got to "W". Treat would have hated "W". And Iraq and the pathological lies. If they were in that film. Then. But the moment passed and "W" was almost inevitable. Comprehensive incompetence riding the drunken, raging bull into estuaries, children's lives, and China shops.We should have done something more. Something better.

Jesus had long hair. that's how all men except for the Romans, wore their hair at that time. it's a little ironic how we now tend to associate long hair with wanton Godlessness and short hair with pious observance. conservative square types always think hippies are messed up, when it's more than likely the opposite.personally i think people should wear their hair any d-mn length they please. i have very short hair. for the most part i have always had very short hair and i like it that way. considering my penchant for antiestablishmentarianism, i'm hardly a square egg. i'm no hippie liberal type, but lets just say i can get a little more rowdy than most people. i also happen to think long hair looks sexy on guys.Milos Forman's optimistic and vibrant adaptation of the controversial Broadway rock musical 'Hair', is a breathing testament to American idealism and individualism and a decade that represented some of the most radical social change in the recent history of our young country. deep down Americans have always feared repression and the controlling nature of government. 'Hair' the movie is a true embodiment of those characteristics.not to mention Milos Foreman is a brilliant film director who has never made an artistic failure. i also admire it that Foreman's directing style is always realistic and natural. Foreman never relies on gimmicks like opticals, blue screening and composite shots. every scene is done with much naturalism, even a hallucination sequence which boast many surreal images but no composites or FX to achieve it's imagery.this film also has one of the most convincing depictions of boot camp i've seen outside of Kubrick's 'Full Metal Jacket'. the film also heightens the realism by using authentic locations.this is a great film and a terrific musical. it is also a great statement about human lives and their personal existence, examined and unexamined.</fullReview>

As someone who is anti-war and especially anti-Vietnam-War, it just infuriated me. But it took me far too long to realize the inherent message of optimism, peace, and freedom that the movie carries."Hair" is a film taken from a successful and controversial 1967 stage musical, originally just a series of vignettes powered by songs. The film, at least, is the story of a farm boy who comes to New York City to enlist in the Army and is embraced by members of the hippie movement-- and the War he is going to fight, while the antithesis of what they stand for, is respected by them, and they acknowledge its reality and tragedy. Many of the songs are phenomenally well-written and/or well-performed. And, of course, the opening rotating panoramic shot of a soloist against the backdrop of New York City is purely staggering. The movie is still a little weak and strained in places, and the continuous story interferes with the flow of the songs.The reality is, of the four most notable "hippie movie musicals" of the seventies-- along with "Jesus Christ Superstar," "Godspell," and "Tommy"-- "Hair" is definitely the weakest. But it is one of the most necessary, and its message speaking out against violence and injustice rings clear from a line of the opening number, "Aquarius." "Harmony and understanding, sympathy and trust abounding, no more falsehoods or derisions, golden livin' dreams of visions, mystic crystal revelation and the mind's true liberation" (8/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this movie in the theater. I was 10. I just watched it a second time and I must say it was amazing. The music, the dancing, the acting. It is a great story and told extremely well. I fell absolutely in love with Treat Williams when I was a kid after seeing him in this movie. One of my favorite parts was when his mom kept yelling at him to give her his pants, and then finally said "how much do you need"? (money). That was classic. ; ). Moms are the best. If you haven't seen this movie since it came out I say see it again. It's timeless. It will do what all great movies do; make you laugh, cry, and think.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good music, flawed plot. Deserves a remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie gets a 10 for the music and dancing, but a 5 for everything else. The producers inject a flailing plot into a production that is too fluid, and it sinks. Still, it sounds pretty at the bottom.If you had to watch this film in fast forward, I'd recommend stopping to hear "Aquarius," "Easy to Be Hard," "Walking in Space" and (of course) "The Flesh Failures/Let the Sunshine In." "Black Boys/White Boys" and a few others also entertain, but are staged weakly. If this movie were properly remade, they could shine the way they're supposed to.Overall I gave this movie a 7: amazing singing and choreography that shouldn't be missed, but sadly dragged down by a hammy, conventional plot that has no place in a production as radical as this. I think it's time for a remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not too bad...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I should start off by saying I have something of a love-hate relationship with musicals. Some of them are fantastic, some are downright crap. So I expected Hair to fall into one of those categories. However, it didn't, falling instead in the middle.The songs aren't brilliant, though the "Sodomy" song did make me smile a lot, and everything is rather dated looking. But the movie didn't draw me in as others have, such as Rocky Horror. Although that's a bad example, since for years I hated Rocky Horror, then all of a sudden I got it and have loved it ever since. Maybe Hair will be the same. Although I doubt it will get as much exposure as Rocky Horror due to the language and nudity content, so I doubt I will get the chance to have it grow on me. Gettit? Hair....grow...oh suit yourself.Anyhow, I didn't get to see the last fifteen minutes or so due to a technical glitch, which was a shame, since I would have liked to see how it ended, especially after reading some of the reviews here.Not a film for the casual cinema-goer, but definitely one for musical lovers. I really hope they don't re-make it, though, since I think any such re-make would end up a shallow, pale, PC version of the original.Worth a look for lovers of the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>victory through hair power</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For people like me who were born long after the '60s ended, we can only learn about the era through cultural artifacts, of which "Hair" is one. This is certainly a well done tour de force. One can get a sense of how things were for the hippie culture. Probably the most impressive scene - for me at least - is when the group crashes the rich people's party. As for the movie's final scene, one might interpret it as the symbolic end of everything that the '60s represented.But no matter how one interprets this movie, it's important to understand that even though the '60s themselves may have ended, the movements that typified them still exist in small enclaves. It's a time that people won't soon forget.Anyway, this movie is one that I definitely recommend. Milos Forman scored another great one here, right between his two masterpieces "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" and "Ragtime" (so why did he later make a piece of crap like "Man on the Moon"?!). Starring John Savage, Treat Williams and Beverly D'Angelo.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tragically misguided</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie of Hair is downright sad, because it was really the one shot the musical had to be made into a movie and it's in no way true to the original. Tossing out the original structure and a lot of the best songs, one is left with something that is both a failure as an adaption and pathetically lame judged on its own merits. It does, however, contain an absolutely brilliant opening dance sequence that is probably the best thing Twyla Tharp has ever done. But this movie means there will never be a good movie made of hair.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>interesting....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me summarize this for anyone who has plans on watching it: This story is about the glorification of clueless, jobless, drug using communists/dirty hippies wreaking havoc in society; Stealing cars, begging for money, and being stoned out of thier minds whilst preaching a ghasty philosophy. Disgusting garbage. Any semi intelligent person will soon realize this story and its negative implications. May I repeat it once more? This movie is complete trash. On a positive note, some of the songs are good =)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The music is pretty good.I just kind of thought that the musical that was supposed to be THE musical of the 1960's should have more to it than pointing out that there were hippies in the 60's, and there were people who weren't hippies in the 60's. At some point, Hair starts to hint at developing a plot, but it puts you through a lot of pointless blah blah blah before it unfolds.My problem with Hair isn't that it's pointless, it's that it pretends that it isn't.Also, Treat Williams looks way hotter as a marine than as a hippie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stupidity in America</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Forty years ago I joined with thousands of America's finest young men. Men of all races, colors and creeds. We went off to fight a war against tyranny, to make the world a better place to live. Today I rented the movie "HAIR", hoping that 40 years later it would give some insight into those who did not go to war, believing that 40 years later, I might better understand who and what they were. After watching the movie I've decided that Vietnam veterans "failed" on their return home. We should have come back and destroyed the miserable jerks.. the drug ridden, sexually mis-oriented, know nothing intellectuals who knew nothing. They prostituted their women, themselves, this country and all that it stood for. They destroyed the morales of America, they put their disgusting self pleasures before God and Country and crapped on all that had made America great, in their effort to destroy what millions had died to create. I think the understanding that I got by watching this movie 40 years later is that those creeps are the teachers and politicians of today. No wonder America is in a downward spiral.. God help us all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Godawful, worst Milos Forman movie by far.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've liked Milos Forman's movies since I saw "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" and "Amadeus" (two big masterpieces), but when I saw "Hair", I kept wondering if this was the same Milos Forman. This movie is boring and uninteresting to say the least. OK, the music is pretty good, but on screen it only seems like a bunch of drugged people dancing around (wait a minute... that's what it really is!). In fact, the only interesting part, and the only part where Milos' talent shows up, are the last 15 minutes or so, (SPOILER!!) since when Berger takes Claude's place as a soldier set to the Vietnam war. That 15 minutes are moving and well-directed, but it's a shame that we have to endure so much awful material before that.Well, maybe this is one of those movies you need to be "on the subject" to enjoy (the subject being marijuana, acid and other drugs the film glorifies). I'm not, so...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too One-Sided Slam of "The Establishment"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The play "Hair" was one of the big cultural events of the 1960s whether you agreed with it or not. It captured the spontaneous, youthful exuberance that was in vogue at the time. A revival of the play could re-create the times, but the movie "Hair" does not pass the time-capsule test.Even though times change, sometimes a movie accurately brings you back to the time. You know the type -- a musical like "Singin' in the Rain" or a World War Two film like "Thirty Seconds over Tokyo." Unfortunately, this movie does not pass the "time capsule test." If my kids were to ask me if it was a realistic picture of the Sixties, I'd have to say "Yes, but..." As George W. Bush once said, "When I was young and irresponsible, I was young and irresponsible." Despite the fact that many baby boomers, including our President and ex-president, went through variious degrees of rebellion, sexual experimenting, and drugs, this movie would does NOT stand the test of time.I was in college from 1968 to 1972. My friends were mostly against the war and we LOVED Rock Music -- Jefferson Airplane, the Who, and the Beatles. But none of us touched drugs and we did not trust the hippie wannabes who ran Student Government and the student newspaper. We let our hair grow a little, but we studied hard to get an education. And none of us went to Woodstock.It is very true that the Vietnam war divided this country bitterly. Most young people after the Tet Offensive turned against the war and did not want to go and especially die in vain. "Hair" made a strong anti-war statement. I did not like the way it presented the entire military as Evil. The way that this movie portrays the Armed forces as a bunch of killers is very unfair. The draftees did not want to be there. But it was the politicians who lead the country into that terrible war that still affects us today. I have great respect for all the veterans.If the producers had made the movie prior to 1974 it probably have been a bigger success. However, the movie came out in 1979. About two months later, Iranian students captured the U.S. Embassy. The mood of the country changed overnight. "Hair" was made instantly irrelevant. And I wouldn't recommend it to anyone today. Yeah, the music was OK, the dancing was good, and the was acting so-so.If you want a more accurate movie about the late 60's early 70s, try "The Strawberry Staement, "Woodstock," and "Almost Famous."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you think that "Hair" is a good movie, you obviously can't forget the scene where Treat Williams struts down a table at a fancy soiree, much to the astonishment of the party-goers. But what really makes this scene memorable? It's not really Williams's attitude or his song--it's his choice of dance partner. Do you remember who this pink-outfitted woman is? Our very own Mrs. Garrett of TV's "The Facts of Life." Her ability to tame this young ruffian with her ready wit and perfectly teased, fire-engine red hair show that young hooligans can learn a thing or two from their elders.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rated PG but contains full frontal nudity of a woman and several other nude scenes. Very surface view of the protest movement. The music was okay but some songs were objectionable (Not very complimentary of African Americans) and all of the film came up short. I regret buying it for our library.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The last scene of the movie Hair has a mass of persons in front of a "WhiteHouse" while the song "Let The Sun Shine In" is being sung.The people were all persons who had committed suicide while listening to "a voice" tell them "the voice's story".As "the voice" is speaking about the concerns of a DisneyPayOut which seems to be not taking place because no DirectDeposit(s) have occurred into "the voice's" checking-bank-account."The voice" tells them to go ahead and kill themselves...By faith some do...These are the ones who know their way to The Hall Of Justice Camera in front of The White House in Heaven...They made it!

		<fullReview>I think this film it's completely weird. I also think that before watching this "film" you should smoke marijuana or consume drug because if you don't, you won't understand this movie.The songs (except "It's the Age of Aquarius"), the clothes, the language, the plot, the actors, the scenes, the special effects, the makeup, everything involved with this picture I hate it. I was obligated to watch this film and let me tell you this: it was the most terrible experience of all my life. (I'm sorry Hair fans)I like the style of directing of Milos Forman, but this is his worst picture. My rating: 2 out of 10.</fullReview>
