		<shortDescription>I just can't stop shaking my head</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Upon coming out of Grizzly Man, with my friend, I couldn't help noticing my own face in the reflection of the lobby mirrors... my face was completely blank. I looked over at my friend, and noticed she was merely staring down at her shoes and scratching her nose. Exiting out onto the street, joining the rest of the crowd as we all search for our cars, I couldn't help but believe I was still staring into the lobby mirrors... nearly every head was shaking, and every expression blank. I now believe I will never know how I feel about Timothy Treadwell. A boy who accidentally grew into a man. Grizzly Man immediately opens with the facts surrounding Timothy Treadwell and his girlfriend Amie Huguenard's death. These facts will stay inside you as you grow acquainted with Timothy and the animals surrounding his demise. Sadly, Amie Huguenard remains a faceless mystery.Werner Herzog's soul remains intact, as he gently disassembles the matter of Timothy Treadwell's. Failed actor? Inveterate liar? Misguided Mercenary? Was Timothy Treadwell merely playing out the part of some great Discovery Channel episode in his head? We watch and listen as a lonely Timothy walks and talks into his only companion, a MiniDV camera, about his female problems, drug problems, memories and most importantly his love of animals.Bears and Foxes in particular. There is one thing you could never doubt about this man, and that is of his love for Bears. "I love you, I love you..." We constantly hear him saying to the Bear's and Foxes that had become his "friends" over the years. And through Herzog's direction it is impossible to miss the beauty in this.Timothy Treadwell's photography in this film is absolutely extraordinary. And Mr. Herzog did an extraordinary job putting it all together. In my opinion, this is his best film since Little Dieter Needs To Fly. (Un) fortunately, I cannot stop thinking about it. I cannot stop wondering who this man was... He wrapped himself in bandana's, claimed to be a "Peaceful Warrior", there to protect the Bears. But from what? The arguments were made that acquainting himself with them, he was doing much more harm then good. Why should they get to know a human? How could this help them in the future? And we know how it ended for him...How can you just sit there and watch one mans whole life be wrapped up in a two hour film? And then declare his work meaningless? You can't. Was he just a suicidal man, playing one big act? Was he truly some feral warrior, bringing awareness and the importance of Bear protection and safety to light? Was he a directionless maniac who ultimately got an innocent girl killed?The duality of Timothy Treadwell is merely one more example of the duality of mankind. And the mirror in which I had been looking into had, in fact, been the movie screen itself. Unfortunately, it appears as though he believed the Bears surrounding him shared this depth. And who am I to tell you they don't?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A life both tragic and silly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For thirteen years "grizzly man" Timothy Treadwell went to an Alaskan wildlife refuge on Kodiak Island and pitched his tent alone -- and the last couple of times with a girlfriend (Amy Huguenard) -- spending the summers among huge grizzly bears. The rest of the year he went to schools and "free of charge" showed his films of the bears and his exploits. When the last of his summers drew to a close he and his girlfriend died among the grizzlies as he'd always known -- and even David Letterman had pointed out -- that he might. Filmmaker Werner Herzog, longtime student of crazy eccentric loners on heroic doomed quests, has taken on Treadwell's life and personality as the subject of a rare and powerful documentary. At the heart of "Grizzly Man" are Herzog's selective cullings from film Treadwell left behind chronicling both the bears and his own demons. Herzog has added interviews with women in Treadwell's life, with his parents, with the pilot who took him to and from his campgrounds and later found his and his girlfriend's remains, and with Franc Fallico, the unusually sympathetic and sensitive -- and perhaps a bit looney -- coroner who examined these. The director has bound it all together with his own frank and idiosyncratic narration. The result is a rare sober look at the more delusional aspects of man's relations to wild animals. At times Herzog by implication sympathetically links Treadwell with his former principle star and sparring partner, the late mad eccentric actor Klaus Kinski. Like Kinski Treadwell had tantrums on a film set. But his set was the outdoors and there was no director to spar with; his sparring partners were nature and his own troubled psyche. Nature contained, of course, living witnesses, chief among them the grizzly bears he knows can kill him. He repeatedly tells the camera how much he loves them. He loves the gentler, smaller foxes near whose dens he pitches his tents during the second halves of his summer sojourns. He tells the camera you must be firm with the bears, and he says he knows how to handle them, even though he also repeatedly says he knows he may die there. He is a gambler. Is he a complex man, or merely a confused one? Is he brave, or just foolhardy? What is his purpose in spending all this time among the grizzlies? Is he gathering information, or taking refuge among creatures he need not please, only keep a safe distance from (though he continually comes closer to bears than the park rules and good sense require)? He has a soft sissified manner and voice and even says he wishes he were gay. But he also rants and rages embarrassingly and tiresomely against unseen enemies, poachers, sightseers, rangers, hunters, park officials, the whole urban settled world he runs from to this world he idealizes and blindly sees as perfect. As Herzog notes, Treadwell sought to disregard nature's cruelty, and any time it was in his face -- as when the bears were starving in a dry spell and began eating their own young -- he sought to manipulate nature to eliminate the ugliness. He faults not the bears but the rain gods. Young Timothy according to his parents was an ordinary boy who loved animals from childhood and got a diving scholarship to college. But he injured his back and quit college and he drank and when he went to LA to act and didn't get a part on Cheers he "spiraled down." He never had a lasting relationship with a woman and the drinking became serious and constant. In vain he tried programs, meetings, self-discipline -- but the drinking went on and was killing him. Finally he got sober for the grizzlies and the foxes. He decided to devote his life to them and he pledged to them that he would be clean and healthy. It was a miracle. Yet he remained not only manic-depressive but passive-aggressive, as his alternations between gentle declarations of love of the animals and his spewing of vitriol against the civilized world attest.Treadwell's soft-voiced declarations of love and sweetness among the grizzlies would be beautiful -- if such behavior, in a world of extreme physical risk, surrounded by limber lumbering beasts with great teeth and long claws, while preening for the camera with caps and bandanas and golden locks in a dozen alternate takes -- were not criminally silly and irresponsible. Herzog hides none of this in his portrait, which is both sympathetic and ruthless.As the years passed the Grizzly Man found transitions back to civilization harder and harder to make. On the last occasion, an airport official infuriated him by questioning the validity of his ticket and he turned around with his girlfriend -- who was afraid of bears! -- and returned to the "maze," the most dangerous of his summer campgrounds because it wasn't in the open where the bears could see him and steer clear but among their burrows and the brush. It was later than he ever stayed and the bears he knew and had names for were hibernating now, replaced by new unknown and more hostile and nasty animals. He must also have been more desperate, perhaps more careless? We see the bear that probably devoured him and the woman.Herzog has access to everything, even an audio-only tape of Timothy and Amy's truly grizzly death. He spares us, though.As Herzog begins his film by stating, Timothy Treadwell crossed a line between wild animal and human that should never be crossed. This is a line so many other touchy-feely "nature" and "wildlife" films cross. See "The March of the Penguins" and you'll have a prime example. "Grizzly Man" isn't meant to be about grizzlies. It's about men who cross that line -- who willfully misunderstand nature for their own misguided reasons, to serve their own dysfunctional needs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Perfect Match</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone who has followed the trajectory of Werner Herzog from the time of "Even Dwarfs Started Small" will understand the immediate appeal that the Treadwell story must have had for this intensely brilliant German director. Treadwell must have seemed to Herzog like a Laguna Beach version of his Fitzcarraldo and his Aguirre and even of Herzog himself in his more unhinged moments. This film appears at first to be a fair minded documentary about Tim Treadwell, the 'protector' of all things natural and wild in the remote regions of Alaska. What Herzog shows us, however, is that what Treadwell really needed protection from was reality itself and that his escape into the wilds was just a deadly game of denial. The film is also a meditation on the brute force of nature, on art and on human hubris. My wife found the 'character' of Tim Treadwell so ludicrous and offensive that she had to leave the theater. For my part, I was in awe of both Treadwell's incredible physical courage coupled with his absolute lack of judgment and his insane narcissism. He struck me as a cross between Pee-Wee Herman and Marlon Perkins, the guy who narrated the Mutual of Omaha nature documentaries that showed up on Sunday afternoons in the 60's and 70's.The word is that Hollywood, in the person of Leonardo DiCaprio, was a financial supporter of Treadwell's 'mission'in Alaska and that a Hollywood version of the story is due out sometime soon with Di Caprio playing the lead. I know I won't be going to see that version because it will just continue the lie and the myth that Treadwell tried so hard to create and sustain. Even at his most intense moments of profoundity Treadwell had nothing to 'say' to anyone about either bears or himself. It was all self-serving and self-congratulatory and it is only in his grotesque death at the hands of a rogue grizzly that any meaningful message finally comes across. (Herzog thankfully spares us from the actual experience which was caught on audio but not on video because the lens cap had been left on.)Its hard not to feel sorry for Tim Treadwell and the young woman who died with him, but the 'native' scientist in the film put it quite nicely "My people have been living nicely with bears for thousands of years and we know enough to stay out of each other's way."Tim Treadwell wanted desperately to cross the boundary into the 'way' of the bear because the 'way of the human' was too much for him. Despite his goofy, childish demeanor he revealed himself to be a man of deep anger and resentment. However, if the bears had let him live he would probably be considered something of a folk-hero in 'reality' obsessed America.Herzog shows us that there was nothing real about Treadwell at all and that the bears knew a lot more about him than he ever would of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another complex protagonist for Herzog</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Timothy Treadwell was not a well man when he spent 13 years among the brown Grizzlies in Alaska until his time ran out one day as dinner for one of them. For me "not well" means he didn't quite understand that no matter how much he "loved" the bears, they couldn't always return the favor.For director Werner Herzog, of Aguirre: The Wrath of God and Fitzcarraldo fame, most of his work is devoted to eccentric and often crazed but charismatic leading men. He captures in his voice-over the essential madness of Treadwell in his new film, Grizzly Man. Using over 100 hours of the young man's footage and narration, Herzog fashions an objective documentary of Treadwell's rise and fall. At one point Herzog explains over a close up shot of a grizzly's eyes that he sees nothing but "the overwhelming indifference of nature." The emptiness of Treadwell's assertion that he knows the bears is only too evident when we listen to the animated report of the coroner as he reconstructs the mauling of Treadwell and his girlfriend. Treadwell did, however, predict he would "live and die" with his friends.Thus, Herzog has another complex protagonist with hubris and innocence enough to guarantee early passage from life. This documentary does well showing Treadwell's love of drama, his alienation from society, and his superior naiveté when it comes to formidable animals such as the grizzly. Herzog also offers memorable photography of Alaska and Treadwell's own footage, which shows him often too close to the bears. However, Timothy did last for 13 years among them; he just seemed to forget that he could not win that game.Treadwell says of the grizzlies, "Everything about them is perfect." Everything about Timothy is not. Grizzly Man is a cautionary tale about crossing the invisible line between man and beast, the cost of ignorance, and the allure of a personal vision, in this case that of a lost soul who discovers his calling but goes beyond what is allowed to mortals. Grizzly Man will help you overcome romantic notions about wild beasts (and pesky Alaskan black flies).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loved Herzog, but could not sympathize with Treadwell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***Possible Spoilers*** "Grizzly Man" is a documentary of Tim Treadwell who spends 13 summers in Alaska living amongst grizzly bears and eventually loses his life to the creatures to which he devoted all his heart.I saw "Grizzly Man" without knowing anything about it. I first thought it would be a documentary about the beauty and behavior of grizzly bears. However, through Tim Treadwell's interaction with grizzly bears, Werner Herzog shows that this film is actually about the inadequacies and insecurities of human nature.Tim Treadwell seems to be the culmination of many of the deficiencies that man possesses. I felt absolutely no sympathy for this individual, despite the fact that he suffered a tragic and horrible death. If it weren't bears that killed him, it probably would've been something else. He was definitely headed toward a downward spiral. I felt like he was a man who ran away from his demons because he could not face or overcome it. He developed high "ideals" and when he could not adjust his values and beliefs to that of society, he abandoned it and sought out for acceptance from creatures that are incapable of judging or criticizing Treadwell. Unfortunately, Treadwell mistakes the grizzly bears' indifference or incompetence as a sign of acceptance, and falls in love with them.Treadwell displayed behavior suggestive of manic depressive disorder, or cyclothymic disorder, or histrionic personality disorder. His emotional reactions to incidents were over dramatic to the point that one questions whether it's genuine. I also thought that he was a closet homosexual who could not accept his sexual orientation. In the film, Treadwell talks about wishing he were gay because it would be easier, but he denies being gay. He also talks about how he has trouble with keeping relationships with girls. I know this is a big assumption, but I couldn't help but question whether he was running away from civilization hoping he didn't have to face the reality of his sexual orientation. Treadwell is a person who does not know himself, and is afraid to find out.I also did not like the fact that Treadwell was on this unsubstantiated high horse. This self-proclaimed protector of animals and nature displays his hypocrisy in at least 2 scenes. When Treadwell stumbles upon poachers who throw rocks at a baby cub, all he does is hide behind a bush and criticizes the hunters for hurting the bear. Not quite what a "protector" would do. Also, when Treadwell discovers the dead fox, he gets angry for the destruction and death that exists in this world. However, he doesn't blink twice to try to swap a fly that is buzzing around the fox. Obviously he shows no respect for the fly, which is also a living organism.Also, throughout the film, most of Treadwell's friends glorify all that he represented. It seems that his death has elevated him to a martyr, and I found that inappropriate. I don't believe one's achievements in life should be overblown and exaggerated because he or she suffered a tragic and violent death. Based on Treadwell's self-recordings, I find that he has done nothing to deserve any praise. The way he died is sad, but that should not have any bearing on what he did in life. If anything, Treadwell encroached upon the grizzly bears' territory, and abused their independence and way of life in order to hide behind the mask of his own demons. I find nothing altruistic about his actions because of that.In the film, Herzog says that death and destruction is a unavoidable reality of nature, and he has done a brilliant job in portraying that. My take home message was that everything bad in this world exists because man is too weak and feeble-minded to transcend beyond our natural tendencies to destroy his surroundings and to self-destruct. And Treadwell is the perfect example. Great job Mr. Herzog.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a kind of master's class in a schizo documentary- sometimes quite amusing and entertaining, other times very somber and depressing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This documentary, written, directed, and narrated by German madman maestro Werner Herzog, has very little in it that isn't worth seeing, and at its best brings some of the most captivating, candid, and entertaining documentary footage of the year. The subject matter is an environmentalist/bear nut named Timothy Treadwell, a nobody who became a kind of weird celebrity for living each summer on an Alaskan wildlife preservation with Grizzly bears. He also documented a lot of his time on the island, which Herzog chooses wisely for his film on him. Treadwell may or may not have totally believed a fate like death among his co-habitants would come (there is one scene where he says he'd die for them, another when he says he's safe). But his fate did come, along with his girlfriends, rather grisly as we hear from the details (which, wisely, we never see).One is tempted to comment on Treadwell, as he is (much as with Herzog's protagonists in his fiction films) possessive, ambitious, naive, dazed, emotional, but somehow in tune with his own sense of nature and the ways of the world. Herzog himself comments a good deal on Treadwell, when he agrees with him, when he doesn't (Herzog, as Roger Ebert pointed out, does have a bleak world-view as opposed to Treadwell's overly optimistic one). What one can comment on is the execution of the material. We get interviews with Treadwell's close friends (one platonic, one not), the people who found his and his girlfriend's bodies in the forest, and a couple of nearby experts (one Native American comments on how Treadwell did what they had never done in 7,000 years, to cross a boundary that was respected). Herzog also gives us majestic, spacious images of Alaskan wilderness, and gives some ample time for footage of the bears and foxes.If not for Treadwell's rather high &amp; low nature (as a friend comments), this might be a very standard documentary on a bear expert. But because of the documentary- or near television hosting footage (I sometimes felt like I was seeing a nicer, if stranger version, of the Croc Hunter)- of Treadwell on camera by himself, the film gets another dimension. It's also a help that in combating the grim reality of what became of him (Herzog's narration is this rather sad, if praising side), it's rather funny to see Treadwell in his behavior on screen. In some subtle ways he's in a more 'normal' state of mind than the rest of us- he loves his bears (whom, by the way, he gave names to; he stands his ground against the occasional poachers); he has that mix of sentimentality and rawness that is needed to live for so long in the wilderness. The absurdity of it usually brings the laughs, but even behind them there is always a constant curiosity about him. We learn that he wanted to be an actor, which lead to a bad, near fatal spell before his 'bear' retreat, acting as more of a spiritual catalyst more than anything else. Even if some of this footage is a little zany, over-the-top, or may go far on his name, it is honest to a kind of schizo degree. We almost wouldn't want Treadwell to be normal, and go figure- Herzog would have no interest in him. In the end, despite Herzog's comments (which aren't the best parts of the film to me), his film tries not to pass judgment on Treadwell, letting his actions and other testimonies speak for themselves. And, if nothing else, it's compulsively (for a certain movie-viewer) watchable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best film during Sundance and one of the greatest Doc's EVER!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warner Herzog is a brilliant and masterful director. The way he put together the story of Tim Treadwell and his life with grizzly's defies the constructs of formulaic "nature" doc's. It goes deep, as we are allowed to dive into the mind and psyche's of both Treadwell and Herzog as Treadwell's fated story is revealed to us through bits of the 100 hours of footage Treadwell left behind, new interviews, insights, and a brilliant and personal narrative done by Herzog himself.As Herzog gets to know Treadwell through his footage and loved ones left behind, he is touched, changed, and allows the audience to revel in his new found awe, frustrations, and respect for Treadwell's life.The film documents the life of "the Girzzly Man" timothy Treadwell through his leftover footage from thirteen summers he lived with, and immersed himself into the grizzly habitat and culture. He felt he was a grizzly, and thus broke boundaries that have been respected among the Alaskan natives concerning these brown beasts. He created what he felt to be a bond, a brotherhood with these majestic animals. But was this conquest purely for scientific reasoning or was he truly terrified of the "human world." That is where Herzog directs this film.The fascinating thing about Herzog's interviews is what he catches after his participants are done answering his questions, and we see these souls search and ponder for answers to questions they may never know the answer too."Grizzly Man" won the Alfred P. Sloan award at this years Sundance film festival, which goes to the film felt to tie in science and discovery into normal narrative paradigm. This film deserved it's praise and was thusly purchased for theatrical release by Lions Gate before it's release on television through Discovery films.When you get the chance, don't just run to your local theater or television to view this masterpiece, leap and sprint. This is an important and beautiful piece, one that will touch and move all those who allow it to. This is the best of the fest in my opinion, and maybe even of the year, and it is only January.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Treadwell: An addict not in recovery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Grizzly Man works on a lot of different levels. However, as a recovering addict and alcoholic, what I found most interesting about the film was how it exposed Timothy Treadwell as an addict (alcoholic) who may have swapped his substance addiction (drugs and alcohol) for a process addiction (gambling, sex, danger) with the bears. Like all addicts in their disease(and not in recovery), he basically needed more and more bear to get the same fix (high) he experienced during his initial contact with them.With all addictions, there is a progressive movement away from truth. As Timothy's bear addiction moved him away from reality and toward a state of "insanity." His distorted thinking becomes apparent in the footage he shot of himself (that was never aired on his TV Special, The Grizzly Diaries). "Addictions (without recovery) are almost always progressive and fatal." -- Anne Wilson SchaefEverything about Timothy's behavior, from the misplaced anger at the Forest Service and exaggerated paranoia about poachers, to his delusional thinking about actually being a bear, showed a person trapped in their disease and moving further away from reality. Add to the fact, that his impaired thinking process was based upon faulty beliefs. And this is where his lack of formal training or education in zoology, or any of the natural sciences, really came back to bite him. (No pun intended). A "non-addict" thinking person would have understood that if a male bear will kill cubs to stop a female bear from lactating so that she'll want to mate again, and that hungry bears do eat other bears to survive, that maybe they could eat me too!Like all addicts, Timothy became progressively self-centered, isolated, paranoid, confused, controlling, perfectionist, blinded to his disease (denial), insane, blaming (projection), and dysfunctional. In short, his life had become unmanageable. And ultimately it put him, his girlfriend and at least two bears to death. Herzog's film works as a tragedy. But also serves as a cautionary tale for all addicts, that can be summed-up by a lyric from Neil Young: "The very thing that makes you live, can kill you in the end." -- Neil Young</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not just a morality tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some would like to see 'Grizzly Man' as a morality tale, with the death of Timothy Treadwell an example for people not to follow. On the contrary, I see Treadwell as a tragic figure, not someone to be merely ridiculed and dismissed. Like a character in a play foreshadowing his own downfall, Treadwell repeatedly mentions the fact that his close proximity to the bears puts him in serious danger, and that he could be eaten if he is not careful. What Treadwell sees as his reason for existence and his greatest source of happiness ultimately destroys him. Herzog portrays him as he really was, a multi-faceted, complicated man, whose dreams sadly did not conform to our world.It is fair to say that Treadwell was eccentric and delusional. Treadwell imagined himself as a champion and protector of the grizzlies, when in reality they were in little danger. He saw in his beloved grizzlies an idealised world of love and harmony. All the love and beauty that Treadwell thought was missing from civilisation he projected onto the bears. He was naive and delusional in that he failed to acknowledge the brutality and misery that are constants in our world. It is heartbreaking to see him encounter the half-chewed paw of a dead bear cub. Herzog's narration outlines his more pessimistic view of life and nature, where sorrow and ugliness are constants, not aberrations. Treadwell's violent death would prove Herzog right, adding to the tragedy and sadness created by this film. Treadwell was not a violent or evil man - he just didn't fit into our world. His belief that the world can be made a better place leads to his destruction. Herzog's film brilliantly captures the poignant sadness of Treadwell's death.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How do you feel after seeing this movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like it when I do know know how to feel! Herzog seems to start out by portraying a man, Timothy Treadwell, as a crazy, self-obsessed (NOT Grizzly-obsessed) individual who gets himself and his girlfriend killed for no purpose, in the Alaskan wilderness. Initially I thought that the story was a cross between 'Jackass' and the Discovery Channel - you have a dopey, though he only sounds like it, blonde surfer type who likes to approach (awfully close) and make sweet-talk with 10-foot bears. Viewers might see Timothy as a reckless, selfish misfit, but as the film continues, your appreciation for his cause deepens - but what is his cause? Is it to work out personal demons? Absolutely. Treadwell clearly has mental/emotional problems, just listen to how many times he tells the wild animals "I love you!" or when he talks about his lack of success with "human women." But his passion for the grizzlies and their wilderness is real. Herzog particularly commends him as a filmmaker, seizing unique opportunities and rendering priceless footage. Do not forget that TT lived close to the bears for 13 years (including the year he was killed) without harm; and that his success, his careful, intuitive, loving behavior was only partly self-aggrandizing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is something else...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the first Werner Herzog movie I've seen. I don't really know how to review a movie like that, since I feel I can't judge it by the usual standards. Some parts of it were really sad and moving. Others sent chills up my spine. One scene specifically (about Timothy's watch) was really contrived. But my favorite thing about the movie I think was how Herzog usually left the camera rolling for a few seconds after the interviewees finished what they had to say, just to capture those moments of silence and (sometimes) awkwardness, which felt really authentic. I think Herzog saw a lot of himself in Timothy's tortured soul. Also, one of the most breathtaking scenes in the movie is where Timothy captures an intense fight between two bears.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dangerous passion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there was anyone at all to take this story to the screen, Werner Herzog, the distinguished German director, would have been our first choice. Mr. Herzog, a man who knew madness first hand, as his association to Klaus Kinsky proved, is a man that could make this documentary work in the way it does.We follow an obsessed man, Tim Treadwell, whose love for the grizzly bears consumed him. Mr. Treadwell's own life, away from that setting, was nothing to speak of, but let him loose in the Alaska wilderness and he became a figure as large, as the bears he loved and cared for so much. Tim's passion for the grizzlies took him to appoint himself as the savior of the animals. This was a man that didn't pay attention to the dangers around him, because as all consumed individuals in search of greatness for achieving something, he lost track of what was real and what wasn't. Tim even gets his girlfriend Amie Huguenard involved in his quest for protecting the bears. At the same time, Mr. Treadwell is seen also with the foxes of the area, who didn't pose the same danger as the great brown bears.What Mr. Herzog has achieved is to show us the man in the mission he set out for himself, expanding in the material Mr. Treadwell had amassed on his own. The director shows us breathtaking views of Alaska, as probably never has been shown before. The cinematography takes our breath away. The Katmai National Park has never been seen in its glorious splendor before."Grizzly Bear", like "The March of the Penguins", currently playing in local cinemas, is a welcome diversion from the typical summer Hollywood fare of films that are big on special effects that don't add anything to our enjoyment because the adhere to the same tired old formula.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tragic story of a self centered individual</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a person, who spends hundreds of hours each year, educating people, especially students on the proper manner in which to act around wildlife, I find this true-life story to be disturbing and most of all will set the educational wildlife industry back many years.Mr. Treadwell, was not an amateur wildlife expert, but a self centered anti social person, who found an imagined cause to add meaning to his life, he has no training with wildlife, and most certainly not with the Alaskan brown bear.He shows his 'thumbing his nose' attitude at the Park Service, the Law and most of all the rest of the respectful wildlife and nature lovers in the world. His reckless attitude eventually led to the demise of two Alaskan brown bears, and another human being.His close relationship with wild foxes, led the very young girl in the row in front of me to believe this was a cool and neat thing to do, and I have to wondering with this film and the next projects which show Mr. Treadwell doing these illegal activities, how many young children will think it is okay, which will lead to the unneeded destruction of wildlife, as well as the associated injuries that will occur to other humans.In not once instance in this film, did I ever observe his actions as being protective of the bears, as they are not endangered, they are not hunted and there has been no documented case of illegal hunting of these bears in the last 28 years, in fact the bears in this film, are quite conditioned to the human beings that visit them every year to observe and take pictures of them. The bear that eventually caused the demise of Tim, was not part of the community that he says he lived with, but an interior bear, which has a different makeup, then the coastal bears who are quite familiar and tolerant of humans.Mr. Herzog's narration and showcase of Mr. Treadwell, works in the fact that is shows an individual, who for some macabre reason, had a wish to destroy himself and his companion, as well as the bears, he professed to love so much, his love was to elevate his standing as a self made star, his arrogance to the wild creatures of Alaska was quite transparent, and as stated will have to be undone, by the educational community.I don't feel his interviews with the associated parties of this story show anything more than individuals who knew of Timothy's destructive nature and how they are more than happy to make a buck off of this tragic story, I saw very little emotion from any of his friends or family, which I am sure is not the whole truth, but all individuals interviewed in the making of this film, seemed to be quite aware, that Tim was on a self centered destructive course, which had a predetermined outcome, that was set in place many years ago The M.E. at best was star struck, and the Native American curator, was disgusted with the actions of Tim.In closing, if we use this film to actually educate the public, by showing all the wrongs Tim practiced, then perhaps, the loss of life and wildlife, will have some meaning, this is not an action thrill adventure, but a very important story on how not to act in the wilds of America and the world!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>{Viewed 04-01-2005 - Whitefish, MT.} This is the story of Tim Treadwell, a man whose work with bears was more about self-gratification that it was of protecting the bears from poachers and the government, as he claims he was doing. Tim photographed and videotaped for 13 seasons in the wilds of Alaska and then took his films on the road and showed schoolchildren across the country a world that most will never see. Tim was born in Fla. to a stable family, was a B student in school, excelled on the swim team, went to college on a swimming scholarship and eventually dropped out due to the drinking problem he developed in college. Tim ended up going to Hollywood where he unsuccessfully tried to land roles (Coming in 2nd to Woody Harrelson for the bartenders' role in "Cheers") which further increased his chemical dependency. Tim then decides to go to Katmai National Park in Alaska to be with the Alaskan Brown Bears (which he continually calls "Grizzly" bears) need his protection (albeit they are on a federally protected bear refuge) and that in order to do it properly, he must not be "screwed up" and we assume stopped drinking. Undoubtedly, Treadwell in his 13 seasons in Alaska took some of the most breathtaking media of the Alaskan wild ever witnessed. His interaction with the wild foxes is something that must be witnessed and the extreme close-up's of the Brown Bears are unlike anything you have ever seen. But having no sort of wildlife background, he ignores signs that the bears are not always happy with is presence. He openly disregarded laws about not moving his camp one mile once a week and getting within 100 yards of the bears. As the movie goes on, it shows a more and more anti-societal, anti-government Treadwell go on a blue-streaked tirade about the Natl. Park Service and that it is actually HIM that is responsible for saving these bears. He brags himself up that he is camping in the most dangerous place in the world and it is only him who is capable of doing such feats as others would be eaten dead! His girlfriend Amie Huguenard, is shown on film a total of three times for a total of less than one minute of the over 100 hours of footage that Treadwell filmed. One point shows Treadwell getting of his charter plane and saying to someone to get out of the shot because people are supposed to think that he is the only one up there.It is revealed later on that Tim Treadwell started to tell people he was from Australia and tried to even pass of the accent. Think about it, A big, strong, sandy-haired well built man trying to be with one with ferocious carnivores; Didn't Steve Irwin already apply for and get that job back in 1992 when his 1st documentary was seen? The difference is Steve was born into a family that had the background and education needed to be taken seriously.On a side note, the man they had who was the medical examiner, seemed far too staged and cheesy acting to be a real medical examiner. If he is the real thing, I think it is time for him to find another line of work. Maybe it is because I have personal experience in this field, but not one of the morticians or M.E.'s that I know behave like that. I felt it cheapened what was fairly consistent set of interviews with families and friends.We never do get to hear any of the last audio moments of Tim and Amie as they were attacked. Maybe it would make the next Tim Treadwell in attendance at a "Grizzly Man" viewing stop and think twice before dragging his girlfriend off into the woods to both be killed and eaten. There is nothing wrong with following your dreams, just make sure you are awake when you do it and firm grip of the reality that can befall you when you forget that these are called WILD animals for a reason. 6 out of 10 Stars for one-of-a-kind content that cost two people their lives.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hubris Brings Down a Quixotic Man-Child in the Wilderness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Werner Herzog has created an outstanding documentary feature, adeptly letting Timothy Treadwell's work speak for itself. Herzog interjects his own opinions only on occasion and makes no attempt to demonize or rehabilitate Treadwell's complicated legacy. The footage of the grizzlies is amazing, something far more intimate (for better and for worse) than anything I have ever seen in other documentary footage. It is almost beyond belief that Treadwell lasted 13 years in Alaska among these bears before he finally met his end. He had deluded himself into thinking that he had earned (or been given by God?) some kind of special immunity from harm among these animals. What complicates this delusion is the fact that he knew he had to behave as a "gentle warrior" among the grizzlies in order to fend off their occasional aggressive maneuvers. This description, although somewhat romanticized, at least acknowledges a rational need for some form of protection among the bears. Treadwell decides to camp in the heart of the "Grizzly Maze" almost as a means of proving his special ability to survive the dangers that would no doubt capture and claim ordinary men. He dares the wilderness to take his life---and it does. I agree with Herzog's decision not to play the audio recording of the attack. Seeing the expression on the ex-girlfriend's face as Herzog listens to the tape himself is very poignant. Herzog, however, seems to grandstand a bit when he counsels the woman to destroy the tape and never listen to it. The woman should be allowed to make up her own mind what to do with the tape and does not need Herzog's or anyone else's advice in that regard. However, this is a minor quibble against so many skillful moments brought to life in Herzog's film. On a final note, I think that Treadwell missed his calling---he was definitely a Fox Man rather than a Grizzly Man! Those foxes adored him!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grizzly Men</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It would be rather easy and quite comforting to simply label Timothy Treadwell as a delusional crackpot who ultimately received his just deserts. Treadwell's woefully naive idealism coupled with his willful rejection of the most basic realities of his natural surroundings make him a rather wieldy target for even those with terrible aim. Treadwell's inability to anticipate the inevitable consequences of his actions has been interpreted by many to signify the man's complete separation from any resemblance of realism and sensibility, thus marking his extensive efforts as purely frivolous and futile. But by merely dismissing the man's Utopian vision of a harmonious existence between humankind and nature, we're ultimately doing a great disservice to ourselves as well. Werner Herzog, one of the cinematic world's preeminent cynical jackasses, was able to both understand and empathize with Treadwell's contorted optimism, refusing to conveniently sticker Tim as some sort of brain damaged, new-age spiritualist. Herzog discovered inside of Treadwell's madness an alluringly gullible romanticism that carefully shielded a secluded demonic realism. Treadwell's refusal to succumb to the demands of our world's primitive natural order clearly fascinated Herzog just as much as Tim's secretively smoldering fixation with the indigenous inhumanity of the unforgiving material world.Herzog ingeniously incorporates Treadwell's tangential metaphysical ruminations into the movie in order to communicate his own conflicting philosophical perspectives while also conveying a semblance of sympathy and familiarity, if not outright accordance as well. Herzog immediately empathizes with Treadwell's desire to search for some higher meaning beyond the discernible limits of both sanity and security, but does not fail to readily concede the enigmatic stupidity of Timothy's misguided enthusiasm as well. In many respects, the movie explores many similarities between Treadwell's adventurous pursuits and Herzog's well-documented desire to impose his own will on the natural world. For all of Herzog's pontificating on nature's unmistakable indifference, such confessed naturalism has never stopped the man from attempting to conquer these impartial forces through sheer fierce determination. Similarly for Treadwell, even the unequivocal evidence suggesting the inapplicability of his philosophical disposition (the murder of a baby fox, the infanticide of a baby cub, instances of cannibalism during an extended drought) is not enough to dissuade him from the attractiveness of his hallucinatory insistence on the beauty and simplicity of the natural wilderness. While Herzog mocks and scolds Treadwell for his blatant ignorance with regards to the childlike Quixotism of his pilgrimage, he also seems to secretly admire him for his refusal to conform to others' expectations, even when all the impulses of the universe seem to be conspiring against him. Like Aguirre and Fitzcarraldo, Herzog is able to extract carefully hidden noble qualities buried within a man of very questionable character.In many respects, Timothy Treadwell's quest for natural harmony was an unattainable search for spiritual absolution as well as social vindication. Herzog shows great respect for Treadwell's intense desire to discover a sense of place and purpose within a higher immaterial order, while similarly displaying affection for Timothy's corporeal drive to convincingly demonstrate both his superiority and masculinity to all of those who had expressed doubts and engaged in interference. Herzog has always reserved his greatest admiration for those great historical figures who have unleashed their greatest ambitions upon the natural world around them, and Treadwell is clearly no exception. But this is not because of some juvenile fascination with conquest and subjugation; Herzog's veneration has always been directed towards the instinctual human passion to satisfy one's greatest aspirations, forces of the uncaring universe be damned. Treadwell's absurd eagerness to prove the feasibility of his ideological utopia is sufficient enough to earn Herzog's qualified approbation, but it is not practical enough to stave off Herzog's equally powerful adherence to rational skepticism. Just as Herzog ultimately recognized the folly of Aguirre's ways, Timothy Treadwell is similarly depicted as a man who has become so lost within his untamed search for grandeur that he has forgotten the very purpose of his once innocent expedition.Many people have taken issue with this back and forth dialogue between Herzog and Treadwell, bemoaning the use of voice-over narration as manipulative, theatrical and unnecessary. Many people have accused the movie of being quite staged and overtly fictional, while needlessly abandoning the most basic purpose of Treadwell's adventure in order to posit some hackneyed, sophomoric philosophical dichotomy that was completely beyond Timothy's intentions and perhaps comprehension as well. But without Herzog's added abstract speculations, Treadwell's undertakings lose a great deal of larger significance and withstanding permanence. Without Herzog interjecting his own balanced suppositions, we're unable to see just how Treadwell's acts of defiance are not only acts of pure lunacy, but acts of poignant proclivity as well. It would indeed be easy to categorize Treadwell's activities as little more than the product of years of alcohol and drug abuse coupled with prolonged bouts of frustration and isolation, but it is infinitely more difficult to recognize his actions as a manifestation of a much deeper, exclusively human predilection to create meaning in one's life by imposing order upon one's natural surroundings. Werner Herzog's (and it is Werner Herzog's) Grizzly Man is not only a fervent rebuke of the unfeasible insanity of Timothy Treadwell's hopeless optimism, but also a tempered celebration of humanity's imperishable stubbornness, arrogance, and inspiring audacity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An intriguing, but ultimately incomplete look at a total mallet-head</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What would you say about a man who feels compelled to videotape and live in close quarters with wild grizzly bears for seasons at a time without a firearm to protect himself? You might expect he is doing so as part of a government or university-sponsored longitudinal study in the habits of these majestic and fearsome animals.But that's not what Timothy Treadwell was doing.In 'Grizzly Man,' a Werner Herzog documentary of Treadwell's exploits, we encounter not so much a learned man of science and his discoveries as we do a complete fruitcake with a death wish.Comprised entirely of Treadwell's extensive footage along with separate, after-the-fact interviews, sewn together with Herzog's ponderous voice-over narration, this film achieves a near 'This is Spinal Tap,' level of unintended absurdity. But instead of inviting us to ponder the merits of an amplifier with an extra-high setting ( this amp goes to e-leven), the comically effeminate Treadwell increasingly attributes human motivations to wild animals that would just as soon eat his face.After a sequence in which he has taped two gorgeously majestic grizzly bears dueling like mother nature's own fur-bearing titans, Treadwell seems just a little giddy afterwards about the fact that in the course of battle one of the animals had, as Treadwell put it, "made a B.M." Evidence of his dementia mounts as we see him affectionately handling grizzly excrement, scolding foxes like children, sleeping with stuffed animals, and routinely putting himself in the path of hungry bears.Hey, Tim, I don't know if you've heard this or not, but "BEARS EAT PEOPLE!"Aside from occasionally beautiful video of wild bears up close and what might be considered useful information on standing one's ground when confronted with a grizzly in the wild, Treadwell's contribution seems to have given way to naked self-aggrandizement. This less-than-noble goal comes into stark relief when his parents speak of the downward spiral his spirits took after having, allegedly, lost a chance to play a role on the TV show, 'Cheers.' A lifelong animal-lover, Treadwell then appears to have restyled himself as America's Steve Irwin -- the famously daring Australian crocodile enthusiast. Treadwell is even alleged in the film to have tried changing his name and adopting an Australian accent for a time.Without really covering his business dealings, one might expect Treadwell was attempting, variously, over the course of his undertakings in Alaska, to sell his persona and adventures as documented on videotape, but wasn't having much luck. His would-be customers probably came to the same conclusion we do. That a TV show about wild bears and the hockey puck who thinks he should live in their midst would be a lot better if it starred a genuine naturalist with ANY kind of credentials who didn't behave like a flaming homosexual.In one rather revealing sequence, Treadwell waxes wistfully on the benefits of a gay lifestyle, but jars it up afterwards like a bad liar protesting too much. Indeed, if one wanted to play amateur psychologist, one would probably quickly come to the conclusion -- especially after we meet his no-nonsense, Eisenhower-era parents -- that Treadwell was in full-blown denial about his sexual identity and that he had probably decided to come out after he was rich and famous a la Ellen Degeneres.But after 13 years, the film shows us, Treadwell's work was going largely unnoticed. The inference one is invited to make is that he was starting to realize that the only way he'd ever gain any notoriety would be if he were killed by these bears.And of course, ultimately, this is exactly what happens. He and his girlfriend are mauled to death and devoured by a bear I'm convinced Treadwell knew was a danger to them both. An audio record of the attack exists but is not played in the film.What would cause someone to walk out into the woods and basically beg to be gobbled up by wild bears? Inasmuch as this film poses and then answers that question, it is intriguing and definitely worth watching. But it fails to fully explore what could have truly motivated Treadwell and lets him get compared to Thoreau and other great naturalists who didn't view nature as some sort of foil for their own personal problems. Treadwell was a nature enthusiast, certainly beloved by a number of kindred misfit souls, but what comes across in Herzog's outtakes is someone who is clearly disturbed and in need of some therapy. To the degree it buys into Treadwell's cover story -- he's just fighting for those misunderstood bears -- the film fails utterly.Treadwell was, finally, a tragically pathetic figure so starved for recognition he was willing to endanger his own life, the lives of others in his community ( habituating bears to the company of humans, not to mention giving them a taste for people ), and the life of his faithful partner. To the degree the film helps us reserve our pity for those he hurt, the film is a stunning success.The worst thing you can say about 'Grizzly Man' is that it does for Timothy Treadwell just what his death by digestion intended: makes him famous.This movie review by Erik Gloor</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The only tragedy is that he lived as long as he did</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only thing I can think is that the viewing public is as stupid as their love of reality T.V. suggests, and so incapable of rational thought, that Timothy Treadwell seems like a man to be revered for his actions. He didn't even conduct "bad" science. He didn't do any research at all. He didn't contribute one piece of valuable information about grizzly bears. He was on land that was protected. He couldn't have protected the bears if there had been a threat, he was unarmed. He just went out and stood in front of grizzlies for 15 years (I did enjoy it every time he jumped when one came at him while he continued to talk about holding his ground to earn their respect; and when he scolded them and then yelled after them, 'I love you, I love you'.Here's what I think Timothy should be remembered for. The word moron is overused. We need something else we can say when we refer to people of Timothy's ilk. So now we can say, "What a Treadwell!" It has a nice ring.I think the bears just got sick of his shenanigans. I can see them sitting around their dens talking about taking this guy out, and sending word they wanted a hit-bear from out-of-town - maybe he was a Chicago bear - I know everyone seemed to be able to say with certainty it wasn't a local bear, like a local bear wouldn't have hurt dear, silly Timothy. Timothy was a waste of space and a blight on the Alaskan landscape; and this movie is nothing more than someone trying to make a buck off someone else's timely death and the public's constant hankering for 'stupid human tricks.' One moment of notice paid to the likes of Treadwell is a slap in the face to those scientists throughout the world who continue to do important research in all areas of specialization; and who, in many instances, lose their lives in the process. Where are their movies, Mr. Herzog?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disturbing film in relation to both the subject and the film maker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this film extremely disturbing. Treadwell is delusional and disturbed, to the point of probably suffering from a mental illness. The footage shown is him and not an actor, but yet it is showing behaviour that ended in death. Is it appropriate to show actual footage of a suicide? Let's not mince words. The film shows footage of behaviour that directly led to his death.For those who think that Treadwell is some kind of hero, think again. The footage he shot is about him and not about the bears and foxes he claimed to be helping. He did no meaningful research into their habits or numbers and did nothing to actually protect them. All he did was run around in the bush and convince himself that he was better than everyone else. Reality is, by helping to desensitize the animals to humans, he exposed them to great risk. His self indulgent behaviour not caused his own death, but also the death of his companion Amy plus exposed his beloved bears and foxes to greater harm.But I'm also concerned about Werner Herzog's actions in compiling this film the way he did.A friend and I have had a long argument about this film who loved this film. He believes that seriously disturbed people make for interesting subjects and he cites the movie Downfall as an example. But in Downfall they use actors. We didn't see the real Madga Goebells put cyanide capsules into her own children's mouths.There was something about using the real footage in Grizzly Man which reminded me of that horrible football stadium tragedy where people were being crushed to death and the photographers who could have helped, elected to simply keep recording the horror.Herzog's film shows us that Treadwell's footage is more about Treadwell. But Herzog has done the same. His own personality and opinions are aired in this documentary, which is supposedly about someone else. Scenes such as the one where he listens to the tape are not necessary. We already knew what was on the tape because the coroner had told us. We didn't need Herzog shedding a tear with one of Treadwell's former girlfriends. It didn't add to the film.The film showed us that Treadwell was very self-indulgent, but it also showed us that Herzog is as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Portrait of a Narcissist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It became apparent from the first scene of "Grizzly Man" that I was watching raw film footage of a mentally ill man. Given that the bulk of the film consists of Timothy Treadwell talking into a camera, for the bulk of the film you, the audience member, seek entertainment or enlightenment from a raw encounter with a madman. Tourists used to visit asylums like Bedlam. As I watched this disturbing film, I asked myself, am I no better than those creepy tourists at Bedlam? "Grizzly Man" also rapidly became amazingly boring. I say "amazingly" because you wouldn't think that a film depicting such a naked encounter - man against nature, or, properly, nature against man - would bore. But mentally ill people often are quite boring, and Treadwell, so lost inside his own sad, limited, dead-end mind, bored me.I had to do a forced march through the boredom. And, I came to appreciate this movie as something it isn't marketed as at all, but definitely is. More on that, below.Timothy Treadwell was a boyish, blond actor who spent thirteen summers doing primitive camping among what is sometimes labeled earth's largest land carnivore: Kodiak Island grizzly bears. (Polar bears are also sometimes labeled earth's largest land carnivore; let's let the bears duke it out for the title among themselves.) Treadwell and his willowy blonde companion, Amie Huguenard (you couldn't make these names up), were killed and devoured by a grizzly bear; the sounds of that attack were recorded by Treadwell's camera (the lens cap was left on . . . one can't help but think of the sad, sick jokes this might inspire.) I knew all that going in, from a lengthy "Vanity Fair" expose; I thought, what can I get from this movie? Werner Herzog adds minimal commentary. For the most part, you are watching film footage shot by Treadwell himself, of Treadwell himself. There are a few short scenes of the bush pilot who flew Treadwell in and out of his last campsite, the coroner who examined "four garbage bags full of human remains" pulled from the intestines of the killer grizzly, a Native American grizzly museum curator, Treadwell's suburban and normal parents, his flakey girlfriend Jewel Palovak, a male friend from California. No one advances any grand, overarching theory. Treadwell pere does indicate that losing the role of the bartender on "Cheers," that went to Woody Harrelson, drove his son into a downward spiral.Given the minimal commentary, viewers will inevitably interpret Treadwell according to their own agendas. Rush-Limbaugh, exploit-the-earth types will denounce Treadwell as an "environmentalist wacko." This is wrong, of course; Treadwell has as much to do with true environmentalism as Mohammed Atta has to do with safe aircraft piloting.Treadwell was not an environmentalist. He was not a symbol of the frontier. He was not a man obsessed by love. What Treadwell was, was a narcissist. Did Herzog miss this? I don't know if Herzog uses the word "narcissist" once. But what made this movie ultimately worth watching, for me, was its - perhaps inadvertent - presentation of a classic case study of narcissism.The word "narcissism" gets tossed around a lot, often in ways that obscure its true meaning. Narcissists are not people who love themselves too much; in fact, true narcissists don't love themselves at all.Narcissists detest themselves, and avoid, at all costs, any encounter with their true selves. Narcissists seek artificial, choreographed encounters, which they script and control, in which they can be seen as the superior beings that they want to be understood to be.Unlike Treadwell, most narcissists don't create their dramas by interacting with wild animals; most narcissists create their dramas by interacting with people whom they can fool, manipulate, and control. For this reason, narcissists often associate with people they perceive as being less intelligent than they are, or weaker in some sense. Narcissists often seek out children, the ill, or the poor, whom they cast as characters in their productions.In any encounter, though, the narcissist is not running toward intimacy, either with the self or the other; the narcissist is running away from contact with the self and the other at top speed.I can't think of any more perfect encapsulation for narcissism than the image most common in "Grizzly Man." Treadwell sets up his camera on a tripod, and then stands in front of the camera, filming himself, with grizzlies in the background.Treadwell goes on and on, repetitively, about what a great man he is, saying so explicitly. "I am a great man. I am doing great work. No one loves these grizzlies but I. No one is protecting these grizzlies but I. God is very happy with me" - he really says things like this. And the truly telling part of this triangle charade is this - there is nobody there. There is no audience. Treadwell filmed himself without any other people around. There is no grizzly. Treadwell did not understand these animals at all. He attributed feelings to them that they do not feel. And there is no Treadwell. This is a man who spent his last breath resisting any real encounter with himself.There is a scene in which the real Tim Treadwell appears. He releases a torrent of violent verbal abuse against the real protectors of the grizzlies, the parks department. If you want to see the true scabrous soul of a narcissist, catch that scene.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film by Herzog was certainly worthy of making but is so bizarre. Two seemingly unrelated and opposite worlds forced together (by T. Treadwell) it what the laws of the universe ultimately decided would never work, ending in destruction and chaos. The bizarre nature of T. Treadwell who was fighting his sexuality demons in the most narcissistic and self flagellating manner would have been better played out in a drag queen reality show. The fact that he chose to capture his "life DRAMA" in a natural setting so majestic and raw was such a disconnect and made the film look like a side show. Drag Queen in the Wild would have been a better title than Grizzly Man. It was nonsense and pointless. I get the human struggle, the search for himself blah blah blah. But to try to make a poetic statement about this obviously deranged individual was pointless. Maybe that was Herzog's intention. To make it appear as a side show. Certainly the parents scene, the ex-girl friend "friend", the watch scene and the morgue scene were side shows in themselves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the most subtly done comedy/documentaries ever. I cannot begin to describe how funny it is.Werner Herzog is a passive aggressive genius. How he kept a straight face while filming this movie is beyond me. He should be on the World Poker Tour. He systematically destroys any perceptions of Treadwell as an "bear expert" and layer by layer, reveals the true nature of Treadwell's demons.It is horrible, beautiful, and above all ridiculously funny to watch.It's a real life Waiting for Guffman!

		<shortDescription>Funniest movie of 2005!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was really kind of stunned by the reviews below that found this movie moving and deep. I found it very, very funny.Treadwell was clearly mad as a hatter. He "loved" the grizzlies, and told them so, over and over again, yet he had no reason to believe that the grizzlies loved him in return. Seemingly this did not matter to him. He had a grossly inflated sense of self-importance. He is constantly telling us that, "he spent another year protecting the grizzlies" when in fact all he does is follow and film them, and evidence suggests that doing so HARMED the grizzlies (by acclimating them to human contact).A particularly funny scene involves a group of nature lovers that Treadwell stumbles upon during one of his summers with the bears. He instantly thinks they are poachers and he stalks around their boat filming them and saying so. You can almost hear in his voice the desperate desire that they actually BE poachers so that the elaborate fantasy that he has woven for himself (that he is a grand grizzly guardian) might have some basis in reality.When the nature lovers become aware of Treadwell's presence they jokingly write a couple of notes to Treadwell and (in a nod to the Blair Witch Project) pile some stones together next to a "smiley" face. This, Treadwell contends, is a "threat."To me, the best humor involves deflating self-puffery, and a silly, self-important man who gets eaten by a bear because of his sentimentality is high humor indeed. Adding to the humor is Herzog's narration. Never in my life have I seen such a corny pseudo-intellectual. Cliché follows cliché all delivered in a tone that suggest wisdom is being imparted. When you add to that his thick German accent you have a character straight out of a Mel Brooks film.I admit that those who lack a sense of schadenfraude will not find this movie at all amusing, and those with tender hearts might feel sorry for Treadwell. However, if you are a bit cynical and sarcastic, get together with a couple like-minded friends and sit down to enjoy a very funny movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grizzly, but also funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's no doubt that Timothy Treadwell was insane. Just look at the facts; here was a guy who lived (unarmed) with bears, who referred to himself in the third person (always a sure sign of insanity) and who had a loon for a best friend. But entirely because of that, his story is a fascinating one.At first, what's so amazing about Treadwell is how camp he is. He has a squeaky little voice, a peculiar obsession with his wispy hair and he's always cooing, "I love you" to his animal 'friends'. It seems remarkable that such a person would survive so long in the wilderness. But fortunately for Treadwell, he's both tough and completely insane. Therefore he has the blind confidence of the deluded ? he never really thinks about what he's doing.Treadwell's lack of real insight is summed up in his life's purpose ? he wants to protect the bears. But the forces that he's protecting the bears from are amorphous (poachers and the Park Service). They're never really there. And it's telling that when some strangers finally do turn up, Treadwell can only hide in the bushes and film from afar as the men throw rocks at the bears ? he doesn't do much protecting.But as Treadwell admits, it's more about the bears protecting him. Which, I guess, is ridiculous (and it is), but it's also true. As the film shows us, Treadwell was in all kinds of trouble before he went bear crazy. He lost his scholarship, became a drunk and got involved with criminal elements. Had he kept steering that course, he probably would have wound up getting killed. And although it's darkly comic that his new obsession finally did bring about his death, it did at least provide him with a momentary release.The film that Treadwell shot is both amusing and sad. It's amusing because Treadwell is such a strange figure, declaring himself a 'kind warrior' and touching bear faeces with an almost orgasmic excitement. But it's sad because Treadwell is so out of touch with reality. For example, he gives all the bears cute little names like 'Mr Chocolate' and 'Rowdy' ? he even calls a particularly nasty bear 'The Grinch'. All the time he's trying to humanise them. He desperately wants to be their friend. And although at times Treadwell seems to understand that they're killers, it never truly sinks in that they could kill him. "I will not die at their claws and paws," he says.Another illuminating moment is when one of his fox friends steals his cap. He seems deeply upset; he seems personally affronted. He just doesn't quite grasp the fact that these are wild animals, that they aren't really his pals. But despite this, Treadwell does capture some wonderful moments on film. There's a fantastic bit where he's in his tent playing with the paws of a fox that come poking through from outside. It's here that you can understand why Treadwell has isolated himself from people. It's innocent moments like this that keep him hanging on to the few marbles he has left rattling about in his brain.But although Treadwell doesn't really understand nature, Herzog does. In his unmistakable German accent he says he sees no kinship in the bear's eyes: "I only see the overwhelming indifference of nature". Everything between Treadwell and the bears is one sided. The love is only his. To them he's just meat. Or as a helicopter pilot says, maybe the bears just thought he was mentally retarded.And although the film is a wonderful insight into a crazy mind, and although it's poignant and sad, it's also very funny. And it's some of the peripheral characters who provide the biggest laughs. One moment that sticks in my mind is when Herzog is talking to Treadwell's crazy ex-girlfriend. It could and should have been a moving moment, as Herzog is listening to the tape recording of Treadwell's death, but Treadwell's ex is just so bonkers that I couldn't help but guffaw when she broke into some of the weirdest tears I've ever seen ? at first it seems like she's laughing. And then you have Herzog, in his gravest tones, telling her that she must never listen to the tape. And she replies, "I know, Werner." No wonder the scene has been parodied.And then you have the coroner. He really seems to love the fact that he's in front of the camera and decides to ham it up for everyone. And this actually leads me to my one criticism of the film. There are a few sections that are just too staged ? the scene with the watch and the bit in the morgue stand out the most. Herzog is obviously trying to give the film more drama, to break away from the restrictions of a documentary, but the people in the film are over the top enough as it is without them acting it up for the camera. The story really doesn't need any spicing up.But despite that one criticism, Grizzly Man is a wonderful film. It tells the story of a ridiculous man who probably did more harm that good, but at the same time the story is strangely positive. It offers hope to damaged people. It shows that by finding a purpose in life, you can overcome your problems and find some degree of happiness. I guess the trick is to focus your energies on something less dangerous than man-eating bears.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An uncomfortable mix of obviously failed actors over-zealously and tediously recant personal experiences with what should be a very interesting and eccentric individual. The interviews of the "actor friends" are painful to watch and are usually left unedited to a point where you wonder what Herzog was thinking. The coroner in particular is so clearly acting for the camera, that when he finishes his "script" he waits uncomfortably for the camera to stop rolling.The entire movie is filled with the pretentious voice-over of Mr. Herzog--where he selfishly promotes his tiresome opinions about hunters and the universe. Where he believes he ideas to be profound, he falls miserably short. What could be a chilling climax to the documentary, an audio tape that recorded Timothy Treadewell's brutal demise, is instead diminished to a boring few minutes of film. What the director does give us instead is footage of someone watching Herzog listen to the audio on headphones. Herzog selfishly keeps this audio to himself and then, once again, inserts his uncalled for opinion that the owner of the audio tape should have it destroyed.THUMBS DOWN. Documentaries are meant to illuminate. What "Grizzly Man" amounts to is community theatre at its worst. How about calling it, "Waiting for Grizzly"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Portrait of a Man Unable to Bear the World he Lived In</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Herzog's "Grizzly Man" is a miraculous documentary. He started by collecting hundreds of hours of video tape shot by the movie's subject, Timothy Treadwell. The director then culls through the footage and assembles a fascinating portrait of this uniquely bold (and clearly troubled) human being: Treadwell spent 13 summers living amongst grizzly bears in the wilds of Alaska, before being killed by one in the summer of 2003. Treadwell's footage is gorgeous, and at times heart-stopping: a grizzly battle caught on tape is the stuff Animal Planet would kill for. But the footage goes beyond simply revealing the harsh yet beautiful reality of the Alaskan wilderness. The camera soon becomes a silent confidant to Treadwell's self-obsessed confessions. For one, he sees himself as the singular savior of the wildlife preserve he camps at and the creatures that reside there. But he also sees himself becoming increasingly less connected to the real world he lives in 9 months out of the year. The footage here is most poignant, revealing Treadwell's inner struggles. It paints a picture of a lonely man searching, perhaps desperately, for purpose in a world he feels has rejected him. Most eerily prescient are Treadwell's repeated remarks about how he would die for the bears, though his eventual death does not appear to be the martyrdom he so clearly sought.This is where the film is most riveting - in Treadwell's footage, focused on the man, the bears, and the force of nature around them. Less compelling are Herzog's talking head interviews with Treadwell's friends and family - although they do help to solve (as much as possible) the puzzle of where Timothy came from, what lead him to the bears, and why he was killed.It would not be a Herzog film with the director's own philosophical palette framing the story. Herzog's commentary reveals his longstanding view that nature is cruel and that chaos is the constant in our life experience, not harmony. That Treadwell saw beauty and soul in the bears seems to be beside the point, since ultimately their need for sustenance made them turn on their self-appointed protector.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbing tale of a man with no concept of Nature.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have watched this film with my Psychology major girlfriend four times. She claims Treadwell was a man with a deeply repressed sense of his own self, that he could not accept the reality of what he was, so that knocked the freight train of reality off its tracks. "If he isn't really who he is, then bears aren't really what they are." she says. "Think about it, a really effeminate man looking desperately to be loved by 'bears'"I don't really know about psychology, but in the film Treadwell often rambles on and on in the middle of the wilderness, surrounded by Grizzlies, about how he's "so not gay" and how much he loves "human women." A little too much protest?I Knew early on in the film Treadwell was a man who was going to die by Nature. It seemed as if he was completely out of touch with reality at times. His "Nature" video recordings included his constant efforts to cover up his receding hairline.He named ferocious 1000 pound wild animals "Mr. Chocolate" and "Freckles" and "Tabitha" and "Downy" and actually tried to act like them.He chased grizzlies around yelling "I love you! I love you! I love you! I love you!...""I'm not mad!" (Like a grizzly could give a dang.)He claimed poachers were rampant, and though I don't doubt they are, he never provided any evidence of it on hundreds of hours of film. Though he did take the time and trouble to capture film of himself asking "How's the hair look?"He claimed (as he squatted in a National Park) that he was "the ONLY protection" the bears had without ever describing exactly the protection he was (exclusively) providing.He railed violently with unrestrained vitriol against the very park service that gave him maps, warnings, water, weather reports, checked on his safety and allowed him to squat when and where he did.It was all about the bears he claimed, even as he yelled "Timothy Conquered!" as he stared directly into the camera and almost continually wiped the hair away from his eyes in an effeminate way. "But alas! Timothy is not gay!"So concerned about Nature was he that he chased a fox that stole his hat for hundreds of yards yelling "That hat is so important for this trip!" and "If I don't get that hat I'm dead!" He conditioned foxes to the presence of humans to such an extent that they lost their natural fear of Man and began stealing his fashion accessories... This serves nature how?He was someone who cried about the natural death of a bear cub subsequently eaten by other bears. Yet he made no mention of the tons of Salmon eaten by the bears every year, or the deaths of any of the other animals that occur in the wildHe was not a naturist, not an ecologist, not a scientist. He slept in a tent surrounded by grizzlies as a grown man, an adult? with a teddy bear. Let that sink in.He was someone who never understood that nature is neither for nor against anything, no matter how valiant or well meaning that 'thing' is. Nature just IS. Treadwell couldn't contemplate that life feeds on life. Every living thing is a potential food source for another living thing.If you watch this film and ignore him, it's a beautifully shot film about nature. If you watch it and look at him, it's a film about a deeply troubled man completely out of touch with reality who thought he could bend nature to his own naive, immature, ignorant ideal who eventually gets eaten by bears, the sound of which is recorded by a camera with its lens cap still on? Sad really, here's a man so vain he recorded every tiny mediocre thing he did in the wilderness, who claimed not to care if he gets eaten by bears ("Its how I want to go") and after years of tempting fate, when it happens ?the lens cap is still on? Ouch.Werner Herzog's film is so unassuming, so apolitical, and so un-judgmental, that we are left to draw our own conclusions.Werner Herzog handles the film in an even-handed professional way, and to his credit does not include any of the sounds of Treadwell's (or his Girlfriend's) death. If we find Treadwell a psychotic victim of his own deluded behavior, we don't want to hear it. If we think him a hero, we don't need to hear it?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watching the consuming madness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I expected this much from revered filmmaker Werner (pronounced Verner?), what I did not expect was the intensity and complexity to this almost surreal documentation of a madman smitten with a deranged purpose and misguided soul.As the observer, the audience is given the right to judge the object, but I failed to see the difference in subject and object here. Werner trying his best not to pull a Michael Moore, fearlessly inspects without interfering with Timothy Treadwell as a human that became confused and disillusioned in a fantasy that went too far.Technically speaking there were a few problems, the dizzying hand-held shots with Timothy running through the brush, and the sound being garbled or deafened covering the Mic, but these channels of imperfection only strengthen the subject matter. Jim O'Rourke's music has always been keen on accompanying a dying soul (see Love Liza). Beautifully rendered by acoustic and electric guitar, this bluesy, folk score captures the wildness and aesthetic appeal of the whole documentary.I remember cringing, even though we know within five minutes of the film of his ultimate fate, (30 seconds if you know anything about the doc) every time a bear would get close to the camera. This was more than just a wildlife documentary, this was a glimpse of the blisteringly un-normal last years of a distraught beings life.The interviewees at time seem: contrived, gleaning for notoriety, or unsympathetic. But the truth is, Timothy was associated with people that were eccentric, or overtly theatrical. We're not little children and we should be aware of non-reliable narrators. We can deduce from the evidence (the actual candid footage of Treadwell) who Treadwell was and make an educated guess on what and why it happened.Timothy finds his solace in the proximity of the wild Alaskan Grizzly bears in the same way that we find peace in television, or cigarettes, but there is an element of immediate danger with the bears, and a slow diffused and sometimes unnoticed symbolic danger in everyday life. Herzog narrates a poetic and contemplated voice-over that highlights his differences with Timothy stating the uniting bond between nature is not beauty or harmony, but violence and the need to kill. The imagery and metaphorical scenery in this film is mind-blowing at a second glance.Timothy notices a giant African bee paralyzed on a flower. Mr. Treadwell states that the bee died performing its role in life, prematurely dying doing what it was purposed to do. Treadwell foreign to the Alaskan terrain, just like the bee, also died doing what he imagined his purpose. Deep inside Timothy's conscious knew he would meet his end, an almost pseudo-messiah, environmental martyr, vainly dying by the mouth of a friend he was trying to save.This teaches us that the world is not going to comply to our vision, religions, tolerances, intolerances, superstitions, faiths, creeds, but something is etched inside the earth's genealogy that doesn't put humanity on a pedestal. That we are just another link inside a chained fence of survival. The story of Grizzly Man is by far touching, inspiring, and a mystery. Though you may not align your ideals with Treadwell or Herzog, you can refuse your apathy for just long enough to absorb the heart wrenching tale of a man who crossed the line.Listen to your heart, not to the critique, go see this film if you feel something.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To prepare for this, I saw "Into the Wild," Fitzcarraldo" (again) and "The Life Aquatic" , this latter being in the same vein as the originally intended documentary.I have long ago accepted Herzog into my life. So it matters to me when he gets old. It matters when he stops being radical and merely talks about it. It matters when he has to go outside of himself to encounter those forces he imagines and settles on nature.So its a death I grieve these days, and have to impose on this poor sap, His silly life matters when imposed on this grand template that Herzog has wrought.It happens to be pretty powerful. Its real, but not as real as the fictions we used to get from this man. What we get is Herzog's unabashed admiration for a filmmaker who didn't survive. So we end up not watching this fellow, but watching Jerzog watch him. He compares the madness of the actor within ti Kinksi.We hear his Dad's story about him. Its the story of an actor who entered a suicidal path after being turned down as the bartender on "Cheers."Its wonderfully assembled. No one but Herzog could have done this. It puts Michael Apted's up series to shame. To shame.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mentally disturbed lunatic goes to Alaska and is eaten by bears</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a terrible attempt at making a raving nut case look like some type of naturalist martyr. Treadwell was an idiot who was endangering the Alaskan wildlife as much as he was endangering himself. By getting the animals accustomed to humans he may have caused irreparable damage. His death was inevitable. There is nothing here to make me think Treadwell did anything to preserve the wilderness or the animals therein. The entire movie is just one madman's ravings. Nothing special here. You play with fire, you get burnt. You play with bears, you get eaten. This film is perhaps best summed up in the scene where Traedwell comes across a pile of fresh bear droppings and begins to touch and marvel at it. He goes on talking about how wonderful it is because it came from inside the bear and special it is for that. Well, I guess in that sense Tim Treadwell is now special as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well done, but a sad story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film proves what little we already know about wildlife: 99% of the time, it will leave you alone as long as you don't harass it, but the 1% is a differential that ends with you screaming and some guy finding your arm later. It also proves that we know even less about human nature than we do about bears, as Tim Treadwell is a mystery even to his own species. It's obvious that he has some kind of disorder or drug-related brain damage, what with his extreme lability of mood, delusions of identity, neurotic and repetitive speech patterns, and general paranoia about the activities of his fellow humans. He knows a lot of interesting people, from his geeky friends who state the mundane as though it is profound ("I don't think he had a death wish at all." "I don't think anyone really deserves to be eaten alive by a bear."), to the Friend/Actor who is not even believable when portraying himself, to his very ordinary parents who are just as confused by him as we are. In this film, we learn that Treadwell switches addictions from alcohol to bears, and descends into functional madness while attempting to integrate himself into their "secret, inner world." He is paradoxical throughout, both disliking humans and yearning for a love relationship, being fully aware of the dangers that the bears pose, but doing nothing to protect himself from them. (Well, he is fatalistic in his devotion to them, but seems to think that they will not harm him as long as he behaves properly around them. That an older, aggressive bear could become hunger-crazed enough to attack him indiscriminately seems beyond his scope.) At times he shows a thorough understanding of animal behavior and the natural world, at other times a grand ignorance of the reality of life in the wilderness. He seems forever stymied trying to enforce human concepts like justice and righteousness upon the jungle. His sentimentality with the bears and perceived relationships there show in stark relief when the animals display constant indifference or even aggression, and when it is clear that some near-altercation with them has occurred off-camera. In the end, he is really no more successful with bears than he is with people, understanding the basic rules but never seeing the whole picture in clarity enough to know how to avoid crashing and burning. Perhaps most indicative of his dysfunction is how he responds to the fond relationship he develops with the foxes, who actively play with him and seek his company and interaction. While he loves them, they are but a footnote on his path to destruction; he prefers the ambiguous and imagined affection from the dangerous bears, to the foxes' genuine displays of it."Grizzly Man" is not about a man at all; it is a sad, true story about a wayward being without a species. On this journey, the audience meets a lot of bears that look alike but who we know were distinct to Treadwell, a creepy coroner who is probably not acting, and a slew of observers who all have their own biased and often badly distorted views of "what really happened." In the creamy middle is the quirky pilot who knew Treadwell best, and the director himself, the voice of reason in this well-crafted work. The moral: Van Halen was right. "It's business as usual in the woods." Animals make sense; it's people that don't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Herzog's intriguing doc proves mental illness and 1000 pound killing machines just don't mix well.........</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For 13 summers, animal activist Timothy Treadwell traveled to Alaska to live among and "protect" his most cherished of creatures, the Grizzly bear. During the last 5 of those seasons, he brought video equipment to capture his interactions with the native wildlife. Unfortunately for him and his girlfriend, the number 13 would prove most unlucky as both were eaten by, unsurprisingly- A Grizzly. Enter filmmaker legend Werner Herzog. With over 100 hours of footage and an immense belief, he gives us "Grizzly Man", a superb documentary far more involved with frail human conditions than anything about nature.With Treadwell as the main attraction, it couldn't have been any other way. It is truly mind-boggling to witness all the mental/emotional problems colliding and bubbling so, so close to the surface- Exaggerated ego, self-loathing, (possibly) repressed homosexuality, willful ignorance, dangerous hypocrisy, and some form of bi-polar disorder are just some of them. Here are some pretty good examples:Throughout the film, Treadwell boasts of unsurpassed expertise and intimacy when dealing with bears, but as it happens, he has NO form of training dealing with wildlife whatsoever. He went from being a wannabe actor with alcohol and drug issues to super-activist almost overnight and with too few questions.Treadwell repeatedly speaks of his contempt for mankind, yet he somehow manages to endow the bears around him with very human characteristics. Full of delusion, he sees love in cold eyes and takes "Back off dude" gestures as welcoming advances.20 takes and multiple diatribes, all while mugging for the camera, seriously clouds Treadwell's integrity in several instances. And finally............If you're going to brag about being the bears "only protector", you really shouldn't do it when you and the animals always reside on a government sponsored preserve. Furthermore, when tourists throw rocks at your "friends" and you hide in the bushes and do nothing about it because you can't "blow your cover", it's time to question your protective abilities.Believe me, there is MUCH more, but hopefully these will be just enough to grab your interest.Now as far as Herzog's work goes, it's quite good. He intersperses footage with interviews evenly and keeps things flowing nicely. Admittedly, a large portion of the interviews feel contrived/staged and some footage seems redundant, but on the overall, this a well put together and absorbing package.In the end, "Grizzly Man" is an excellent viewing experience about a complicated, troubled man-child and his severely misguided endeavors. (Strangely enough, Treadwell had a far more genuine bond with the foxes of the preserve; they really seemed to care for him and enjoy his company. Maybe if he had focused on them, he'd still be with us.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Message for Herzog fans only (well OK... the rest of you can read it too)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just to set the tone, let me say that I'm a huge Herzog fan. So you can trust me when I say that this film is a total dud. Here's why...The common reactions to this film are "Man that gay guy was freakin nuts" or "What a stupid f**. Bears eat people." Or perhaps some viewers will parrot what Herzog proclaims in the documentary: "I believe the common denominator of the universe is not harmony but chaos, hostility and murder."Those who react to the film this way have obviously fallen for Herzog's clever (yet extremely obvious) propaganda. Herzog has painstakingly spliced together fragments out of context in order to produce the desired effect. Those of you who are familiar with Herzog's work will sniff it immediately. And if you're like me, you'll probably resent the attempted brainwashing. That's why I've rated this film so low.Have you seen FITZCARRALDO or AGUIRRE? If you have, then you know that Herzog's favourite obsession is: "insane man vs. nature" (and nature wins). It's an interesting theme, and I love both of the aforementioned movies. But in this "documentary", Herzog attempts to create another Fitzcarraldo or Aguirre out of Timothy Treadwell and attempts to pass it off as fact. You can expect to see a lot of "insane ranting" from Treadwell's personal footage, but this doesn't make him an insane lunatic as Herzog would like to have you believe. He's no different from you or me, except that he had a camera to record all of his most personal thoughts. Herzog descends on the more insalubrious clips like a bloodthirsty vulture and sews together what can only be described as a video Frankenstein's monster.And the clincher is at the moment of truth, when Herzog holds the coveted tape of Treadwell's death in his hands... Herzog comes on camera and pulls a total Geraldo Rivera by saying "the tape of Timothy's death must never be played. It must be destroyed." (and so he conveniently leaves us with our drooling morbid anticipation unfulfilled, while he makes himself out to be Mr. Responsible Reporter).There are so many overt gimmicks like this that at one point I wondered if this entire spectacle was a tongue-in-cheek satire of himself (like he did in "Incident at Loch Ness"), but it becomes obvious from Herzog's sappy, disingenuous epilogue that he's really trying to push this propaganda.I wish I had never seen this film, because it made my respect for Herzog drop 10 points. My advice to Herzog fans: don't let this happen to you. Stick with his early work, particularly the amazing works with Klaus Kinski. If I could scrub this pretentious, hypocritical "Grizzly Man" trash from my memory I certainly would.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film almost made me sick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film itself, done pretty well. The subject matter? Enough to make me scream. If I were to seek out a family of healthy children, and then set myself on fire, and go stand right next to them, in order to preach a lesson to the world that the kids needed protection, would I be called a hero and protector? If I find a tribe of healthy, self sustaining Indians, and I give them blankets filled with small pox, as a way of showing the world that they need protection, do I really love the Indians? I don't want to add any words which could hurt the family of this person, Timothy Treadwell, but I hope that they don't read commentaries, such as these. I have maybe an iota of sympathy for Treadwell, but that's it. He had an emotional disorder, for which he refused treatment. Instead, he elected to endanger a group of animals which he purported to love.By his mere presence, he endangered these magnificent animals. He walked into their territory, they did not come into his. They were already safe, where they were. There are so few places left, on our earth, for these bears to live, freely. What they do not need? Humans. Humans bring two things: injury, and death. Mother bears teach this lesson, to their cubs. Bears need to learn to stay away from humans. Timothy endangered this lesson, threatened this lesson. The proximity that he had to them, was an encroachment on their territory. He pestered, and annoyed them. It seems to me, that the grizzlies who tolerated him for so long, must have sensed the disability in him, and in some grizzly way, felt a form of compassion. But that's it. They did not WANT to be his friend, or WANT his presence. His "love" of bears, killed two bears. He brought death to those bears.I can't remember if it was in the film or not, but the fact is that when a group of bears start eating the whole fish, and not just the skin, that means that they are starving. Think about it; if you have to survive the winter in the mountains, and be somewhat comfortable, don't you want to get as many blankets together as you possibly can? That is what bears are doing in the fall; getting as much fat on their bodies as they possibly can, before the first snow, and their necessary hibernation. It's a physical phase which they enter, where they have a single minded quest to consume as many calories as they can. That's why they rip the skin off of salmon, and toss the rest. (the rest of course also feeds other animals; circle of life stuff). This is when times are good, when food is abundant. They will just eat the fat, which they need. They don't normally eat the whole fish. Well, Timothy Treadwell either didn't care to find out the facts of bears, or, he knew that these bears were very hungry, but he ignored it. The fact that the bears were clustering together, fighting for territory in the river, meant that the salmon was not as abundant as it might otherwise be. Perhaps a berry crop which the bears relied on, had failed, that year. Either way, there were very clear signs, to stay away from these hungry bears. Well, he got himself and his girlfriend eaten, THUS two bears had to be killed. Bear lover? not a chance.I suppose as a way to bring about discussion of wildlife, and the preservation of what's left of it, the film succeeded. However, I wish that it had driven the point home much harder, that this man hurt, that which he proclaimed to love. And, he did it willingly, and knowingly. Through his insistence on perpetuating his fantasy of his friendships with "sally" or "muffin" or whatever ridiculous names he gave to these wild, intelligent, and protective animals. By his refusal to give a hoot, to consider reality. By his exploitation of the bears.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nature versus Civilisation ?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Werner Herzog is famous for portraying surreal characters. In this movie he tells the story of Timothy Treadwell who spent every summer with bears in Alaska for 13 years until he was killed by one of them. Treadwell recorded 100 hours of his journeys with the bears on MiniDV. Herzog narrates the pictures in his usual gloomy way (and his German accent) and he also criticises Treadwell occasionally for his apparent views that nature is in harmony. For example, when Treadwell discovers the remains of a "Baby-Bear" that was eaten by an " Adult-Bear", he cries and Herzog then mentions that nature can be harsh and brutal. Personally, I don't think that Treadwell lost his mind towards the end of the footage, since the video sequences give almost no clue to their chronology. Treadwell talked at length about his past, his troubled childhood, drug and alcohol problems and lack of sexual relationships. He then argued that spending half of the year in a remote location made him happy. That he is disenchanted from civilisation also becomes apparent at one of the later sequences where he violently rages about the Park Authority and other members of society.There is strong sense in this documentary that Treadwell felt let down by society and tried to escape to (or from) reality. In my opinion, he achieved that by spending 13 years in close contact with the bears only to be killed by a "newcomer" bear. There also is some truth in that society is in itself brutal and harsh and continuously lets people down. This movie isn't funny and the fact that many members of the watching audience were laughing at various sequences suggests that we have a lot to learn to respect the natural world.I think this documentary proves that human society has nothing to do with nature and that, ultimately, we are totally disengaged from the real world by being absorbed with our own little lives. At least, Treadwell has shown to me that I am not the only one in this world who believes that Humans are not the most important things on earth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a unique film in so many ways.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film isn't about bears although there is some stunning footage of them and the Alaska wilderness. It's not a nature film at all, unless we include human nature.It is a slow, often painful, reveal of one man's self-vision told through his own words and actions, augmented by the personal observations of friends, family and the director himself. Sometimes funny, sometimes chilling, sometimes annoying - you stare at the screen like a dog watching a snake. The film stays with you and intrudes on your thoughts. Where is the line between courage and impetuousness? Was Timothy Treadwell a visionary or a delusional, damaged man - or both? Grizzly Man sets the evidence before us in an almost lyrical way at times and in a clinical way at others. The answers are elusive. Unlike any documentary I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Man vs Bear vs Nature vs Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Grizzly Man: ****Werner Herzog has once again given us one more reason to claim him as a genius. 'Grizzly Man' is a fantastic documentary, one of the best I've ever seen, and it certainly stands aside from the rest. It's a film you'll see; may or may not get; may or may not like; but you will never forget what you've just seen. Timothy Treadwell, is in a way, a distant (or maybe close) extension of Herzog himself, or perhaps his long time friend/fiend- Klaus Kinski. Herzog even gives us a connection when commenting on Treadwell's rage filled rants to the heavens over rain, comparing it to his experiences on film sets with angered actors - clearly Kinski. Herzog never really takes a side with Treadwell. He sometimes agrees with him, and sometimes disagrees. We're presented mostly with Treadwell's films with voice overs, or just Timothy talking. In a way, perhaps you can say Herzog is siding with Treadwell by being the medium through which Timothy's films and thoughts are now being presented to the world. And, in a way, this documentary is about films. Herzog has spent months living in isolated jungles to make his films and claims that he would rather die than not finish filming. You can see the connection between the two here, and its no wonder Herzog was so interested in Treadwell. We all know that Treadwell is gone, and before seeing this documentary you knew this and felt little over the death. But after watching this, I felt very sad, yet was happy at the same time. Treadwell was, by his own admission, very troubled. Was he crazy? It is not mine, your's, or Herzog's place to make this assumption, and thus he doesn't. We are all in some ways eccentric, and its possible that Treadwell was simply brave enough, or desperate enough, to act on these inner thoughts. And though he comes across as a simple fellow, as the documentary goes on you see that he wasn't so. He makes strange decisions that leave you wondering 'why?'. I'm sure anyone who sees this with an open mind, not having already condemned or praised Treadwell, will come out asking yourself many questions. The score of the film, which you can watch a documentary on the making of on the DVD, is wonderful, as is every soundtrack to a Herzog film. It's never background music, it always plays a part and it works wonderfully. The final scene, lead off by Don Edwards 'Coyotes' will leaving you smiling as you watch Treadwell walk upstream with two grizzly bears by his side. No matter what you feel for Treadwell, this is a beautiful, touching, fascinating and crushing experience. Anyone and everyone should feel some connection here. This is very much a reflection on society and its pariahs, and in a way, we all have a little bit of Treadwell in us. In short, this is far and away the best documentary of the year, and thats saying something as there are quite a few good ones out there. If this does not win the Oscar, then something is clearly wrong with the Acadamy. Herzog is one of the most talented and interesting filmmakers on the planet and its about time he got his due. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A study of dangerous delusion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I strongly recommend this documentary, which focuses on the life and gruesome death of self-appointment grizzly bear "protector" Timothy Treadwell. It is a fascinating character study of a passionate but tragically deluded man, and the cast of oddball characters attached to his story -from the people who supported his delusions, to the bizarre coroner who talks us through the state of his remains. Treadwell clearly was a big fan of that other irresponsible and deluded individual, The Crocodile Hunter; obsessively filming himself in often contrived situations with dangerous wild animals. We see much of Treadwell's work in this film, and it reveals a lot more about him than his purported subjects, the bears. His camera was still running, recording audio, the day he and his girlfriend were horrifically eaten alive by a hungry bear. While we are thankfully spared the tape, we are given a gruesome insight into the consequences. Despite Treadwell's gross irresponsibility, we are left feeling pity and sadness for this passionate and strangely likable man and the woman who he took with him. The flick is also a fascinating nature documentary, with some great Alaskan vistas thrown in for the bargain. Go see it. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is hard to love somebody who disappoints you so very much. 14 years in the Alaskan wild, 5 with a camera and there wasn't enough nature footage in this film or compelling information about animals or living in the wild to fill a decent half hour. Instead it is a biographical ramble through the life of a poor soul with lots of problems, who somehow latches onto the bear thing. I was so disappointed and disgusted, it was hard for me to access my compassion for this fellow and the people around him. I hope in time to see his nobility. In any event this is not light fare and probably won't improve your mood much either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shallow and pointless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a great fan of Werner Herzog, and consider him along with Ingmar Bergman and Robert Bresson as one of the most uncompromising director of the films.However, I am not impressed by this film. Leaving aside the character of Timothy Treadwell for the moment, I find the film rambling, shallow and pointless. The comments by the people are all badly staged. Herzog's own commentary is at times pedantic or worse meaningless. Like his comment that bears' blank eyes don't show any emotions for humans - just an eye for another source of food. Herzog's editing also lacks any sense of purpose.Of course, part of the problem with the film is the character of Timothy Treadwell. The guy as seen in the film is a megalomaniac, who is not only intruding into the nature for no rhyme or reason, but is also intruding into his own film supposed to be about his beloved grizzly bears. There are just 2 long shots of Amy who was with him for 2 seasons and died with him, and may be a dozen shots of the bears. Rest of Timothy's film is all about himself - his harangue and meaningless patter about his love and protection of grizzly bears in Alaska. It's a great tragedy that such characters exist from time to time, who claim to be naturalist, but in fact end up giving a bad name to naturalists. In Australia, we had a similar character Steve Irwin, who died in similar circumstances filming an underwater documentary film. They all believe the animals love them for their pranks, not realizing the animals may be viewing it as torture.All in all, a disappointment from a great director.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A story impossible to tell in Fiction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone that talks into a camera, as Treadwell does throughout the film, involves the audience in a passive way in his endeavors. This act invites criticism, judgment, empathy. This film is not about a man living with or studying Bears. This is a very personal journey that one human being takes to discover himself, confront himself, and a vain attempt in the end to define himself. What makes this a great film is that we get to go along for the ride, through the very personal and visible involvement of Herzog, who makes himself a character in the piece. The film becomes self-reflective both of it's subject, Treadwell and the filmmaker, Herzog. Who Treadwell is or was, in the end is still a mystery (thankfully). But, like meeting someone new in life, we get a pretty good idea whether or not we'd like Treadwell personally, or if we'd like to spend any time with him, or even engage him in conversation. Apart from or perhaps because of his eccentricities, to me at least, Treadwell's life is that of someone who isn't quite sure of who he is. Is he the kid from back east who adopts the hippie liberal Berkley affectations, as if he were an actor, living the part of an interesting person doing important work for the greater good? There are glimpses that he lets us see, sub-consciously, that reveal depression, self-loathing, sexual confusion, an overwhelming desire to be relevant in a chaotic and unsympathetic universe, and yes, even sociopathic tendencies. Are these the measure of Timothy Treadwell? The journey he takes is the search for Eden, the connective tissue that Modern Man believes has been lost. The desire to connect with nature in an effort to fill the void of meaning and the loneliness that civilization has created in us. The betrayal that Treadwell feels toward the modern world, for crushing his dreams of adulation and love, of relevance and his need to feel necessary, is revealed in how he regards the inanimate camera contrasted with his regard for the men who encroach on his camp. In the end, his death, which feels like a suicide to me, give his efforts the context that eluded him his whole life. Would Herzog have noticed this guy if he hadn't been eaten by the creatures he sought desperately to connect to? Why are we watching this? I find Tim Treadwell interesting in a tiresome celebrity-centric way. I'm sure he was a nice person and he was very obviously well-loved, but the shadows of the person I see on screen is someone I would not like to spend the afternoon with. His interest in the Bears runs toward the narcissistic. As if to say: "Look at me, I love these animals, I am important and relevant and I should be admired for this and valued and celebrated!" Do any of us watching this not covet the same? That is what is extraordinary about this film. It's what I think of myself after watching it that I find remarkable. Treadwell is so pervasively average, it's impossible not to connect with the part of him that drives his need to go to the wild.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Grizzly Man, directed and narrated by Werner Herzog, is a must see. It doesn't appear to be playing widely, but wherever you have to haul arse to find it, GO! First, the footage is *amazing.* Slap your hand over your mouth, hold your breath, talk to the screen in disbelief amazing. Timothy Treadwell spent 13 summers in Katmai National Park living among the grizzly bears and other critters (most notably the foxes, who are delightful - so much so that I give them human grammatical treatment here). He knows each bear individually, and he knows bears. Combined with the fact that he's totally unhinged and thinks he's one of them, this enables him to get incredible moments on film.Second, the movie is a fascinating piece of artwork. Treadwell is very much the main character even in his own footage - he's a cross between the Crocodile Hunter and Marty Stouffer from Wild America. There's no attempt on his part to create a straight documentary, no attempt to maintain the illusion of the fourth wall or journalistic distance/invisibility. He's right there, in your face, in the bears' faces, treating the camera at times like a soapbox, a confessional, a therapist's couch, or a companion. In some rare moments, he seems to almost forget he's toting the camera, and though the footage then tends to be a bit Blair Witchy, it's also the least contrived and therefore among the most engaging.Herzog, too, makes no effort to uphold the sanctity of the fourth wall. He is both audience and narrator, commenting on Treadwell as much as the contents of Treadwell's tapes. In a break from traditional (think March of the Penguins-style) narration, he actually appears on camera conducting interviews, firmly affixing a face to the (judgemental but, I thought, dead-on) voice. It's thrilling that in this film, we *are* supposed to pay attention to the man behind the curtain.Finally, and this is far and away the most interesting aspect of the movie, Timothy Treadwell is clearly not a sane and healthy man. He is passionate, he has a deeply felt sense of conscience, and he is madly in love with these bears. He tells the camera over and over again that his work is dangerous, putting him constantly in harm's way, and that the bears are wild animals and can maim, kill, decapitate (he seems oddly fixated on their ability to decapitate), and otherwise hurt people. The problem is, he's like the guy at the doors to the fun house who cackles, "You may not come out alive!" just as you enter - it makes the ride scarier, but no one actually believes it for a minute, as Treadwell seems not to believe that he could meet his end at the paws of a bear.Nonetheless, Treadwell does seem to know he's not altogether alright, acknowledging to the camera that he's unable to cope with the world of people. In moments such as the one when he bends down to touch a steaming mound of you-know-what straight from his favorite bear's behind, he notes the weirdness of his actions, but it's as if he knows no other way. He's compelled.And he does, despite his protestations, believe he is a bear. He gives each animal a name, following their growth and maturation year after year. He swims with them, stands them off in conflicts, gives them post-fight pep-talks about girls and judging the enemy, and grieves their deaths. He re-builds a stream bed to encourage the salmon to run, and when that doesn't work, demands that God bring rain so that his bears can eat. He is stupidly fearless, expecting his bear totem to bail him out or to give him some kind of magical power of kinship with these terrifying and beautiful animals. He sees them as his protector, and he as theirs.In the end (and I spoil nothing by telling you this - it's the whole reason the film was made), he and his girlfriend get eaten alive. Bless Herzog's soul, he suggests that the tape of their grizzly end be permanently destroyed, and refuses to air it. It's only audio, as Treadwell's video camera was apparently running, but with the lens cap on. Hard to believe, but I'll forego the proof of hearing the tape myself. Its contents are recapped graphically enough by Treadwell's friends and those involved in his case after his death.Grizzly Man is a rare gem, a nature documentary that examines the human animal as it struggles for survival. Treadwell is nuts, but he's also strangely admirable. Sadly, as Herzog notes by the blank stares Treadwell captures brilliantly over and over, the bears don't love him back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In films it's all about the editing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I have to wonder what Timothy Treadwell would have thought of the film Herzog made with his footage from the wild. TT shot over 100hrs of footage living with the grizzly bears. What got edited down for a feature length film is barely 1/50th. The film is about Treadwell, not the bears. I wonder if he'd lived, if Treadwell would have done anything with his footage. And if so, if he'd made himself feature as prominently as Herzog did? I think he would have made himself the star, but obviously he would have chosen other footage. He would have chosen the *good* takes, not the confessional ones where he comes off like a cursing lunatic. And then what would we have thought of all this? If he hadn't been eaten by a bear (oh yes, of course he does)--and if he edited the film to his best advantage, would we be lauding him as some incredible wilderness guru? I wonder. Would Timothy Treadwell have finally found the love and acceptance he so desperately needed? Well, the problem when you're dead is, you no longer have control over your life's work. If your family wants to sell the rights to your work rather than protect your memory then you're screwed.Treadwell was DEEPLY disturbed, clearly bi-polar, and clearly homosexual, though deeply in denial. He is the classic self-hating homosexual who can't come out, can't even allow himself to admit it to himself. Who continues to bang his head against woman after woman (pun intended), all the time wondering *What went wrong? Why don't they love me?* --when it's clearly HE who doesn't love them.I wonder if he'd only been able to deal with his sexuality, if he could have discovered a life for himself that was worth living. Instead, he retreats to the wild, deludes himself into believing he's doing *important work protecting the bears and wildlife*--and ultimately fulfilling his own death wish.He was a failed actor in the civilized world, a closeted, conflicted gay man with bi-polar illness, who reinvented himself in the wild with delusions of grandeur and a video cam. He made wildlife presentations to grade school children *for FREE*. He didn't even value what he was doing enough to charge money for it he just wanted to be loved and accepted so badly.Werner Herzog didn't encourage Timothy Treadwell to do what he did, or get eaten by a bear. But he's profited from it. Is that ethical? There's been a raging debate since this film's debut. Herzog chose to expose Treadwell's sickness. That's the *story* of the film. Concealing it would have been unethical too, I suppose. No one could have stopped Treadwell from doing what he did. He'd have found a way. But watching it on the big screen, seeing this lunatic self-destruct, is a spectacle for only the least sensitive, most hardened and hateful individuals. Homophobes, anti-environmentalists, will LOVE this film.And that's enough to make me sick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film had come highly recommended to me by a reliable critic, but as the film drew on, I began to develop a mild contempt for the "conservationist". Apart from having seen far more grasping Grizzly documentaries on National Geographic, it was sadly obvious that this was not a dedicated conservationist, but rather a sad fur-ball coughed out by Hollywood, and resorting to animals as friends in attempt to cure his lonely path. How long I wonder, does it take to turn on a camera like that... and how long does it take to remove the lens-cap? Could it have been suicide? Trying to force his fame into the spotlight with an extreme last ditch effort? I found nothing spectacular about his work, and am interested to see if in all his time there he actually accomplished anything at all? Speaking to kids is futile because nobody remembers these things when they're older... Upon renting this film, I was with baited breath, looking forward to a story of a real researcher with valuable information to share about the behavior of bears, but was not impressed to watch a film about a man turned lunatic primarily focused on (and unsuccessfully) building human relationships with bears, as a last effort after being rejected in Hollywood, and producing nothing or little from it, but one bear being killed for acting on its instinct in that situation. I would vehemently dissuade anyone from watching it, especially those from a wildlife conservation background, its a mockery.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Werner Herzog brings the story of grizzly bear enthusiast Timothy Treadwell. He sees himself as a protector of the grizzlies. He would spend time with them in Alaska and interact with them. He talked to kids about the bears living a meager existence while gaining a small amount of fame. He was a drunk until he discovered the bears. In 2003, he was killed with his girlfriend Amie Huguenard by a bear.Treadwell is an outsider. I would not categorize him as insane or crazy. He obviously found a calling and an obsession. I don't think it matters whether the audience agrees with Treadwell or not. He's a fascinating real life character either way. Personally, I agree with the native museum manager who says that Treadwell's story is both tragic and wrong. It's better to leave the bears alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grizzly Man Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The biographical documentary of Grizzly Man, directed by Werner Herzog, follows Timothy Treadwell's adventures through the pristine Alaskan wilderness. The viewer will be shown first hand the daily voyages and experiences that Treadwell has, in particular the unique connection he has with an unlikely species, the grizzly bear. Treadwell captured these adventures with personally narrated videos of himself taking on all that Alaska has to offer. These videos give the viewer footage of the interaction between two species that many believe are not meant to associate with one another. Treadwell manages to interact with these species in a way that no one ever has. His unique personality and confidence allows Treadwell to venture into the world of the grizzly bear in order to effectively educate the world on the life of a grizzly. This documentary has a unique way of telling the life story of Treadwell that includes personal footage, interviews from acquaintances, and a time line of his life leading up to his voyages to Alaska that prove to be successful in keeping the viewer informed and entertained. At times this film can seem quite idiotic because of Treadwell's immature personality, but this only gives the film a more distinct subject matter that can be more appealing to most people. People who have a love for nature and unique biographies should watch this film. It truly does give insight into the life of a man that had a true passion for the life he was living and wasn't afraid to share this with the world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The last Herzog documentary I watched was LAND OF SILENCE AND DARKNESS, a moving piece obviously shot a very long time ago. GRIZZLY MAN is something else entirely: a mainstream, English-language film that tells the unforgettable story of one isolated man and his (very) close encounters with wild grizzly bears in Alaska.You can see why Herzog was drawn to this material, as it's perfect for him. Themes explores include man vs the wild, human loners, hints at madness, the cruelty of the animal world, and of course death and destruction. Herzog has taken some 100 hours of camcorder footage shot by Timothy Treadwell out in the wild, and made a thoroughly compelling narrative out of here.As a film, GRIZZLY MAN has it all. There are more fascinating glimpses of the wild and its creatures than in an Attenborough documentary. There's a kooky, intriguing protagonist who seems on edge throughout. There's unexpected humour, alongside tragedy and triumph, and a great score. It's haunting and beautiful and everything in-between, and truly one of the most profound films I've ever watched. In fact, I can't wait to see it again...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Law of the World</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Werner Herzog makes documents, films, art and money. But I do not believe that he intends to do any of this. I believe that Herzog has spent most of his career trying to tell us something about humanity. Perhaps it's his own analysis and interpretation, but I think that reducing his representations to this over-generalizes and misses his points. He creates films that are open to interpretation, but within the confines of the simple profundities he explores.In Grizzly Man, Herzog is perhaps more direct about what he thinks than he ever has been. There is much about the film which is typical of the Herzog portfolio. The film is beautiful; the setting is nature - beautiful and terrifying as Herzog seems to think it is; the protagonist is interesting, self-indulgent, passionate, troubled, heroic, and tragic (the allusions to Klaus Kinski in this film will not be lost on followers of Herzog's work);And underlying all of this is a penetrating, clear-headed, profound and simple analysis - provided by Herzog himself. Does Herzog really want us to agree that "The Law of Nature" (of which we are a part) is really violence, cruelty and murder? I don't think so. Rather, I do not think that Herzog cares what we believe. Rather, I think he wants to move people to think and feel - not as he does, but as they will.Herzog believes that Tim Treadwell's life and death have meaning (to him) because what he saw in bears and foxes during his 13 summers among Grizzlies in Alaska reflects upon some aspect of humanity that we seem all too willing to overlook. Since Herzog is first and foremost, an intensely thoughtful film-maker, I think that part of his attraction to the material presented in this film must have been the apparent senselessness of it. Herzog, like his audience, is on an endless search for meaning and truth. And in Tim Treadwell, he was faced with somebody whose life was loaded (in his own mind) with purpose, meaning and truth, but which defied conventional conceptions thereof. Did Herzog get "it" right?... the question can not be rationally answered, because there is no "it" outside of one's own individual interpretations.Did Tim Treadwell's life and death at the claws of a hungry grizzly have a deeper meaning and purpose? The answer depends on your perspective on it. Personally, I see Herzog's point, but it isn't enough for me, because I do not share his evaluation of "The Law of the World". As a practicing scientist, I believe that "Laws" are somewhat distant from and irrelevant to the truth of nature, but that humans use them heuristically to interpret that truth. Nevertheless, Herzog's films, Grizzly Man included, always provide me with ample fuel for wonderment, appreciation, thought and inquiry. Grizzly Man is a conversation piece. See it with thoughtful friends and the experience may bring you closer, and permit you to express ideas that you may not have previously explored.More than most of Herzog's films since the passing of Klaus Kinski, Grizzly Man is a collaborative effort. Much of the footage came from Treadwell's own camera, and Herzog does a little more autobiography than usual as he comments on the young man's development as a film-maker. Ostensibly, Treadwell's mission was to share the beauty and wonder of Alaska's great bears with a world which he felt to be loaded with threats. Underlying this was a desire to remove himself from that world and to become part of the world of the bear. In this, he ultimately succeeded by - and this seems quite intentional - getting himself killed and eaten by a grizzly during his 13th summer in Alaska. Unfortunately, his girlfriend, Amie Huguenard, was also sacrificed.Herzog explores Treadwell's history and paints a portrait which, though somewhat unflattering, is certainly respectful. Even if it may be impossible for some, if not most of us to directly sympathize with Treadwell, once his character is developed within the film, it is not at all difficult to empathize with many aspects of his personality - his passion, single-minded determination, and sincere love for the creatures with whom he chose to spend his time. The film is more than a documentary, a character study, a posthumous collaboration and an appreciation piece. It is, in fact a dialog between two very different, but ultimately deeply connected souls - that of Herzog and Treadwell, with a thesis, antithesis and a synthesis (Herzog's interpretation of Treadwell). Brilliantly, by relegating his interpretation to a few minutes near the end of the film and stating it not as fact or clarification, but rather as a passing observation, Herzog leaves the door open for his audience to jump right in and have their own say.So, we are left with our own interpretations, and a whole lot to think and talk about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A complicated individual</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the type of film that keeps re-surfacing in my head. I was ready to like Treadwell and I do think he is essentially a good person with a good soul. Sure he comes across as a simple man requiring a simple existence yet it is very apparent soon in that all is not what it seems. One of the most fundamental things is that he obviously lies to the camera by saying that he is alone when we know he is not. This was disappointing as he comes across as sincere but is all phoney. The main problem I had was that I never really understood what he actually did there. He kept going on about protection but the one moment when he was confronted with people actually throwing rocks at a bear, he hid away. I could not believe it. From that moment he seemed very hypocritical. The history of alcoholism and abuse seemed to show a man who had a strong addictive streak in his personality. He had perhaps transposed the booze for the bears. I don't mean in such a crude and simple way but the way the man is involved mentally with the bears, the way he talks to them did not strike me as someone who really grasps the kind of animal he was dealing with. The scene with the two male bears fighting over a female demonstrates the breathtaking ferocity and power these creatures are capable of. Ultimately this was his undoing and his end. The touching moments with the foxes showed a bond with nature that I didn't see he had with the bears. The improvised scenes were completely fresh compared with the self- conscious moments with Treadwell preening himself before delivering another operatic piece to camera. This said the film was enjoyable. It is just that I could not reconcile the man with his work. In this Treadwell and his 100 hours of footage failed to convince me, but Herzog did reveal a complex individual who yearned for some connection to nature and finally found it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don Quichotte with a false Australian accent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Werner Herzog had the unique chance to use actual footage shot by Timothy Treadwell - ''the grizzly man'' - for his documentary. This aspect gives the viewer a painful insight in the person of Treadwell and his self-centered behavior. On tape he's presenting himself as the cool uncle daring to defy the ferocious carnivores grizzly bears are, wearing bandannas and Rambo styled clothing. He keeps on telling his imaginary audience that his life is in danger, but that he has the capability to control the situation by his own knowledge of the bears.At first I sympathized with this happy loony, clearly loving his wild lifestyle and wanting to share it with a broad audience. But at a certain point, it becomes painfully clear that he's dangerously self-deceptive. He's justifying his presence amongst the bears as a way to protect them against poachers, multiple times saying that he'd be glad to be killed while protecting them. To contradict this, we see him sitting in a branch, watching how a group of poachers is actually stoning a young cub. He doesn't do anything to step up against this hideous crime; he's just ranting about it to the camera. And then it started to dawn on me that this man wasn't the nature preserving freak he claims to be, but an ex-addict using the wild nature as a way of experiencing the kicks that alcohol and/or drugs gave him in the past. His presence in the wild was a failure to cope with real life, and not the act of a strong individual really wanting to make a difference in the world. This men was mentally ill, very ill...By selecting both the footage shot by Treadwell himself and by adding interviews and a reflecting monologue, director Werner Herzog does a good job trying to grasp the complex motives of this deranged man. He doesn't glorify this person as a hero, but he humanizes him by showing both his charming sides and dark sides. We see a Timothy Treadwell that is loving, sensitive and really empathic with animals, but we also see a narcissistic man that is fully estranged by his own self-deceptive fantasies. It's the story of a Don Quichotte; the knight is a mediocre American with a false Australian accent and the windmills are ferocious bears.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Hauntingly Beautiful New Doc by Herzog</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are two sorts of documentaries: those that serve to lecture on historical events in an objective manner, and those that serve to document the lives of specific peoples, who may not have had an impact on the history of the world, but who made an impact on the filmmaker who wanted to share such a story with the world. Werner Herzog's Grizzly Man is not a tale of what is right or wrong, a guide of "what not to do", nor is it one of a man who serves as an exemplary human being. Instead, this documentary serves as glimpse of Timothy Treadwell's final summers living among the grizzlies in Alaska; this is a man who lived alone with some of nature's most predatory beasts, and who managed to live among them for thirteen years before being slain by one in 2003. Edited down from hours of tape filmed by Treadwell himself (and for the last two years, his 'girlfriend' Amie Huguenard, who was also killed), Werner Herzog has managed to create a masterpiece in documentary film-making, skimming the fine line between devotion and insanity.There is a dualistic nature to this film: not only does it document the daily life of the grizzly bear, but it also serves as a study on the character of naturalist Timothy Treadwell. The result has been heated discussion amongst those who believed him to be completely out of touch with reality and those who respected him for the love he showed to the animals 'he swore to protect'. My stance is somewhere in the middle, which is what Werner Herzog seems to have wanted by the end of his film: Timothy Treadwell was completely out of touch with reality, ignoring the obvious dangers of living in extreme proximity to the grizzly population; but one cannot help but admire his love and devotion for the animals, not to mention the fact that he was able to survive close encounters with them for thirteen years. There is a truly a streak of madness in the character of Timothy Treadwell, a trait that immediately related him to children at schools he would attend. His idiosyncrasies only act as a magnet to viewers. I, for one, could not help but admire his passions, despite acknowledging his delusions.While the character of Timothy Treadwell acts as an immediate draw to the documentary, the editing skills of Werner Herzog and the original music by Richard Thompson craft a hauntingly beautiful portrait of the Alaskan wilderness. The footage caught on tape by Treadwell and Huguenard is some of the finest to be found of the grizzly population, and some scenes are simply astounding. Be it footage of bears fighting for a mate, playful foxes, or Timothy rambling his thoughts on life and love, Grizzly Man never bores. While a few of the interviews conducted by Herzog for the purposes of this film could have been cut, the core footage leading up to the gruesome demise of Treadwell and Huguenard leaves never a dull moment.

		<shortDescription>Not about bears, but the delusions of a self destructive man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I find it interesting that so many people have criticized this movie because it doesn't focus on the grizzlies. This is a doc about Tim Treadwell, and like his own footage it has more to say about him than the bears. They seize the chance to deride what they see as an out-of-touch hippy environmentalist, when in fact many environmentalists (including this reviewer) were appalled by his behavior. The idea that he is some sort of cult hero for environmentalists, or somehow representative of them as a whole is ridiculous. The image of him walking freely through the wilderness trailed by wild foxes seems romantic until you realize he's been feeding them and therefore acclimating them to human contact.A lot of people just write him off as a sick outcast from society who wasn't doing anything valuable and therefore not worth their time, but personally I found his story to be a fascinating look at a very sad, lonely, and mentally disturbed man. Its pretty obvious that he wasn't doing any research, that he wasn't protecting the bears from poaching, etc.. If anything he was doing the opposite of respecting the bears.It becomes clear that he is out in the park to escape reality. I think this may have had something to do with his failed acting career and being a closeted homosexual (something he denies but admits would "make things easier"). His rant against the park rangers and tourists, contrasted with his naive idealization of the natural world and his place in it, underlines this.At the outset of the film, one might buy into the image of Tim Treadwell that he tries to create for himself (that of the fearless "kind warrior"). But as the film progresses (and in spite of the mockumentary interviews that feel scripted and badly acted), more intimate and personal footage is revealed that was never intended for public consumption, painting Treadwell as a bi-polar manic depressive with a self destructive streak. What once seemed like bravery around the grizzlies dissolves into a game of Russian roulette, and in fact he had several uncomfortable encounters before he would finally meet his end.Unfortunately, his suicidal tendencies not only ended his own life and that of his girl friend, but also the lives of two grizzly bears - magnificent and beautiful animals who would probably have avoided humans and their camp had they not become accustomed to Treadwell in the preceding days or weeks. If you can see past the hideous interviews and form your own conclusions about Treadwell's personal footage, I think you'll come away with a deeper appreciation for the old adage, no man is an island.Oh, and I can't end this review without mentioning something. Werner Herzog, who directed and narrated this film, is constantly insisting we hear his opinion on things. He says at one point that he believes "the common character of the universe is not harmony, but hostility, chaos and murder". He also states he sees nothing but indifference in the eyes of the bears. Maybe Herzog should take a look at some of the wonderful BBC documentaries that show the incredible harmony that exists in nature, or the tender care that a mother grizzly gives her cubs. If anything, those statements are true only of the universe of men.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Price of Obsession</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Grizzly Man is an extraordinary documentary film that explores the life and death of bear obsessed Timothy Treadwell. Having spent every summer of the last 13 years of his life living amongst grizzly bears, Treadwell along with his girlfriend Amie Hugvenard was mauled to death by a rouge bear near to the end of their trip. Director Werner Herzog trawled through over 100 hours of footage that Treadwell had recorded of his bear experience during the last four years of his life, and met his family and close friends in order to understand as much as he could about Treadwell.The result of Herzog's research is a film that is occasionally amusing, but often a deeply tragic and disturbing portrayal of a man who's obsession with bears was an escape from his disconnection with society. Herzog's film shows not a man who was a wildlife film maker in the mould of David Attenbourgh, but a man who crossed a fine line in nature to the point where he believed he could live amongst bears as one of them. A man who seemed to genuinely believe there was a secret key to the bear world and that he had found it and could safely co-exist with them. Tragically he was wrong And yet while undoubtedly the documentary shows Treadwell to be a foolhardy obsessive perhaps close to mental illness, there is an innocence and earnestness about him that makes you fail not to like him. Herzog does his best to be non judgemental about Treadwell, getting mixed opinions about his life's work from friends and critics alike. We can see that while Herzog clearly does not agree with Treadwell's romantic view on nature being gentle and sweet, he nevertheless respects Treadwell's passion and convictions about his work, and ultimately concludes that his life and death had an important purpose, if not quite the purpose of the bear protector as Treadwell envisaged. Instead Treadwell left a legacy of a man no-one will ever be able to fully understand, a man who wanted bears to love him as much as he loved them, a man who sought love from nature that he could not get from the civilized world, and who can say he failed? The only problematical issue with this film is the absence of Treadwell's companion Hugvenard. Her family refused to appear in the documentary and she remained a silent and largely unseen companion on Treadwell's footage, as he liked to maintain the image that he lived alone with the bears. Without any material in order to explore Hugvenard, Herzog largely ignores her although in exploring the death of the two it is clear that Hugvenard was exceptionally brave, and loyal to Treadwell to the very end. Indeed the exploration of Treadwell and Hugvenard's death is one of the most profound pieces of film making I have ever seen. Having shown us Treadwell's love for the bears, it's hard to deal with the fact that he was killed by the creatures he so loved. Footage of Treadwell clutching his childhood teddy bear just days before his death moved me close to tears. We are fortunately spared the recorded sounds of Treadwell's death in the documentary, but we do see Werner Herzog listen to them on some headphones. His reaction to this and the way he speaks to a close friend of Treadwell who was entrusted with the tape of his death, is incredibly moving and disturbing.If ultimately Timothy Treadwell's life was not a triumph, then this documentary certainly is. It tells the story of a troubled but remarkable life that if he had lived we would never have of known about nor understood. Instead Treadwell would have remained to many a source of amusement, and his inner depths unknown to all but a few.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At least, that's what Timothy Treadwell thought in his own mind in Werner Herzog's "Grizzly Man". Indeed, Timothy Treadwell is really not so extraordinary than what we at first think ? there are people out there who usurp reality with fantasy on a consistent basis. The only difference between those people and Treadwell is that the latter took his flight of fancy to the Alaskan wilderness.Herzog, with a welcome and somewhat eerily detached view, narrates this documentary based on found footage of Treadwell's summer expeditions to the Alaska wilderness where he "protects" and "interacts" with mainly the grizzly bears that live there. He "loves" these bears more than anything else ? his devotion is clearly seen in the mini-homage he makes to still-warm grizzly bear excrement.Is he a whacko? Well, insofar as his lifestyle is absent of normalcy. Herzog, in a brilliant move, simply observes this man and vocalizes philosophical ruminations that come across his mind. A friend of mine wisely said that if Herzog in any way "sympathized" with Treadwell then this documentary would be a dud ? a piece of dreck that would barely be Discovery Channel worthy.Throughout the doc do we understand that Treadwell and his girlfriend were ferociously attacked, killed and partially eaten by at least one grizzly. This is quite remarkable because it doesn't build any "suspense" as regards what's going to happen to this guy. If Herzog went that route then this would be a trite snuff film. However, with the facts clearly laid out early in the feature does it force us to meditate on the existential crisis Treadwell had resolved in his mind by "living" with these bears.There's a scene that shows Treadwell on an extended tirade against all that is normal in human society ? even society that has a share in regulating the land the grizzly bears reside. Here it becomes all too clear that Treadwell is (was, I should say) a man that couldn't adapt to normal society ? he was "done" with humans, so to speak. The illusion he created that stars himself as "master" over the wild creatures in Alaska is obviously foolish to us but cathartic and comforting to him. Treadwell found paradise ? but his paradise was a place where neither he nor anyone else belonged.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intriguing, fascinating movie, well worth seeing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Grizzly Man was an extremely interesting movie but not at all what I expected. I thought I was going to see a nice nature movie.....Wow! Not exactly. This is not something to rent for the kids. I actually had to check the internet to see if it was genuine or a hoax because it is told in such a dramatic way, and is quite bizarre. While it contained lots of great scenery and animal shots, I felt it was more the story of the man, Timothy Treadwell, and what kind of a person would want to live with bears. The viewer gets a very up-close and personal view of what goes on in the mind of Timothy Treadwell, what gives him joy and pain, his questioning of his own sexuality, and what could have lead him to living with dangerous wild animals. I believe that he had a mental or emotional illness of some sort and the viewer gets to see how that takes shape. As a psychological profile film I thought it was quite fascinating and should be required viewing for all students of psychology. Despite the strange topic matter, this movie is also extremely funny!! A must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best of 2005--#2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Werner Herzog resides in the pantheon of directors and has since the late-1970s. I'm sure the canon accepted him around the time of Stroszek and knew it had made a stellar choice when Fitzcarraldo appeared a few years later. Why has everything this man made been incredibly thought-provoking if not always cinematically wonderful? I would guess it's because he's obsessed to an extreme degree. Herzog is a man of vision, and a man unwilling to let anything disrupt that vision. This has resulted in great movies (Aguirre, Stroszek, Invincible, Fitzcarraldo, and now this), but it has resulted in failures as well. His remake of Nosferatu was rather unsuccessful, though, as I said, not without value. Nothing this man touches is ever without value. Herzog was likely the only man who could have made this film. As an obsessive (and only an obsessive; he is not, as some would say, mad), he can understand and respect Timothy Treadwell's desire to live with the bears, but Herzog's lack of madness and genuine distrust of nature allow him to recognize foolishness when he sees it. Treadwell is a fool. He's well- meaning, to be sure, but were his efforts necessary? I doubt it. Unless you're discussing a necessity to him. They were necessary for Timothy to exist. Treadwell was, in a lot of ways, a screw-up; at least that's how I read him. Unsuccesful in his 30s and 40s, he needed something to grab at. Humanity failed him too many times so he forged his alliance with the wilderness. It's understandable and I sympathize with him. Anyone who has ever felt ostracized--to any degree--can feel for a man who wants to live amongst the trees and foxes. Most people, though, would recognize the futility and danger in doing so. Herzog, I think, occupies a territory similar to mine--he sympathizes with Treadwell without ever siding with him. He does not believe Treadwell "was right."As a result of this, Grizzly Man is not an animal rights film, though it makes certain points that simply drive home the point that human beings still abuse their privilege of being more highly evolved than 99% of the other animals on Earth. Grizzly Man is a film about a man--a man, like Herzog, with an obsession. The complexity that Herzog achieves here is incredible and on par with the nonfiction films of Errol Morris. I don't know if this is entirely a documentary, but it's certainly closer than any of Michael Moore's films. Grizzly Man is based almost entirely on Treadwell's footage and the remainder is comprised of interviews with friends and families. What we wind up with is a film that views like a New Yorker article about some particular eccentric (like the article about the Raft Guy Alec Wilkinson wrote last year)--it's a full-bodied and seemingly complete portrait of a man. It captures his faults and foibles, his undeserved sense of grandeur. It tells his story respectfully without ever coming close to hagiography. Grizzly Man is a complex and wonderful movie--part of a resurgence this filmmaker has been experiencing since the late 1990s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Herzog is stunningly right on target</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As another reviewer pointed out, if you know anything about Herzog, Treadwell and he were tailor made for each other.In "Grizzly Man", Herzog edits Timothy Treadwell's sometimes beautiful, oft times frightening footage of the Alaskan wilderness together with filmed interviews of Treadwell's family and associates. He succeeds in bringing into sharper focus the end of a life of what most sane individuals would have guessed as being a strange and delusional individual.Contrary to some of the negative reviews, Herzog does not try to aggrandize Treadwell. He finds no honor and positive lessons or results from what Timothy has done. He does not present Treadwell as a martyr to the cause of preservation or to the safety of the bears. He does not portrait Treadwell's forays into the wilderness as anything but flirtations with disaster.He presents Timothy's own footage of his bizarre rantings, his hysterical proclamations of "love" for the animals, his vehement disdain for humans, his consistent waffling between believing he was invincible and his obvious awareness of his own horrible demise, in a factual and straightforward manner. Herzog's sparing narration (for the racist negative few, Herzog is German, thus the accent: how shameful of those who deride the film because of that) he only poses questions as to the real purpose of Timothy's quest into the "maze", and the intentions of his associates. At times, as I was watching, I became frustrated with his parents and his "partners" especially Aimee Why? Why allow him to continue when the danger was unbelievably real? Why did Amiee even go there the first time with him, let alone a return trip? What you see is a very troubled and angry individual with delusions of granduer, blinded by a narcissistic view of himself, who was really, in my opinion, out there trying to escape from the real world, with the goal of "educating" only as a cover.At the end there is no escaping Wernor's own conclusion that all Treadwell was doing was presenting himself to the bears, not as a protector, but as lunch. It was only a matter of time and circumstance until one got hungry enough to take him up on his offer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Director Werner Herzog made a provocative documentary.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Herzog's revelation in the special features section of the film that he wanted to find the "essential" says everything about Treadwell's need to connect to his "essence" and his finding it in nature. In Treadwell's quest to connect to nature, he mistakenly crossed the line by habituating the animals to him, but I think he could do nothing else in his drive to find himself. The only mistake is that by allowing the wild creatures to connect with him, they made themselves more vulnerable to danger from that unrealized part of ourselves which fears nature, and in that fear, needs to destroy it. But, maybe Hertzog and all the other contributors to the film, including the musicians who bestowed their "essential" nature in the film score, we get a digital glimpse of nature, and hopefully, we can connect to ourselves, without having to venture into the real nature and destroy it, as Treadwell tried to prevent, but in his misguided way, may have opened the door for some harm. Still, for venturing into that uncharted human territory, I thank Treadwell for his journey.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant "Fable" About Identity and Delusion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Grizzly Man," directed by Werner Herzog, astounded and absorbed me, and has stayed with me long afterward. Herzog edited together film taken by Scott Treadwell, a strange, self-dramatizing young man who lived 13 years in the Alaskan wilderness, hanging out with grizzly bears--one of whom finally killed and ate him and his girlfriend. Herzog added his own interviews and narration after the event to Treadwell's remarkable wildlife footage and peculiar ramblings.It is one of the most powerful, beautiful, deep and complex documentaries I ever expect to see--full of surprises. It left me thinking about how *provisional* identity is for many people--maybe for most people--and about the stories people tell themselves *about* themselves, and how people can turn the suffering induced by their damaged identities into a kind of ceremony that consists in equal parts of joy, dementia and. . . ummm . . . "self sacrifice." Undoubtedly a visual (and box office) wonder like "March of the Penguins" will waddle off with a bunch of honors. But "Grizzly Man" stands in the top ranks of all the documentaries I have seen for its narrative power. All Herzog's films use obsessive grotesques to disarm the viewer into admitting entree to thoughts and feelings that otherwise are defended against with great efficiency.I truly admired the balance Herzog achieved in the tone of "Grizzly Man." He lets us see not only the most unnerving personality traits and awkward self-presentation in his people, but also their scattered shards of sweetness and authenticity. The film is so much about self presentation and self deception (and isolation, and death), but also ultimately about the most recognizable characteristics of human beings in a postulated world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly the greatest dark comedy of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Herzog certainly found a lot of material in pathetic loser Timothy Treadwell and his mad delusions of grandeur. While the movie serves to show the man in a fair light, one of the flaws is Herzog trying to justify Timothy's love of nature but really not giving enough time to Timothy's need for nature as a backdrop for his own personal fulfillment. This isn't a slam on Herzog: he does manage to make a few canny statements about the nature of celebrity and its relationship to the myth and romanticized idea of nature that people have gotten from Thoreau. And underneath this, we examine a man who knows nothing of nature, gleefully pals around with bears, and makes up fantasies which nobody can refute due to solitude. Treadwell, for all his friends and people who just put up with him, is a man who wouldn't be out of place in a pathetic reality show. The only difference is that the man himself is so utterly pathetic that the movie eventually becomes a comedy.It's hard to watch the film and not mock Treadwell, despite Herzog's valiant attempts to stop the man from sabotaging himself. Treadwell comes off, after all is said and done, as a man who is in love with himself more than his 'passion' or anything else. He was a charismatic man who, despite having people who cared for him, was only focused on himself. While this kind of honesty would be admired in today's world, Treadwell had no idea what he was doing. He was a failed actor who couldn't even bother pulling his life together after being one-upped by Woody Harrelson. After this, he decided to make nature his unwilling backdrop and was so in love with this that he was more than willing to put people in danger. And now he lives in infamy, part of a documentary that will serve to underline his character flaws and selfishness, forever part of a documentary where his greatest achievement is acting as a key ingredient in bear dung. While Herzog attempts to find a middle ground to give Timothy some credit, it's a losing battle. Timothy dooms himself, his failure to face his problems, and his own ignorance about the very world he inhabits by living in his own pathetic dream world where he 'fights' 'injustice' by doing nothing for his cause that would involve real work and not placing his pathetic self in front of a camera. This is not a documentary about a man and his 'passion' for nature, this is a man defying human civilization by creating his own within his mind and destroying himself when his fantasies meet up with reality and he is not capable of dealing with it.Herzog did a great job at this. Treadwell also did, although he basically assassinated his own character in front of a camera and ended up as fertilizer for his trouble.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Young man rejected by the flock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems that this young man for some reason did not fit in with the flock of his family or humanity which probably rejected his sensitivities/differences and left him feeling like a failed outsider (leading to drink and floundering) Or that he just couldn't resolve himself to how mean "civilization" can be and had to get away from it. This is certainly not uncommon either.This happens to a percentage of people perceived as "different". The flock does not treat them so well. Human species may be by far the most cruel. Being eaten by a bear was probably less painful than years of being rejected by society and the mental struggles around that. It's a harsh culture.I sensed the desperation that he could be anything meaningful that would allow him to fit in or be perceived as a valuable member of humanity. Of course, if you can't make money, well then you're never going to fit in because a lot of it is all about the money.While it might have seemed grandiose, that one idea to hang out with the bears and film it seemed all that he had that he could try at. And he tried to be good or entertaining with it, and I can't blame him that he tried to do that. I could sense the amount of internal pressure going on with him that he should be able to make something out of it but also that he knew that he probably couldn't and that was his last shot.If he had a black-belt spiritual practice along the lines of Krishnamurti it might have helped him rise above it. But apparently he did not.He did not seem gay, he seemed like a heterosexual who was rejected by the flock and couldn't get his bearings enough as an adult man to establish or maintain relationships. Obviously the girlfriend he managed to get got eaten by the bear. So attracting women to his lifestyle on top of his personal struggles would not be easy. He would be extra work if you could survive it.Afterall he did prove that he could coexist 13 summers with bears. Only when he stepped outside of his normal procedure, probably for some subconscious self destructive reason (because he was not gaining recognition, or lack of funds to fly home?), did he have problems with other conditions that were unfamiliar (more desperate bears) But in general yes this man proved his point pretty much. If you hang out with wildlife with loving vibes, peaceful coexistence seems to work to some degree. This is also true between people. Yogis can do the same. Vibrations make a difference.That doesn't mean it's necessarily healthy to test those limits (for you or them) but Tarzan did it too. :-)Probably he should have never taken someone with him who was afraid of bears because that would introduce fear vibrations. You know how they say animals can smell fear.And it's probably true that the degree of violence expressed by animals may have a direct vibrational relationship to the degree of violence being constantly expressed by humans, including to creatures and the planet. This movie must have been a success because it sparked so much discussion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Werner Herzog shouldn't have directed this movie. Errol Morris should have. At times Herzog seems to be trying out the Morris method (put your subject in front of the camera and let them talk) but he can't resist his own explanations, which are almost as ludicrous and funny as Timothy Treadwell's rants and declarations of love for foxes and bears.Treadwell was a distinctly American kind of nut, the product of alienation, Utopian yearnings, showbiz fixations and substance abuse. Morris would have known how to fill in the cultural context Herzog pretty much missed in his heavy handed narration. The limit is the aerial shot of the jumbled ice blocks in the glacier which Herzog sees as Treadwell's soul. Come on now, isn't that just a wee bit Teutonic? It's still a fascinating movie, though. Treadwell's bear footage is amazing, and his self-revelation on camera is unsettling, heartbreaking, painful to watch. And Richard Thompson's music is predictably gorgeous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"He's got what he deserved"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was fascinated by Werner Herzog's documentary "Grizzly Man" (2005) but its main character, Timothy Treadwell induced very controversial feelings. At first, I was very impressed by his love for the wild animals but further into the picture I began to understand that there was something unhealthy in his obsession, that he was deluded. He took it upon himself to "take care" of the grizzly bears, to "protect" them but I don't believe that they needed his protection. He needed them to make his life more useful and meaningful and nothing is wrong with that but in doing so he had crossed the line - he humanized them and he saw himself as the part of grizzly world. He kept repeating feverishly that he would gladly die for them and should he be killed by them he would not want any of them hurt. Well, it all ended tragically - he and his girlfriend (who joined him during the last summer) were attacked by a bear, killed and partially eaten. The bitter irony is that he had sacrificed not only himself but another human life. The bear that killed them, the very creature Treadwell was so in love with, was killed by the police the day after Treadwell's and Emmy's death. Many people say that he got what he deserved when he chose to cross the dangerous line and get too close to the ferocious animals. But he also got what none of us would get - he got Werner Herzog to make a documentary about him. Herzog used the footage (almost 100 hours) that Timothy Treadwell had shot during all these years. Herzog' was the only artist who could say so much and so well about man's obsession that borders with madness. He narrated the movie himself and he said that in his opinion the common denominators for the Universe are chaos, hostility, and murder - not harmony. Anyone who saw Herzog's films would agree with the statement. I just want to add that Universe in his movies radiates magnificent indifference (in the best case scenario), not warmth or love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rare opportunity for man and bear</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Herzog has brilliantly interceded for the welfare of man and bear by authoring this amazing movie. I am moved by Herzog's passion to ensure that Treadwell's life's work did not go unsung.The depth of Timothy Treadwell's misunderstanding of bears is truly heart-wrenching. This was of particular interest to me because I grew up in Alaska during the 1950's. I also lived in Jackson Hole Wyoming later in life, so my contact with wildlife is more than the average person's. We lived in Anchorage while it was still wild and woolly. We still had a saloon and dirt roads. I learned how to walk and ice skate at the same time. As a child, I wore muck-lucks and fur parkas. The main kind of meat I ate for the first few years of my life was bear, moose and deer because everyone hunted for food. Huge green eyed moose sometimes came into our front yard and look into the living room window at night. My mother would be appropriately fearful of them and taught us the same. We learned at a young age to respect all Alaskan wildlife. Despite the dangers, seeing beautiful deer, magnificent moose and other wildlife did have a seductive way with us.So I understand this man's love affair with the bears. Unfortunately, he went way beyond reason because he didn't consider himself a threatening presence to wild animals and he did not truly consider himself as a food source. He couldn't seem to buy into the fundamental cycle of life in the wild.Through his tragedy and the hard work of Herzog, the world can now see both sides of the issue. All wildlife is cared for by nature. All that wildlife needs is to be left alone. This movie should be a wake up call to man. We are obligated to care for these creatures by leaving them alone and not encroaching on their territories. Timothy provided an interesting bridge between our world and theirs. He said several times that he would die for them. In a larger sense, he did, if only to portray on the screen how very important it is that wildlife must be respected in all ways.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is total disrespect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a good documentary, it was put together well and is very interesting. The documentary subject is really entertaining and makes you imagine how this guy lived. However, the Grizzly Man shows total disrespect towards these animals. The discovery channel and all other nature channels are getting carried away with this fad. I'm sick of all these so called "conservationists" getting real close up with dangerous wild animals for "conservation and educational purposes". There is a guy who gets up close with Lions (almost attacked), guys who swim with great white sharks (almost attacked), the crocodile guys (all almost attacked) and then there's this bear guy. Let's just call this what it is.....Remember back in grade school when you and your buddies played-"who could get farther into the old man's yard next door, without him coming out and screaming get off his lawn?" All these guys are doing, is a big "look what I can do!" It's totally for ratings, and yes it does work because I watched it hehe :). But its like what the guy said in the documentary, "It's total disrepect and what he was doing was actually not good for the bears because they aren't afraid of humans anymore". There's a show on MTV called "wildboys". This show shows guys doing crazy stunts with animals, and that is pretty much the same thing these guys are doing but much funnier. Just my Opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remarkable, Devastating and Tragically Beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is surprising that a film which is essentially homemade could be so remarkably engrossing, devastating and tragically beautiful; yet this is what Grizzly Man achieves. Herzog documents not only the views of Timothy Treadwell, but those of his supporters, his friends and his critics. A well balanced film, its beauty can be recognised in gloriously improvised moments and raw passions. There is something bygone and primeval about Treadwell's existence in the wilds that is so uniquely dangerous and awe-inspiring, that anyone but him and his camera would be powerless to capture it. The very essence of his life, one that these days is so utterly lost in the modern world, is returned once more to us in this authentic and at times bizarre, but always striking portrayal of a savage, cruel, tragic but rewarding life. Grizzly Man is one of those rare pieces of film that deserves its place among the greats of the genre and is sure to touch the hearts of all who appreciate it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sad Grizz Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a very sad story for me. I left feeling quite gloomy. My gloom was not simply because a bear killed two people. (I trust this is not a spoiler comment, because from the start of the movie we know this end.) Rather, the down feeling comes from watching a man, a woman and a bear destroy themselves. Timothy Treadwell was very troubled, if not somewhat mentally ill. I say this with respect for him and a profound sadness for his end.He reminds me very much of Christopher McCandless, as described by Jon Krakauer in the book, "Into The Wild" 1996. Christopher also went out alone into the wilderness in an attempt to survive on his own. There seem to be certain men and women who seek to isolate themselves from the rest of the human horde. This is not that uncommon. I believe often many people choose isolation instead of living with all the complexity and pain of society. They choose to live and die alone and without fan-fair. What is uncommon in this instance is Timothy put himself and a friend in harms way and died very violently, drawing lots of attention.I suppose we all choose to a certain degree, how we will die, by how we choose to live. But Timothy went out in a big way. Instead of playing tag in traffic, he played house with bears. What saddens me most is the waste of potential. If only things had been different, Timothy had greatness inside of him. I don't think his best end was played out with the bears. In my opinion, he neither helped the bears, the environment, wildlife or himself. As a matter of fact, he was directly responsible for the death of three living things: Himself, his girlfriend, and the Grizzly.In conclusion, the movie was most about Timmothy Treadwell, a trouble person with a very good heart. I understand his love of nature and of the beasts. The film captured Timmothy's drama very well. It was more a movie about a lonely heart than about bears. However, it was a reminder that you shouldn't play with fire . . . or wild animals! They of course are not evil or even mean, they are just as they should be, dangerous and wild.God Bless Timothy, his companion, and the distressed hungry bear.Randall</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very good. I think director was compassionate and tasteful in leaving out the grisly parts. Some may find themselves looking forward to in a macabre way, but director forces you to listen to the sad plight of this individual who sought refuge in nature, but only brought along his own demons of suffering from rejection and the bitterness towards all people because of it. It is obvious that in his bitterness and loneliness, he chose to latch on to bears and nature, but when we find 'salvation" in just a part of God's creation (instead of in God) we easily pass over into obsession, and this has it's built in curse. He chooses salvation in something that doesn't save, so it kills him. He tells how he is special and can circumvent all the usual safety precautions normal in being around wild animals, and shortly thereafter, his presumptuous attitude brings him instant karma!!But he is tragic, and breaks my heart for the lost and lonely. On a lighter note - i wish he could gotten a clue and just gotten a dog or cat that he was obsessed over like the rest of us.</fullReview>

I was hoping for a story that would offer some real insight into a heart so in love with its subject as to be consumed by that subject. But instead I witnessed a maniac on a suicide mission. The heartbreaking part is he had to take another person with him. Maybe it's mainstream ideology of those who tread where sane men will not that allows Treadwell his posthumous notoriety.

Regardless of his eccentricities, it was a tragic end that no one could possibly wish on another person.That said...The entire film is HYSTERICAL---especially so if you are able to divorce yourself from the fact that it is real and pretend that it was written by Matt and Trey. Even the Coroner, who, I assume was a real person and not an actor, is breathtaking. I kept expecting Cartman to show up at the end and sum up with some rude comment. The narrator's German accent---everything about the movie was over-the-top stereotypical and, well, you just have to see it. Do I feel guilty for laughing? Absolutely. Will I indulge again? YES. It really could not have been deliberately scripted to be any funnier. I agree with the person who compared this fellow to Corky in "Waiting for Guffman". The sheer megalomania of the man is...like watching Stan, Cartman, Kyle and Kenny play ninjas. I definitely recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crocodile Hunter and Mr. Rogers.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Grizzly Man is a documentary film about Timothy Treadwell's expeditions to Alaska to live with the Alaskan Brown 'Grizzly' bears. For 12 years Timothy Treadwell had been making trips to Alaska to film and live with these bears. This all ended in 2003 when Timothy and his girlfriend (Amie Huguenard) were both tragically killed by one of these bears.You are giving the impression that this was Timothy's escape from reality and that he wanted to be a bear himself. He claims he is a protector of bears, yet the bears he would commune with are protected (A cross between Crocodile Hunter and Mr. Rogers). This is a sad tale about a man who apparently could not deal with society and could only find peace with his bears. What he thought was kinship with the bears seemed to be more like tolerance. There were many warning signs in the film that he obviously ignored. He also violated regulations designed to protect him and ultimately paid the price.I do not feel sorry for Timothy, he was a nut case and spread misinformation about these bears. However, it is worth seeing some incredible footage of the bears, foxes, and other wildlife that Timothy shoot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a movie about a man who was eaten alive twice....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Timothy Treadwell moved to LA transfixed on the hope of becoming a star, but got "eaten alive" by the decision makers in the entertainment industry. He then went to Alaska to make what happened to him figuratively in LA a horrible reality by taunting grizzlies until one finally took his bait and killed him. The only surprises were that it took 3 years to accomplish his dance, and that he tragically took someone (an innocent woman) with him. Ironically, in his death, director Herzog came along and made him a posthumous star in what is a most compelling movie about man's relationship to nature.Treadwell emerges not as a sympathetic environmentalist, but as a narcissistic, compulsive, and mentally imbalanced wacko hell-bent on self-destruction. Not that he isn't sympathetic; he is. But he is so obviously wrong that one cannot leave the theater thinking he got what he deserved.Imagine a common housefly with a microscopic video camera flying around someone's house, pretending to be at one with the humans, filming its exploits for the other flies. The fly buzzes all around the humans, showing how the humans won't hurt it so long as it doesn't give its ground. When one of the humans tries to shoo the fly away, it tells the human it loves it. Sooner or later the hairy little pest is going to get swatted, and rightly so. Well, If I were a grizzly bear I'd feel about as sorry for Treadwell as a human would about that fly. Treadwell had to know this, and yet he deludes himself into thinking that he was somehow immune to the irrefutable laws of nature in which there are predators and prey and never the twain shall meet.In the end, the bears probably hurt him less than the Hollywood producers who years earlier led him on with false hopes; the producers being far more dangerous than grizzlies, especially in their native habitat.</fullReview>

This guy was well known up here as a nut case and a danger to the bears he thought he was protecting. He lied about his actions to his family, saying he was fighting off people trying to harm and hunt the bears. I have seen previews of the movie and from the actions the bears around him were taking they were very stressed and it's a wonder he wasn't attacked long before he was. This guy got what was coming to him, it's just a shame he had his girlfriend with him. If you do see this movie just remember, Treadwell was more of a threat to these bears than you can possibly imagine. By being around them the way he was, the bears become accustomed to being around people. When bears and people are in close proximity someone usually winds up being killed, and it's usually the bear for safety reasons.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Strange, this hobby of mine, watching films. I saw two documentaries in one year about men obsessed with grizzly bears. Grizzly Man is the better of the two in every conceivable way.Shortly after seeing Project Grizzly (do a search), an empty, unfunny, uninspiring and poorly made documentary about an idiot in a tin suit, I heard about Grizzly Man. I heard it was a class act, and I heard right.I'll leave the detail to other, far better reviewers. But I've just watched Grizzly Man for the first time - I'm a fan of Werner Herzog, I believe Aguirre Wrath of God to be one of the finest, most scorchingly memorable films that I've ever seen - and I am deeply touched.To those who simply want to "hear the tape" ... you are categorically wrong. Watch this personal, moving, surprising, shocking, unpredictable film, and maybe you will understand Herzog's tasteful decision to leave the tape unheard. I hope Jewel Palovak has destroyed the tape, because nobody with compassion needs to hear it. Hearing the sound of Tim and his girlfriend being attacked and eaten by a grizzly would have destroyed the film's (and Timothy Treadwell's story's) dignity, and would have reduced Grizzly Man to not much more than a snuff movie.This is a beautiful film, an instant top five in all the documentaries I have ever seen, it has great intelligence, humour, shake your head in disbelief moments, and it is paced by a great director, a story teller. My respect to Herzog, and to Treadwell's friends who helped bring his story to the screen. A new treasure in my DVD collection.</fullReview>

If you've seen 'Waiting for Guffman' and the character Corky St. Claire, you've seen the main character from this movie. The movie is fairly enjoyable as a great example of bad film-making with obvious heavy handed, staged direction and unintentional humor. The only sad things about the film is that an effeminate self-destructive manic-depressive and his girlfriend died to make this clunker, the tree-hugging environmentalist stereotype is re-enforced and Christopher Plummer gets no royalties.

		<shortDescription>This movie is a unintended comedy about a bizarre guy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must say that I had never heard of this guy until three days ago. Well, I'm Brazilian and Timothy Treadwell is completely unknown in my country (although I believe he must be famous in the United States). Then as I heard of him? To summarize: the internet. I was on youtube watching a video of the naturalist Casey Anderson playing with a brown bear named Bella. So I was reading the page comments, and I saw someone to comment in irony tone: "Don't be another Timothy Treadwell." This immediately aroused my curiosity. Who is this guy? When searching on Google, I found the biography of this man, a supposed passionate naturalist by bears in Alaska, who died tragically eaten by a bear in 2003, along with his girlfriend. Only this information impressed me, and when I found out they had made a documentary about his life and his filming, of course I wanted to watch the film. Well, after finishing seeing "The Grizzly Man" last night, I leave here my main impressions:I can understand the love of Timothy by nature and by the bears, because I also love nature, I also love bears - they are really impressive, beautiful and majestic creatures. But one thing is you love and admire something, another thing is you dangerously invade the wild space, ignoring the natural laws, and ignoring the true nature of bears and their true human nature. Although he recorded impressive scenes, such as the grand struggle of male bears by a female, which show to us the immense power of these animals, Timothy's recklessness and narcissism are evident. Philosophically speaking, I disagree with Timothy and with the Herzog director's view of what is Nature. I don't see nature with the naive and childish view that everything is harmony, peace and beauty, but I don't have this depressing view that everything is pure chaos and sheer destruction. I think the nature is a mixed and combination of both. Yes, I see moments of destruction, cruelty and suffering in it, but I also see moments of beauty, joy and harmony. I think the question is have the wisdom to know, to study and to understand the beautiful and the ugly at the same time.For me, the documentary worked as an unintended comedy. There are sad moments, as the moment when Herzog heard the tape recording when Timothy and his girlfriend were attacked, but most of the time, I found myself crying laughing. The part where Timothy is in ecstasy for see a bear poop is hilarious. The part where a interviewed criticizes him without mercy saying that the bears think him like a mentally retarded also made me laugh. Undoubtedly, Timothy Treadwell was a very bizarre dude, but their relatives and friends are also unintentionally comic figures. I mean, the mother and father, his ex-girlfriend, the "platonic" friend, and the mustache guy in the helicopter who found his remains are creatures as eccentric as Timothy. The only person who seemed more normal next him was Amie, after all, she was afraid of bears and not approached them so dangerously. Unfortunately she hardly appears and remains unknown to us. In fact, this film is not about bears, but about a bizarre dude called Timothy Treadwell.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Much of this film is pretty standard, and it seems to follow basic conventions of documentary filmmaking. However, there's an added layer of depth and exploration, one that is entirely composed because of what Herzog is going for. You can sense his intrigue and fascination with his subject all throughout the film. What should be noted is that while Herzog makes it a point to actually tell us the ways in which his worldview is different from Timothy's, he still does so in a respectful, mannered way. He seems to respect Timothy and that comes shining through, he seems to even look up to him in a weird way for what he does. There's no judgement at all, and instead Herzog comes across as yet another viewer just interested in this story, lending the film its poetic nature.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If Timothy Treadwell had been a test pilot, a volcanologist, a doctor working with Ebola patients in Africa, a Christian martyr, or anyone else who believes in, and loves what they do enough to back it with their lives, no one would denigrate him or flood his contribution with hate. But Timothy Treadwell is vilified.No one regards the Kraffts as crazed loonies; neither do they Gus Grissom, St. Peter, or scientists who die to find cures and to help end suffering. We grant them their "crazy" cause, even though they knew the risks involved. We admire, even worship,some of them; but Tim Treadwell is vilified.In our upside down societies, we pay to see Evil Kinevels jump canyons; we thrill to death defying, pointless stunts like high speed car and boat races; yet Tim Treadwell is vilified.For any uninitiated folk, park rangers cannot protect bears 100% of the time and poachers do not respect laws (hence the name,"poacher"); it does not matter what areas are set aside for bear safety. Recently,a man was caught in a Northwestern airport trying to smuggle a large cache of bear gizzards and paws to China. In the scene showing the bear's carcus, the one who killed Tim and Amie, observe the severed paw(s). This was done so someone could make a buck selling them. What the bear did was Nature; what the human did was perversion; the reason Timothy was there in the first place.Fish and Wildlife Departments are owned by hunters and exist, not for the protection of wildlife, but for Man's killing pleasure.Timothy Treadwell WAS protecting bears. He brought a spotlight to the entire issue of animal and human rights. Amie died because she was willing to do so for the person she loved. This was her choice and should be honored. Amie was an incredibly brave human being; let no one use her courage to disparage the very purpose of her death.All saints and crusaders for any cause, all envelope pushers in whatever field, are committed to something more important to them than their lives, than the brief and otherwise mundane existence the rest of us choose to lead.In defense of our own self to our self, we somehow must account for this greater courage than our own. We thus denigrate or worship the Tim Treadwells of our world. We worship those we agree with, and deny those we don't. But no matter which, we must bow to their bravery to live and die beyond the usual,the secure confines of our own decisions.Safety does not give immortality, but passion gives life. Timothy Treadwell lead a passionate and worthwhile life. Albert Schweitzer said, "We are life which wills to live in the midst of life which wills to live." I thank Timothy Treadwell for reminding us that bears have the will, and the right, to live.</fullReview>

Not warming his hands by the heat of some fresh poop..Timothy Treadwell wanted his death by bear to be on film and his "legacy",this i felt tarnished any good he ever did. sadly i have heard the attack came on so sudden he didn't have time to remove the lens cover so an audio recording of him being eaten was all.

This attitude led to a fatal tragedy, that also included his girlfriend at the time. Werner Herzog captures testimonials from the victim's friends and relatives, ecologists, biologists and pretty much everyone related to the event that happened, so it was interesting to see very different inputs on the matter. Some understand that he died doing what he loved and that he truly belonged to the wilderness while others think he was actually disrespecting the bears, contradicting everything he used to stand for. Finally, the director not only interacts with these people in a very heartfelt manner, but he also communicates with the viewer on several occasions, showing his own reflections on Timothy's thoughts and actions, making Grizzly Man always a profound and enthralling experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Grizzly Man" is unlike any nature documentary I've seen; it doesn't approve of Treadwell, and it isn't sentimental about animals. The documentary is an uncommon meeting between Treadwell's loony idealism, and Werner Herzog's bleak world view. Treadwell's footage is sometimes miraculous, as when we see his close bond with a fox who has been like his pet dog for 10 years. Or when he grows angry with God because a drought has dried up the salmon run and his bears are starving. He demands that God make it rain and, what do you know, it does. Treadwell was an environmentalist who gained notoriety when his passion for grizzly bears led him to spend 13 consecutive summers (1991 through 2003) on the Alaskan peninsula living amongst them. During his last five years, Treadwell brought a video camera with him to capture images of the bears and himself in their territory. In October 2003, Treadwell and his girlfriend, Amie Huguenard, were killed by a grizzly. Their remains were discovered the next day and the bear was shot. Left behind by Treadwell was about 100 hours of footage that Herzog has sifted through to produce this fascinating motion picture. Treadwell was more complex than he seemed. In rambling, confessional speeches recorded while he was alone in the wilderness, he talks of being a recovering alcoholic, of his love for the bears and his fierce determination to "protect" them -- although others point out that they were safe enough in a national park, and he was doing them no favor by making them familiar with humans. He had other peculiarities, including a fake Australian accent to go with his story that he was from Down Under and not from New York. "Grizzly Man" addresses some complicated themes. What is that fine line between man and nature? Did Treadwell see himself as more bear than man? Were the liberties he took by initiating such close contact with the bears "disrespectful" (as one Native American puts it) to the natural boundaries between a predator and its potential prey? Certainly, Treadwell found a home in the wilderness with his beloved bears that he could not achieve in human society. Regardless of one's views of his passionate work and lifestyle, "Grizzly Man" is compelling material from start to finish.</fullReview>

Contrary to what I anticipated, 'Grizzly Man' is first and foremost a character study; the man is discussed far more than the beasts he surrounded himself with. From the onset, I was surprised by Timothy Treadwell's eccentric demeanour; I was even more surprised by how quixotic and naive he was. Treadwell had been both an alcoholic and drug user prior to his Alaskan adventures, and it seemed as if he was still hitting the bottle during his rambling, gushing monologues about his love for the animals and the immense passion he had for his mission of 'protecting the bears'. The main problem with Treadwell was that his objective was irrelevant and aimless; the bears weren't really under any threat. Indeed, an interviewee spoke about bear culls, an activity which I admittedly didn't see any purpose in, but these culls didn't affect the stability of the population. Overall, Treadwell's apparent love for bears was a self-serving endeavour; he was never going to improve the bears' quality of life, but the bears certainly improved his. The problem with the film is Timothy Treadwell, it's hard to resonate with the man due to his foolishness and juvenile manner. Treadwell became increasingly conceited throughout his footage. His complacency reached its zenith in an almost comically ironic segment recorded hours before his death where he proudly stated that he had reached a point of untouchability with the bears - it summarises just how detached from reality he was. This is another of Werner Herzog's accomplished documentaries, however it is Treadwell's flawed, rather unlikeable personality that makes it one I probably won't watch again.www.hawkensian.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The violent bear it all away</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Herzogian stuff, as is usually presented to us; the romance with madness, with the edges of the world, the one and the same precipice where the transcendent vision is possible. And once there, the agony of breaking through as the agony of spiritual growth or destruction.It is about the journey to the ecstatic image, as he favors it. A long time ago, that image was occasionally so pure - I'm thinking of the parting shots of Heart of Glass and Cobra Verde - it stirred into an expanding realization. I could use it to situate myself in the center of things. The finale of Heart of Glass for example, with the rock in the middle of the sea and us in a canoe towing away in oblivion; it was, at once, a vision of humanity and the source from where everything emanates. It was its own asymmetrical circle, the stuff that old religions made symbols of.This, this is Herzog in a mainstream, accessible way. Awkward to no small degree, especially when thought of as a documentary. It is, once again, about a feverish man struggling to break through - from his humannness into a primal state of the world.In the first part Herzog mischievously paints the romantic picture that no doubt must have accompanied Treadwell's eulogies; the 'child of nature', blissfully free, compassionate, kind, at one with nature. The film may seem rather tepid at this point.That picture then squashed, almost with delight; this 'child of nature' as a psychotic individual peddling the image of the white knight, his delusions of protecting nature pierced by inner turmoils, violent tantrums. Herzog relishes the opportunity to remind us again that nature is chaotic, murderous, not the romantic picture painted by Treadwells. We see the breakdowns on camera, from the journals he kept alone in the wilderness.This is what must have attracted Herzog to the story. In spite of everything else, Treadwell was a filmmaker. He stylized a persona, invented himself through his own fictitious narrative. In many respects, he is like Herzog himself.So this is the broader thing; the reinvention of self. Treadwell shot over 100 hours of footage from his days in the Alaskan wilderness. Whatever he intended to accomplish with those video journals, it proves a powerful document for a different reason; not of a man yearning to be one with nature, you don't need a camera for that, but of a man - neurotic in clinical terms - yearning to be one with himself. So yes, the entire footage is part Treadwell's inner monologue, part flamboyant performance before a cinematic mirror - the camera as both confessional and theater stage.Of course the performance could not contain him, as we find out. We see here the makings of one such performance, and the real personality intruding upon the persona acting a role.So we have blurred boundaries between this actor's performance and real life; blurred more by interviewees conducted like actors to perform, blurred even more by another filmmaker conducting the original footage into his own narrative. And then all sorts of two-way inroads between the world intruding into the one narrative (eventually violently removing the actor from the stage), Herzog's second narrative into the first. It's basically New Wave stuff, but Herzog was never much attuned to self-reference so he doesn't emphasize this strand. What he seeks is the ecstatic image.The ecstatic image that binds all of it together is the aerial shot of a craggy, rocky wasteland as the landscape of this man's soul. As above, that kind of thing.What keeps this back for me is how much Herzog projects of himself in the work. Nature, the world, is no more Treadwell's wistful idea of it, than it is Herzog's. It is an interesting thing in and off itself, but based on what I know him to be capable of, it left me wanting more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Obsession and devotion paint the portrait of an insane yet passionate man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The dedication of man is astounding and often times disturbing. What drives certain people is always different. Some people are driven by money, others fame, others freedom. What drove Timothy Treadwell was nature. Grizzly Man is a documentary about this man, Treadwell, who lived the last 13 years of his life in the Alaskan wilderness living amongst the grizzly bears that live in the region. He studied the bears intensely, compulsively recording himself and the wildlife, compiling over 100 hours of footage. But he met his tragic end when he and his girlfriend at the time were mauled to death by a bear in 2003. Grizzly Man paints a portrait of this man and chronicles his deep bond with nature and how it drove him to pure madness. His love and devotion are unmatched by any nature activist ever known and it is this passion that led him over the certain invisible boundaries of nature that are not meant to be crossed. It is a tragic yet honest story of one man's obsessed, often selfish, devotion to what he loved.What a man like Timothy Treadwell reveals to us is that in order to be so passionately devoted to something you really do have to be somewhat insane. It is imperative that you have a certain amount of psychoticness to your character to have the kind of devotion like Treadwell had. Treadwell proves that in order to completely devote your life to something you love you have to let go of your human side and become one with whatever it is you are so passionate about. And Treadwell does just this. He becomes one with nature. In his own mind he becomes part of the bear community. He keeps his distance, but always strives to push the boundaries of what nature will let him get away with. Tragically, he pushed the boundaries one step to close, resulting in his death.Just as a quick disclaimer, there are those out there who are skeptical of the validity of Grizzly Man. I for one believe what I witnessed in this marvelous film and am really aggravated by those who just feel a compulsive need to be skeptical of every little thing they are told is true. This is why there are people who don't believe in gravity. Because we feel this ridiculous need to put down whatever is told to us. And in Grizzly Man if you focus on trying to debunk everything that goes on in this film, you a) make an ass out of yourself, and b) miss the heart and the meaning of this film.It is a beautiful portrait of a man's determination and love for nature. And it also portrays a bleak contrast that nature is still, well, nature. It is still dangerous and you can't become so disillusioned by its beauty and grandeur that you forget you are still putting yourself in danger. Grizzly Man is very respectful to Treadwell and never bashes him for doing what he did, but it certainly establishes a firm division between reasonable and unreasonable. What Treadwell did was at times unreasonable, but he did it all so obsessively and passionately. He stood for something, and the film respects that, while also not forgetting that fact that what happened was bound to happen.This film is beautiful, visceral, and real. It gives us an insight into a truly unique human being and it tells his story in the most respectable fashion it can. There is some incredible footage in this film, and by that I mean the almost surreal footage of bears and nature that Treadwell captures, and also the surreal and at times disturbing footage of humanity that Treadwell unintentionally captures in himself. Treadwell knew that what he was doing was crazy. He establishes that many times throughout the film. It is incredibly disturbing just how many times Treadwell talks about how face-to-face he is with danger and how he is constantly on the, in his own words, "precipice of life and death." Sometimes you feel as if he knows he is going to die doing this, but it doesn't phase him as he continues on in his determined quest to study and protect these bears. It is crushingly sad to know the result of his passion, but it serves as a very pure reminder of our morbid reality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Case Study Of A Flake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film is no nature documentary, as some people evidently had thought this was going to be, but rather the case study of a lunatic. It is clear that Timothy Treadwell was a deluded man who called himself the protector of the bears in the nature preserve he was staying in. Of course if any danger had come, he had no gun or other means of protecting himself or anyone or anything around him. Also, despite the pictures he took, he provided no observations about the bears or foxes or anything else you could not find better done in any other nature documentary. On top of that, he still carried his childhood teddy bear with him when he traveled to Alaska. Which is just as well when you consider he was such a childish man who treated the animals around him more like pets than nature's creatures to be respected.The truly shocking part, though, is why anyone would have wanted to befriend him. The girlfriend who was with him, in the few scenes she appeared in, seemed to dislike being around the bears, but she stayed with him even to her death. Evidently he had some sort of personal magnetism, for I would have thought anyone spending enough time around this man would have killed him long before any bear would have done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everybody highly rates Werner Herzog's late cinema, but I prefer his early work when he did not pretend (at least as obviously as now) to be papa-guru to all of us viewers. Although Timothy Treadwell is hardly a character to like, with his attitude to animals as if they were domesticated pets (I called it the «Walt Disney syndrome»), and his egomaniac personality (the most evident trait of the catalog of behavioral problems he seems to illustrate), Herzog's well-known self-righteous, cynic preaching is neither enticing nor convincing. I tend to identify more with the point of view of Sven Haakanson Jr., the director of the Alutiiq Museum, who voices the belief of the native Americans regarding nature (a belief that it seems to me is shared by most natives from Alaska to Patagonia), living more in atonement, in community with our environment. He makes a single appearance and Herzog does not follow that line of thought, convinced that he has the final word ?which indeed he has, as he turns Treadwell's footage into his own ego trip.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A balanced portrait of a unique character</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Werner Herzog's 2005 documentary, Grizzly Man, is the story of Timothy Treadwell, a self- styled naturalist who spent 13 summers living amongst the bears in southern Alaska. Five of these summers Treadwell spent with video cameras collecting over 100 hours of video footage, until he ultimately died at the end of his 13th summer from a brutal bear attack.Timothy Treadwell is a person prone to provoke divergent reactions: from those who admire his determination, his boldness and his love of nature, to those who despise him for his reckless and naive idealization of nature. Herzog went through this extensive footage and interpolated quite a bit of it into his film. He blends the footage with a number of interviews from those who knew Treadwell and his own narration, to create a balanced portrait of Treadwell. He shows both the admirable and the not so admirable sides of Treadwell's quest. We see a person who isn't quite comfortable in human society and who is much more at home among the bears. But, on the other hand, Treadwell's comfort among the bears is built on a deliberate ignorance of the savage cruelty of nature. We see someone who loves and is dedicated to the bears and wants to protect them, but who also has become sort of territorial and possessive, regarding any visitors to his region as intruders.Herzog inserts, through his narration, his own take on the psychology and motivation of Treadwell which is quite interesting. But I think the movie would have been better if Herzog had held back on this more, considering he really only got to know Treadwell second hand and thus is quite speculative.All in all, though, the flaws in this movie are minor. It's a moving portrait of someone, whether you like him or hate him, who is quite a curious and interesting character. I read on Wikipedia that Leo DiCaprio had planned on starring in a biopic on Treadwell's life. I'm sort of glad this was never made because I fear it would have over-emphasized the admirable side of him and portrayed him as a crusading savior. It's nice that instead we have an intelligent and even-handed approach from a talented filmmaker like Herzog.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brings Up More Than I Thought It Would</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Grizzly Man" is a slick and stylized documentary about the life and death of Timothy Dexter/Treadwell, and his companion Amy/Amie, both of whom fell victim to the very element Timothy proclaimed to love and want to preserve. I won't say how, in case you haven't seen this film yet. However, I will have to say that this ranks up as an important film for most people to see, not for it's subject but for the issues it raises.I would encourage the viewer to try and focus on Tim's voice alone, and draw opinions about him from his own narration of his life. Personally, I found it to be more telling than he may have intended. He often vacillates between hysteria and despair, cursing many things in his own life and the life that surrounds him that he claimed to be escaping. But if you listen carefully, there is almost a manic fatalism. He seemed to me to want to be swallowed by the natural world. If you notice, in almost every clip of him he eludes to his own death in the wilderness, always reminding us the he could die by all measure of means. I began to wonder if he actually wanted this, and perhaps was seeking it on some level...However, for all of his claims to be there for the wildlife, he definitely had a narcissistic streak in him that colored his self-effacing statements. True martyrs rarely seek the limelight as much as he did. He was compelled to talk about himself more than his 'precious bears', spoke about his life and himself in the third person, and attempted to mock and ridicule those he perceived as not believing as he did. If he indeed believed in what he said he did - I wonder if the animals were an outlet for him only because he felt so unaccepted by other humans; or, perhaps, some form of self-loathing that made him want to run away from his own kind. The risks he took were foolish, but purposeful--he knew what he was doing, but perhaps more for himself. It may have started as a noble idea, but I think the footage proves that it did not end that way for him. The only reason this story is a tragedy is that someone else died with him, his companion who it is said did not really want to be there.Then, other thoughts began to grow within me that made me question how I really feel about our world, the animal's world, and a host of other issues. I do wholly believe there are big-hearted people with truly noble aspirations out there who do want to help and make a difference, and The Fates love them and bless them for that. And then there are other groups who may truly be doing more harm than good. Being from (and in) the Pacific NW, I'm all too aware of these "eco-terrorosts" who believe that violence upon animals justifies violence against humans, a belief I do not share in the least. Violence doesn't prove any point, except that that person is violent. Period. How can blood and angry words ever invoke harmony and understanding? How does screaming about how evil society is and calling me names, without even knowing me, make me want to listen to you? So, because of certain groups in vogue these days, animal preservation has become more of a pundit point rather than the worthy cause it is. But, after seeing this, I do have to agree with a few points. In that, even though we as humans may have the best of intentions, the more we interfere the more unintentional harm we may be doing. Yes, there are very good people living among animals these days, trying to help them be used to us. But, is this really such a good idea? And, do we really belong there? Yes, we are mammals--we are from these species. But, sadly, we are not of them anymore. We have domesticated ourselves just as we have domesticated dogs and cats over time. A great parallel would be to take a modern German Shepard and toss it in to a pack of wolves, in order to show them that the dog is simply another wolf. What do you think would happen?Through thousands of years, that German Shepard is no more wolf anymore than we are ape. This does not give us the right to infiltrate their land, nor does it give us the right to prove that we are the most dominant species - a theory of which I personally have doubts. After all, in a "fair fight" against me and a bear, I have a good idea who would win! The only things that links animals and humans anymore is that we are all equally killable. And, we all do sometimes kill our own. Personally, I feel that given a choice, any animal would choose to leave us alone. I think we owe the animals that same courtesy. If we really want to help and respect the animals, then preserve where they are and leave them alone. As much as we care, and as much as some guardians such as Dian Fossey have cared with all of their lives, I think the best thing we can do is to not try and integrate with them, but leave them to their own existences and give them the space they need to live their lives in peace without us. They've been here thousands, millions, of years before us, and chances are good that they'll be here after us, too. We could help so much more by working to keep their spaces just that--their spaces. Just as we work so hard to keep ours. It's only fair.If you're ready to think about these things in a way that has not been fed to you, please see this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Werner Herzog's film about Timothy Treadwell, 'Grizzly Man', is a bit of a mixed bag - not just showing some of his video footage of the bears and foxes he lived among, but also discussing the violent attack which led to his death, mauled and eaten by a bear alongside his girlfriend.Treadwell treated the wild animals as friends and humans, but it isn't clear whether he was just naive or plain stupid when it came to dealing with bears. Herzog presents him with some sympathy, but does ultimately sit on the fence - as good documentarists should - about his true feelings about his subject.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most of us probably heard the little snippet of news that some guy got eaten by some bears in Alaska. I seem to remember that story, well what I didn't know was that his footage would be found, and then assembled by none other than madman Werner Herzog.Herzog's blunt honesty in this documentary is quite surprising, he both respects Treadwell and finds him to be foolishly irrational. From a psychological perspective you have to wonder what exactly pushed Treadwell into his madness. He was a failed actor who somehow wanted attention and notoriety and got it by saying he was protecting the bears. Herzog shows that he was mostly doing harm by being around these bears and violating state park laws. Of course we can all understand this man's desire to wander out into the woods, everyone wants to just get out there sometimes.The subject matter of this documentary is strange, and the character we focus on is not incredibly interesting, but Herzog puts on his best show, with his deep German accented narration and straight forward interviews. This would have been dull had anyone else done it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Timothy Treadwell spent thirteen summers living isolated with the wildlife and grizzly bears of Alaska until one of the bears killed both him and his girlfriend in 2003. And director Werner Herzog (Aguirre, and Fitzcarraldo) executes this perfectly, making something so vividly wild and untamed into art - intertwining Treadwell's own footages with new interviews of his ex-girlfriend, pilot and coroner, creating something very profound and immediately unforgettable. Herzog treats the miraculous life of Treadwell with huge attractiveness to the bizarre and obsessive soul of Treadwell, through Treadwell's own observations as a filmmaker, bear-lover and outsider, Herzog captures magical moments of the tragedy, the uniqueness and the compelling journey this is. 'Grizzly Man' is a brilliant documentary, and as Herzog himself narrates that the last thing we should do is to treat animals like people - you can't help to feel both sides of Timothy Treadwell's life; his foolhardiness and his pure love for the bears.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good films move you, and great films resonate within you long after the final reel. Before encountering this film, I had a vague awareness of Timothy Treadwell as 'the bear guy', someone who briefly came to prominence because of the manner of his death, a man who had the crazy idea that bears and humans could live in the same space, and paid for it with his life, dragging his hapless girlfriend in his ill-fated wake. Maybe he was an urban myth, or a Darwin Award contender briefly illuminated in a forwarded email.In fact, Timothy Treadwell left over 100 hours of video tape charting his expeditions to Alaskan bear country. How the footage came to be acquired and manipulated by Herzog I do not know, but thank God that it did. It would be easy to poke fun at Treadwell as a un-informed tree-hugger. The voices of those that do so are heard in the film. On the other hand, one could easily treat a man who loved bears dearly and paid for it with his life with reverence. Those people are also represented.Herzog rises above. He finds the humanity in Treadwell without ignoring the madness. He shows the beauty of Treadwell's images and the idiocy of some of his acts. Treadwell was a complex character; handsome, fit , articulate, low in self-esteem, boastful, humane, vicious... All these sides to his character are revealed, without ever answering the question, "Why did he do it?" To try to do so would be trite, and Herzog skillfully leaves it up to the viewer to decide how they feel about Treadwell's life and death. The coldness in the eyes of the fox, the indifference in the bear's stare - stunning, haunting images that get inside your soul. Treadwell cursing the Park Service - images he may never have revealed to the world had he lived, but glimpses of a fragile being that we are privileged to view because of tragic circumstances. If Treadwell had lived, he may have edited this footage himself to create a different picture of his quest, his being. That he died means his legacy, through Herzog, is a documentary of poignant beauty and heartrending tragedy. Herzog does not redeem Treadwell, but he humanises him, and lets us see ourselves as we could easily become. Sometimes the path less chosen is less chosen for good reasons.The 50-minute extra on the DVD, on the making of the soundtrack for the film, is an outstanding documentary in its own right. Grizzly Man is an sublime work of art that illuminates and edifies. There is no better study on celluloid of the flawed human condition.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A misanthropic amateur naturalist's descent into madness of self-delusion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have heard about the documentary, even saw the trailer which impressed me. But feature length documentaries tend to disappoint me often, even outrage me for having wasted time and money, like that pointless and aggrandizing garbage film "Rize" (I stopped watching the film into an hour).Grizzly Man is almost the opposite, but it's not without the faults. There's Werner Herzog's fairly opinionated running commentary mocking to the point of denigrating the protagonist Timothy Treadwell the more he becomes crazed in the illusion of delusion. There are a few incredibly annoying shots that could be trimmed, like Timothy's pathetically grating minutes-long "nature lover versus authoritative mankind" rambling peppered with more F-bombs than Al Pacino's big-gun-blazing rant in Scarface. And the film does feel a tad manipulative, toying with the audience's emotions as Mr. Herzog is known for fudging with the facts in Aguirre, the Wrath of God (a mediocre film that's more tedium than awe, with the "factual prologue" being a hoax) and Invincible (a technically and aesthetically amazing film, though its allegation of based on a true story is total bunk). Mr. Herzog is a master audience manipulator of film, documentary or fiction, that is more in line with another semi-lunatic accomplished filmmaker Lars Von Trier. So I watched Grizzly Man with a healthy dose of skepticism, wary not to allow Mr. Herzog play with my emotion again.However, the candid character of Timothy Treadwell is stunning in valor and pathetic in delusion. I shook my head in frustration, disagreement and, yes, despair, as Treadwell repeatedly explain his rationale for interacting with the Alaskan bear species at the expense of his life. Werner's barely-mocking, critical narration notwithstanding, I was appalled and amazed simultaneously as Timothy interact with the very wild animals that might strike him *dead* at any moment, even touching the wild foxes which might bite his petting fingers and give him rabies. Timothy was certainly no magician -- he was an amateur naturalist/animal rights advocate/environmentalist/documentary filmmaker.If I met him and knew of his expeditions that he would sacrifice his life for, I would punch him in the face to wake him up from his slumber of irrational self-delusion. Timothy gave the rational naturalists a bad name, as Herzog's film will show again and again of his descent into irrationality and madness leading to his death that exemplify the English vocabulary "irony".Grizzly Man is one of the finest films that demonstrate without censor the true nature of profound mental illness in human beings, captured on camera by the person himself as he literally lose his mind over time. The increasing mental instability has to do with the lack of the defined purpose of life (Timothy doesn't appear to have a purpose at all until he found his "calling" which is living with the wild bears) and the utter desolation of the wilderness where Timothy was simply dropped off to document his life for a long period of time (a few months at a time) as a "survivalist".I give Timothy a commendation for his valor, but because of his delusion combined with defensive attitude favoring nature over man at all cost, he did not have the foresight to save himself from the cruelty of nature that come around to kill him and his female accomplice. Nature is invisible and there are no boundaries.Timothy is probably guilty of voluntary manslaughter for literally dragging his girlfriend to accompany him on the dangerous expedition until they encounter the hungry bear that ultimately killed them. Nature is very, very cruel and there's nothing sentimental about the "harmony of nature". It's depressing and sorrowful as the viewer may feel in the final half, but for me it was the feeling of frustration and disbelief, wondering what the hell were Tim and Amie thinking.Grizzly Man is an emotionally taut documentary, though there are a few irritating moments of F-bombs (Timothy does appear to be a genuine misanthrope, hence his affection for barrage of cuss words) and Herzog's pretentious moralizing narration. I think viewing the documentary once should be enough, because it had left me emotionally appalled and depressed after the inevitable outcome of death at the savage hand of nature. Mental illness is a serious psychological condition and love of nature cannot and will not cure this terrible condition -- living in complete desolation without human contact for several long summers in rows equal madness and self-destruction, like it did to Christopher McCandless, the subject of the best-selling nonfiction "Into the Wild".*** out of four</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had never seen a Werner Herzog film before I saw "Grizzly Man"; now I want to see more. It's one of the most beautiful, touching, and haunting films ever made. Herzog clearly sympathizes with his subject, late grizzly bear activist Timothy Treadwell, even as he exposes the fallacies of his view of nature. Perhaps the most valuable aspect of "Grizzly Man" is the way it sheds light on the naive, pseudo-romantic pantheism that lies at the heart of so much environmentalism. As Matthew Arnold wrote more than a century ago, "Man and nature can never be fast friends." It's impossible for humanity to live in harmony with nature; we must either dominate it or be consumed by it. Herzog is in a better position to understand this than most, coming from Germany--a country where two hundred years of mysticism, idealism, and romanticism climaxed in the holocaust--he knows the dangers that an uncritical veneration of non-human nature can bring. But the film is not about environmental politics. It's about a sad, lonely man who found a quest that gave his life meaning even though it ultimately killed him. Much of the footage Treadwell took in the Alaska wilderness remains breathtakingly beautiful, although even here we can see that he crossed the line by failing to treat the bears with respect. Herzog shows himself a man of decency and compassion (not always common virtues in the arts) by telling one of Treadwell's ex-girlfriends that she should never, never listen to the tape of the fatal mauling and by refusing to play the soundtrack of said tape on his movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What an odd and fascinating documentary on Timothy Treadwell, one of the most unlikely characters you would ever expect to live the longest among one of the worlds most dangerous animals. At first I thought the movie was fictional, because Herzog did a similar "documentary" of Loch Ness that was in fact fake. The movie is mostly an amalgamation of all of Timothy's own personal footage he took of himself and Grizzly bears in the Alaskan wilderness known as the "grizzly maze" which eventually lead to his and his girlfriends death. And let me tell you, Grizzly Adams he ain't! The reason I thought it was fake is that Timothy is one of most effete, emotional and sensitive and, I'm sorry but just plain "gay" sounding men I have ever heard as an outdoorsman. He reminded me of Cristopher Guests character in "Waiting for Guffman". However, this does not detract from the fact he obviously has a strong relationship with animals and a genuine love of the outdoors. Or does he? It is obvious after viewing some of his own footage of himself, however edited by Herzog, that he is clearly narcissistic, and seemingly borderline psychotic and in desperate need of attention or love. How many grown men still have their teddy bear? What is the relationship between himself, the teddy bear and the real bears? What do the bears really represent to him? Some hint that they were an adrenaline rush, a sense of danger, but I think there is more to it than that. His parents talk about his normal childhood, but it seems to be that something went on there they did not let out, or rather a lack of something.Herzog makes his own comments on Treadwell's mental state and his views on nature, and much of it I agree with, but some I do not. Herzog portrays nature as being in constant state of chaos, death and aggression. I would tend to think that it is closer to the Yin and Yang idea, it is both in perfect harmony and total chaos, constantly flowing from one state to another. I also saw the "comments" film that followed the documentary which showed the reactions of friends to the movie. Sometimes I wondered if they saw the same film I did and had overly rosy memories of Treadwell. I don't think anyone said that they thought he deserved to die the way he did, but most indicated that they were not surprised of the outcome and that most people do not get so close to these dangerous animals for precisely that reason, they will KILL YOU. Treadwell clearly knew that, he talked many times of his own death on camera, specifically by the bears. Whether he had a death wish or a perverse need to be consumed by the bears, the part where he touched the feces of a bear was interesting, he seemed so excited to touch the "insides" of the bear, it seemed almost orgasmic. It was definitely weird. Reminded me of guy who answered the internet ad in Germany and consented that he be eaten by another human being.Anyway, after watching "Project Grizzly", the bizarre doc on the Tory Hurtibuise, the Northen Ontario outdoorsman that tried to build a grizzly proof suit I am reminded that if you live in the bush, your brain starts to go a little "funny" and all of a sudden these bears become symbolic of some deep need or hole in your life. For Troy, the bear clearly represented his father. For Timothy, who knows? There might also be a similar relationship, but instead of trying to defeat it in a manly fashion like Troy, Timothy tried to become one with them, to be loved by them.A fascinating film, this is why I love documentaries so much! I love how Herzog talks about the magic of the camera of what you can capture, and I would tend to agree, there is something about the act of filming something that creates incredible stories of REAL drama, not fake over blown Hollywood drama. For nowhere in Hollywood would you EVER have a feminine sounding outdoorsman! I love it, good job.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grizzly Man (2005) ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Werner Herzog's highly acclaimed account on the enthusiastic Timothy Treadwell, who spent 13 years living his life in the wilderness with bears, only to ultimately die along with his girlfriend after being devoured by one. Using key footage culled from over 100 hours of Treadwell's own archival videotapes, Herzog gives us a very emotional film. I thought I was in for a rough ride at first, as within the first two minutes of seeing Timothy on camera it was so evident that he was pretty much a fool who was not only stupid but quite touched in the head, and I figured it would be difficult to really care about what we knew was going to happen to a guy like this who harbored a death wish. I pretty much agreed with one of the several interviewees in the film, Sam Egli, who was a helicopter pilot assisting in the gruesome cleanup after the fateful mauling: " he got what he asked for and deserved, but the tragedy is that he took the woman with him. I think the reason he lasted so long was because the bears must have thought he was mentally retarded or something".Well, whatever the bears thought, I do think Timothy was off his rocker (such as when he lovingly fondles bear poop or wants to be a bear himself, just to use two examples), but he was essentially a harmless person except to himself, as it turned out. And as the film progressed, I did come to feel more for him and think he was a pretty likable fellow, and I did share the anger he felt in one segment where he witnessed poachers arriving at his paradise only to begin throwing rocks at one of his favorite bears. This was in sharp contrast to the love and affection we'd been conditioned to feel with him up till this point.Somehow, we have a natural curiosity to see or hear footage of the deadly bear attack. Though we're teased with actual accounts from people who've heard an existing final audio tape that captures the moans and screams of Treadwell and his girlfriend during their deaths, we are spared the horror of listening to it for ourselves. In a highly emotional and effective moment, Herzog himself listens to parts of the tape privately through headphones, but then breaks down and asks that the player be turned off. He then tells a former lover of Timothy's (who owns the tape and apparently has never had the courage to play it for herself) to never listen to it, and to destroy it.This is a captivating piece of work that touches our hearts in different ways, and holds our interest, even though we know that Timothy Treadwell pretty much played with fire and knew full well he was likely to get burned. *** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just watched the Treadwell documentary last night ? "WTH" (What the Hell)! I feel awful speaking badly about a dead person, but he was clearly a fake...and more importantly...emotionally/mentally unbalanced.I'd already heard about this tragedy?but it angered me a bit more after realizing that he was more about fame and notoriety. In one instance...it's as if he was trying to be like 'The Croc Man' - but big/better. Then...at times...it seemed like he was trying for the 'variety show' angle with animal characters playing their respective parts. However, his most successful portrayal was a staring role on - "When Animals Attack." I only regret another innocent creature (Amie)...along with the two bears...perished due to his need for stardom. Also, why did so many people enable him? They were relative spectators at one of those ancient Roman battles between man and beast. I sincerely feel that several of his 'supposed' friends and close associates who spoke so passionately about him...posthumously...could have prevented this tragic end. Everyone who encouraged/supported his fiascoes is accountable.It's really sad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into the movie really wanting to like it. But I really didn't like Timothy Treadwell which makes it hard to like the film. I don't think what he was doing was necessary or really helpful and he himself is quite annoying and arrogant. I don't agree with his anger and hatred of the park service or his attitude towards humanity. I don't think he understood the grizzlies as he thought he did. He thought of them as his friends; he was wrong in thinking that they cared about him at all. By making them used to his presence he did more harm then good. That being said, the footage of the grizzlies is pretty cool. I would probably have enjoyed a national geographic documentary about Alaskan wildlife more than I enjoyed this. I don't recommend it unless you feel like watching one of those movies that is fun to make fun of, although Timothy is a really easy target with his lack of eloquence and his obvious idiocy.</fullReview>

I guess I thought this movie was more intriguing than good. The movie tackels fairly deep issues about man's role in the world and his place in nature. I really appreciated that the director Herzog chose as his subject a man (Timothy Tredwell) who he strongly disagreed with on many of the issues this film tackeled. I also got the feeling Herzog didn't evan particularly like Timothey (I know I couldn't have standing talking to him for more than 3-5 minutes if I had met him). I personally disagreed wholeheartedly with Tredwell and Herzog but liked the movie anyway. Even if your not it for the philosophical junk the shots of the Alaskan wilderness are beautiful and Bears are just plain fun. It's no Murderball but its good... go see it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In Eichmann in Jerusalem, Hannah Arendt demonstrated to us how evil can be banal; Mr. Herzog has, in his own way, done something just as revolutionary with Grizzly Man: he has shown us the banality that lies at the heart of insanity, for Mr. Treadwell was clearly bonkers, and yet, in hearing his rants and ecstasies among the bears, I could only think, How Pathetic. In Shakespeare, the fools and jesters are often tasked with stating the profundities that other characters are too blind or craven to express. Treadwell's insanity offers no such nuggets, but merely the predictably vague moralizing of an obviously sick man. I did feel a real pity for his female companion. There are so many cautionary tales here, it doesn't bear (pun unintended) listing them all; this is a credit to Mr. Herzog.Still, Treadwell's footage survives him, and as an ecological document, is very fine stuff.</fullReview>

Hmm....It served no purpose....but maybe he faked his own death? The acting is horrible, the dialog is horrible, and yet this film is watchable because of the "tragedy". I think the dude cashed out.

		<shortDescription>A capturing film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had seen the previews for this film and was intrigued by the interaction of Tim and the foxes. I was surprised to see this movie was less about wild nature and more about the nature of one man, Timothy Treadwell.Treadwell's desires and insecurities roil just beneath the surface in ways too loud and too shrill at times. Timothy feels nothing halfway. There is no doubt he loved the Alaskan brown bears deeply, but in an idealized, childlike way. Timothy Treadwell did what Timothy Treadwell thought best for the bears, and for that, he, his girlfriend, and they suffered.He deliberately disobeyed the rules of the park service over and over again. He misrepresented the plight of the bears to the general public and his sponsors and misrepresented their need for him. No bear had been poached in that part of the park in decades, and despite stories to the contrary, only three bears were poached after Timothy's death, and these in a part of the park far removed from the bears Tim was filming. The breaking of park rules was so blatant, that Tim ended up camouflaging his camp to hide from the consequences of tickets and park expulsion that would have inevitably occurred. Not exactly a role model for the kiddies.We find out in the film that Tim consistently misrepresented many things about his life, so I was left wondering what he misrepresented to Aimee Huguenard, his girlfriend who was also killed by a bear. Did he calm her fears with his seeming expertise in the field after surviving more than a decade? Was she finally starting to see behind the mask? According to the film, Aimee told Tim she was ready to leave him and that he was hell-bent on destruction. By a terrifying set of circumstances, Aimee realized too late.Had Tim been as bear savvy as he liked to portray, he would have known the berry crop for the bears in nearby areas had failed. There was an influx of bears to the area all competing for food sources and causing unusual stress through sheer numbers. These things weren't hard to find out or observe. Yet, Tim continued with business as normal believing he knew how to act.The film leads one to believe it was strange, more aggressive bears in the area that may have killed Tim and Aimee, but the two bears killed were both bears known to Tim.I was left feeling that Tim was so concentrated on working out his own problems that he literally could not focus on much else. I believe in adults making their own choices even if it means extreme risk to themselves, but I cannot commend Tim for creating a situation that cost more lives than just his own, particularly when he'd been counseled, and it was all so unnecessary and could have been avoided. Camping away from the bear paths alone would have minimized the risk.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have watched this movie three times now, and would watch it again. I'm drawn to it out of curiosity for the most part. It's a mix of heart warming wildlife and human tragedy. It's has some good wildlife footage, but very little at that. Almost every shot of the bears involves Tim. I would consider it more of an educational film. Showing how careless and intrusive humans can be. While in the presence of dangerous wild animals. I think everyone should watch this, twice. After all, TIM was trying to save the bears. They have a right to live on this planet. Without humans messing with them. I just wish the attack was caught on film. Not out of dis-respect for Amy and Tims death. Only to show how serious BIG BROWN BEARS are. They are NOT pets.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie confirms the need for programs to ensure that psychiatric patients who are non-compliant with treatment receive the treatment that they require to enable them to function in society. In this case, the main character, Timothy, is an alcoholic manic-depressive who, according to the movie, not only refused to take medication for manic-depression, but actually wanted to maintain his symptoms, which led to tragic results. Further, the movie does a disservice to the conservation movement by portraying a mentally ill man as a champion for environmentalism when actually he was using environmentalism as a pretext to act out his delusional fantasies. That Timothy chooses to "protect" grizzly bears, the largest carnivores on land, is further evidence of the depth and intensity of his mental illness and the extent to which his judgment was impaired. Yet those who knew Timothy, and knew how disturbed he was, did nothing to intercede. Then again, perhaps there was nothing that anyone could have done except to watch, in amazement, as a man embarked on a journey to self-destruction.</fullReview>

It had elements of monthly python,Saturday night live the rutles and spinal tap and at first it seemed like a spoof albeit a tragic one and Mr Treadwell came across as some kind of Andy dickesque character throughout the movie as he talked to the bears and other animals and nearly was swatted numerous times by huge bears..the German director's accent somehow added to the absurd feeling of the whole film along with parts like the pilot who dropped them off adding to his title 'former rodeo rider" which had my wife commenting "whats that got to do with it ?" in fact the only sensible bit seemed to be the interview with the man with the droopy mustache stood in front of the aircraft hangar who quipped"The only reason he lasted that long without them eating him was because the bears thought he was mentally retarded" and the "I think one day that bear just had enough of him and thought that day that he might taste good" the ex girl friend rambling on about meeting him at the medieval feast place and talking about setting the soup on fire added to the demented mood of the whole film even the bit where the man showing the exhibit of the bear with its paw taped back on by the look of it ? It reminded me of the old fable told to children of the emperor's new clothes and proved that people will glorify anything even things regarding lack of common sense the icing on the cake was all the strange names of all the various people interviewed and at what point did he have an Australian accent ? macabre indeed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had wanted to see this film before my recent vacation to Alaska. I had hoped to gain some "National Geographic" style insight on bears. However, it just didn't work out. I had a terrific vacation, including bear watching from a pontoon boat in Redoubt Bay.Since then I had the opportunity to watch this film, and what a surprise. This film isn't about bears at all! It's the story of a madman: Timothy Treadwell, a man without naturalist training who spent 13 summers living amongst grizzlies. This was not the film I was expecting.Having said that, I did become intrigued by this movie. Not because of the beautiful vistas or wildlife (both of which I've seen in person), but because of the tale of this soul, a man simultaneously upbeat and downtrodden. This is a character study beyond all character studies, told through his own camera, analyzed through the editing choices and narration of the filmmaker.In the end, this is a human tragedy. We all know the ending: the Grizzly Man gets eaten by the very animals he purported to protect. But this isn't the entirety of the tragedy. Here is a man who survived drug and alcohol abuse and a failed career, who was saved by wrapping himself in a noble cause. Who would later die serving that cause, and, after his death, would be treated as a madman.I find it difficult to review documentaries without reviewing the topic thereof. But I feel this film does a good job weaving the tale of Timothy Treadwell, showing him to be an interesting, driven, compassionate, yet horribly flawed and troubled, soul.I also give the director kudos for not making it gruesome. That would have spoiled the core of the story, the madness that was Timothy Treadwell.8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating exploration of an image</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Timothy Treadwell is a man who spent 13 consecutive summers in Alaska, living near, and practically with, wild Grizzly Bears. In October 2003, he and his girlfriend were attacked and eaten by a bear just days after they should have left the wilderness. Over the previous few summers, Treadwell had videotaped himself in his wilderness adventures, the footage of which makes up the majority of the documentary Grizzly Man. Noted director Werner Herzog has edited the material along with new interviews into a fascinating study of a man who created an image of himself to suit a desire to appear to be "making a difference".Timothy Treadwell is revealed to us through his footage. He was a man with surfer-guy looks, a haircut described by a friend as "Prince Valiant style" and a typical outfit of black clothes, bandanna and sunglasses. He would often set up the camera focused on some bears and step in front to narrate the scene behind him, often with the excited tones of a teenager thrilled by seeing something new. But, Herzog isn't really interested in bears. He is interested in a man who created a mythos around him, latching upon the bears as his personal mission, while significantly overplaying his role in their survival. Treadwell often refers to how he is protecting the bears, but, based on the film, there is little evidence that they are ever in much danger from the outside world. It is pointed out that the bears that Treadwell lived around were on a protected natural range, and only once are we shown other people encroaching on the environs, and they were there to take photos. Treadwell occasionally rants about those who are legitimately looking after the wilderness range (Herzog has the good taste to not air the names that Treadwell says aloud in one scene). He scoffs at the advice given him by park rangers to keep a distance from the bears. Treadwell must be near the animals to protect them, to do what he can for them, he tells us. But the only creature in danger in that wilderness appears to have been Timothy Treadwell.Through various interviews with family, friends and those who found Treadwell and his girlfriend's body, we are shown the opposing sides to the image that was Treadwell. His former girlfriend, Jewel Palovak, who helped him found his organization, Grizzly People, talks about how much he cared for the bears. Two colleagues read hate mail letters from people denouncing him, although those are rather amusing as they are simply regurgitated partisan rhetoric that can be heard on countless talk-radio shows. We hear from a pilot who would drop him off and pick him up each summer, who seems to be somewhat indifferent to Treadwell. Others, including a Intuit bear expert, state that Treadwell had long since crossed the line of common sense and paid the price with his life.Herzog shows us Treadwell's filming technique, where he performs multiple takes of himself in many situations, breaking a portion of the illusion of spontaneity that Treadwell seemed to want to project. While he is not necessarily denouncing Treadwell with this revelation, merely lifting the magician's curtain to show us the workings underneath, it is again instructive in the creation of Treadwell's image. The last few summers he visited, he took his girlfriend, Amie Huguenard, with him, yet still referred to himself as being alone and lonely in the wilderness. She appears in a few fleeting glimpses on the footage, but never clearly. Treadwell had built a persona, and was going to stick to it.At times, Treadwell opens up on camera, talking about his drug past and his lack of success with women. It is uncertain whether they were staged or not, but Herzog believed them legitimate, and you can't help but wonder if some of that footage would have never seen the light of day save for Herzog's inclusion of it. Perhaps the most unsettling moment in the film is when Herzog listens to the audio of Treadwell and Huguenard being killed by the bear that attacked them (Herzog again shows taste by not airing the audio for us to hear). It is recounted by him and the medical examiner in detail, talking about how Treadwell was eventually killed by what he so deeply cherished.Timothy Treadwell was a man who took something that meant so much to him and blew his place in the grand scheme of things out of proportion. We all, at times, want to believe we are important; Treadwell created an image for himself that that was the case, and he, in the end, died for that image.</fullReview>

Treadwell displays signs of a lonely human being looking for love in all the wrong places. he denied being gay but i beg to differ. It saddens me anytime that i see a life lost especially when i know that it was avoidable but he had to have known that it would've happened sooner or later. i have never heard of a gentle grizzly bear and as the narrator pointed out that he hadn't seen any affection or connection between the bears and Treadwell neither did i. all i saw was a bunch of hungry animals.it seems he lead very destructible life, unfortunately he had to take another with him when he died. but how can you hurt a 500+lb bear with a frying pan? i would have never thought of it for sure. I'm sure most people would have ran as far and fast as humanly possible in at least an attempt to save their own life. I'm sure the producer did as much as they could to make some sense out of the purpose of Tim Treadmill's quest for living amongst deadly animals but overall there is no sane reason or explanation for his adventure. who gets excited over fresh bear poop? someone should have seen some signs of mental instability in his actions.

		<fullReview>I find it interesting that Timothy never really see's himself in any other light then one of Savior to the bears. The film was beautiful and full of finely crafted imagery. The filmmaker starts out as apologetic to Timothys cause and ends up brutal and truthful as to Timothy's true psyche. I find it also interesting that TImothy is turned away at the airport over a non-valid ticket and that precipitates his return back to the island. He admits later that the season is over, and that his beloved bears that he is familiar with are all in hibernation. Timothys presence was tolerated by the bears and this only led to a greater delusion that He was friend and protector of the bears. (Isn't is odd how the coroner describes the end?- Ann was fixing breakfast, and she is heard beating the bear who is mauling Timotahy with a frying pan. timothy is screaming to her "Run" as fast as you can!) Funny isn't it how the camera is running, but the cap is on? Ann has stated her desire to leave Timothy after this last trip, but her sentimentality cost her her life. IN conclusion, a sad, tragic, tale of insanity, delusion, foolishness on the highest order. What mockery that now on the Grizzly People home page are instructions on how to treat bears! Rules that Timothy broke with great regularity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What this film shows is how a man's obsession can destroy the thing he loves. By the end of the film I found myself thinking what a selfish little boy Timothy Treadwell seems to have been. His recordings show that it was him who was central subject and not the bears. He teated the bears with what he called love, while in truth had no respect for them whatsoever. If he had, he would have kept his distance and observed only, without interaction. Instead Teeadwell's behavior has endangered the bears. Those he was close to, now have less fear of humans than they should. The stranger bear is dead. His crime was that of being hungry and eating a human who did not have the sense to stay out of reach. Treadwell must have known that if he was eaten by a bear, that bear would be hunted down and butchered if for no other reason than to reclaim the human remains in its stomach.What is most tragic is that Treadwell's actions also led to the death of the woman who was his companion. No more needs to be said about that I suppose.By the conclusion of the movie I found myself amazed that his so called friends and loved ones so quickly romanticized the his utterly pointless death. Please save us all from such "friends".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has the attraction of a train wreck. It is at the same time fascinating, but gruesome because you know where it is leading &amp; you can see it coming a mile off even if you didn't already know how it would end up.Timothy Treadwell most definitely ran away from society &amp; people, living in his own private fantasy that the bears were somehow his friends &amp; that he was protecting them. For a start the bears were not his friends, they were just not hungry &amp; tolerated him as unthreatening. Basically since he wasn't chasing females &amp; every bear had a full stomach he wasn't worth wasting energy upon. Second, I did not see anything he did that actually protected any bear.For sure he filmed some fascinating behaviour, no doubt to be picked over &amp; studied by zoologists for a very long time. From the movie sequences &amp; the stills he took too it is plainly obvious that he was talented with a camera of any sort. In difficult circumstances he often achieved stunning photographic results. You can also admire his ability to survive in the wilds, although it is obvious that he had quite a well supported camp site &amp; he wasn't always alone, as he continually tries to claim throughout the film.However his repeated statements that he is "researching" ring hollow. Sure, he recorded some stunning material which is probably unmatched &amp; won't be repeated for a long time, but where are the results from the "research"? What outcomes were developed from all this filming. Bears are cute? Bears are our friends? Animals rule? Maybe there is more, but I doubt it as Werner Herzog seems quite diligent in running the whole story down &amp; if there had been some scientific aspect to Treadwell's expeditions I'm sure we would have heard it.Treadwell's sanity also has to be questioned. Clearly he was either outright delusional or deeply lost in his own fantasy. I am reminded of a friend of mine who once claimed he knew what he was doing climbing mountains, as he had never been avalanched or fallen into a crevasse. Then one day he was shown exactly how wrong he was by a real expert. It wasn't a case of knowing where the crevasses &amp; slide risks were, it was merely a case of having been lucky for so long that you think you know what you're doing &amp; that you are safe.... so you keep doing it, making the same mistakes &amp; being lucky. It is a dangerous mind set because by the time you find out you're dead wrong it is too late. The same goes here, only a crevasse won't hunt you, an avalanche won't change course &amp; follow you. A bear will.What was Treadwell running away from? We hear about his drink &amp; drug problem &amp; also some odd rants about being straight, not gay. This latter piece has an uneasy feel to it, that there is something there that he is bringing out, yet keeping veiled &amp; then ultimately rammed shut again. It is the case that he was not merely confused about his sexuality, but deeply tortured by it? Was he gay or bisexual &amp; repressed his feelings? Maybe the drink &amp; the drugs was one was one way he dealt with this dilemma, later replacing his chemical addiction with the life he lived among the bears. We can surmise, but it is obvious he was messed up about something &amp; replaced one dangerous lifestyle with another.There is someone who claimed that he "Got what he deserved". Like most I think this is wrong. But I do think he got what was coming to him. Like a kid that runs across the road in a game of chicken, if you keep doing it &amp; getting away with it for long enough you might end up thinking you're indestructible, that you know what you're doing. But in reality so far you've simply been lucky, just like my climbing friend with his avalanches &amp; crevasses.Treadwell should have been warned when he saw the remains of a bear cub killed by a male. There is nothing noble about them, there is no friendship or partnership, not even to the next generation, to offspring that may even be your own progeny. There is simply survival, expediency &amp; the next meal. When one bear regarded Treadwell as that next meal that was the end of the story &amp; Treadwell go what everyone else could have told him would eventually happen.I also do not share the opinion that he had no death wish, a notion expressed in the film. I think he was self destructive &amp; knew deep down that he was sooner or later going to die in one way or another. That he died in the Bear Maze is, I am sure, what he wanted all along. I am also sure he believed it would be something romantic &amp; that his bear friends would weep over his body. But in the end reality caught up with him &amp; his death was brutal &amp; nasty.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is fascinating. Like watching a train wreck. Despite the interviews with his friends who believe to the contrary, I'm quite convinced Treadwell was absolutely nuts.Watching him talk to and interact with the grizzly bears is like watching a child playing with dolls and stuffed animals. He talks about "the dangers" of what he does, and how anyone else who might come to live among the bears would be killed without question, but it's obvious that he sees no danger at all for himself. He refuses to recognize it, even when the signs are right in front of him that this world of bears is not as idyllic as he wants to believe. He sees himself as totally above reproach--not just a friend to the bears, but almost a god to them.That initial mentality is compounded by the fact that, for months at a time, his only confidant was a camera. And so, with nothing to do but talk to himself, without any kind of response or feedback, his thought process is disjointed, repetitive, and rambling. Often funny, but no less disturbing for that. In fact, perhaps more so, in a whistling-in-the-dark sort of way.Perhaps just as fascinating in its own way is the glimpse we get of director Werner Herzog. He makes it clear that the film is his own perspective on Treadwell and his life and work. He often editorializes, inserting his own opinions on what happened and why. Being a fan of Herzog's earlier work (particularly Aguirre: Wrath of God, another portrait of a madman outside of civilization), it was quite a treat for me to meet the man behind the camera... as much as it was to meet the man in front of it. And not nearly as disturbing, either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grizzly Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Grizzly Man played on Discovery last night from 10pm to 1am. I was only able to watch half of it because of the hour. However, this Doc stuck with me all night though... and, still on my mind today. The photography is awesome bringing you, the viewer, closer to these bears than perhaps you even want. I watched many parts of it through my hands (something I do when I'm frightened).I've always been frightened of bears as they sometimes wander our property in British Columbia. I love animals, but these huge carnivores are not tame and I believe the more people venture into their habitat the closer these bears are to extinction. Keeping people away from Grizzlies is paramount. Timothy tried his way... but, what can only one man do? An eyeful of a film and most educational to say the least.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An objective yet compassionate and ultimately brilliant piece from documentarian Werner Herzog</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is no spoiler that in his 13th summer with the grizzly bears, Timothy Treadwell and his girlfriend Amie Huguenard were violently killed by the same grizzly bears Treadwell had befriended and studied since 2000. While "Grizzly Man" is at face value the story of Treadwell's expeditions with the grizzlies of Alaska, Werner Herzog wastes no time in dispelling the notion that he means to tell a story. The viewer learns immediately of the circumstances of Treadwell and Huguenard's deaths so we may focus on the nature of Treadwell himself and why he chose such an arguably insane expedition. The documentary is a compilation of interviews with friends, family, and other associates of Treadwell's along with selected sequences from Treadwell's own footage taken while he lived among the grizzlies.The documentary begins objectively with the basics of what Treadwell did in Alaska. Treadwell states his intention to live with the grizzlies as an equal and how he would accomplish his task. The truly amazing aspect of this documentary is how objectively it deals with the subject of Treadwell himself. Herzog includes interviews with friends who admired his work and interviews with skeptics who thought his expeditions were either morally wrong or simply lacked common sense. The final segment includes sequences of footage that Treadwell shot. These reveal probably more than Treadwell would have revealed about himself and his feelings about society and the grizzlies. Such possible disrespect toward Treadwell must be forgiven of Herzog (in an artistic sense, at least) since his task is not to exalt Treadwell but to examine him.The film seeks not to moralize any of Treadwell's decisions or actions. Herzog refrains from contradicting or censoring any of his subjects' assertions or opinions, although he does occasionally mention that he disagrees with Treadwell himself. Herzog remains off camera, though narrating, throughout almost the entire film. His camera also lingers a bit longer on his subjects than is usual in a documentary. Even when they are clearly done speaking, the camera remains rolling, capturing their unconscious gestures that reveal enough to remind the viewer to be objective. The result is that the viewer is constantly aware that he is watching a film and to be aware of subjectivity. Objectivity again comes into question in Herzog's choice of segments from Treadwell's own material. Should the viewer question the partiality of Herzog's choices? Probably not, since Herzog chooses enough segments that run the gamut of Treadwell's nature.While the interviewees' opinions range from praise to criticism, the consensus is that Treadwell's ultimate, if unconscious goal, was to become a grizzly as much as he possibly could. While Herzog presents the contrasting views of whether Treadwell was indeed helping the bears or harming them and of whether his expedition was scientifically moral or totally unfounded, he avoids philosophical discussions for exploring the objective nature of Treadwell's desire to become a bear. The structure of the film reveals that Treadwell slowly detached himself from society and immersed himself entirely in bear society. The film avoids any footage of Treadwell during the winter months of hibernation, subtly blurring his nature with that of bears. Finally Treadwell died living as a bear. Having purposefully violated numerous park rules in his attempt to live with the bears, the film prevents us from judging the occurrence as anything but an act of nature. Herzog makes no attempt to discover why he was killed; Herzog is satisfied with the answer that Treadwell was killed just as all animals, including bears, are killed. If it was Treadwell's desire to become a grizzly bear, then the film posits that his death was fitting and, while tragic, probably what Treadwell would have wanted.Mimicking the duality of Treadwell's personality, the film praises and criticizes Treadwell equally. It is amazing and tragic, but Herzog composes his film in such a way that we cannot be anything but satisfied that Treadwell succeeded in his goals. "Grizzly Man" is a detached and objective, yet ultimately compassionate film. To achieve such a combination in a documentary is a rare feat and a credit to Herzog's continuing collection of masterpieces.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most fascinating and powerful documentaries of recent years.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Grizzly Man deals with Grizzly Bears, and beautiful Alaskan scenery, but more than anything it's a human story. It's about two different worlds colliding, and how that collision amounts to one man's obsession and tragedy.Timothy Treadwell finds passion in the Grizzlies of Alaska to the point of spending time up close to them, without weapons, and living in their habitat for months at a time. He really isn't crazy about the human world, and feels lost in it, but with Grizzlies he's happy, and he's determined to strike down human-animal boundaries unlike perhaps anyone in the county's history. Eventually he and his girlfriend succumb to death by one of those beasts he had come to love so much. Narrator and director Wermer Herzog does a masterful job exploring Treadwell's life both inside and outside this passion, though basically all the footage we see of Treadwell is among the over 100 hours of footage he shot during his last five summers with the bears. Some of that footage is more astounding than anything one could see on Animal Planet. He interviews a number of people congruent to Treadwell's missions and life, and no interview seems wasted. It's one of those rare documentaries I think that just about every interview subject is interesting, partly due to Herzog's allowing the subject to speak while asking few questions.More than anything this movie is made stunning by the waning down the 100 hours plus of footage to about an hour or so we see in the movie. There are scenes of beauty, scenes that astound, and scenes that disturb, but the film never feels jagged and is always entertaining. Treadwell is one heck of a fascinating subject. He loves the bears, but owns to the fact that he could possibly die from one. He gives the bears names and recognizes them years later. According to a friend he does drugs, but according to himself the bears cured him of alcoholism. That's just a taste of what makes this character so compelling to watch, and it often seems eerie watching the guy talking about bears, in their habit, as we know his eventual fate is death by one. Herzog gives both a compassionate and harsh approach. Different people will watch this and come out with different opinions of Treadwell. The narrator's final conclusion is something he builds to and I think supports quite well. I have minor quibbles: some information is repeated multiple times when it really doesn't have to be, and it would have been nice to learn more about a younger Treadwell and his path to Grizzly-obsession. Those are very minor flaws in what is a film with one astounding scene after another.</fullReview>

He takes Timothy Treadwell's raw footage and assembles it into a poetic take on the life of an inspired (somewhat mad) man.The images captured by Treadwell alone are awe inspiring. He plays with foxes in the wild, and each time a great grizzly bear sniffs his finger it is a truly amazing sight to behold. Herzog chronicles Treadwell's journey of solitude and how he sought to protect the bears from poachers and society at large and how increasingly he was putting himself in grave danger.A great nature film and study of a man who wished to become one with nature and in doing so was engulfed by it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You could have replaced Treadwell with any other completely self absorbed, completely delusional, self-destructive behavior individual without even noticing the difference and maybe you could have spared a life, his girlfriend's.Unfortunately it was too late when, in her own words, she realized he was set on the path of self-destruction. Ironically, the same self-destruction he had feared would come from alcoholism was instead borough from his new addiction. Oh well, if you have to die doing something..."Treadwell love of animals and bears" is quoted. Please! he just replaced the booze with another addiction, the bears. What love?...child-talk to a grizzly bear or a fox is no indication of love.On the other hand, the editing, the music and the pure genius of Herzog would have achieved such mastery, despite of Treadwell. We can be eternally grateful to Treadwell for the pristine footage he left behind but his presence in his own tapes was superfluous after the first 5 min.I am blown away by Herzog's craftsmanship, again.D</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rare look into the life of a very unique man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes a film is released that is so realistic that you have to constantly remind yourself that it is just a motion picture. "Grizzly Man" is the exact opposite of that. It is a documentary, but in the world we live in, it is difficult to believe that there existed a man like Timothy Treadwell. Treadwell was a grizzly bear activist who took his passion for bears to a level like no one else. For 2-4 months at a time, Treadwell would camp in Alaska and live amongst the bears completely unarmed, watching them and interacting with them, somehow co-existing with some of the most dangerous animals in the world. In October of 2003 Treadwell and his girlfriend Amie were killed and eaten by a bear. Director Werner Herzog used Treadwell's personal footage as well as interviews with his friends and family to make the documentary.Treadwell claims over and over throughout the film that he is the "only one protecting these bears", and he criticizes wildlife officials for not doing their job. However, it is never made clear how Treadwell is actually protecting the bears, or that they even need protecting, as they are in the middle of a wildlife preserve, and we never actually see any use that the bears have for Treadwell. It is clear though that Treadwell finds true joy in what he does, and believes very strongly in it. Often, he is very critical of civilization, and seems more content roaming through the woods with a fox he has befriended than he would with a human being.The great thing about Herzog's presentation of Treadwell is that he does not craft the film in a way that we are told what to think about him. Throughout the film, we are presented a number of viewpoints on Treadwell, from great admiration to "he got what he deserved", and even Herzog offers his own personal thoughts at times. From what I have seen, everyone comes out of this film with their own views on Treadwell, and I have read some heated discussions online regarding the true merits of Treadwell's work.As for myself, I am not really sure what to think of Treadwell. I strongly suspect that his adventures in the wilderness did nothing for the grizzly bears, but I still cannot help but admire him. It is rare to see someone spending their life doing what they love, and Treadwell made it explicitly clear that he was willing to die with the bears. With Herzog cutting the film, we get perhaps a very different perspective than if Treadwell were editing his own documentary. Herzog leaves uncut pieces of footage in; sometimes we see Treadwell do multiple takes of a "scene", and it is as if we are looking into his secret diary at times as he speaks to the camera. While on the surface it is a documentary about a man and grizzly bears, the film is really somewhat of a character study. We see Treadwell's emotional highs, such as the joy he displays when interacting with the bears, and the lows, such as when he suddenly goes into a complete fit of rage directed at the national park service."Grizzly Man" is a very unique film about a very unique individual, and I applaud Werner Herzog's ability to present the film without bias, as this film could very easily have been a piece hailing Timothy Treadwell as an American hero, or one that portrayed him as a lunatic. The pacing was a bit odd, and I do have to question Herzog's commentary on Treadwell at times during the film (to my knowledge he never even met Treadwell, so do we really care what he thinks?); it seemed a little ego-centric. Those were very minor concerns, though, and I was very impressed overall by the film. As we all know, a certain nature documentary has been holding its ground at the box office for months now, and by no means is that certain documentary a bad film, but my recommendation would be to pass up the cute and cuddly birds, and go see how Timothy Treadwell lived and died in a place where few could survive unarmed.3.5 stars (out of 4)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grizzly Man shows Herzog's Still Got it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Grizzly Man re-establishes Werner Herzog as one of the most provocative directors to emerge from the New German Cinema movement of the 1970's. While other filmmakers his age are losing their edge, Herzog's passion for madness and nature finds a foothold in this compelling and tragic story. He is obviously fascinated with Treadwell, the ill-fated title character, despite disagreeing with his foolish grandiosity. Herzog knows what it is like to tempt fate and there is no better director to handle this material than he.In Aguirre, The Wrath of God, he took a skeleton crew of filmmakers deep in to the jungle on a raft made of logs. In Fitzcarraldo, Herzog tried to haul a riverboat over an Amazon mountain. Herzog in public has declared that one must respect nature and not try and do as Treadwell had done. For many, the reasons would be obvious. But Herzog disagreed with Treadwell's romanticized notions about bears being "lovable" creatures. Herzog saw them only as "heartless murderers."No doubt the director is fascinated with his material, and perhaps even wants to honor Treadwell's memory by giving him the spotlight he so desperately wanted while he was alive. While that may have eluded Treadwell in his life, in death, thanks to Herzog, he has achieved immortality.Philip Brubaker philip@philipbrubaker.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Man's Sublimation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One lonely "man", subliminally projecting, mad, artistically yearning ... is what this movie was about. The acclaimed arty filmmaker Verner Herzog discovered a man named Timothy Treadwell who committed suicide by bear. Herzog looked at the footage Treadwell shot of himself alone with Alaskan brown bears and saw in Treadwell's videography this mad genius artiste who documented his long struggle to fulfill his death wish to die by ferocious animal. Right in the opening scene, Treadwell reveals his raw psyche, he rants and raves about his life-or-death macho mastery over grizzlies, all the while his ridiculously gentle, repressed twink persona shines through brightly. The psycho-analysis is too obvious to ignore and one scene after another reveals layers of Treadwell trying to come to grips with his demons and each time failing miserably and projecting his repressed self-hate on others(various governmental agencies, backwoodsmen, wildlife professionals, etc.). The crux of this self-hate is best revealed in an amazing scene in which Treadwell is walking towards his bear buddies and filming himself from a hand-held, close-up profile shot. He goes into one of his long expositions, but this time it is not the usual diatribe but rather a very personal confession about his sexual-romantic frustrations. He laments about why women don't sexually like him and I personally could imagine hearing the psychiatrist-in-the-sky(with Herzog's voice)saying "Are you certain that it is the women who lack the sexual attraction?" Treadwell shows great pathos and unconscious artistic feel in his relation with bears and I found the the strongest theme of the movie Treadwell's sad attempt to be a "man" when every fiber of his being is obviously exactly the opposite.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grizzly Man explores the life of bear activist Timothy Treadwell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Grizzly Man is a superb film which raises many more questions than it answers. How and when did Treadwell begin to develop his passion for grizzlies? It's a long way from his childhood stuffed bear and pet squirrel to his ultimate calling to defend grizzlies. How did he go from Hollywood actor wannabe to nature filmmaker? If he didn't charge for his visits to school children how did he support himself and his vision? The implication is he is supported by the Grizzly People foundation but that is never clarified. Perhaps these unanswered questions make the film more compelling because they make the viewer think harder. The shots of the Alaskan wilderness were breathtaking. The comments by those who knew Treadwell are insightful and revealing. Together with copious video he shot of himself and the bears, these comments create a portrait of Treadwell that feels authentic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grizzly Man with a Grizzly Plan Meets a Grizzly End</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From 1990-2003, Timothy Treadwell spent his life with grizzly bears, both physically and spiritually. As an activist, Treadwell founded Grizzly People, an organization concerning itself with the welfare of the brooding animals. Following the bears through the Canadian outback each summer, Treadwell believed that he had learned to think like a bear, to communicate like a bear, and truly wished to become a bear. In the last five of years of his life, Werner Herzog gifted him a video camera, so that he could properly document his findings. After Treadwell's death in 2003, Herzog reconstructed the tapes of those summers, crafting a wonderful character study of the troubled man. Treadwell had hoped that the footage would be used to show the problems that grizzly bears face--namely human encroachment, starvation, and poaching. Instead, Herzog shows us the inner workings of a conflicted man sitting outside the circle of human civilization.The self-destruction and anger that accompanies tortured souls has been caricatured countless times in literature and film. To see it in documentary form--as it is presented in Grizzly Man--gives one the most powerful and accurate representation of the life and mind of a true eccentric. Treadwell is that representation, from the first frame to last. Through his commentary on the bears and his constant mugging for the camera, Timothy fancies himself the savior of the grizzlies, speaking often of his 'love' for them. But Herzog forces the audience to question if Treadwell's motives are truly altruistic. As the protagonist rants soliloquies to the camera about the "f----ing f---s who f---ing f--- the f---ing people who try to save these f---s" (paraphrasing), we begin to see more clearly the mental state of our unbalanced friend.Treadwell's strange life and even stranger personality is certainly worthy of the 100 minutes of film devoted to him. Together, the montage of gorgeous Alaska scenery and cinema bearité makes for an easy sit, as far as documentaries are concerned. And though Herzog interjects an opinion or two about nature's cruelty, he functions well in his role as story teller. Unlike Michael Moore, who guides the moral approach to the film from his own perspective, Herzog allows the audience to decide for itself if Timothy's work is indeed good or bad. Herzog seems to weigh in by letting Timothy's on-screen insanity shine for itself. As is true with grizzlies, though, what you think will not influence the outcome of Treadwell's decision. Like a bear locked in the heat of battle, Timothy Treadwell lived and died a Grizzly Man.*********Henceforth begin the spoilers (only read if you have seen the movie or don't mind spoiling it for yourself).********************* In all of his attempts to help the grizzlies, Treadwell shows us one form of activism that has become all too prevalent in recent years: egoism. Rather than focusing his efforts on actually helping the animals (by perhaps raising funds to support better surveillance of the bears), he seems more at home standing next to them with a camera. And when, in one incident, the bears are agitated by private tour-guides, Timothy finds his rightful place hiding in the bushes and videotaping the event.After several takes in the wild thickets of Alaska wherein Timothy repeats that he is indeed alone among the bears, Herzog shares with us the truth of Timothy Treadwell. He has been living together with his girlfriend Aime. Additionally, he receives help from his friends in the form of rations. And then there is the case of his multiple takes. Treadwell seems compelled to repeat his message, over and over, until he gets it perfect. After his death, Herzog must have had countless hours of irritation with Tim's self-congratulating speeches. But, then, Herzog also had the power to stop Treadwell from being martyred by a ridiculous bear-activism group.And it is Herzog who takes the limelight away, using his power as filmmaker to keep buried the sounds of Timothy's death. On location, with camera in tow, Timothy and Amie were savagely killed and eaten by a large animal (I won't say what kind of animal, but careful readers should be able to deduce from the clues given above). It is Herzog's choice not to let us hear the grizzly (hah!) incident. Instead, we must assume from the reactions of a coroner, as well as Herzog himself, that what occurred was truly horrific.On IMDb message boards, there has been discussion regarding hearing the tapes. The general consensus is that hearing the tapes would show how truly stupid Treadwell's actions were. I do not agree that we need to hear the screams of two people being eaten to come to the conclusion that what they were doing was dumb.One only needs to hear the comments of the Aleut at the Grizzly Bear Museum on Kodiak Island. Having lived side-by-side with the bears for centuries, the Aleuts have a very sensible philosophy towards the furry ones. Stay away from them, and keep them away from you. Because Timothy did not follow this simple rule, the Aleuts consider his actions to be disrespectful. While it might be difficult to interpret what the bears think of his time among them, it is certain that he was acting without proper skills or training.And then he died, not surprisingly, at the hands of a bear.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great movie if you have been to Alaska or are thinking about going. Footage is really from the Alaska bush where Tim did his "studies". Having been to Katami myself, I truly do not understand how he actually survived for 13 summers around these huge carnivores. The films he has of the bears in their natural environment is just fabulous. The bears and the scenery is beautiful, and a real treat if you have never had the chance to visit such a wonderful place. I thought the documentary style of the movie would be boring, but actually made it very interesting, always making you wonder what else Tim was going to do. Tim pushed the limit, and eventually went over it. I wonder if he actually harmed the bears, and other wildlife more by his "saving" of them? The Grizzlies should be left wild, and never-ever feel relaxed around humans, for their sake and ours. Definitely a great movie to see, but some part of me wishes that we could have heard just a little bit of his last encounter with his beloved bears.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When the news of this guy getting killed made the news, I didn't realize he was a complete idiot! And Werner Herzog tells his goofy, sad story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A decade ago, the news reported that some guy who loved to film Grizzly bears was eaten by the creatures. This didn't surprise me but I thought it was an awfully sad story. Little did I know that the guy who was killed (along with a companion) was a complete idiot--and his death shouldn't have come as a surprise to anyone, much like the death of the Crocodile Hunter. You don't take unnecessary and insane risks around extremely dangerous animals--and they really don't have too many creatures on Earth that are as dangerous and mean as these animals! Yet, Timothy Treadwell reveled in getting extremely close and even touching wild bears--and videotaping his exploits. Well, he got his wish...one of the bears ending up eating him and his partner and it was actually recorded by his cameras. Fortunately, filmmaker Werner Herzog did NOT reveal this footage but tries to reconstruct what occurred and investigate this strange man and those who knew him. How did he morph from a seemingly normal kid to an alcoholic to a nature lover? And, did he really end up helping the bears...and did they even need helping?This is a fascinating documentary and that doesn't surprise me, as Herzog's best work (despite fame for his feature films) are his documentaries. He takes a simple story and breathes life into it and investigates far deeper than you might find with other documentarians. I think some of this is because although Herzog is troubled by some aspects of Treadwell and criticizes Treadwell, he also seems to feel a certain respect and admiration for him as well---particularly Treadwell's very exacting and personal style of making films.While some might find the film overly long (it features LOTS of video of Treadwell talking on and on and on), I appreciate that it DOES give so much. It helps the viewer to construct an interesting portrait of the guy--a person who seems to be a combination of a narcissist and with an addictive personality and a death wish as well as having a tenuous grasp on reality. This reality distortion is more and more pronounced as the film progresses. He seems to think he is somehow THE man to protect the species and no one else can--though the bears in the film apparently were NOT at risk and didn't need protecting. He also is so into being around the bears that he seems to lose perspective in other ways--such as practically wetting himself in excitement when he finds fresh bear poo and plays with it! Truly a bizarre man--and the film does a great job of putting this across to the viewer. Overall, a strangely compelling and strange film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Utterly straight-faced documentary about a new-ager bothering wild grizzlies until he's justifiably eaten by one.Grizzly Man is like Spinal Tap for the David Attenborough generation. No cliché goes unturned to try to convince us that Tim Treadwell was a misunderstood spiritual genius at one with nature, instead of an idiot with a god complex who finally ran out of luck.There is some great footage, of course, but the attempt to sanctify Treadwell is transparent and hopelessly misguided.No matter. The whole thing is narrated with fabulous Teutonic gloom by the director.My sister and I laughed until we cried.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grizzly Man: The Mysterious Timothy Treadwell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was glued to the screen when we first watched Grizzly Man as I had never seen, nor heard of, a man walking and living among these magnificent beast! This is a documentary by both Werner Herzog and footage/Audio from/of Timothy Treadwell. Mr. Herzog clearly displays a mix of emotions from curious, shocked, respectful and the mystery about Timothy Treadwell that he was so eager to grasp, yet we will all never fully understand. Herzog masterfully incorporates 13 summers of filming Timothy did in The Great Bear Maze Of Alaska with interviews of Timothy's family and old friends, the Game Commission who was constantly at war with Treadwell and their remarks about Treadwell, are in a sense vengeful E.G. Getting the last word in and (I told you so.) Many people on the Internet poke fun at this man, but I invite those people to do as Timothy did,not only endure the extreme hardships of living in the wild but stand your ground against a full grown Male Grizzly that slams you with his head. Was it bravery, courage, stupidity? I don't think it was none. I believe it was having a knowledge of the Grizzly and knowing that if you show fear or run it is a natural response to attack or pursue. So perhaps Bravery does fit in there, and in retrospect I believe you will agree, when the film finishes up on the detailed events on the day of his death and that of his Girlfriend Amie Huguenard whom also showed courage beyond measure on that devastating morning. He carried no gun, not even mace, just his wits, a camera, and the knowledge that each encounter may be his last. In the end nothing could save him. As introduced in the beginning of the film, Timothy and his girlfriend are both killed in their thirteenth summer with the bears. A Rogue attacked them as they slept. You will see some fantastic bear footage like two male grizzlies in a fight for the alpha prestige. A Grizzly Adams character that becomes one with the animals around his camp and its all very real. The movie captures the spirit of a troubled man that sought a sense of belonging and self-worth by studying bears like no other man has ever done before. I have since watched it 5 times and every-time I do I love it more. Its a movie you will not regret watching. On a side note, It does include some crude language and a morbid talking coroner. I rate this Documentary a well deserved 10... -Dale Rhode</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't bother renting this title if you're looking for a nature documentary. Although there is some stunning footage of the Alaskan wilderness, this is not a film about nature, or bears, or conservation.This is the study of a man in crisis. Amongst humans, Timothy Treadwell is a sad case: alone, poor, a junkie, an alcoholic, with no future. So he went to find a life amongst the bears of Kodiak island, and for 13 years he thought he had found it. His videos show him not only pursuing intense (but completely one-sided) relationships with the bears, but imagining himself as a lone warrior, protecting his friends from the evil humans.We know from the start that this is a fantasy: Treadwell does nothing to help the bears, who feel no affection for him. Worse still we know that he has been killed by one of the bears. All of this is documented in the 100 hours of footage shot superbly by Treadwell himself in the hours before his death.As the film delves into the mind of this poor, deluded soul, we also begin to gain an insight into the mind of the director, the legendary Werner Herzog. Herzog clearly identifies deeply with Treadwell, with both men having risked their lives and sanity in their obsession with making movies in inhospitable environments. The only difference between the men, he admits, is that where Treadwell saw harmony in nature, Herzog sees only indifference and cruelty.In the end, we're left looking at ourselves, wondering how our human ideals fit with the physical world we occupy, and if there can ever be any reconciliation between the two.Herzog is one of the greatest living artists in cinema, and he has successfully turned this unique footage into a superb movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not all I had hoped for but still a well-developed and interesting look at Treadwell beyond the tabloid headlines</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During his fifteen years living on an Alaskan nature reserve among grizzly bears, Timothy Treadwell became a minor celebrity as he relentlessly pursued his own mission to protect the bears and educate others about the creatures. He even took to filming his trips with the aim of putting together educational films showing the creatures and himself in the wild. However in October 2003 Treadwell and his girlfriend Amie Huguenard were found dead by a pilot coming to collect them before the winter. Using Treadwell's footage and his own interviews and thoughts, Werner Herzog looks at the man who, depending on your viewpoint, was na?ve, childish, passionate, sacrificial or just obsessed.Having seen several of his films that look at the nature of human obsession, I was looking forward to Herzog's look at Treadwell simply because there is much more beyond the tabloid headlines to this story. On the surface of things it is easy to see the naivety of Treadwell's "mission", the stats show that the bears do not need protecting within the national park and, if they do, then it is not the sort of protection that Treadwell seemed capable of giving them. Although a lazy man would fixate on the sentimental "Disney-fied" view of nature and go no further than that, the film does delve deeper into Treadwell's past to look at possible formative moments and the path that led him to live in the wild and believe he was protecting these wild animals. As is often the case with Herzog, he sits back and lets the material do most of the talking with limited opinion from himself. Of course he does have some comment and, as usual, he does have a bleak view of the world which sharply contrasts with Treadwell's tireless optimism; I guess if you are closer to the latter than the former then you may find Herzog a bit obtrusive.He is respectful enough to never demean the tragedy of the situation regardless of why Treadwell was in the wild. In this world of showing everything on television for mass consumption, Herzog is to be commended for not seeking to play the dead tape as part of his film. However he does use the coroner (a natural in front of the camera) to really good effect to provide some non-gory detail of the deaths so that we are never allowed to forget that two people died here. Treadwell himself is quite annoying with his whiny, sing-song voice and saccharine naming of the bears but the film minimises footage that only does this and mixes it up with stuff that brings out his anger and paranoia as well as his good intentions. It won't be enough to grip all audiences because for long periods the film will often leave Treadwell's footage playing and personally I found it hard to like or be interesting in the na?ve ecologist-wannabe that I saw in front of me.Overall though this is an interesting if unspectacular documentary that builds an interesting picture of a troubled man beyond the tabloid headlines about the protector becoming prey. It wasn't all I was hoping for and is perhaps a bit too slow and respectful but it is still interesting and well developed by Herzog.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even handed, insightful and gripping film-making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not a great watcher of documentaries. Filmmakers seem to know this, and the documentaries they produce tend to be sensational, one-sided, fulfilling a personal agenda that I must then agree or disagree with or frankly, just downright boring. Which is why Grizzly Man, an astonishing film about the astonishingly strange Timothy Treadwell (who had a suicidal devotion to grizzly bears), startled me with its integrity and difficult-to-define attraction.Treadwell was an amateur grizzly bear expert and wildlife preservationist. Having failed as an actor and worked in a restaurant he discovered his calling. Treadwell kept video diaries of his work which show not only remarkable footage of these little-observed creatures, but also his wayward character, obsessively trying to get the best presentations. Treadwell has an air of New Age madness about him, is tireless in his proselytising for the cause of grizzlies when not encamped with them, and yet his craziness is tempered with sincerity. When the bears are threatened by a shortage of rain (and consequent lack of salmon), he first attempts to build a channel for the water. When this doesn't work, he tries an appeal to whatever gods might or might not exist, including Jehovah, Allah, Buddha and the 'Hindu floaty thing'. Humorously, and to the great relief no doubt of the bears, these earnest supplications are, strangely enough, followed by rain.Every so often, director and narrator Werner Herzog brings us down to earth with unaffected commentary. Treadwell devoted his life to making friends with bears and believed he had accomplished his mission. Herzog, on the other hand, disagrees, saying that of all Treadwell's footage that he has studied, or of the many reels of grizzly bear behaviour he has watched, not once has he seen anything that could have been regarded as a warm attitude from grizzlies to humans - nothing other than a bored disinterest with a source of last resort food. His observation is piercing and poignant in its accuracy.It would have been easy to sensationalise this story (Treadwell was eventually eaten by grizzlies), make fun of a man whose rationality seems frequently to be in question, or pit various factions against each other. Herzog did none of these. He co-produced the movie with someone who was close to Treadwell, expressing a sensitivity in spite of being calmly critical of the man, and manages to keep us entranced from one scene to the next without playing trump cards such as the screams of Treadwell recorded on his last tape.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Movie Was Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was really good and I thought it was worth it to watch. It came on the discovery channel one day and I thought it was something good to watch. Timothy was really emotional in the movie. The cool thing is that he was on TV and he almost got the role of the bartender on cheers. He was also on the dating game. But after he got done using drugs he went to Alaska in 1992 and stayed there until he was 47 and was killed by a bear. But I got to listen to the tape and it really freaked me out big time. All it was was Tim moaning and Amie screaming at him to play dead and fight back. And at one point you can hear Amie hitting the bear on the head with a frying pan and Timothy telling Amie to run and go save herself. That was the scariest thing that you can ever hear in your whole life. After all that was a great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Herzog Delivers Yet Again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an excellent film. Let's establish that right off the bat. Go see it. (I rated it a "10": anything less than an "8" is ridiculous.) It is beautifully photographed, both by Herzog and Treadwell, with a cast of real-life characters that are far more memorable than anything Hollywood writers have come up with recently. (E.g., the weirdly-demonstrative coroner, the 40-year-old Valley Girl, the helicopter pilot, and last, but certainly not least, Timothy Treadwell himself.) This film is utterly fascinating...a synopsis doesn't do it justice. It is tragic, comic, and tragicomic. It is a glimpse into a very disturbed man's soul, and it is set in one of the most beautiful places on Earth, the Alaskan peninsula. You will be amazed and dumbfounded by some scenes; you will be uplifted and depressed by others. Above all, you will be drawn into the film, never bored, always entertained. (That is, if you have a certain baseline IQ...I'm guessing 115 is on the mark. Anything below that, and Deuce Bigalow 2 would probably be more appropriate.) I guarantee one thing: you will never forget Timothy Treadwell, a man to whom the Alaskan Brown Bears gave life...and took it away..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Grizzly Man: this time a "message transcended the media"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In "The Grizzly Man", an amateurish medium was transcended by its naively, but heroically, acted out message to our time. Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, a Roman Catholic Jesuit scholar of the first half of the twentieth century, said in one's of his latter philosophical/theological books that some people are accidentally selected by history to play out, for us all, on the world stage, the latent, crucial conflicts of the culture. Timothy Treadwell was one of those people. He was not a professional actor or cinematographer, nor was he a zoologist or trained animal tamer. However, he was accustomed to learning to master the skills involved in physical challenges like surfing and diving. He was by no means a genius. He was an educated risk-taker with a capacity for sympathy, a love of bears, a sense of mission, and a passion to stem the tide of extinction of the formidable and awe-inspiring Kodiak bear. For thirteen arduous, solitary summers, stripped to the bone of the conveniences of modern civilization, Timothy Treadwell was the devoted student and friend of these giant, lethal creatures. His vision was to bring back to civilization an understanding and appreciation of this beleaguered, dwindling species. As best he could, he filmed himself fondly interacting with the bears, explaining how using wisdom could minimize their danger, and proclaiming their right to continue to exist without harassment or slaughter within their delimited habitat. During this saga, his winters were spent teaching schoolchildren and enchanting them by showing them his films about the bears. Eventually he attained international fame, for which he was ill prepared. He was exposed to dramatically opposite phenomena: the acclaim and interest of the media and civilization's insensitive encroachment and poachers' ruthless murder of bears. The one catapulted him into a kind of grandiose excitement and arrogance and the other plunged him into dark, anguished despair. This combination, toward the end, resulted in outbursts of outrage and indignation against civilization and its government. With marked contrast, there were simply, caring, ordinary people who lived in the village near his excursions and with whom much of his time in between summers was spent. He developed very close bonds with these villagers and they seemed to have a profound respect for both Timothy and his mission. They were also aware the risk he was taking for his mission due to the danger in which he put his life while living in the midst of the bears. No one was surprised at his gruesome end. With the pain that comes from having to lay to rest an heroic and revered friend, his friends ceremoniously cast his ashes upon the habitat of the bears whom he so dearly loved and for whom he gave his life. The beauty of the bears within their wild territory and the heroism of his mission for the bears' preservation with dignity is truly a message for our day that far transcended the amateurishness of his cinematography. It is a film to be remembered and replayed for generations, especially to our young.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From silly to tragic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most noticeable part about watching this movie, in a theater, wasn't the movie itself, but the small group 20-something kids sitting near the front. At the the beginning of the movie, they were cracking jokes at the rather silly character of Treadwell. By the end, though, they were silent. Somehow, Herzog managed to bring out, through editing and narration, the Human part of this story. So, the absurd becomes ironic. When Treadwell starts to go on a tirade, it was Herzog's narration that brought it in context -- it allowed me to bridge the gap: to recall my own frustration over my illusions. Beware: this film runs deep.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deeply Compassionate Study of Man's Inner Nature</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joseph Conrad wrote in his great novel "Heart of Darkness" that "The mind of man is capable of anything, because everything is in it, all the past as well as all the future." This implies that all of history is subjective. It only exists through our knowledge of it, through our perception of it. Werner Herzog's masterful new documentary "Grizzly Man" is a study in the ability of film to record memories and personal histories in such a way that only the mind ever could before. It shows how the cinema provides a certain immortality for those who have left us too early. It also proves that the "mind of man" is not capable of everything, that the human mind can be deluded by falsehoods, falsehoods which can give meaning to our lives.The great falsehood in bear-enthusiast Timothy Treadwell's view of the universe was that there existed no barrier between human civilization and Nature, other than that which humanity had erected through hunting and poaching. Werner Herzog's compassionate narration doesn't aim to judge Treadwell, but point out that the great foundation of his life, his enthusiasm for the wild, while the thing which gave him meaning, was also based on a misconception. Somehow Treadwell really believed that both animals and humans were "children of the universe," that they could love each other and spend a life of joyful, carefree play together. His ideals refused to accept that nature could be harsh, demanding the survival of the fittest. He tried to introduce love into an inherently chaotic environment, and nature took his life. There is no good, no evil in nature. It just exists. There is no harmony, there is only chaos.Grizzly Man is two films. The first consists of the rough footage shot by Treadwell during his 13 summers living with grizzly bears in the Alaskan wilderness. He shot hundreds of hours of footage, not only of the bears themselves, but also of long monologues that he would direct at some unspecified future viewer. He would reflect on his contempt for human civilization, his frustration with previous relationships, the apparent beauty to be found in the simplicity of the wild, and his anger at the government for not protecting his animals. The second film is that of Werner Herzog, who carefully selected key moments from Treadwell's footage and interpreted them with his own narration and in relation to documentary footage he shot himself of people talking about Tim. The most moving moment of the film occurs the only time we actually see Herzog. He is listening to an audio recording of Tim Treadwell's death at the hands of a grizzly bear in October 2003. His reaction conveys his horror, but understanding of the chaos of the universe, and his contentment in knowing that Tim met death the best way he ever could: at the paws of a grizzly bear. Herzog's compassion is not patronizing, and not overly sentimental. As he states frequently throughout the film, he tries to understand humanity from a filmmaker's perspective. Tim Treadwell ultimately preferred escape from the world of man, rather than trying to understand it, but he still did connect with his inner humanity through the use of his DV video camera. This video camera assumed a confessional significance, as Tim revealed his confused tormented heart to nothing more than the digital files of the camera and the foxes around him. Not only a comparison of the nature of man with the Wild, "Grizzly Man" is a testament to the confessional, healing power of the movie camera. Tim Treadwell has become one with nature, whose only lingering connection to humanity is his legacy on film, just as film was his last connection to humanity in life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Sadest and Most Moving Movies of the Year!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the opening cue of the movie you get the feeling that this movie is going to be moving. At first sight of Tredwell it says 1957-2003. Just seeing that is pretty sad. Throughout the beginning of the film you get a little insight of Tredwell's personality and friends. Most of the interviews are very interesting, especially the interview with the coroner. When he describes what is on the audio tape of Tredwell's death is heartbreaking. Seeing all the footage of Tredwell shows you how much he loved the bears. Near the end of the film, as footage of Tredwell is on the screen, at the bottom of the screen you see things like "Days before death", "Scene of death directly behind him" or "Hours before death". That alone is very very eerie. Looking at a persons last days and hours is strange. As strange or ironic is how much Tredwell talks about how "Bears could kill him any time". He repeated this throughout the movie. All in all this movie is Oscar material and a fantastic movie. I highly suggest this film to anyone and everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>fascinating and thoughtful real life tragedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Documentaries are not to me the most fascinating type of cinema. Oftentimes they can be boring and full of themselves. But when they are done well it's important to give credit where credit is due. Grizzly Man is one of those documentaries. It has not one false note. Werner Herzog does a masterful job of letting Timothy Treadwell, the unfortunate and misguided self appointed warrior for the wild bear, tell his story through the video he, himself, shot. Since we know the tragic consequence of his behavior, we watch with horror and wonderment as he rationalizes irrationally the justification of testing the boundaries between wild nature and man. We see a man who could not fit in except in the wilderness where he convinced himself the wild bear needed him as their protector. He exhibits a child-like enthusiasm giving bears pet names seemingly believing they somehow accepted him. His friends loved him for his eccentricities and he apparently attained some sort of cult status because of this behavior. All of this was a recipe for inevitable disaster. Herzog edits and narrates his film objectively allowing the viewer to see Treadwell as a well meaning, overly enthusiastic protagonist who was like a kid in Disneyland while at the same timea vulnerable, ill advised man placing himself and his partner needlessly in harm's way. You know a film is good when you find yourself thinking about it many hours after you have viewed it. Grizzly Man leaves the viewer with a lot to mull over. You won't easily forget this film or this misguided, well intentioned man.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Madness!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warner Herzog specializes in films about men going mad. In Aguirre, the Wrath of God, a man was trying to find the Lost City of Gold and wouldn't stop even though it became quite clear to everyone that it didn't exist. In Fitzcarraldo, a man is trying to haul a 340 ton steam ship across a strip of land in the Amazon. Even in the early planning stages of a task like that, you can picture madness rearing its ugly head. In "Grizzly Man", Herzog documents a man who spends 13 summers in Alaska with grizzly bears. The way the documentary is structured it appears that Timothy Treadwell is slowly moving towards madness. Don't forget though, he probably was always this crazy. It's just that Herzog has shown you his more "normal" days first and only in the last 30 minutes of the documentary do you see him exhibiting Kinski level behavior. (Cursing at God, the Parks Board, etc.) With that in mind, I wouldn't take a documentary at face value. We learned that from watching Michael Moore movies. However this storytelling technique is still valid because this manipulation provides us with some very good movies. It is thoroughly watchable to see Treadwell treat the bears like puppys. This man did not observe the distance that man and beast should observe and you wonder how one person can have so much hubris and stupidity. He was an environmentalist to the core. An environmentalist is someone who does not understand the predator prey relationship. An environmentalist coddles nature while a conservationist respects it. Treadwell's friends had great respect for him because they felt he did a lot for the bears by "trying" to protecting them. The conservationists in the film argue that the bears didn't need protecting since they were in a national park and that Treadwell was hurting them because they were getting more exposure to humans.Indeed there is a scene with poachers. Actually, they were not poachers, but tourists in a boat. They throw rocks at the bears. Out of the 13 summers Treadwell spent out there with a video camera "protecting" the bears, he managed to get a few minutes of footage of rocks being thrown. After showing a viscous fight between two grizzlies, I'm convinced that a 2 pound rock hitting a bear probably feels like a beer nut hitting Treadwell.The whole movie has an eerie quality to it because we are told at the beginning that a grizzly ate Treadwell and his girlfriend. This looming quality haunts every scene where he talks to the bears in a high-pitched voice that you might talk to a baby with. Treadwell is kind of a goofy likable guy and he seems to channel a little bit of the Crocodile Hunter. He reminds me of the blonde guy on "Queer Eye".One thing went through my mind though during the attack (they don't show it or let you listen to the audio). Treadwell's girlfriend was there, close enough to hit the bear with a frying pan. Also it is established that she didn't like being close to the bears and was scared of them. Treadwell makes it known that you do have to show a tough facade around them or they will attack you. Did Treadwell die because his girlfriend acted shy around him and the bear?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grisly Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has to be emphasized from the start: Treadwell was killed while visiting the Grizzly reserve at a time he never did before, by a bear he didn't know, who was apparently desperate for his own survival and starving. Prior to his death he managed to live with the bears a couple of months each year, mostly alone and for 13 long years, a task considered impossible by most people.But this extraordinary, unique, feat gets distorted by Herzog's manipulative and sensationalist documentary. Herzog is a consummate artist, he's sophisticated enough to mask his sensationalism: instead of playing Treadwell last recording for us, in which he can apparently be heard dying, Herzog films himself listening to it, bursts into (well rehearsed) tears, then cuts to a coroner who describes the death scene graphically and with suspect enthusiasm. A genuinely sublimated "Tabloid" style if there ever was one.Reality for Herzog seems hopelessly two-dimensional and über-Romantic; it's divided neatly into "Nature" and "Civilization", and persons have a "dark side" and a "good side" to them. Treadwell "crossed a boundary" that should never be crossed. As Treadwell obviously didn't share Herzog's views, he is judged as delusional and paranoid. His life become a manifesto to Herzog's beliefs; he even rudely interrupts Treadwell's speeches from time to time to correct his world-view to his own. Here's one documentary director who couldn't care less to sympathize with or listen to his own subject matter.After living with Grizzly bears and other animals for 13 long years, the director sums up Treadwell's error of judgment by zooming into a bear's eyes (arrogantly using Treadwell's own material to subvert everything he lived for and believed in) and commenting: "I see no love here, only a constant search for food," strangely, and absurdly, contradicting everything that he had shown us thus far.Obviously the real error of judgment is the one by Treadwell's family, allowing the director access to his materials. He seems intent on using them only to further his own delusional and paranoid agenda, with no respect whatsoever for the dead person upon whose corpse and legacy he concocts his ?uvre. I can think of no better description and no higher justice for this film than to adopt the director's vicious method and turn his own words against him: "I see no love here, only a constant search for food."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is not, surprisingly, really about grizzlies. This is a movie that attempts to pick apart the outcast.Unfortunately, it's main character is not an outcast because of something genuinely different in his nature, but because he simply (very simply) afraid of people.The actual mechanics of the film really disappoint. Werner Herzog's narration, while thoughtful, is slow and very, very accented. It takes the weight out of any reflection when one has to translate from a near-comical German fog. The film also dwells too much on Treadwell's inanities, letting him make a mockery of himself. Perhaps this is the point, but I personally found it grating and nearly unwatchable. More footage of Treadwell's 'work'would have been nice and maybe even meaningful. Also, and this is a point a lot of people don't understand, film shot while running or walking is not comprehensible and can even make people nauseous. It is not artistic, not when it is used extensively.The point of this movie is debatable, but leans towards vapidity (as many claim that Treadwell's work does as well). It takes too much to watch an insufferably narcissistic man and not gain much in return.But annoying movies give us all something to talk about, right?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The picture that Herzog painted of Treadwell was more a caricature than a character study. Knowing very little about Treadwell before seeing the movie, I can't say if the depiction was accurate or not. Treadwell was represented as a lost soul and an addictive personality, searching for salvation and finding it in his passion for grizzly bears. However, according to the film, passion quickly turned to obsession and Treadwell went beyond conservation to putting his own life, the life of his girlfriend and the well being of the bears he claimed to love so much in grave danger. He was accused of anthropomorphizing the wildlife to such an extent that he lost touch with reality Out of the 100 hours of footage to which Herzog had access, he chose to use film that depicted Treadwell as a kook at best and at worst someone who was narcissistic, egocentric, paranoid and deranged, bent on his own destruction. Is this the best Herzog could do? The film seemed very contrived and exploitative of Treadwell, his story and Grizzly People, the foundation for conservation that he left behind. The interviews seemed scripted and staged. The cinematography was spectacularly poor. Herzog was in what is probably one of the most wildly, naturally beautiful areas of North America and he did nothing to showcase it. The narrative was flat, in my opinion as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great story, poor execution.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Too bad that such an extraordinary director didn't want to spend more time researching such an extraordinary story. The complex, tragic, pathetic, infantile, almost "Michael Jackson-esquire" life of Timothy Treadwell (the "Grizzly Man") deserved much more commitment. Herzog himself admitted in a recent post-screening discussion that, in order to show it at Sundance, he made the documentary in very few days without even having the time to watch all the 100+ hours of Treadwell's original footage. Herzog doesn't even bother to contextualize Treadwell's bear obsession. He doesn't interview any prominent scientist and therefore we have no idea how valuable or damaging his expeditions in bear country really were. Poor execution also on the personal front of the story: Amie Huguenard, his girlfriend, who was afraid of bears and never the less followed him to his deadly Neverland and died with him, gets less exposure than his pet foxes. Then there are the debatable questions of Herzog wearing headphones and listening in camera to the audiotape of the last horrific moments of Treadwell and Huguenard's lives and the uneven choices of lenses for the interviews. Even with all these shortcomings, the documentary deserves to be seen because of Treadwell's absolutely fascinating candid footage. The pervasive feeling of impending doom a la "Blair Witch Project" also helps to make this documentary watchable. Just wait for the TV release on Discovery.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Haunting Story, Scary Statement Of Radical(s) Gone Amok</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very, very disturbing documentary about a sick individual, a man who re-named himself, "Timothy Treadwell: Kind Warrior. " The most alarming aspect of this biography may not be his lunacy but the huge of numbers of people out there who support a wacko like Treadwell. That's frightening.This was a very interesting film, but not one I would recommend particularly to my friends, at least those who are offended by the f-word. There are 50 cases of that in here so be forewarned. There are also a few short scenes that will visually disgust you. In other words, this is not an easy film to watch and "Grizzly Man" may sound like a nice Disney adventure but it is anything but family fare.The movie gets points for keeping one's attention and making us think about it, but a film on horrible car crashes could have the same shocking effect, so I wouldn't go overboard in praising this film just because it held our attention. Nonetheless, an intriguing film and one that should encourage intelligent debate, and for that, it's very good.I will play amateur psychiatrist here and write a few thoughts about the mental problems Treadway obviously had before and during his 13 summers in the Alaskan wilderness attempting to bond with grizzly bears and other wildlife, but there are enough good reviews here already that do just that so I'll try not to go overboard. Four excellent reviews are right near the beginning of the comments, those by "chosunkid," "fvww," "jgriffin689" and "davendes" all hit hit the nail on the head and I highly recommend reading them. I don't know if I've ever come across a film with so many intelligent reviews of it as I see here, at least in the first several pages.Veteran German filmmaker Werner Herzog narrated and put together this film, from many hours of footage all shot by Treadwell. Suffice to say the documentary paints a disturbing portrait of a Far Left radical who goes way over the edge. If Treadwell was a Christian, the filmmakers would be quick to point out here is another "religous nut," but Treadwell was the opposite, a non-believer, a man who admitted he was clueless when it came to whether there is a God or not or what He would be called. I only mention this because Treadwell's atheism points out one of the dangers of it: you make up your own set of rights and wrongs, based solely on what pleases you, what you can live comfortably with, and it's extremely selfish and usually very destructive in the long run. Treadwell worshiped himself....period. He loved his looks, his courage, his noble actions, as he puts it, on and on. Just listen to him. That constant "I love you" to all the animals and even insects was another mask for his inability to adjust to his own human species and sexuality. In his selfishness, he forces himself on a world that wants no part of him and where he has no business being......all in the name of being this great protector of animals.Listen, there are screwballs are on both sides of any political issue, Left and Right Wing, but Treadwell really demonstrates the hypocrisy of the modern-day liberal, and the extreme PETA-type environmentalists. They chant "pleace and love" and most of all "tolerance" but deep inside are many times hate-filled people with unbelievable rage inside them, who - like Treadwell - have NO tolerance for anyone who might disagree with them or dare to tell them what to do. Treadwell is the poster boy for this kind of thinking.An extremist like Treadwell winds up hurting his well-meaning environmental cause for the more sensible people who might be on his side, but at least have respect for laws, know the difference between humans and animals and have tolerance for all viewpoints. Treadwell cared only for himself, despite his claims, and to Herzog's credit, he shows this. I didn't even get into his high-pitch speech, his gay affectation-like inflections, fake accent and another personality traits that don't help his cause either, only because his mannerisms would irritate anyone - straight or gay. The real tragedy in the whole story was that someone else also died a horrible, violent, unnecessary death along with Treadwell. And - despite Treadwell and his friends opinions - human beings are far more precious than animals.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Timothy Treadwell's Last Chapter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Released in 2005, this is a worthwhile documentary by Werner Herzog (director of the acclaimed films "Agguire, the Wrath of God" &amp; "Fitzcarraldo") on "grizzly man" Timothy Treadwell, who actually LIVED with grizzlies for 13 summers in wilderness Alaska from 1991-2003, sometimes accompanied by his bear-phobic girlfriend. Treadwell comes off as a loon yet, at the same time, likable, unique, gifted and dynamic. It's a fascinating story with entertaining touches, like as the hamming-it-up coroner (but I suppose that's just the coroner's whacked-out personality; after all, he examines human remains for a living).Treadwell documented his 13 summers with the grizzly bears on film and in journals. His journals have been made into a book by Ian Zonglobski. Each of the 13 chapters detail Treadwell's experiences with the bears, one chapter per each summer. The first 12 chapters reveal Treadwell's great love for the animals; to him the grizzlies are lovable cute &amp; cuddly critters. The 13th chapter, however, horrifically details the tragic end of Timothy and his girlfriend as they end up half-eaten by a grizzly, apparently an older bear who was having a hard time finding enough to eat. This last chapter is fittingly titled "I Guess They Weren't So Cuddly After All."Just joking, of course. Treadwell himself testifies that he's fully aware of the life-threatening danger of the bears, but he's learned how to live amongst them year after year. His secret is that you can't make yourself look weak, like a victim; you have to show yourself friendly, but strong. In any case, there's stunning footage of two grizzly males fighting for the rights to a female and it's worth the price of admission. There's also a lot of footage of foxes whom Treadwell befriends, like they're his pets. One of the best parts of the documentary is Herzog's non-judgmental, but honest insights about Treadwell, which adds a layer of psychological depth. The filmmaker is clearly intrigued by his subject. He informs that he thinks it's a mistake for Timothy to sentimentalize the bears, but he shares his view in a respectful manner. Herzog clearly respects Treadwell for the living-on-the-edge boldness it takes to do what he he does. So there's no judgment to his commentary; he's just fascinated by Treadwell's amazing story, like we the viewer.One curious part occurs when Treadwell shoots footage of visitors to the park, which shows one of them throwing a couple rocks at a grizzly. Timothy is clearly offended, but fails to do anything about it. As the "protector" of the bears, as he continuously claims, I expected him to at least approach the group and verbally castigate the man who threw the rocks, but he does nothing.(In defense of the guy who threw the rocks, he possibly did so to sway the bear away from them, which is what rangers instruct visitors to do if a bear comes too close). I'm just trying to figure out what he actually did that "protected" the bears? I suppose you could argue that he created public awareness through his videos and appearances, which might have indirectly helped the bears. The film runs 144 minutes. GRADE: B+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember that when I was a kid my friends' parents used to told us stories about bears that killed people-- or at least caused a skin ripped off. However, I never really had the idea that bears could be as dangerous as this movie's story remembers us. In fact, this film is very useful for people to understand that you cannot just go into an animal's habitat expecting to be best friends with him. Animals simply don't think like human. That's a great thing about this documentary; filmmakers tried to show that even thought you may admire forest animals, many of them are INDEED dangerous and you should be very careful while messing with them. Timothy Treadwell, in my point of view, had the wrong idea about bears due to his psychological condition, which wasn't the best out there. What I dislike about "Grizzly Man" is that sometimes it feels too fake to be a documentary. You know, people interviewed act soooo strange that it was hard to believe it was a real documentary; many of the scenes made it feel just like a film. Even "The Blair Witch Project"-- which IS a film-- has more natural interviews than this documentary. Maybe that's just why I'm not giving it a better rating, since I liked the documentary's message, even thought I felt very sorry for the dying couple. Oh, and it felt overlong sometimes, it wasn't necessary to run for so long, we could understand everything after the 60 minutes. Interesting picture to see anyways.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Werner Herzog has a reputation of a genius, but i'm not sure what was he aiming at in this movie. It doesn't take much time to figure out that Timothy Treadwell was an unstable personality. There was even a personal crisis mentioned, after which he found a purpose in life in living among bears. Nevertheless, i felt a heartache when watching him talking to them or explaining to the schoolchildren how meek they actually are.We may also assume that he simply had a different outlook on life. But even then you must grow up in Disneyland in order to believe that grizzly bears are man's friends. They are omnivores and prey on large mammals, when available, which the main character will discover later in the movie and pay with his life.Overall this movie is rather an MTV Jackass episode with a death wish than a serious documentary.</fullReview>

I feel bad that the guy got killed but he really was asking for it by putting himself in that situation. Really I think there was something mentally wrong with him? Maybe all the marijuana, drugs and alcohol he consumed addled his mind? Plus, it may not have been a bad movie to show kids, but the language Treadwell uses is very bad.

If anyone has watched Louis Theroux documentaries its a similar frustration, however interesting and deeply immersed you are in the material every now and again there seem to be highly contrived moments that are not needed. This is one of my favourite films though and Herzog does make some fantastical decisions such as to listen to the footage on camera, it made the hairs on my neck stand up. Fantastically emotive.Herzog couldn't be a better commentator, his obvious connection and soothing narration over Treadwells stunning footage is powerful. I have some sympathy for Treadwell and the eventual outcome of his work, however I get the feeling he really lived. Despite all of his mental problems that he was experiencing he managed to do exactly what he wanted to do and not many of us can say that.The moment that the fox comes to visit is astonishing. It really is beautiful, such a shame it has such a brutal end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most people know the story before it starts. However, I wasn't aware of the level of Treadwell's madness.He didn't use electric fences around his tent at night. He wanted to be friends with man eaters. He talked to them like your mum talks to a kitten. He got WAY to close to them. Even trying to stroke one at one point. He thought the rangers were fools who were letting 'hunters' get at the bears. This was nonsense. Treadwell was the threat. The bears (as stated on here by an ex-ranger)can become accustomed to humans if in constant close contact. Bears may then go and walk near more humans without fear. The result is either bear gets shot or human gets eaten.I had little pity for Treadwell as he put basically was responsible for his girlfriend's safety. Two innocent bears were shot. Their crime? Being bears. One innocent human also lost her life. One fool caused his and those losses of life.The film is very well made by the way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps it's strange that Timothy Treadwell reminds me of Bruno, Sacha Baron Cohen's over-the-top Austrian fashionista.In "Bruno," Cohen's character attends an orgy and, uninvited, posts himself beside a guy having sex, then coaches and praises him through his gyrations. Just as superfluous does Treadwell seem in Alaska's Katmai National Park, a federally protected habitat for thousands of wild bears. Treadwell does anything but tread lightly there, raising anthropomorphism to a high art as he anoints himself the grizzlies' protector and friend while giving them names in a god-like manner. The film's promotional material proclaims that nature has boundaries that Treadwell dared to breach. I agree. However, Werner Hertzog's fascinating documentary goes beyond the realm of boundary violations and into the domain of psychiatric case study. At times he seems like a naive and silly St. Francis. Other times he's a crazed martyr who ends up getting killed for his beliefs. Hertzog never explicitly says so, but Treadwell originally courted the bears after having been left by a girlfriend. The animals provide a sense of purpose for the alcoholic amateur naturalist -- he couldn't very well serve as a guardian for the bears if he were falling-down drunk, he reasons. So Treadwell makes himself sentry, against a stunning mountainous backdrop, in an area so remote it's accessible only by air taxi. Treadwell seems a sensitive if not obsessive observer of ursine behavior -- all the while filming his subjects from a perilously intimate vantage point.Hertzog believed Treadwell had a death wish and I tend to agree. He stayed too late into the fall season, knowing that half-starved bears were on the prowl, and he was fatally attacked the day before his scheduled pick-up. Treadwell couldn't find a place for himself in human society and he was probably a misanthrope. Yet the 100 hours of film he left seems a gift to the humans he disdained. We see bears catching salmon, wrestling for domination, and gamboling with their cubs. The movie leaves a very strong impression. But how could anything by the relentlessly curious Werner Hertzog NOT?</fullReview>

It should not come as a shock, at least to a normal, sane human being. No one should be shocked by the fact that Treadwell and girlfriend were both killed by a 6 1/2 foot, 760 lb. eating machine whose claws are as long as your fingers, maybe longer. And as you would expect, neither Timburger nor the girl bothered to do any real or imaginary research on the species they chose to live with. Surprised about that? You shouldn't be considering how these two behave among creatures known for the past 10,000 years to consume human flesh. All this film is, is a study in stupidity - period.</fullReview>

Treadwell is a fascinating character, almost inhumanly naive and childish but also extremely knowledgeable in the actions of wild animals and the demands of life in the wild. Ultimately he allows his passion to get in the way of good judgment, as he madly rails against new park regulations installing a hundred-yard cushion between man and bear just weeks before becoming grizzly food himself, but there are both positives and negatives to take away from the story. His interactions with wild foxes make for some charming, amazing asides, and the unique perspectives afforded by his lifestyle share an intimate peek into the tendencies and temperament of grizzlies at their least guarded. As a naturalist he's without many peers, but unfortunately he's equally unrivaled as a cautionary tale regarding the volatile, unpredictable disposition of the untamed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been aware of this film for a while, but never had a particular interest in seeing it, as I thought I had all the facts -- overzealous naturist lives with bears, bears eat him, the end. While yes, that is the general outline, the actual film reveals much more. Fact is, Tim Treadwell (the 'grizzly man') was a deeply disturbed individual with some fairly obvious mental illnesses. His actions throughout the tapes he made reveal him not as a thoughtful conservationist, but rather as a crazed, borderline-psychotic recluse with a death wish. It's incredibly sad really. The man had some serious demons (past drug and alcohol addictions) and was clearly trying to commit suicide, even if that desire was subconscious and couched in his unbridled 'love' for grizzly bears, which he anthropomorphized to the point of delusion.The worst part is how obvious it all was, and the fact that his close friends enabled his behavior without any serious attempt at intervention. It's terrible that he also took his girlfriend along with him.The documentary itself is well paced and informative, and Herzog did a great job with the narration and providing much needed perspective and sensitivity. He doesn't judge Treadwell, but doesn't glorify him at all either. Worth watching if you haven't seen it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Timothy Treadwell, judging from this documentary, is...how should I put it? A nut, a kook, a man who willingly puts himself in extreme danger, because he believes he will be safe. Of course he ended up being killed by one of his beloved bears, that's nature for you, you think you have things under control, and then the next second you get your head ripped off by a savage animal. It is admittedly, quite amazing seeing Treadwell interact so closely with these animals, yeah, there is footage with him playing with some foxes, which are fun, but the bear footage, that's unbelievable. When I was a kid I used to go for a walk through forests very often, and I was always so nervous that I would meet a bear, and here, we see Treadwell swimming with a bear, putting his finger in their face, and he gets away with it, until of course he met one who wasn't interested in playing around. We hear a lot of stories from people who were close to or knew Timothy, but the majority of the movie's running time is spent with Mr. Treadwell, he is kind of interesting in that he actually does what he does, I will say that I found him slightly annoying at times, some footage late in the movie screaming and saying the F-word every five seconds, it seemed like he was doing Andy Dick's shtick, was he acting or was he actually THAT crazy, who knows? More importantly, it doesn't matter, because regardless, I found some of that behaviour to become a little tiresome eventually. The death of Timothy and Amie, his girlfriend at the time, was not captured on camera, but the sound was, we don't get to hear it but we see Herzog listening to the actual audio, and he decides not only will he not include it in the film, he encourages the woman who owns the tape to destroy it. I like that Herzog takes a stand here, that kind of sensational, gruesome material does not need to be in the film. I liked the documentary, it has some incredibly footage in it, Timothy Treadwell himself is a special kind of guy, I could've done without some of his antics later in the film, but it's a documentary worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Grizzly Man is one of the most fascinating and impressive documentary films I've ever seen. When filming hours upon hours of material Timothy Treadwell imagined himself as a naturalist and nature documentarist, but in Werner Herzog's able hands that same footage was re-purposed as a document of a delusional and conflicted man on the verge of insanity, and of the delicate balance between man and his most primeval nature.Grizzly Man is a rare documentary, one that has several layers of content and creates real discussion and thought. It tells a fascinating story, and at the same time makes a more global statement; Treadwell's footage is the heart and soul of the film, and could have made for a wonderful documentary on the Discovery Channel, but Herzog's input gives the film another dimension. Whether the additional scenes, featuring Herzog himself, are genuine or reenacted, is irrelevant; they're part of the bigger picture, a document of human nature, the human mind and the human condition, and it's much bigger than just a documentary about bears.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Timothy Treadwell was an interesting guy. He was a failed actor who yearned for fame. He decided to try and pass himself off as the Jane Goodall of grizzlies. Unlike Jane, however, he wasn't a naturalist. He was just a big, strong, fearless guy who got closer to grizzlies than anyone else. The fact that he was obviously gay and tried to deny it is very funny. In the end, all it took was just one homophobic grizzly. I would recommend seeing the documentary - Treadwell took some amazing footage. He obviously loved animals and his ability to transform wild foxes into lapdogs took a lot of insight into animal behavior on his part. Treadwell was a very likable, honest, eccentric, but screwy guy. Some of his off-air rants are priceless, as when he's upset with government intervention on his plans, or when he demands that God make it rain (it promptly came down in torrents....hoax?). He also uses baby- talk to communicate with 800 lb. killing machines. Footage of grizzlies fighting, swimming, and playing are very memorable. It is ironic when Treadwell handles bear poop and regards it in a spiritual way. He was destined to become just that very soon. It's a shame that Treadwell and his female companion were mauled to death and partially eaten. He tempted fate and the end came quickly and without warning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An engaging and fascinating story of a man who sees himself as the protector of Alaskan Grizzlies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***7.5 out of 10*** Grizzly Man is Werner Herzog's documentary about Timothy Treadwell, a man who turns his back on society and goes off to study bears in Katmai National Park in Alaska. Treadwell spends 13 years in Alaska, the last two of which he is accompanied by his girlfriend Amie Huguenard. The documentary, most of which is taken from Treadwell's own video-taped narratives, is fascinating viewing. It's very much a voyeuristic 'accident scene' kind of fascination, without actual video footage or sound of any accident, which lends a respectful credibility to Herzog's treatment of the material.Movies like Grizzly Man often elicit polar reviews - either very critical or complimentary - based more on the content of the story, it's characters, and their perceived impact, than on the basis of whether or not it's actually a good piece of documentary film making. On the latter point, Herzog is faced with the task of editing some 100 hours of Treadwell's own footage into a documentary that comes in at under two hours. I was left feeling that I had a pretty clear understanding of Treadwell's contradictory nature, and his often self-aggrandizing, often contrived, more immaturely childish than innocently childlike character. The interviews with those who know Treadwell are good revelations, both in terms of Treadwell the boy-man, and these same equally strange characters who know him.Watching this film I couldn't help thinking of James Frey, writer of 'A Million Little Pieces'. The writer Mary Karr aptly comments in her NY Times review of Frey's book, that Frey ultimately missed his own story - his struggle to tell the truth - which would have made for far more interesting reading. In this regard, the material Herzog chooses to include does the job of portraying Treadwell's struggle to be honest with himself, without resorting to hitting us over the head with a lot of commentary on this obvious fact. While Herzog's narration expresses his own feelings about Treadwell's character and actions, it still leaves room for viewers to form their own opinion of Treadwell. It's far more balanced than a Micheal Moore style of documentary.Comparisons have been made to Chris McCandless's Alaskan venture portrayed in 'Into The Wild' - John Krakeur's book and Sean Penn's movie of the same name. McCandless and Treadwell both inhabit a pathetic world; pathos is an apt expression for how I feel in regards to both of them. Not really sympathy or empathy.I differ with one of Herzog's final assessments of Treadwell's character. In one scene Treadwell rants a diatribe against the park service. Herzog narrates "It is clear to me that the park service is not Treadwell's real enemy. There is a larger more implacable adversary out there, the people's world and civilization". The truth is that Treadwell's greatest enemy is himself. This is the story of a man who is very much a victim of his own unrelenting self delusion. His companion, Amie Huguenard, is also the unfortunate victim of that self delusion. I don't feel hate or contempt for Treadwell, nor do I see him as the bear-protectorate of the wilderness that he tries so hard to portray in his goofy style.This is very much the character study of a troubled man, set against the backdrop of Alaska and the bears who inhabit the landscape with Treadwell. Whether or not he is what he claims to be is left for the viewer to decide.A good, very watchable documentary.Note: A language warning for kids.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Werner Herzog put together this film largely from material recorded by it's subject, and that material is riveting.It's a documentary portrait of a very unusual person, doing very unusual things, which although it has a tragic outcome (explained at the very beginning of the film), paints a portrait of someone who, while obviously troubled, followed his bliss successfully for many years. The fact of Timothy and his friend's deaths strongly overshadows the beauty of seeing an extensive record of a human in close contact with nature. It's deeply unsettling. I was reminded of Into The Wild, which follows a similar person on a similar journey. The longing to connect with nature is something most everyone can relate to, even if some people take it way over the edge.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sad character, astounding production</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The tragedy of Timothy Treadwell's tale is perhaps the fact that it likely took until his final moments on earth to realize that what he was doing was utterly selfish. It's a sad, sad story.Living, he did not seem to understand the concrete balance between animal, nature and the superficial human world. He did not seem to grasp the notion that the gigantic brown bears he was "befriending" were not his friends at all. They were dangerous wild animals that needed to be treated with the utmost respect. No, Timothy treaded into their world and paid the ultimate price. He convinced himself that he was invincible living with these magnificent creatures, but as we all found out, he was not.As for the film, it was downright brilliant. The editing must have taken months considering Treadwell generated almost 100 hours of footage. Then, to fuse it into a 103 minute production is astounding. Werner Herzog should be commended for his work on this chilling production.Warning to parents: Timothy's archive footage features constant course language and extremely vulgar statements. Other than that, it would be more than suitable for anyone age 12 and up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Into The Wild</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I believe the common denominator of the universe is not harmony but chaos, hostility and murder" - Werner HerzogWerner Herzog's "Grizzly Man" is perhaps best viewed as being part of a recent wave of eco-themed films ("Wall-E", "Avatar", "The Happening", "An Inconvenient Truth", "Into The Wild", "Dreamland", "The Day The Earth Stood Still", "Antichrist", "The Day After Tomorrow", "Happy Feet" etc). Most of these urge their audiences to "return to nature", "retreat to some pastoral existence" or "save the planet", without actual looking at the systemic forces which undermine or make such wants impossible. For example, the human race's energy requirements exponentially increase at a rate of about 3.9 percent. Such a growth is wholly unsustainable - we'll effectively require all the energy in the Milky Way in a couple thousand years - but of course capitalism as a machine requires constant growth and expansion in the misguided beliefs that it can outpace its (energy) debts. No surprise then that Herzog's later films increasingly adopt an apocalyptic tone: to Herzog, man's already dead.Interestingly, aside from "Antichrist", "Grizzly Man" and "Into The Wild", nature in these films is always portrayed as being some kind of mystical, "balanced system". While mega-studios, quite ironically, advise us to harmonize with nature, "smaller" directors (Penn, Herzog, Von Trier) seem to instead posit worlds in which nature is vile and base. Nature is still portrayed as being majestic and splendid, but is also accompanied by asphyxiation and choking, death and rot. The only harmony ? as Herzog famously said ? is that of overwhelming and collective murder. Murder, then, is the central theme of both "Grizzly Man" and "Into The Wild". Like Sydney Pollack's "Jerremiah Johnson", both films are about young men (Christopher McCandless in Penn's film, Timothy Treadwell in Herzog's) who cut themselves off from civilisation and venture off into the wilderness. Of course both Herzog and Penn initially romanticise their central characters' flights. They see beauty in these journeys and a kind of crazy inner strength (the adventurous Herzog, of course, identifies with Treadwell's mad obsessions). But both artists are also careful to counter this idealism with nature at its most violent. And so both films see their heroes "leaving civilisation", but only because they've first suffered a total, psychological collapse. They now disbelieve in their Master Signifiers, in their Symbolic Orders, and see civilisation itself as being representative of that which is arbitrary and chaotic. Both films then end with the deaths of their central characters, McCandless killed by a lowly poisonous berry, Treadwell killed by a mighty grizzly bear. This is not romanticism: the impetus for our adventures is something sad and pathetic, even if they're absolutely right. Their problem is that they've diagnosed civilisation but idealised Nature, a fatal failing; mankind's history is a history of battling the wild outdoors. Respect Nature. Approach with caution.Unsurprisingly, both Treadwell and McCandless are portrayed as being disenchanted idealists who cut themselves off from a world they no longer feel apart of, no longer trust, no longer love. In Herzog's case, Treadwell is portrayed not only as a naive, alienated, insecure and possibly homosexual guy whose hatred of society (presumably stemming from his failures as an actor) plunges him into odd "relationships" with animals (he watches grizzly bears), but also as a shadow of long time Herzog associate Klauss Kinski. Like Kinski's characters in Herzog's "Aquirre the wrath of God" and "Fitzcarraldo", Treadwell is an egotistical, wispy haired blonde. A man who becomes ego-maniacal as a defence mechanism and who misguidedly attempts to overcome Nature's malevolence and indifference.As with Herzog's other films, this is also implicitly a film about film-making. Herzog's cinema is often an autobiographical cinema in which the artist is called upon to not only endure, but survive the very art he is creating. Kinski's act of lifting a ship over a mountain in "Fitzcarraldo" isn't just a trial in a story, but an ordeal which Herzog must himself overcome. It is Herzog as director, as artist, who must lift the ship! In other words, for Herzog, art is itself a form of ordering or triumphing over nature, or at least meeting it blow for blow, which is perhaps why the director prides himself on being shot, wounded, tortured or nearly dying while making films.And so it's no surprise that Timothy Treadwell, like Herzog, is himself a film-maker. Treadwell shoots copious amounts of wildlife footage, is always with a camera, always editing his material. The difference, perhaps, is that Timothy became an ego-maniacal actor who saw documentary film as a way of promoting himself as a personality, while Herzog, though he is also often criticised for his narcissism and self promotion, seems to see cinema as an ordeal which must be survived despite his own inconsequentiality. 8.5/10 ? A sad, crazy, but also very funny film. Like Herzog's "Even Dwarfs Started Small", the film plays best as a tale about a pint sized man who thinks far too highly of himself. Worth two viewings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For thirteen summers, Timothy Treadwell lived among the wild grizzly bears of Alaska. An untrained but fervent bear-lover, he took his videos and message of bear preservation to schools during his off-season. This documentary alternates Treadwell's footage with interviews of his friends, family, and co-workers.The result is a portrait of a man with a childlike enthusiasm and certainty that he could live with the bears as one of them. He also comes across as a grandstanding showman determined to make himself immortal. This documentary has done that much, although Treadwell and his girlfriend were killed and eaten by one of his beloved bears. There is no footage of bears showing anything but indifference to him, but Treadwell endlessly proclaims his love for the grizzlies and says he would willingly die for them. One can only imagine the horror of it.The Alaskan footage is lovely and one is impressed with the power and size of the bears. Unfortunately, the pristine beauty is usually interrupted with Treadwell's showboating antics. I think he was delusional when it came to his safety and I feel sorry for those who mourn him. Heartily recommended for nature lovers and those interested in a man recklessly pursuing a bizarre lifestyle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Laying bare the extraordinary tale of a Grizzly man.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There will be those that deem it only right that the study of this 2005 Werner Herzog piece was at one with nature in the extreme manner that he was. The subject at hand is a certain Timothy Treadwell, born Timothy Dexter, who spent a many number of years in the rural wilderness of an Alaskan nature park before his death at the hands of what it was he was there for: the large grizzly bears known for inhabiting the area. In a very basic sense, and by way of the documenting of Tim's past life problems; issues and events, a zone as beautiful and as natural as the wilds of Alaska is captured as being just as tranquil and eye-opening as it is deadly dangerous, thus combining nicely with what it is that made up Treadwell: a softly spoken and pleasant individual by way of what we get via the camera who himself has his own 'side'; a side which was angry, running on a history of disappointment, alcoholism and drug use. Therein lies an allegory between an item's beauty and tranquility with the harsh realities of other deadly items that lie within; the plains of Alaska on which Treadwell spent most of his later-life years and him as a person, complete with vengeful and angry inner feelings but a distinct ability to present a methodical and eye-opening persona.The film is a documentary, about the item of documentary film-making, predominantly featuring a film-maker. Those of us familiar with at least some of Herzog's work will realise before the man himself tells us what it is that draws him to the story of Treadwell; an odd or off-the-wall story with an often peculiar premise about someone relatively eccentric placed in a strange and hostile world full of items both strange and overbearing, but often a world they come to accept and try to conquer. From Kaspar Hauser to Kinski's Aguirre to Dieter Dengler on two separate occasions, this is Herzog's field and he effortlessly pulls it off; presenting Treadwell not as a freak nor as someone you ought to observe with a puzzled expression and laugh at on the odd occasion, but as someone like anybody else looking for a niche in life; to find company and companionship in the work that he did and the life he led. With partner Amie Huguenard, somewhat elusive in terms of screen time born out of the lack of footage, the film documents what some will argue as the happiest times of the man's life in the cold and vast locales of Katmai National Park and Preserve, located in America's forty-ninth state.Herzog guides us through his piece, offering timely insights on certain situations and the man himself, placing the facts out on a plateau without lecturing or talking down to the audience. He has taken reams of footage and condensed it down into an hour and a half-plus package expertly getting across the nature of Treadwell and magnificently constructing a portrait of the man keeping balance and precision on either side: refraining from creating the image of a freak; refraining from placing blame on any one thing that led him to do what he did and refraining from enforcing to us as to whether what he did and how he spent his time was a right or wrong thing. In lesser hands, Grizzly Man may have come across as an absolute circus.The film jumps from Treadwell's escapades on the forest and free flowing river-clad Alaskan mountainsides, Treadwell himself capturing some startling imagery of animals and nature, the likes of which we get the feeling even had Herzog himself in both surprise and awe at - which is saying something given what the man must have seen on his many years of travelling and film-making; to interviews with a certain former girlfriend by the name of Jewel Palovak; to third party individuals whom either knew Tim or knew of him, ranging from the pilot that flew him over there each year to local experts in the field of the Alaskan wilderness. Like Tim's parents, Jewel's insights are amongst the most interesting as we learn more about this man; a photograph she has of them together sees them situated beside one another as a picture of a bear hovers in-between them in the background whilst pinned to the wall. The idea that it is the bears who represent nature, the item of Tim's primary interest for the course of what he did, is quite literally coming between them as the photograph is being presented, is eerily prominent.One of these men openly dictates he does not believe man and nature can especially co-exist on the same plain, with all of Treadwell's activity being proof of this; observing Tim as an example of what happens when humankind attempts to cross over the divide that separates us from them, something grossly ill-advised. But it feels like Treadwell did genuinely belong on the other side of that divide, so much so that naming bear cubs and coming back each year to watch them grow whilst maintaining he was able to identify each of them was the order of the days during the best parts of his life. It appears to fill him with the sort of glee one would imagine any other normal person operating within the boundaries of normal life might feel when striving to achieve something. Tim goes so far as to identify that his drinking issues evaporated somewhat in being out in the back of beyond, foxes sitting beside him fast asleep in rather perturbing acts of trust as Tim speaks to the camera whilst he persistently pushes the boat out as to how close you can get to an untamed grizzly bear. Grizzly Man is a powerful and affecting documentary film, combining true to life demystification of a man with his own powerful footage of his time away from one civilisation and at 'one' with another.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>GRIZZLY MAN is a deft depiction of a multifaceted character. Although Werner Herzog's opinion of his primary subject is quite different from how the man saw himself, he still rendered an almost loving portrait of the man. Timothy Treadwell was a human dichotomy. On one hand, he was a sincere environmentalist who believed in universal harmony, and on the other hand, a somewhat immature eccentric. Werner Herzog feels that the universe is regulated by power and violence, and there is really no basis for such a pollyannaish philosophy. However, his bias never detracts from the examination of his subject, and Timothy Treadwell is treated with the utmost respect and admiration. Another positive attribute of the film is the way that Herzog seemed to linger on the subjects that he interviewed many moments after the obvious ending point. This technique added a certain tension, and brought out more 'non-verbal' data that would have been missed if he had ended the encounter at the more appropriate point. Herzog mentions how Treadwell's videos of nature often revealed hidden elements that were unintended, and Werner seemed to add this insight to his interview style. Clearly, Timothy Treadwell was not a man in step with the modern age, and Herzog's film elucidates this fact. Many historical figures, especially explorers, were probably characters similar to Henry in that they could not live under the limits and constraints of their respective ages. I think much of recorded history is biased toward making these personages more noble than they might actually have been, and maybe the real motivation for their quests was not 'to go where no man has gone before', but that they had to leave because their contemporaries could not accept them. And, this seems to be Herzog's impression on the life and times of Timothy Treadwell.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chaos, Hostility, and Murder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As Herzog poignantly put it, "I believe the common denominator of the universe is not harmony, but chaos, hostility, and murder." No sentence quite captures the essence of Grizzly Man like this one. At first the structure of the film bothered me (and still some of the directorial decisions do) but as I advanced through the film, Herzog's motives became clear. As they say, hindsight is always 20/20.I was a bit confused by the choice to reveal to the audience that Tredwell's life would end in tragedy so early in the film. I thought this would create an anti-climax. As I proceeded through the film, though, it became clear that with prior knowledge of his death, we're provided with greater insight into the characters of both Tredwell and the bears.Treadwell, our tragic hero, was clearly suffering from some sort of depression, or social-anxiety disorder. He rants in the film about his detest for all those who, he believes, hate bears. Half-way through the rant Herzog's voice brings insight. As Tredwell's rant becomes theatrical, Herzog likens him - without dropping the name - to Klaus Kinski; the context Herzog provides is that of an anti-social eccentric descending into madness. Here we understand that Tredwell's love for bear society is a self-deceiving, and ultimately fatal method of convincing himself that human society is wrong, and the he has been right all along.Following along with the filmmaker (Tredwell, not Herzog) we're tempted to sympathize with his love for bears, at times. Yes, bears are beautiful creatures whom we should respect. But, as Herzog reminds us, they are not human, and do not have human sensibilities. There is a scene near the end of the film, in which the bear who eventually murders Tredwell is seemingly acting very playful in the river. In reality, the bear is in a desperate search for food to avoid starvation during hibernation... This desperation ended in tragedy for not only Tredwell, but more importantly, his girlfriend Amy.This film is quite good. Anyone interested in documentary film-making, human psychology, or both will surely find it interesting. Still, everyone should watch it. It comes as a reminder of the realities of the natural world, where life is nasty, brutish, and short.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Preachy and too long if you're not a film school type</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's interesting that Treadwell recorded enough video to make into a documentary, and the bears certainly are captivating. Unfortunately, while the film makes attempts to show Treadwell's crazy side and the dangerousness of his idealism, the attempts are not enough and the film does not come out evenly balanced. It's hard to avoid rooting for Treadwell and yet clearly he was a fool to take so many risks. (Or even to be involved at all, if you agree with the park ranger.)Similar to Into the Wild, where someone dies in the wilderness mainly for being a damn fool, I resist the idea that Treadwell was a hero. Perhaps if it was only him who was killed, I might feel differently. Of course, it was not his girlfriend's first year with him in the wild.I was forced to give Grizzly Man a 5 out of 10, both for this reason and because it was a little too slow in its pacing. A little too much melodrama over what was a kind of grandiose suicide.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My first Werner Herzog movie, and my first review at the IMDb. There is not so much I can tell about the movie, except that it is... Different. Herzog has created a perfect balance between his own documentary and the footage of Timothy. Because of this, Herzog is able to make a profile of Timothy, and at the same time he uses the footage to make an impressive nature-documentary. Whether you think Timothy is a nut or he is a genius does not really matter. It is up to the viewer to decide what Timothy was. In short, Grizzly Man is a movie that tries to understand why a man would live with bears without being armed with weapons to defense himself. In fact, the movie was not just about bears and the nature: it was about a man who could not stand the civilization and wanted to be one with the nature.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Con as Big as a Grizzly Bear</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Besides some great video of Bears (that without him bewailing in it), he left nothing but sorrow, grief, loss, and confusion. Hertzog, in the movie Grizzly Man, handles the story of Timothy Treadwell well, especially at the end. He provides enough information and evidence to allow the viewers to determine for themselves the further truth about Grizzly Man. The main character Timothy Treadwell provided Hertzog with ample footage to work with. This is what makes this documentary worth watching. It carefully presents information that give the viewer time to draw their own conclusions.Timothy appeared very unbalanced and was a pure con man. Not that he did not have a passion for wildlife, but he saw his passion as his way to extend his 15 minutes of fame. It is a shame he to become a meal for a bear in order to do that. It is also a shame that whoever underwrote his project does not have to take some of the responsibility for encouraging this poor man.jemenfoutisme commenting on the movie, on this site, said this, "For my part, I was in awe of both Treadwell's incredible physical courage coupled with his absolute lack of judgment and his insane narcissism. He struck me as a cross between Pee-Wee Herman and Marlon Perkins, the guy who narrated the Mutual of Omaha nature documentaries that showed up on Sunday afternoons in the 60's and 70's." -- I sort of agree Timothy was an untrained, undisciplined adventurer who flaunting science and authority to do something he "sold" as a worthy cause. His on camera rantings are clearly evidence of a person who does not have full stability in his mind. Values and ethics are twisted to suit his purpose and those who would question him would be blasted.If the big picture is examined, Timothy accomplished very little good. His claims to protect the bears from poacher are not true. The group in the movie tossing rocks toward a bear on the shore from a boat were not poachers. They were on a camera excursion and were there taking photographs only. No guns, not intent to kill. Tossing rocks was an attempt to get the bear to react so they could get a good shot. Even though this is clear in the video Timothy took, his voice-over comments attempt to make the tourists, the photographers out to be invading poachers.Very sad is the almost criminal mindset Timothy had which Hertzog leaves alone. Timothy lived in a fantasy, a delusion that cost him his life and more tragically the life of his girlfriend who was terrified by bears but went with him out of love. Timothy was a user of people and fed them a line only to get the attention he so desperately needed to feel worth while. I would guess that he had many of the same skills as cult leaders have when they beguile their followers into believing the fantasy so that they can have a physical relationship with them.The movie is very much worth watching and I acknowledge that others will come to a different conclusion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Werner Herzog's documentary covers the troubled life and death of Timothy Treadwell, an activist/adventurer who spent 13 summers in the intimate company of cute red foxes and terrifying but majestic grizzly bears. The film details how Treadwell wanted to become as much like the bears as possible, to have some kind of religious sense of merging with them in their animal habitat. This has both its noble aspects as well as its disturbing aspects -- at one point Treadwell fondles a pile of manure from one of the bears and rhapsodizes about how "this was just inside her!" His devotion to the animals may seem temporarily charming, but gradually the "little boy" voice that he puts on when he talks to them and the way he says "I love you, I love you" to the animals who barely acknowledge his presence is quite off-putting. We see moments of extreme paranoid delusion and anger, when he curses the National Park service authorities for what he imagines to be their collusion with hunters and trappers. It's clear from the footage and the way Herzog chooses to edit it that Treadwell had a very specific need which these animals filled for him -- he was obsessed with the idea of "helping" or saving the animals, despite the fact that credited biologists say he harmed them by making them more used to humans. Treadwell crouches in his collapsing tent, clutching his childhood teddy bear to his chest in a pose that forcefully tells us how much of his "crusade" is really a process of infantalization and misplaced sentiment.My only problem with the movie is that there's a bit too much Herzog. He is a bit too insistent to impress upon us his particular view of beauty through the narration, and doesn't always allow the images to speak for themselves enough. Everything is telegraphed, made obvious. But ultimately it's hard to disagree with Herzog's take on the footage, or on Treadwell. He was a fascinating person, but he was very unhinged. He had beaten various addictions by replacing them with more "noble" neuroses. Watching him on film, it's impossible not to feel his job of life and to be saddened at his passing. But there's nobody to blame for what happened except Treadwell himself, because he was trying to push reality into some kind of box. For him, nature -- and specifically the bears -- had to actually be everything that civilization was not. He could not recognize what Herzog called the "chaos and murder" element which is part of nature, not just part of human life. He may indeed have been on the brink of a psychotic lapse from reality, which the bear attack only managed to prevent. What's really interesting about Herzog's film is the way that the act of filming, the distance between the camera and the person (Treadwell) itself becomes a metaphor for this breakdown in object/subject relationships, the disassociation of Treadwell's neurosis.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remarkable documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Who is the subject of this documentary?" is the question you must ask yourself. Is it the grizzly bear of one half of the title? Or is it the man who died in collating the footage? Does 'Grizzly Man' apply to him (Tim Treadwell) or to a generic man (who he represents) in regressive search of his primordial nature?This fascinating construction using 'over 100 hours of tape' and interviews with amateur naturalist Tim Treadwell's friends and family is all of these. It's also a documentary about The Filmmaker. Throughout, Herzog makes comments about how Treadwell is using the camera to record situations, how it changes him and what the camera actually captures. This part of the documentary on its own is quite fascinating and serves to deconstruct some of the more complicated parts of the character of Tim Treadwell, which inevitably come under scrutiny.Treadwell is indeed the film's principal subject though. I particularly like the conceit that Herzog manufactures (but is none the less true for that), which concerns appearances of Treadwell's girlfriend Amie Huguenard. We see her in four parts of the film, notably in a sequence in which Herzog points out how oblique her presence is - how she is clearly present in some way but seems at odds to Treadwell's nature - retiring, scared of the bears, obscure (her family absent themselves from the film). Later we discover, from a poignant audio record, that for all her nebulousness she ultimately fought the agent of both Treadwell and her death in a moment of unspeakable violence (shown only as a reaction of the director listening to the record on camera). It's as Herzog construes that Treadwell's better, human part was accidentally captured on camera during the haphazard way in which he recorded himself over the period of his Alaskan sojourns.The only drawback is the troubling, pretentious contribution of the local coroner, a man only too aware of the camera in a way the others aren't.

The fact that it is real is absolutely frightening.I don't share the disgusting opinion expressed by other cynics, that Treadwell "got what he deserved", but that doesn't change the fact that what happened to him was brought about by his own arrogance and naiveté.One of the most disturbing parts of the movie occurs when Treadwell stands behind a rock and spies on a tour group throwing rocks at a curiously approaching bear. Instead of realizing that the experience is good for the bear, that it will help the bear develop a healthy fear of humans and that rocks thrown by people will not hurt it much anyway, he instead reacts angrily as if he's watching an assault on a weaker animal.I believe that Treadwell should have been stopped by the "mean" authorities and saved from the bears and himself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Taming nature</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By coincidence, the movie about the life of Timothy Treadwell corresponds very well to a short story I have been writing. The movie involves bears and my story involves fish, but that's just a detail. They are both tales about people who believed they could dominate nature.Treadwell may have been a multi-faceted character, but my overwhelming impression of him is that of a man with immense ego. He "loved" the bears but only on his terms. He loved them not for their wildness or their intrinsic beauty (though clearly he adored the foxes) but for the fact that their presence in his"domain" increased his own feelings of self-importance. To all intents and purposes a social dropout, his relationship with them lifted him out of all of that and took him to insanely dizzy heights. He invaded their domain and constantly pitted himself against them. He dominated them not with guns or whips but by his sheer presence. He gave them names and humanized them. In so doing, he transformed their domain into his and all the animals in his "kingdom" became his "subjects". The voice he uses when speaking to them is not that of a humble pupil of nature but that of a governess who loves her charges to distraction but only if they "do as they're told". The fact that they were dangerous only increased his fascination with them. To feel that you have dominion over such large and ferocious beasts must be some ego-trip. Towards the end, when he rants against anyone who is "invading" his "kingdom", he clearly believes that he is one of the few humans who is able to live within the area which he termed the "Grizzly maze" unmolested. Although he doesn't say outright that he believes himself to be immune from the bears, the implication is there.However, there comes a point in the late autumn when food is becoming scarce and a bear needs to put on weight quickly in order to survive winter hibernation. At such a point it might cease to fear even such a dominating individual as Treadwell.For me, Treadwell was only an extreme example of the many people who try to mold nature to their own psyche. However, to give him his due, he would have been appalled (as was pointed out by the pilot who had transported him into bear territory) by the subsequent killing of the "killer" bear. This animal was summarily shot and the human contents of its gut placed in plastic bags and transported to California. These remains were then incinerated and the ashes flown all the way back to Alaska, where they were scattered around Treadwell's former campsite. While I realize that this was done mainly in order to perform an autopsy, the fact that it was necessary only shows the extent to which such areas have been invaded by humans. Such is the relationship of modern humans with nature.So many people look at nature and wonder at its harshness. Why would a bear eat her cubs? Why would a male kill the cubs of a rival? They fail to see that in nature it's the survival of the group which is important. In a bad year the cubs would not survive without the mother, yet she can go on to breed the following year. When a male wins a sexual contest against another it's important that all resources are diverted to the offspring of this superior male so as to ensure the group evolves with its environment. Humans are losing touch with these important issues and Treadwell deserves credit for some outstanding photography depicting these things.</fullReview>

I have been rented them and watching them with my girlfriend in the last couple weeks and this one was exceptional! Herzog's dry, ironic voice-over's lead to humor and often times to something profound. Its is amazing how well edited the film is considering there was 1000 hours of footage left behind (in addition to the footage Herzog shot himself for the film. Its very well arranged and keeps your attention from the first frame to the last. The questions raised about how human's behave and the create and destroy are still with me today... as is the score. Its simple and somehow haunting. This is an engaging film for any audience and one of Herzog's best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grizzly Bears</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was only my third experience with a Werner Herzog film and definitely my third pleasant experience. Recently I post on this site my top 15 of the year 2005 and now I will have to change it since I consider Grizzly Man as one of the 5 best films of 2005. It is a powerful documentary and actually Herzog introduce to us few persons, some which were close to Timothy Treadwell and others that are related with the subject. The footage filmed by Timothy Treadwell is enough and is really powerful and of course impressive. Herzog himself narrates the film in English and since the beginning he says that he is not a naturalist but a filmmaker, he provides some of the 100 hours of material that Treadwell filmed and complement that with some interviews, we will know more about the Grizzly Man. With his own footage we watch a man in love with something, caring and feeling admiration, curiosity, etc for something. By watching his impressive, sometimes even funny, footage you can forget about anything else around his story. He forgot everything else, at one point you see him worry just about the rain, he is praying for rain, the bears needed food. Timothy was desperate, he was desperate for the bears, he was like a familiar. We see Timothy as the complete alone man, far away from home but at the same time in home, he wanted to be one of them, he was in different world. The interviews help of course to know more about Timothy. He had a fight and he could end with something that many can't even if they try really hard. He found in bears a reason to keep going, certainly he was there for a good cause and certainly he was found death. There are haters; some considers that Timothy was doing a bad thing for the bears by being there in their natural environment. The man of the museum in Alaska says that his people learned to live with bears. I'm not any kind of naturalist and I do eat meat. I found bullfighting to be one of the most abominable degenerations of the human race and any follower should go and f*** themselves. Hunting as sport is a similar things for me. We understand the anger that Timothy was feeling against the aggressors but we see the paranoia around Timothy. It is a unique case, is interesting, tragic and, absolutely, very difficult. Timothy felt anger, he wanted the best for his friends, he entered in their world and he stays there?This is a magnificent documentary, my highest recommendations. For me it is just another masterwork of Werner Herzog and now I can't wait to see more of his work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Compare with Into the Wild</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen "Grizzly Man" for the first time after viewing Sean Penn's "Into the Wild" I was shocked at how many parallels there were.It seems that both men had a death-wish; their family histories are startlingly similar, AND, I would argue, it's probable that BOTH had a psychological disorder.Still, I've got quite a few questions left-- and most will never be answered.Great movie. Also I'm very impressed by the direction of Werner Herzog in this documentary-- enjoyed the minimalism he employed (and his voice-over commentary actually). The scenery alone is worth the price of the movie-- it's unbelievably beautiful.I don't think he took as objective a stance as Sean Penn, although I'm sure most people who've seen both movies would argue that neither filmmaker did! I would not describe "Grizzly Man"--or "Into the Wild"--as a love letter or as propagating any particular "side" of the story. It just is what it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Herzog's narration</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found it fascinating that this film begins like a formal "objective" documentary, but the narrator slowly inserts more and more of his opinions until he ends up in an open debate with the film's subject. Certainly, Herzog is probably better equipped than most to provide counterbalance to the rants of a lonely man in the bush. But, the technique was jarring and I couldn't help but wonder if Herzog was simply using Treadwell's situation as a platform to speak out about his own Winnetou-influenced theories on the natural world.Below are clippings of other IMDb comments on this unorthodox narrative technique:-----------------------------------------------------------------...Herzog's pretentious moralizing narration....dreadful patronising pseudo-intellectual narration...Werner's barely-mocking, critical narration notwithstanding...herzog also was very keen on adding his own opinions about grizzles and nature, both of which he apparently doesn't know a thing about.Herzog's narration is a pleasant and soft spoken counter voice to the often shrill and out of control Treadwell.The narrator was bad and asked dumb questions.First of all, as a narrator and interviewer, Herzog should omit his personal opinions about the subject of this documentary, and I believe this is a basic rule.Werner Herzog, who directed and narrated this film, is constantly insisting we hear his opinion on things At times Herzog ... can't resist his own explanations, which are almost as ludicrous and funny as Timothy Treadway's rants and declarations of love for foxes and bears. (Erol) Morris would have known how to fill in the cultural context Herzog pretty much missed in his heavy handed narration. The limit is the aerial shot of the jumbled ice blocks in the glacier which Herzog sees as Treadway's soul. Come on now, isn't that just a wee bit Teutonic? Adding to the humor is Herzog's narration. Never in my life have I seen such a corny pseudo-intellectual. Cliché follows cliché all delivered in a tone that suggest wisdom is being imparted.Werner Herzog's compassionate narration doesn't aim to judge Treadwell, but point out that the great foundation of his life, his enthusiasm for the wild, while the thing which gave him meaning, was also based on a misconception.Herzog's compassion is not patronizing, and not overly sentimental. As he states frequently throughout the film, he tries to understand humanity from a filmmaker's perspective.Herzog's world-weary cynicism proved a perfect counter point to Treadwell's naive view of nature. Normally, I don't like to hear the filmmaker narrate a documentary. I prefer documentaries where the subjects and the footage manage to tell their own story. However, I enjoyed Herzog's narration. ... What other documentary filmmaker would recommend that an interviewee destroy film? Herzog, with a welcome and somewhat eerily detached view, narrates this documentary...Without Herzog interjecting his own balanced suppositions, we're unable to see just how Treadwell's acts of defiance are not only acts of pure lunacy, but acts of poignant proclivity as well.Herzog narrates the pictures in his usual gloomy way and he also criticises Treadwell occasionally for his apparent views that nature is in harmony.Every so often, director and narrator Werner Herzog brings us down to earth with unaffected commentary.The only pet peeve I have about Grizzly Man is the narrator sometimes inputting his own opinion into a story made only for the man who lived it. I think he should let the viewer make up his mind, and keep it a documentary.The director narrated his opinion often over video of Treadwell, whom he never knew personally, many times stating his beliefs as fact......Herzog's near-undecipherable and extremely lame narration...The narration and writing were terrible......The brilliant, warm, distinct narration...Herzog gives both a compassionate and harsh approach.Herzog's narration is fascinating - he does not approve of Treadwell and his manic devotion to these wild beasts, and he openly disagrees with Treadwell's belief that nature is harmonious - and yet he is not hostile toward Treadwell at all. There is almost a sense of admiration for the man's courage and ingenuity.Anything beautiful about the original footage is completely overshadowed by Herzog's Reineer Wolfcastle-esquire narration over the top of it. Please do not tell me if and why something is beautiful. Please do not assault me with unsolicited gems of film making know how. Do not let me live vicariously though your emotions because they are more finely tuned then my own.The director puts himself in focus... It's ridiculously bad journalism, and I can't believe so many comments seem to have missed that? I almost started laughing sometimes during the movie. I don't want the directors personal views... at least not in the narrating. If he had some skill he could let the viewers decide for themselves.Herzog narrates a poetic and contemplated voice-over that highlights his differences with Timothy stating the uniting bond between nature is not beauty or harmony, but violence and the need to kill.Herzog, too, makes no effort to uphold the sanctity of the fourth wall. He is both audience and narrator, commenting on Treadwell as much as the contents of Treadwell's tapes. In a break from traditional (think March of the Penguins-style) narration, he actually appears on camera conducting interviews, firmly affixing a face to the (judgemental but, I thought, dead-on) voice. It's thrilling that in this film, we *are* supposed to pay attention to the man behind the curtain.Herzog's approach to this film is what really works for me and at times during his narration I felt some real anger coming from his voice ... When Treadwell starts to go on a tirade, it was Herzog's narration that brought it in context -- it allowed me to bridge the gap: to recall my own frustration over my illusions.The director has bound it all together with his own frank and idiosyncratic narration.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Grizzly Man is a different kind of film and a great film. I've read the wide range of opinions about Timothy Treadwell, but perhaps your opinion of Treadwell is not at all important to your relationship with the movie. The footage of Alaska is awesome. The footage of the bears is unbelievable. The footage of the foxes is moving. And the story of a man plopping down in the middle of this vast wilderness, summer after summer, living with the animals and the land is a study of exhilaration and danger. The film makes you ask yourself what is important, what is sane. Thoreau is invoked late in the movie, and his thoughts are fitting to contemplate in association with Grizzly Man: "I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, 'Grizzly Man' is, overall, an awesome movie. Not only is it entertaining, it also manages to move us with its sad story of a man who only wanted to help one of the world's largest land carnivores, and ended up being slaughtered by one. Damned irony.Herzog narrates with his biblical "Cherman" voice. He directs the film wonderfully, telling us exactly what we want and need to know. There is a part of the film where Jewel Palovak (a former friend of the grizzly victims', with a splendid name) gives Herzog the tape that recorded the deaths of Treadwell and his girlfriend. You can see the emotion (head in his hands, forehead increasing in pain), and it's probably more powerful than playing the tape itself.'Grizzly Man' is a terrific role-model for other documentaries to come. It's organized, emotional, and has some truly touching images of nature that I will remember for years to come.4/4</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting film about a disturbed individual</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was quite an interesting film about a very intriguing, if not a little disturbed individual. The movie isn't about the bears or the wildlife, this film is about Timothy Treadwell and the madness that drives him to live in the wilderness with the bears for 13 summers of his life.Overall the film is quite good and Timothy Treadwell is quite an interesting person to watch on screen. He goes from happy and silly to angry and hateful several times through out the course of the film. He often treats the camera as a confidant, recording his secrets and inner most thoughts on to the camera. The film shows Timothy at his best and worst through out the film; We see him calmly and happily tell us how he wants to help protect the grizzly bears, we see him furiously curse the government for not doing enough to protect the bears, and we see him weep after a male bears kills off cubs in order to mate with the female again.The best parts of the film are those that use Timothy's own footage of him in the wilderness. As much as I love Herzog's work, the parts he shot come across a bit below most of his other work. Many of his interviews seem over rehearsed and don't come across as real, causing some people to actually believe that this is all one big hoax. I definitely am not one to say it is a hoax, but the reactions of the people in the film just never seem genuine. It seems as if they had memorized there lines and were trying to remember what their next line was. However, this could just be because it was very difficult for them to talk about and took many takes for them to get things right.However, even though I don't particularly think the interviews were well done, the way Herzog put the film together is done rather well. He seems to have admiration for Timothy Treadwell for doing something that he loved and living in the wilderness for so long. He also seems to really appreciate Timothy's film making style and comments quite a bit on it. Towards the end of the film Herzog does seem to suggest that Treadwell wasn't quite right in the head, but he never seems to put him down for what he did.The overall story is a sad one, I don't think it is a spoiler to say that Timothy meets a very sad end at the hands of the very bears he wanted to protect. However the saddest part may not be the he died but that his girlfriend died with him. He knew that he could get killed out there, and some parts of the movie gave me the impression that he wanted it that way; however there was no need for her to die so horribly as well. We as the audience never see or hear any footage of the death, however we do see Herzog's reaction to listening to the audio recording. He simply tells Timothy's friend Jewel, who owns the tape, that not only should she never listen to it but that she should destroy it.As I said, I really liked the film in spite of the flaws I have mentioned because it tells an interesting story about an interesting person who was passionate about something, although maybe a bit overly passionate. He died believing that he had done something good in the world by helping the bears, and that in it self is an accomplishment. It is just sad that he had to take his girlfriend with him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think, after seeing this documentary, Timothy was a fallen man. Addictions led him to a place where he found his cure. He believed he knew the bears (as seen in this production). Many condemn his actions, others give him credits. I personally think he was a dreamer, who found peace in the wilderness. But his expertise was not fundamented on science but on experience, so he got the wrong impression of his actions. However, being part of his own story, he could not notice it, like we spectators do. Therefor it is easy do condemn him. And not right to give him full credits. His way of life was one of both. And if you watch this movie without prejudice, you may find out it is a story about a man who loved bears, but in his love lost reality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Grizzly Man- 2005, Directed by Werner HerzogGrizzly Man is a single character documentary film which magnifies four consecutive summers from 2000-2003 which Timothy Treadwell spent in the Alaskan wilderness living among the Grizzly bears of Katmai National park in Alaska. The gentle toe-headed, Treadwell appointed himself the guardian of a pack of Grizzly's and shot over 100 hours of footage. Between this footage and the interviews what emerges is a loosely spliced auto-biographical sketch rather then a nature study. Viewers expecting a documented record about the plight of Alaskan Grizzly bears or the progress of the modern ecological movement will have to hold out for another film. Instead we delve into the personal account of a man, his inability to cope with the human world, and his attempt to join the simple yet unforgiving animal kingdom. Timothy's pilot and friend tell about the day he found the devoured corpses of both Timothy and his girlfriend. On camera Timothy begins open up his emotional fragility while lying on the bay shore petting a wild fox he begins discussing why he started coming to the Alaskan Wilderness, to avoid the need to drink. However Timothy's teary confessions of drug and alcohol abuse avoid any examination of what drove him to retreat in the first place, nor we ever see him ever take the time to contemplate his similarities of his old life and his new.In spite of the enormity of his flaws and instabilities not everything in Timothy's life a tragedy. While in the natural world he did manage to capture the some excellent nature shots. Close-up's of bears, swimming, frolicking, fishing for precious salmon. In the single greatest moment of Timothy's "expedition" two bears "Sargent Brown" and "Mikey" battle ferociously over the prized female "Saturn". The fight is primordial and raw and Treadwell captures it beautifully, being one of the few moments where he simply captures rather then narrates. The memory of Tim is also remembered kindly by a small group of old long time friends who shared in his dedication to the bears and who are introduced periodically. Through interviews they express their love for him and cherished remembrances. All of them are quick to showcase old photos, memories, stories. While nobody could possibly claim the Timothy didn't mean well, it's those who are wiser, who actually grew up with bears or studied them seriously that offer a sensible, sober view of Timothy's activities. Museum worker and Alaskan Ilutiiq Native Sven Haakason points out the danger, both to humans and bears, that comes with acclimating these wild creatures to civilization. Bear biologist Larry Van Dyke offers insight at key points in the film. Van Dyke points out that the low kill number from hunters and natural death put Katmai within the safe range for adequate re-population . This is in stark contrast to other ecosystems of the world where hunting actually does threaten several bear species. Yet for is own measure of self importance Treadwell somehow clings to a foggy and dramatic notion that poachers are constantly on the prowl.It's sad that all of this is lost on Tim who in his self-righteous blabbering and confessionals before the camera, admits that he doesn't understand or function properly within the human world. His parents tell of his drug abuse and binge drinking, dropping out of school and his failed try at acting. One friend tells of how he invented a new identity and faked an Australian accent during his life in Florida, and nearly overdosed at least twice. A second friend Jewel Palovak informs us that Timothy made a conscious decision to avoid medication for his psychological problems. Treadwell also became increasingly paranoid and unstable. Insisting that he was protecting the bears even though he films a scene in which he quickly cries and runs away from a party of possible hunters who throws a few rocks at one bear. His patented ego-massaging catch phrase "I will die for these animals" is repeated several times throughout the film, but he leaves the viewer in complete mystery as to why giving up own life would help these bears, or even become necessary. By the films end he screeches and lashes out on camera at the park service who protect the land and the bears. He was quite likely bi-polar or manic depressive, and emotional fragile and has difficulty accepting the birth/death cycle of nature. While nature forces hungry bears low on salmon cannibalize their young, he cannot comprehend that his sentimental view of these animals is demolished. Herzog's narration is a pleasant and soft spoken counter voice to the often shrill and out of control Treadwell. The old veteran Herzog interjects himself on camera only once as he listens to the audio from Timothy's camera. With the lens cap on Tim's camera began recording as he was mauled to death and here Herzog listens to the audio only recording without playing the same audio for the audience. Timothy's oldest friend Jewel watches Herzog's face which is off camera, filled with horror and curiosity. While it isn't always pleasant to watch Treadwell disintegrate he died fulfilling his sense of duty and altruism no matter how tangled his reasoning might have been.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A poor documentary about a fascinating individual.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Grizzly Man is a documentary about Timothy Treadwell, a failed actor and ex-drug addict who lived among Alaska's grizzly bear population every summer for over a decade. At the end of his thirteenth visit he and his girlfriend were killed and eaten by a rogue bear. Over the years Treadwell had shot hundreds of hours of video for a planned wildlife documentary. Much of this footage is extraordinary, on par with the best professional wild life videography. A significant fraction, however, is made up of Treadwell speaking directly to the camera. This footage shows a man descending into madness and obsession. Werner Herzog, famed German director and a fellow who knows something about obsessed madmen, edited together choice bits of Treadwell's footage, along with interviews of his friends and family, in an attempt to understand what drove Treadwell into the abyss. Herzog did not succeed.Treadwell seems the most unlikely of naturalists. To look at him one wonders how he managed to survive ten minutes among the grizzly let alone thirteen years. While a self-taught expert on bear behavior he treated grizzlies not as the wild beasts they are but as (a ranger sourly notes) "people in bear costumes." Herzog flirts with the notion that Treadwell fantasizes friendship and love with the bears and nature as a replacement for normal human relationships. Over a close-up of one bear's impassive countenance, Herzog intones "?what haunts me, is that in all the faces of all the bears that Treadwell ever filmed, I discover no kinship, no understanding, no mercy. I see only the overwhelming indifference of nature?" It is, of course, precisely this lack of feedback that allowed Treadwell to build his fantasy relationships.Treadwell was a good looking blond fellow but his ruggedness was severely undercut by a high pitched, infantile voice. He would seem more at home singing show tunes or baking brownies than roughing it in the Alaskan outback. This he did, however, and with conspicuous success until his growing insanity drove him to take fatal chances. In civilization he volunteered his time and knowledge to elementary and grade schools and set up a foundation to protect the Grizzly. Treadwell apparently financed his endeavors through Internet donations and a series of minimum wage jobs. He must have had emotional and entrepreneurial resources at total odds with what we see. All in all a fascinating character and one that doesn't interest Herzog in the least.Herzog likes his madmen heroic and there is a certain way such men act. The problem for Herzog is that Treadwell was a fey, will-o-wisp of a man who didn't fit the heroic mold. The resulting conflict in tones often cuts close to comedy as when Herzog, responding to Treadwell's woozy romanticism, says "I believe the common character of the universe is not harmony, but hostility, chaos and murder." This is followed closely by an ecstatic Treadwell declaiming "Oh my gosh! The bear, Miss Chocolate, has left me her poop! The sad thing is that Treadwell doesn't need the trappings of a fictional tragic figure, he's the real deal. He genuinely faced down adversity, found triumph and fame and was savagely undone by fate and his own mad hubris. Sophocles couldn't have done better. Perhaps Herzog should have made a fictionalized biography where the living man could have been reduced to the sum of his tragedy. As a documentarian, however, Herzog's dramatic inclinations lead him astray. We, in turn, are left staring at Treadwell's anything but impassive face with less understanding than we had before we slipped the DVD into the drive.</fullReview>

Anyone who deliberately places himself or herself in harms way like he did, well, you have to wander if there's a leak up in the noggin. What did Treadwell prove by his misguided sentiments about the grizzlies? Did he and his girlfriend think they were giant, cuddly teddy bears or what? Animals in the wild are just that. WILD. And often dangerous. Grizzlies are beautiful animals I agree. But I believe they were meant to be seen at a safe distance or in a zoo not to be foolish and walk in among them thinking they won't attack. Treadwell said he would die for "his" grizzlies. Well that he did, duh, and his girlfriend, who in all probability did not share his sentiments as far as dying was concerned. Needless deaths.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Accessible, but disturbing Herzog documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Werner Herzog was given access to a hundred hours of unique footage shot by the Grizzly Man, Timothy Treadwell. He was apparently precisely the right person to be given the responsibility to convert it into a documentary.Or is it all a documentary? The morgue scenes in particular seem to be staged, and are in my opinion by far the creepiest moments of the film. Not because they include any blood, because the film thankfully never does, but because of the immense intensity of the actor. Or doctor.What makes this more accessible than Herzog's other movies, is that he actually tells us explicitly how we should interpret the film: for example, that this is a film about the human psyche, and that nature is chaotic, unpredictable and dangerous - there is simply no flower-power harmony in nature. His voice-overs are excellent, and contribute a lot to making this perhaps the finest documentary I've ever seen. However, his notion that bears are only interested in food and that they cannot in any way relate to humans is in my opinion dubious, although more correct than Treadwell's impressions on this.In sum, Herzog has again managed to make a hypnotic film about decline into madness. Or have we been deceived? With a hundred hours of footage available to him, we can't know to which degree Herzog has given us a representative selection of it. Thus, like his documentary My Best Fiend - although to a lesser degree, Grizzly Man in my opinion also becomes a film about Herzog himself.The excellent music and stupendous shots of nature need to be mentioned as well. This is simply a must-see, but be aware that you'll spend the rest of your week in deep thoughts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Werner Herzog eats his subject</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a fan of Werner Herzog, enough of one to have hunted down a copy of Werner Herzog eats his shoe, back in the day when it was available only as VHS. And I think it's great that he's experiencing a resurgence of interest and relevance (so little of the New German cinema has) and that he's exposing a new audience to his particular and unique personal pursuit of the "perfect image." But there was something unsettling in Grizzly Man, besides the obvious morbidity that ran as a subtext under the film like the soundtrack we all knew we wanted to hear (but shouldn't, because, as the director appeals to Timothy Treadwell's e-girlfriend, 'You must never hear zis,' in a sequence that is the only time we see the director, as if by appearing on screen to validate the horribleness of what's on the videotape, the last reel of Timmy's life, left running while he and his girlfriend are mauled to death, he thinks he demonstrates compassion? Werner have you lost your humanity for a concept of it? And you complain that Timmy's tapes show his girlfriend only twice -- and you show yourself only once? I don't want to jump too far to this conclusion Werner but I think the distance is not far: you betray your fascination by having chosen that moment to appear on camera, and it is precisely the moment you chose to appear that shows that for you the image you seek is detached from human experience, for the image is a concept, and while it may reflect, philosophically, on the human experience, you will remove yourself from society to get it.) Werner's agenda throughout the film seems to be to pull apart Tim Treadwell (as if he hadn't already been pulled apart by bears...) and it's not clear whether or not this is a result of Herzog's encounter with Tim's tapes, due to his fascination with the man's ending, or whether Herzog has an argument with Treadwell's naive and childish love of the animal/ human kingdom. The kid mistakenly embraced the wild, thinking he belonged to it, simply because he couldn't fake it any more in the society of man. But Herzog takes this out on the subject of the film. His compassionate appearance as witness to the taped "murder" (to Herzog, bears can be murderers -- and he accuses Treadwell of projecting?) is false -- it's a cheap attempt to take the subject's side, and it neither goes far enough to establish his sincerity nor far enough to establish his presence as an essayist, not a documentarian. Herzog's instincts as an image maker are among the best in the industry. But his exploitation of subject matter, a criticism wagered many times at his ability to create human tragedy among his actors and crew, is on screen in Grizzly Man, and left me queasy as I'm sure it has done many. This film ought to be refiled. Perhaps under "fictional biography" (next to the movie they'll be making of Frey's Million Little Pieces). Herzog has an agenda, as a filmmaker, and as a documentarian. Does Oprah have a film club?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't know what to expect of this movie before I saw it. I actually didn't even know what it was about. I remembered I had heard praise for it, so I rented it. I figured it would be a pretty typical nature documentary with bears. I was incredibly wrong.In actuality, the film was about a young man, Timothy Treadwell, who spent his summers in the wilds of Alaska "studying" his "friends" the bears. He obviously felt some kind of bond between himself and the bears, talking about them almost as family. However, it's clear nearly from the start that this man was so obsessed with not only studying, but coming in physical contact with these massive wild beasts that he became naive to their danger.It became apparent to me that this man was not quite in his right mind when he began talking about the state park while filming on the beach. He got so passionate about the rangers' "interference" with his studying that he had to shoot several different takes, just because he was so flustered. It became clear that his passion had overtaken his rational thought. It was so sad to watch this story unfold, as Werner Herzog, the narrator and director, slowly informed the audience of the fate of Timothy and his girlfriend. You realize almost from the beginning that Timothy died with the bears. It is precisely how that is so shocking.All in all, this is a spectacularly done movie, one of the best documentaries I have ever seen. I saw it at least six months ago but it still sticks with me, vividly. It's an amazing account of man versus wild and the consequences of not heeding the dangers it can present.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Treadwell was obviously disturbed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I feel that this film doesn't look very deep into the theory that Treadwell is obviously mentally disturbed, and I don't mean "mad at the world". Seeing a 40+ year old man prance about in the woods crying about the death of a baby box, and almost weeping at the sight of a dead bumblebee on a flower is embarrassing. Treadwell talks to the camera as if his audience is a group of 5 year-olds; "Wow, that was a big bear, a big bear, such a very big bear!" It is almost like watching a Saturday Night Live "daily affirmation" sketch with Stewart Smalley, the sappy, weepy, touchey-feely guy. Never in my life have I seen a grown man weeping over the corpse of a baby fox or a dead bug. In my opinion the guy was a fruitcake. And this is coming from a liberal.Yes, I am a liberal naturalist, but I had to cringe seeing Treadwell cuddle-up in his tent with a teddy-bear, talking to bears as if they were 5-year olds "Oh Hellwo there Mr. Chocowate, how are you today?" I can just hear all the Conservative red-neck types turning Treadwell into a poster child for the whole ecology movement, them envisioning us liberal's as a bunch of weepy crybabies who want to run around naked with bears and foxes and everybody living in harmony.And the film also didn't look very much into Treawell being a homosexual, which anyone with any sense could see. He even states he wishes he were gay. Maybe he liked living in the wild with the bears because he would not be judged? The footage was great, and I could see Treadwell had good intentions, but he was obviously mentally disturbed, and his friends in the film also seem to be a bit loony. And I lived in San Francisco for 10 years and have seen it all, but these people are even crazy by SF standards. Like I said, several times it seemed as if I was watching a Mocumentary like "Best in Show". Some of the characters were so strange, especially the coroner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm intrigued and angry, but NOT devastated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot outline says "A devastating and heartrending take on grizzly bear activists Timothy Treadwell and Amie Huguenard, who were killed in October of 2003 while living among grizzlies in Alaska." This is a terrible way to sum up this film. I was in now way devastated, and "heartrending" is just way inaccurate. At the end of this film, I felt nothing (if that sounds completely awful, I'm sorry, but it's honest) for Timothy Treadwell or for all of the people who were close to him and supported him and were so saddened by his death. In fact, the interviewee I found myself relating to the most when it was all over was the one who mentioned that perhaps Timothy was mentally retarded. I think that's a bit of a stretch, but the man was definitely troubled and that is what allowed Herzog to take the footage and make such an interesting film. We see candid moments that were in no way intended for an audience, and through these scenes, we are able to see that Timothy Treadwell was truly an unhappy person who had given himself a very false (however elaborate) sense of self-worth. He is absolutely not protecting these animals in any way. In fact, the one time we see any type of threat to the bears, Timothy hides and films it but states that he doesn't want to give himself away. I can guarantee you that if I ever saw anyone throwing rocks (and quite large ones at that) at a loved one, the last thing I would do would be to hide in a bush while I whispered into a mic about how awful it was. I could be wrong here (I've never been anywhere near a wild bear), but it seems to me that it could possibly be because of someone like Timothy that the bear was even comfortable getting that close to the men. I really can't feel sorry for him or any of those who were greatly saddened by his death but that also supported what he was doing. Aren't we all taught at a young age to keep distance from wildlife so as not to allow them to become too comfortable in close proximity to humans? ...For both the safety of the animals and ourselves? I know I learned it at a very young age and while I may not have perfectly understood it then, I later came to understand that it was extremely important. The curator of the museum states that the natives have adhered to that rule for 7,000 years. Timothy was the intruder, having gone against this. He in no way helped or protected these animals as he claimed to be doing. With of course the exception of the rain that he was able to bring by screaming to "Christ Man", Allah, and "Hindu Floaty Thing" demanding that the give the animals some water. (What an ass!!) It was around this part in the film that we see also that he can't understand / handle that this is how the natural order of things has worked for a good long time now. I chose not to make any comment on the girlfriend that died with him, because I'm not real sure about how I felt about her being with him. This is an excellent film that chronicles the breakdown of a man as he goes to outrageous measures to make himself "happy". He seemed to be a very u8nhappy person, and while it is a shame that he couldn't have been helped rather than wasting years of his life while also breaking the most important rule between man and wildlife, I truly felt no "devastation" or "heartrending". Herzog has done an excellent job of taking the 100+ hours of footage and basically showing it for what it is. Nothing says it better than Herzog's commentary during the scene about 10 minutes from the end where we see a bear smelling Timothy's scent in the air.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*mild spoiler - not really though* It's always interesting to listen to people who are passionate but not well informed about what it is they are passionate about. Mr. Treadwell seemed was not knowledgeable enough about Grizzly bear behaviour to take the necessary precautions. Or perhaps his familiarity bred complacency. It was never clear to me what kind of 'protection' he was offering them, other than simply to raise awareness. But I think useful co-existence includes giving other living creatures their needed space. As the theory in Quantum Mechanics goes, you must consider that the act of observation will have an adverse effect on the outcome of the experiment.What I really observed from his footage is that these bears have the capacity for violent and merciless acts even among their own - how can a human being expect to enter their circle and be entirely safe? But then, instinctively I already knew this.Maybe he wanted to connect on a level that no other human had before with untamed animals. Perhaps there is some nobility in that. I'm sure he believed there was. Maybe it was his way of flirting with danger and feeling alive, some base jump; he bathed with grizzly bears. Although it never seemed like he truly feared attack. Maybe we can walk away from the movie with the romantic notion that he died doing something he truly loved. Otherwise, it could be looked at as a bleak story that leaves many scratching their heads.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film a couple of weeks ago and the most annoying thing for me in this film was that they did not play the sound tape of the Tim Treadwell and her friends death. The only thing they mention about this sound tape was Herzog comments to Jewel Palovak that she should destroy the tape and never listen to it. It would have made this movie complete if the sound tape of the Tim Treadwell and her friends death would have been played in this movie, without the picture only the sound tape playing everyone who would have been interested could have listened the actual sounds of this tragic end to Tim Treadwells life. It would have been possible to play this sound tape after the movie and show a warning sign that if somebody does not want to hear the sound tape after the movie they could leave the movie theater after the movie. This sound tape remains a mystery and probably it has been destroyed so that nobody can ever hear it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have just finished watching 'Grizzly Man' and am still in shock. Although the movie was well made, I can't help to think that it should have been titled 'Look at Me!'. This man was clearly dealing with mental illness, and although I think his intentions were well meaning, I am sure he has done more harm than good to the grizzlies he was claiming to protect by creating a comfort zone for the bears to feel free to approach humans and potentially be killed for getting too close. Had Tim been properly educated on how to observe and document behaviors of the bears, he would known that the best protection for those bears would have been to study them from afar and work with, not against the local park rangers. I must admit, that I initially thought this film was a parody of an actual scientist because I found myself laughing at Tims outrageous and immature behavior not to mention his constant need to like a 'surfer dude'. It seemed that Tim had used the bears as a venue to satisfy his egocentric needs to the point where even a happy face drawn on a rock was conceived to be a direct threat against him! I just can't help to think, that at the end of the day, how sad it is that Tim, and tragically his girlfriend, ended up getting the clearest picture of grizzly behavior. I only hope that the bear that attacked them was spared its life as it was only doing exactly what grizzlies do best...eat and protect themselves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Between Treadwell the maniac photographer; and Herzog his genius editor this film is a work to be reckoned with. Nature at it's realest; man at his most innocent, life: tooth and claw. It's all here.This how it must have been when we were just visitors on a wild planet. Treadwell decides to live in close proximity to some Alaskan Grizzlys in an isolated part of a huge park. He is flown in at the beginning of spring in each of thirteen years, left on his own, and he camps beside the bears. He comes to believe that he is one with them--even that they know and love him as one of their own. Treadwell films miles of film and tape and Herzog edits it for us. We see the Grizzleys close up, not telescopically close up; but, right in with Treatwell, so close we can see the food they're rippling of an elk carcass in between their teeth; and it seems as though we can smell their pungent animal spoor as well. God's terrible beauty is laid out for us.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Grizzly Man What hit me the most was Timothy's behavior, his way of acting. At the beginning he looks like a funny and busy guy, but later in the film you realize that he is someone who has so much trouble expressing himself about his feelings for nature and especially for animals. He has no words that can describe the things he feels for nature and animals.This is a film about a man with a mind so complex, nobody can explain an appearance like this. And although some experts come close to a good explanation for the things he did, and why he loved bears so much, no one can fully understand nor explain this mind, this complex mind.Timothy Treadwell who escaped civilization by living among bears, and he did it for over 13 seasons. What he loved the most became fatal to him, it was love that killed him, love for animals, the urge to protect animals who, perhaps don't need protection, but that isn't what matters, not for Timothy.The bears had given Timothy a reason to live, it was a reason to get up in the morning, it was a reason to dream at night. For Timothy it was live.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the most unique and disturbing qualities of both photography and film is the ability they have of allowing us to see into people's futures before they themselves have had the chance to experience them. We look at images of people frozen in a happier time before a certain personal tragedy has befallen them, blissfully unaware of the fate that awaits them - and, for a brief moment at least, we sense what it must be like to be God and realize what a burden that must be. This feeling of prophetic omniscience haunts the audience all throughout "Grizzly Man," a morbidly fascinating documentary about a man who is quite literally devoured by his own obsession. This is a film that puts its audience into the position of modern day Cassandras, looking on in helpless horror as the subject moves inexorably towards his bitter fate, grimly aware that there is not a single thing we can do to stop the inevitable from happening.Timothy Treadwell earned notoriety and even celebrity status as a conservationist who, for thirteen summers, lived amongst a group of grizzly bears in Alaska. While there, he made "friends" with much of the wildlife in the area, filming his experiences in an effort to draw attention to the plight of these creatures at the hands of poachers and hunters. However, in September, 2003, the bizarre idyll came to a tragic end when Treadwell and his girlfriend were attacked and eaten by a hungry bear. The film, written, directed and narrated by famed moviemaker Werner Herzog, is made up of footage Treadwell himself shot of his adventures in the wilderness combined with interviews with people who knew him or were somehow involved in the post mortem activities.Herzog makes it clear from the outset that Treadwell was always a controversial figure, one who was beloved by fellow conservationists, but treated with, at best, skepticism and, at worst, hostility and scorn by others less favorable to his cause. What we see of the man is alternately inspiring and disturbing. We admire his strong convictions and fearlessness in the face of danger, yet can't help but detect traces of mental illness or at least childish naivete in many of his actions. He is a man constantly testing limits, crossing boundaries and teasing fate. He is often shown interacting with these wild animals with that same air of condescension and sentimentality most people reserve for their benign pets. He names them, talks to them, scolds them, instructs them, cries over them - seemingly convinced that there is some sort of interspecies communication taking place between him and them. We somehow expect someone this knowledgeable about the realities of wildlife to be less susceptible to the temptation - that seems to overcome even the most rational of us - of viewing animals in such intensely anthropomorphic terms. Yet, Treadwell was, apparently, unable to separate himself, either emotionally or psychologically, from the animals he cohabitated with, and he wound up paying the ultimate price for that weakness.As we watch Treadwell's interactions with the animals and listen to the often self-aggrandizing commentary he provides on his own role in the situation, we get the sense that he saw himself, paradoxically, as both a messiah figure for the grizzlies and a sinner who needed to find his own salvation through them. His experiences with the bears seem as much a way of achieving a meaning and purpose for his own life as it is a way of saving them from the threats of an ever-encroaching and hostile civilization.As a master director himself, Herzog is also fascinated by Treadwell's techniques as a filmmaker. He shows how Treadwell, ever the perfectionist and showman, would often film seemingly spontaneous scenes a dozen or more times until he was happy that the final take was the one that would show him off to his best advantage. He would even consciously cover up the presence of the cameraman (or woman) in an effort to make it appear as if he were truly alone on these expeditions.Was Treadwell an environmentalist hero, a self-aggrandizing opportunist or a victim of a bizarre mental illness that allowed him to believe that he was genuinely connecting with the bears on a psychic level - if not a bear himself? "Grizzly Man" raises far more questions than it answers - but, then again, that is what a truly great documentary should be all about.</fullReview>

The lines get messy looking at this question. It took Joe Bini to search through the footage and grab 1 hour and 30 mins from over 100 hrs. It took Treadwell 5 summers to film all these bears. So where does Werner Herzog come in? I think the overall subject matter and the creative choices reflect a very Herzogian film, so we know that Herzog definitely had his artistic hand somewhere in this unique documentary, but it was Treadwell who gave his own life for this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Grizzly Man" (2005): Werner Herzog is one of the world's best film makers. I've followed his career for 30+ years. One of the many interesting things about him is he sees little and no need for fiction. Reality is more accurate &amp; much stranger for his dark, accurate, Germanic opinion of Life. When not reenacting real events for many of his films, Herzog is making documentaries. "Grizzly Man" is a documentary. His three main jobs were to edit &amp; arrange film (which was shot by a man, "Timothy", who decided he should "protect" the Grizzly Bears in an Alaskan National Preserve), interview people involved in the killing investigation and/or who knew him, and work with brilliant musicians to create one of his typically unique, haunting scores. You are put in the position of knowing up front what happened to the man: he was torn apart and eaten by a Grizzly. We then "backtrack" to look closely not at the bears but this man. Like peeling away layers of onion skin, we learn that Timothy was a loser, and in deep denial about it. You will NOT like this guy. He was a liar, a self-appointed expert know-nothing, an alcoholic &amp; drug addict, a dilettante, an empty charmer who convinced a few people he was the Second Coming for them and the bears, an emotional Jekyll/Hyde, a rejected actor-wannabee who found his only "venue" in his self-made video tapes, a deluded fool who related to Grizzly bears as though they were people hiding in bear costumes, a paranoid who needed to create enemies in order to prop up his imagined value, a gay man clearly refusing to acknowledge his own orientation?and that's only the beginning. Herzog makes a layered, insightful documentary from the rough footage of Timothy's footage. It is Unforgettable. Almost everything Herzog has done IS unforgettable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like most of Werner Herzog's films this was worth the hire fee. The bizarre and ultimately sad story of Tim Treadwell's obsession with the bears of Alaska is interesting but I found it hard to sustain interest for 100 minutes.Tim obviously had issues and the main interest point outside of his grizzly demise, is his mental health. The scene where Tim rants at the camera about his enemies and defeating them is amusing and sad at the same time. His self shot video footage makes him out to be a highly annoying character, and maybe in the bears he thought he'd found a world he could be accepted in. The fact that he had an attractive girlfriend whom ultimately followed him to her death, shows that there is always someone for somebody in this world , no matter how outside the mould they are. One feels however that Tim's true love were the bears - a world he longed to become part of but could only ever be an observer. Werner's comment of the bear's indifference to him in the hundreds of hours shot is telling. Tim's alleged connection with the bears I fear was one sided.There is a lot not to like about Tim but Werner attempts to show us the humanity and good side to him as well which is a tribute to his humanity and film making. The film's most powerful but also possibly sensational moment is when Werner listens to the audiotape made of Tim's death. He is obviously horrified but his plea to Jewel (tim's best friend), to not listen to the tape and destroy it is strangely moving.Fascinating story , but maybe could have been culled a bit down time wise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this movie to be worthwhile. It lingers in the mind and imagination and serves as another point of reference for some of life's many conundrums.Timothy Treadwell and Werner Herzog are both entwined in their mutual search for meaning with the Alaskan bear being the unwitting receptacle into which their search is projected.For Treadwell the bears seem to serve as a metaphor for meaning, intimacy, aliveness, self worth and a sense of connection to the mysteries of nature and the universe.For someone who lived as a waiter with a drink problem prior to his epiphany in the wild the bears would seem to become more of a servant to his needs than he realises or intends. His grandiose delusions about his personal role in saving the bears propel him into the role of an archetypal superhero fuelled by his 'special' communion with nature and danger over and above the ken of ordinary mortals such as ourselves. His story is strangely compelling as it probably mirrors our own propensity to delude ourselves, perhaps in less dramatic but no less tragic a fashion.Treadwell is clearly a man in pain and comes across as somewhat hysterical and ungrounded. Yet he also has a lot of the charm of a 'flying boy'. At on point he lovingly caresses the fresh droppings of a bear as if the steaming turd was the most precious thing to his heart. It is almost a perfect image of a man that has resorted to idealising fantasies to escape the developmental tasks of realistically understanding his own 'mess' as an initiation into adulthood. There exists a tension in this dynamic that is both fascinating and disturbing as it probably resonates with us all to certain extent.On the other hand Herzog's commentary concludes that the bear's ultimate killing of Treadwell proves that the universe is not a benign place but a brutal and violent manifestation that we must, by implication, all suffer. His is the voice of supposed realism commentating throughout the film. This is an interesting twist because his voice exemplifies another type of blindness in my opinion. Here the bears serve as a metaphor for Herzog's own sense of isolation from the universe and the rationalised nihilistic and horrific vision that arises from that disconnection.So despite the commitment of both Herzog and Treadwell and the undoubted adventurous spirit that took them on their journeys they both somehow fail to find any sense of resolution, wisdom or peace in their quests. In my opinion Treadwell is mesmerised and enchanted by his own fantasy of the natural world as a benign and loving place. While on the other hand Herzog is caught in his own tendency to collapse the entire spectrum of our existence into the ultimately horrific metaphor that this film presents as a whole.The film then fails to answer any of the questions it poses in a particularly insightful way in my opinion. It does not unravel the complexity of nature or penetrate beyond the obvious and conditional dimension. The unconditional aspects of nature are not touched upon and that lack of inner vision leaves both Treadmill and Herzog floundering around in a disorientated fashion that in fact exemplifies much of our modern life.The film then is rich in metaphor and meaning that I believe touches many who see it and it invites the inquisitive viewer to find their own interpretation. The drama that it plays out is both powerful and compelling and reverberates with the audience on many levels.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Devastating and Profoundly Affecting Documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Grizzly Man" is a mesmerizing but deeply unsettling account of the life and death of Timothy Treadwell, who lived for years with bears in the Alaskan peninsula until he was mauled and killed by one of them. Much of the footage director Werner Herzog has assembled was shot by Treadwell himself; the rest comes from interviews Herzog conducted with Treadwell's family and friends. What results is a disturbing look into the mind of a man who seems to be self-destructing before our very eyes even as he convinces himself that he's engaged in a just and heroic cause.Herzog is obviously as fascinated by Treadwell's behavioral patterns as Treadwell is that of the bears he studies, and so this documentary becomes a complex series of observations: we observe Herzog observe Treadwell observe the wildlife of Alaska. This is enhanced by the fact that Herzog frequently interposes himself into his movie; he will editorialize on a piece of footage or make references to the movie he is making. He makes no attempt to maintain that "fourth wall" between film maker and audience. Therefore, his movie is extremely intimate, at times uncomfortably so.Treadwell fashioned himself as a kind of vigilante environmental crusader. He invented a superhero persona for himself, and he makes it his self-proclaimed duty to protect the bears from a modern world of humans intent on their destruction. In the film's early scenes, he's an amusing eccentric, and there's something charming about his devotion to a cause he deems to be important. But as the film progresses, it becomes alarmingly clear that Treadwell was not a well man, that his self-imposed exile to the Alaskan wilderness was more the result of anti-social tendencies and an almost manic persecution complex than it was his concern for the bear population. And one begins to wonder what good Treadwell was actually doing. He wasn't really protecting the bears from anything; when a group of campers/hunters in one scene are taunting the bears by throwing rocks at them, Treadwell hides in the bushes and works himself up into a rage, but he's powerless to do anything about it. And as many interview subjects throughout the film attest, there was something highly irresponsible about his actions. He seemed unable to respect the line between man and nature. He approached the natural world with the idealistic awe of a child--we see him cavorting with wild foxes, treating the bears like they're cranky but lovable dogs. He claims that he is more in tune with nature than the human world and that this somehow gives him the right to do what he does, yet he seems incapable of dealing with the realities of that world: the sight of a dead bumblebee reduces him to tears.The film's most haunting, chilling scene is the one in which Herzog listens to the tape that recorded the deaths of Treadwell and his female friend. No videotape of the attacks exist, and Herzog, presumably out of respect, does not play the audio portion for his film's audience. But the impact of the tape is made painfully clear nonetheless, and Herzog can't finish listening to it, pleading with Treadwell's one-time girlfriend to destroy it without ever listening to it herself.This is an extraordinary film that any fan of documentaries--or for that matter fans of expert film making--should see.Grade: A+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Werner Herzog's film, Grizzly Man is a powerfully emotional tale about passionate man who may have went to far. Nature and animals were at the heart of good ole' Timothy Treadwell's life. His intense passion for Grizzly Bears gained him fame, and misfortune. Much of the documentary is archived footage, shot by Tredwell himself. Herzog's job was to compile this footage and his own insights and deliver the bizarrely interesting story to the audience, I feel that he did just that and more. Herzog strays away from making a personal opinion on Treadwell instead he focuses on offering the people who will watch the film more to think about. i.e. whether Timothy Treadwell's death was in vain. The film is most likely to strike a nerve in anyone who watches it, if not make them think about sometime after they watch it. The soundtrack is also quality, especially the final song: Coyotes By Don Edwards.</fullReview>

Why he took his girlfriend is a mystery to me, why they cut the arms off the bear that ate him is also something I don't understand. Why was the video camera turned on but the lens cap in place? This is my view on the documentary. What better way to be one with someone you love so much than to give up your entire life for it. He is now one with the bear. I gave it a 10 because he gave his life for what he thought was going to help in the bears plight...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbed Grizzly Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying the I haven't read all of the posts on this documentary so I may repeat others opinions.This is a tragic story of a delusional man. He was running away from failures in his life as an actor, running from drugs and alcohol, and also running from apparent relationship failures.I won't go into all of the details of the movie and my opinions of all of the different facets, I would just like to pose the question of whether this death was staged. And I don't mean that he didn't really die; but did he stage and prepare for this death and cause it consciously? The last video footage is almost a goodbye and as pointed out in the commentary he almost has a hard time getting off of the camera. We have audio footage of the death, but no video. Accident? It wouldn't appear to me to be so. The tragic part is not the loss of his life, but that of his innocent girlfriend.They point out that she was getting ready to leave and leave him for good. He already seems somewhat unstable and unable to deal with people in general except for on his terms. His strange paranoia of other people is the beginning of his unraveling.It just seems strange to me that after saying his goodbye's basically he starts the camera and leaves the lens cap on. I think he wanted to die and he stated several times that he wanted to die by a Grizzly. I think he didn't want people to see him getting attacked and eaten by a Grizzly so he had the video taken out of the equation. I wonder if he did something to provoke that bear into attacking him. I can't postulate on his thoughts of his girlfriend though. I would hope that he would not have wanted her to have been a victim as well. I would say not due to the comments of him yelling at her to leave and save herself. I don't know where she would go or be safe in any case. Apparently the plane showed up shortly after the attack so maybe she would have been safe if she had gone down to the stream. Who knows.I think that he knew he was going to die when he left that airport and went back. He was ill prepared for a hard winter up there. His clothes were in rags as he had already pointed out, he was in a tent. He would have died due to exposure to the elements and the cold specifically. This way, he was able to die the way he wanted to and by his terms.That being the case, I don't feel bad for his death nor do I rejoice in it, but Amy's death in this was a tragedy.This just seems a little strange to me and I thought that I would pose it as a possibility.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Grizzly Man" details the life and events of Timothy Treadwell, a 40+ year old man who lived for thirteen summers in Alaska among grizzly bears. Directed by the great German director Werner Herzog, this film reflects Herzog's perspective almost as much as it does Treadwell's. Herzog tells the story by piecing together footage Treadwell filmed during his period of living among the bears. What comes across is a peculiar and riveting character study. Treadwell's personality reflects itself in extremes. One piece of footage shows him in a lengthy profanity-laden outburst about rapacious human nature, while another bit shows him bubbling in tenderness about a piece of bear excrement that has "just been inside" a particular bear Treadwell is familiar with. Treadwell comes across as a well-meaning but complex poseur who, despite his friends' claims that he "knew the danger" of the bears, seems not to have accepted that the danger was really -- well -- danger!This movie is a very fascinating and tragic study whose effects linger long after the film ends. It leaves us with lots of questions about how we view nature. The only change that Herzog perhaps should have made was that the film might have been more accurately titled "Grizzly Dude" than "Grizzly Man."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful film - but I can't find the duality in this character</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really wanted to find more in this film, but despite Herzog's excellent and compassionate direction, all I really got was a picture of a severely mentally ill individual. Perhaps that's all there is to be found.The perception I'm left with is of Treadwell as drawn to his life out of a desperate urge to be considered special, and eventually falling into madness as comes to believe his own caricature of warrior/bushman. There are a few scenes, where Treadwell is extremely emotional, that are indeed very moving. But the poignancy is in the extremity of the reaction, and I can only assume based on what we learn of Treadwell's bipolar personality type, that the same extreme emotional modulation would result from numerous other events.I have to admit, and I apologise to anyone this offends - that I just didn't like Treadwell after seeing this film. And as a liberal and an environmentalist, I was expecting to fall in love with him. He appeared to me to be profoundly selfish. While his goal was ostensibly the protection of the bears (from what?), I couldn't help but feel the real agenda was self-glorification. I find it too easy to believe, that if it were somehow conclusively shown that it would be in the bear's best interest that he leave, that he would have stayed anyway.I also got the sense that Herzog was on occasion trying to find something that wasn't there, not in a cynical way, but through an endearing and human urge to understand his subject. For instance, in Herzog's commentary on the last recording, he talks about Treadwell's hesitancy in ending his monologue - as if this can be considered foreshadowing. The truth is, throughout the film he showed that same tendency in ending any monologue, because he always wanted to say something that'd make himself look better.Regardless of my reaction to Treadwell, this is a beautiful film. Herzog's direction is both compassionate and even-handed; and he is sufficiently lacking in ego to sit back and let the footage speak for itself on those occasions where narration would spoil things.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Odd</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once again, German director Werner Herzog delves into the mind of a less than normal individual. In GRIZZLY MAN, he provides a somewhat overlong study of a bipolar man with drug and alcohol problems who decides to give himself a new name, uproot himself from family and friends after a failed stab at acting, and go live with grizzly bears. In fact, he declares he wants to become one of them. Predictably, this sad man is eaten by a grizzly. Herzog incorporates footage the man shot with a MiniDV cam with fresh footage of the man's acquaintances, a couple of whom are clearly as daffy as he -- but not daffy enough to go live with grizzlies. The film eventually becomes tedious, as Herzog intermingles footage of the grizzlies -- some of it pretty spectacular but nothing we haven't seen 100 times on Disney and Discovery -- with the guy ranting about society and women and gays and the park service and God and whatever else he can think to yell about. The movie's title is misleading and accurate at the same time: GRIZZLY MAN suggests grizzly bears, and we get plenty of them, but it also contains the word "man" and we get way too much of this unkempt man with his unkempt hair and an even more unkempt mind. In being eaten by a grizzly, did he get what he deserved? A lot of people have said yes. I would simply say he got what he was looking for. He talks incessantly about being killed by a grizzly, and sounds as if he's looking forward to it. Simple as that. There is audio of the guy being eaten, which Herzog declined to include. I could see GRIZZLY MAN being remade with Andy Dick in the lead. Dick would be far less annoying, I assure you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Dark and Beautiful Tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Grizzly Man" is a documentary film by Werner Herzog (narrated by himself) about a man named Timothy Treadwell who for thirteen summers lived among grizzly bears in an Alaskan national park, until he and his girlfriend were eaten by one in September of 2003. Treadwell had taken a camera with him for the last two or three summers he spent there, and had obtained some 90 plus hours of footage of himself with the bears, providing introductions and commentary for what he hoped would eventually become a documentary film about the grizzlies. Ironically, his footage has become a documentary, but it is a very different one than Treadwell would have made. Herzog uses Treadwell's footage almost exclusively (save a few brief interviews with people who knew Treadwell), and creates a vivid, dark, and objective character study of a very obviously disturbed man. Treadwell expressed deep, almost unhealthy, love and admiration for the bears, and the longer he remained with them, the more hostile he became toward human government and civilization in general (we know this because he provides his camera with plenty of angry commentary about park restrictions and people's lack of understanding of the bears' gentleness). Herzog's narration is fascinating - he does not approve of Treadwell and his manic devotion to these wild beasts, and he openly disagrees with Treadwell's belief that nature is harmonious (Herzog believes the common denominator in nature is chaos, hostility, and murder) - and yet he is not hostile toward Treadwell at all. There is almost a sense of admiration for the man's courage and ingenuity.One more thing should be said. When Treadwell and his girlfriend (who apparently didn't want to be there with the bears in the first place, and had written diary entries about her desire to leave Treadwell for good) were killed by a grizzly, he had a camera running, but the cap was still on the lens; this means that there is surviving audio of the attack. Herzog does not let us hear the audio, but instead lets us see him listening to it on headphones. As he listens, he starts to comment on what he's hearing, and then soon becomes too emotional to comment; when he has finished listening, he advises Treadwell's former business partner, who has possession of the tape, to destroy it and never ever listen to it - to which she agrees.This is a wise and beautiful film (indeed, much of Treadwell's footage is simply magical), chronicling the life and work of a bizarre and disturbed man who would have been quite happy to remain among the bears until his dying day. He got his wish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grizzley Man is beyond what filmmaker intended...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I sat down last night to watch Grizzley Man. I must tell you, this is a wonderfully thought out documentary in which the filmmaker put together all the puzzle pieces that is Timmothy Treadwell. He looks at it from a perspective as a fellow human being, not criticizing him as being insane or anything of the sort. He gives you all the information from all sides: parents, girlfriends, coroner, fellow bear enthusiasts, and local interviews. The range of views he has in his film allow for an audience to have a opinion that is just.There are some truths in this story that became apparent to me after watching this film. Once it ended I felt very confused, and that is the opposite reaction that the filmmaker intended. It became apparent to me, the correlation between our 'civilized' society and that of the "seperate" world of bears. We are not so different upon closer examination, and i think that is something that Timmothy had discovered and the filmmaker was to intrigued by his story that he was blind to see.Overall, this is a very touching and sad story of a man who was confused and found sanctuary with the bears. It is definitely worth watching and gets two thumbs up from me. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As ever, Herzog is drawn to danger, even as he warns us against it,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Werner Herzog, a masterful documentarian, has used 100 hours of video footage shot over five summers by Timothy Treadwell to craft an intriguing story of this man, whose fanatical devotion to Alaskan Grizzies led him to take risks that, in 2003, finally resulted in a lethal attack by a bear that killed him and his companion, Amie Huguenard.Treadwell had failed in several career attempts, was for a time strung out on alcohol and drugs, and very likely suffered from either a bipolar or severe borderline personality disorder. He was a social misfit who discovered some peace of mind trekking in the wilderness of the Alaskan peninsula, where he encountered Grizzlies for the first time.Thrilled by these animals, he returned each summer for the next 12 years, usually alone, spending two to three months gradually identifying individual bears within a national wildlife preserve, naming them, approaching them ever more closely, to the point of touching. He also made friends with red foxes, who seemed quite comfortable with Treadwell, unlike the always diffident Grizzlies.Treadwell's videos began during his ninth summer and often feature him talking directly into the camera. Herzog more than once compliments Treadwell's success in shooting interesting scenes (he would do multiple takes of some featuring himself).Herzog's splendidly edited product documents a pattern of Treadwell's increasingly extreme attitudes and emotions about his relationship to the bears. He comes to regard himself as their key advocate and protector. With progressive displays of grandiosity he brags about his cultivated ability to stand up powerfully to the bears, to show no fear, and thus court their respect. In prolonged rants he castigates park officials for not protecting the Grizzlies, leaving the job solely to him.Interviews with park officials and naturalists shown in Herzog's film suggest strongly that there is no basis to such assertions, and that, if anything, Treadwell's presence and conduct possibly could have placed the bears in greater jeopardy by disarming their wariness toward humans.In the end, Treadwell's anthropomorphizing led him to take greater and greater chances: to linger into the autumn of his last visit, after a point the bears who were familiar with him had left the park area, and other, older bears came in their place, one of which attacked and devoured Treadwell and his mate. At least that's the version of the story put forth in the film. An account from another source familiar with the park suggests that the bear who killed the couple was an older animal well known to Treadwell though especially feisty.At one level "Grizzly Man" is an arresting cautionary tale, exposing the hazards of sentimental presumptuousness and runaway zeal that can overtake people's sincere, principled devotion to species preservation and environmental protection (at the extreme edge of which we come to ecoterrorism). The line between justifiable activism and martyrdom versus antisocial destructiveness is sometimes hard to discern.It is also true that psychiatrically disturbed individuals can find solace and meaning through involvement in a social or political movement. Sometimes this works out well. But sometimes trouble arrives when a mentally ill person begins to twist the mission of the movement to serve purely personal, idiosyncratic, or quasi-therapeutic goals.Another subtext concerns Herzog himself, a man who has been attracted to a variety of nearly impossible human feats and eccentric, outrageous people. There are resemblances between the erratic, dangerous, emotionally volatile behavioral paroxysms of Herzog's favorite actor, the late Klaus Kinski, and Timothy Treadwell's behavior (Kinski's antics are well documented in Herzog's 1999 documentary, "My Best Fiend").In two fictional films, "Aguirre:The Wrath of God" (1972), and "Fitzcarraldo" (1982), Herzog insisted on using stupendously difficult and dangerous locations in the Peruvian jungle, and it is widely believed that more than one locally recruited crew worker perished in the efforts. Both films also starred Kinski as the monomaniacal central character.In "Grizzly Man," which Herzog narrates, he is clear in stating that Treadwell's romantic notions about forming meaningful relationships with the bears are not at all supported by any objective evidence. Such relationships, Herzog implies, existed only in Treadwell's feverish imaginings. Herzog also states his own view, that humans have no business rubbing elbows with these animals.Yet Herzog is nonetheless fascinated by this expansive, adventuresome fellow who dares to take such enormous risks. I suspect that an element of identification, of vicarious pleasure, was a strong motive drawing Herzog to expend his creative energies to tell us Treadwell's story. One thing's certain: you'll never get a closer look at a Grizzly than you get in this unusual film. My rating: 8/10 (B+). (Seen on 08/29/05).

		<fullReview>I don't like to call this film a documentary, but rather a snapshot into an important time in one man's life.It will leave you wondering what Grizzly Man really was. What type of person he was. It is a film which will actually leave you with many questions that only you can answer for yourself. The Director did an excellent job of trying his best to gather facts, as well as piece together many hours of footage taken by Grizzly Man into one film. The narration was very short and humble. The people interviewed were few, but offered more clues, not answers, as to why Grizzly Man was what he was. The most interesting part about this film is that it is more of a psychological evaluation, and not a bombardment of facts. I highly recommend that you see this film, but beware it can be a bit dark.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>character study, not caricature</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very simple film about a complex individual. Why a previous reviewer suggests that the film is an exploitive caricature punctuated by staged interviews is beyond me and demands a response.Timothy Treadwell, an actor who never made it in Hollywood, cast himself as a superhero in his own naturalist drama. Herzog is at once fascinated and troubled by his story. He admires Treadwell's commitment and takes issue with Treadwell's cartoonish anthropomorphism of the Alaskan wilderness. All of this is made very clear in the film.Interviews are set in relevant surroundings but there is no indication of lines being fed to the subjects. The coroner, in particular, is suspiciously dramatic. But is this the work of Herzog or of an interviewee's effort to make the most of his camera time? "Grizzly Man" is not a nature film and Herzog shows great restraint by allowing Treadwell's film to tell most of the story. He keeps his own camera in check and focuses on the subject, not Arctic vistas. The subject is Treadwell, a self-obsessed misfit whose tragedy has little to do with bears or nature or preservation. The underlying story is that of a man who cannot escape the feeling of being watched, who creates enemies larger than himself to lend purpose to his narcissism.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Movie About Werner Herzog's Views and Opinions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not a documentary, but a belittling of a man whom Herzog did not agree with, who can no longer defend himself, and a conscious effort to lead viewers to do the same. This is a movie about Timothy Treadwell's death. It is about Werner Herzog taking the life work of a man and twisting it completely away from what the man originally wanted, in order to paint his own narrow-minded viewpoint that nature is a cruel place where man does not belong.Sadly, this is the exact opposite of what Treadwell wanted to come from his tapes, and both Palovak and Herzog should feel deeply ashamed for the creation of this film. The best part of this movie is Treadwell himself (i.e. in the opening scene) and all of the footage he takes, though he is given no credit for it. Treadwell's 6 minute death constitutes only .0002% of the time he spent in the wilderness. And it is that 6 minutes of failure that Herzog so expertly leads the viewer to focus on, leaving the overwhelmingly vast majority of his successes untold.Herzog wants the viewer to think of Treadwell as a madman, someone who "crossed a line," and from the reviews, his obvious tactic worked. Herzog, a film director, spews his psychoanalysis of Treadwell throughout the entire film. He even features an interview with someone who goes as far as to wonder if Treadwell was "mentally retarded." If Treadwell was mentally retarded and crossed the line, you can be rest assured he would have died the first night, week, or month he was there. Instead, Treadwell produced the most documented evidence in the history of man that human and bear can coexist peacefully for long periods of time. 35,000 hours is a long time for a food item to be at the mercy of nature's apex land predator. Dare I say that two humans in each others presence for 35,000 hours might eventually kill each other for even less reason than a bear would? At least the bear was hungry.The scene with the coroner is flat out creepy and has no place in a movie about Tim's life. The scene of Herzog listening to the tape has no place in the movie either, is self-gratifying, and reminds me of someone gloating to other children that he got to see something they didn't. It is incredibly disrespectful to show himself listening to the tape of Treadwell's death, and then saying that nobody else should ever hear it. I cannot even fathom why that was included in the movie other than to shift the focus to the director, rather than subject, once again.Herzog claims in later interviews he didn't want to make a snuff film yet that is basically what he did anyway. He features a long winded description from the coroner of exactly what happens on the tape. Was it really necessary to include the details of what happens when a bear decides to eat a man alive? Is that what Treadwell would have wanted his documentary to be about? Herzog's slow speaking, condescending voice constantly interjecting is irritating at best, ruinous at worst. He interjects his viewpoint about nearly everything he shows Treadwell doing, and at that, he only picks the most unflattering scenes of Treadwell, such as when he gets vitriolic about the park rangers. The viewer can be rest assured that Herzog himself has never had an outburst of anger. The inclusion of Treadwell's most private video recordings are incredibly disrespectful. Do not for a second think Treadwell would have included them in his own movie, and it is akin to bullying a dead person that Herzog decides to expose them. And strangely, Herzog was in one of the most densely populated bear areas in the world, yet makes no attempt to film a bear himself. The most tragic thing to me is that it was Jewel Palovak who Treadwell left in possession of his life's work, and that she chose such a biased producer to make the video. Her decision to have Herzog make the movie shows that she was not a friend at all. Let me leave you with a quote from Treadwell to Palovak: "If I die, if something happens to me, make that movie. You make it. You show 'em." Way to go, Palovak. You really found someone to show 'em.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You may read reviews and news stories that refer to the subject matter of this film as an in-depth study of a passionate environmentalist's quest to protect the ursine denizens of an Alaskan grizzly habitat.I'm here to tell you that this is a flick about a crazy dude that gets eaten by a bear.Others may say that the subject of the film, Timothy Treadwell, while a tad eccentric and misguided, gave his life in a dramatic attempt to teach the world how misunderstood the grizzly is; that his child- like fascination with the grizzly bear, in addition to various other wildlife in Alaska's Katmai National Preserve, was both beautiful and admirable. I've read many reviews in the last hour maintaining that Treadwell spent the final thirteen years of his life trying to send a message of compassion for wildlife everywhere and the sanctity of the land on which they live.I'm saying that the only message I took away from this guy was: Grizzly Bears Eat People! Don't Invade Their Space and Poke Them and Stuff, or They Will Kill You and Your Girlfriend!As for Treadwell's message, it's garbled at best. Personally, I always thought that grizzly bears might eat me. Turns out I was right, so I'm not sure I see how I've ever misunderstood the nature of the grizzly.If you've been wanting to see this film, or want to see it now that you've heard that an environmentalist gets eaten by a bear, please don't avoid it because you think I've spoiled the ending or didn't like it. They tell you about Treadwell's demise at the beginning, and I really did enjoy the story. Herzog's editorial asides undermined the documentary feel of the film for me, but who am I to argue with a guy that dragged a steamboat over a mountain?Spoilers below...What gets me about this Treadwell guy is that the film, for whatever reason, never really talks about how delusional he is. College dropout, failed actor, former drug addict. That's apparently what qualifies him to be a wildlife expert. He goes out into the woods every summer and hangs out with bears and foxes, then he talks to them in this Mister Rogers, sing-song voice, and pretends that they're his friends. To his credit, the foxes actually seem to dig it, but at no point in 100 minutes of film does any bear in his vicinity appear to view him in a welcoming manner. They don't let him touch them, all but the cubs keep their distance, and many of them seem pretty annoyed.If there had been a thought balloon above the head of any bear in "Grizzly Man" I imagine it would have said, "The minute we run out of fish, I'm eating the weirdo with the camera."My point is that Timothy Treadwell had issues. Viewing him as an authority on grizzly bears and wildlife conservation, as many people apparently did and was never discounted in the film, is like seeing Hugh Laurie as an authority on diagnostic medicine. Timothy Treadwell was a figment of his own imagination; a character in an elaborate, self-obsessed fantasy. I think "Grizzly Man" takes him entirely too seriously as an activist.Treadwell goes on at length in the film about how he sees himself as the protector of the Katmai grizzly, and that it's a role he takes very seriously. "I would die for these animals," he states with a show of emotional conviction.Yet during the only segment in the film where one of his grizzly friends is being harmed by humans, Treadwell hides in the bushes and sounds on the verge of tears, unwilling to reveal himself. These guys, whom Treadwell refers to as poachers, were standing around a boat taking pictures and throwing rocks at a nearby grizzly. Treadwell does nothing. It appeared to me that while he was horrified at the way the bear was being mistreated, he was more threatened by the intrusion of other humans into his fantasy world, and was too frightened to do anything about either.It's a sad story. Yes, partly because this kind-hearted guy and his girlfriend get gobbled up by a bear. But also because Treadwell really seemed to need help. A handful of "dear friends" were interviewed for the documentary, and I'm left wondering if these people had pointed out that he was acting like a wackjob, he may have avoided spending his final moments as a 6-foot chew toy.Tim Treadwell really seemed like a sweet guy with a caring circle of friends. It just seems to me that he deserved better in their hands...Good flick. Check it out.</fullReview>

The controversy over the veracity of the released excerpts from that tape is a great post-modern joke. Or not.The most revealing part of the character comes from about 60 mins in, when he keeps referring to his sexuality. And conveniently his female companion remains mysterious, while the director chimes in with an excuse for not finding this crucial piece of the puzzle. And then we're told the guy was a failed actor.It's a deceptive piece of film. And, I suspect, a clever cover for bestiality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Grizzly Man", should be a documentary that by many standards shouldn't work this well. Of course there's enough substance to make a decent enough made-for-television kind of documentary, and Discovery channel sought of did with the follow up "The Grizzly Man Diaries" in 2008. But thanks to the exceptional craft of Werner Herzog, who extracted more than 100 hours of footage shot by Timothy Treadwell. Makes "Grizzly Man" one of the best documentaries of the 2000's you should definitely see.Timothy Treadwell, a man known of questionable mental health in the past. Spent 13 summers in Katmai National Park and Preserve, Alaska studying bears. Over time he believed the bears trusted him, and would allow him to approach them, sometimes he would even touch them. Treadwell continued to document his time with them in order to raise public awareness and then return back to the park, despite repeatedly being warned by park officials that his interactions were unsafe to both him and to the bears. Tragically in 2003 at the end of his 13th visit, he and his girlfriend Amie Huguenard were attacked, killed and partially eaten by a bear. After getting various permissions from Timothy's closest friends and fellow enthusiasts, Herzog crafts and narrates his movie. Barely scolding Timothy for any of his actions, Herzog's interests are showing what Timothy was striving for and interviewing those closest to him. My favourite moments is where Herzog comes to admire many of the shots that Timothy created, and his constant retakes show some elements of a natural film-maker. Unfortunately as the film progresses, there really is no small sign of common sense in Treadwell's mind that his encounters with these animals will inevitably kill him. As Herzog expertly deduces that when looking into the eyes of an animal, all you can see is the cold, indifference of nature (Remember that Herzog's exploits in the Jungle are legendary).Final Verdict: The wildlife footage Timothy shot is pretty dam fantastic and Werner Herzog does justice to a man's work, albeit a reckless one. Everything is done in respect and I thoroughly recommend it. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Werner Herzog has created something truly brilliant here. Timothy Treadwell, a crusader for Grizzly bears, puts his life on the line for his love of these magnificent animals. This documentary details his life and mission right up until the fateful day where he and his girlfriend were attacked and killed by a rogue grizzly.Whether or not you agreed with what Treadwell was doing, you have to admire his passion. The documentary details this passion perfectly and you get the impression that he feels more connected to the animals he was studying, over human beings, but unfortunately tested the boundaries a bit too much, ultimately paying with his life. Its a sad tale of one man's mission to do what was right, but underestimating the power of nature.Herzogs non biased approach allows the viewer to make their own mind up about this unique human being, which makes it a brilliant film from a brilliant filmmaker!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Man Laid Bare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If a tree falls in the forest, and there's no one there to hear it, does it make a sound? Consequently, if a bear enthusiast is attacked by a grizzly in the Alaskan woods, and no one is there to save him, do his bloodcurdling screams register? Because of Werner Herzog's documentary Grizzly Man, Tim Treadwell's screams do echo, for Herzog has given Tim Treadwell life after death. Treadwell's fascinating story of addiction and obsession raises questions about human interaction with wildlife, and Herzog's compelling documentary paints an absorbing picture of a kind yet troubled, foolhardy yet sympathetic environmentalist. Tim Treadwell and his girlfriend, Amie Huguenard, died in the Alaskan wilderness in 2003 after an attack by one or more grizzly bears. Treadwell's video camera was capped at the time, but its microphone was on, and captured the final, terrifying audio of Tim and Amie's lives. The attack ended thirteen seasons of Treadwell studying brown bears in the wilds of Katmai National Park. Herzog has combined his own interviews of Tim's friends and family with Treadwell's original footage to create a profile of a troubled man with a death wish who nonetheless is an inspiring individual trying to find what he believes is his place in this world. Treadwell swims with the bears; he talks to and names the bears; he stands his ground against the bears; he shares the bears' habitat; he ascribes human qualities to the bears; he believes he protects the bears; he spookily, presciently talks to the camera of the possibility of being eaten by the bears. The conversational style of the film is a result of Treadwell's openness, and a byproduct of spending summers largely without human contact. Tim treats the audience as a silent therapist as he details his struggles with alcohol, drugs, and society. The film builds to the final summer of Treadwell's life; the climax is of course not the revelation that Treadwell died, but the fate of that final audio recording. Werner Herzog, early in his career, brought fictional stories of obsessed madmen to life in films like Fitzcarraldo and Aguirre, The Wrath of God. In the second half of his filmmaking career, Herzog has largely turned to documentaries, winning positive reviews for documentaries such as My Best Fiend, Into the Abyss, and Cave of Forgotten Dreams. Herzog gravitates to enigmatic characters on the fringes of society, and Treadwell is seemingly tailor- made for his film. Herzog attempts to understand Treadwell by interviewing his grieving friends and adversarial Alaskan citizens, but Treadwell proves to be a perplexing subject who defies simple categorization. Herzog's respect for Treadwell as a filmmaker comes through clearly?his footage is terrifying and fascinating, especially a heavyweight grizzly mating season battle which is followed by Treadwell piously worshipping the expelled excrement of the defeated bear. Which is more enthralling: the fight itself, or Treadwell's bizarre reaction to it? Always Herzog's examination of Treadwell's life's work is measured?for every scene which presents Treadwell as a hermit more at home with the bears than with humanity, there is a scene that shows his talent for nature filmmaking and his unique communion with the bears. Tim seems so alive in the footage, so brimming with passion for the bears, that it seems impossible that he is dead, that the ignorant bears mauled and consumed their compatriot, their champion, their savior. This brutal irony is Herzog's comment on the unknowable wild: the bears don't recognize Tim's friendship or worship; they recognize that they're hungry and he is food. The mournful orchestral music that accompanies much of the film helps build to the tragedy of Tim and Amie's deaths. In particular, the song Coyotes, about a man who abandons modern trappings, perfectly captures the loss of Tim's life that results in the fulfillment of his dream. The overwhelming question at the center of Herzog's film is whether Treadwell's death is truly a tragedy. Many Alaskans believe that Treadwell merely got what was coming to him, and that it was a miracle that he survived as long as he did all those summers with the bears. The film is not about the predicament of the bears, which are hunted both legally and illegally in Alaska, but about Treadwell's purpose. Herzog allows Treadwell to paint a picture of himself, from his own footage, and that completed picture is of a deeply troubled soul in need of saving. His life was extraordinary. His responsibility for Amie was neglected. His end was inevitable. Nonetheless, Treadwell's death is a tragedy, for though he knew the risks of living weaponless in the wild with grizzlies, he was a misguided man whose heart was in the right place. Tim's battle was always within himself; it was not lost in Alaska, but long before, when his alienation from society began. His death afforded him the answers he sought. The larger tragedy is the loss of Amie's life. She followed a world-weary fool into the wilderness, believing he could keep her safe. For Tim to risk his own life is his right; to risk Amie's was gratuitously irresponsible.Wisely, Herzog spares the viewer Tim and Amie's final minutes, but he spares little else in his portrait of Treadwell. Grizzly Man is a unique film, assembled from footage never intended to be used as Herzog has employed it. Some must consider Herzog a pirate?he's looted Tim's video and pillaged his agenda, but in doing so, he's made a film that will last as an honest memorial to Treadwell's gentleness, commitment, passion, and madness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great story, poor direction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story of naturalist Treadwell is easy to predict. By now, I don't think it is a spoiler to tell the ending. However, 40 years from now, someone may read these reviews, and not know.Treadwell felt a deep sense of companionship for the grizzly bears. He felt this upon an encounter with one. He didn't realize that just as one human can differ from another, so might one bear.Treadwell made some serious errors. He was on a quest, a quest for his place in life. His search made for some tribulations for himself and his girlfriend. It's sad that she suffered so much along with him, but he obviously didn't mean for her to suffer. He was incorrect in some assumptions. I challenge any man to be a perfect judge, to be correct in all assumptions. I challenge any man to predict the exact score of every NFL game for the next season. If one is to suffer for error in judgment, then all of us are prone to that judgment. It is unwise to judge Treadwell for his lack of proper judgment.He is a fascinating character. There was a TV special made just before the release of this film, which was much better than this film.That's because the TV special aimed at a focus on Treadwell himself. No other personalities, save those involved in the story. It was documentary style story telling about his trials and tribulations.Here, the narrator invokes his presence into the story for absolutely no purpose. He seems to just want to be in front of the camera, and it looks goofy. Treadwell was looking for support. The narrator here comes across as one who isn't cast in a play, but decides to walk across the stage and improvise his own lines.That's the weakness here. However, the fascination of Treadwell's story is passionate enough to carry this film past a director who is at his best in mechanics and craft, and whose weakness is in the inspiration of Humanity. A documentary about an inspired person is not the forte of Herzog. His forte is the hate of inspiration of a character like Aguirre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If only he died earlier in the movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is nothing interesting about this guy who lost his mind and decided to live in bear country. It is kind of sad, but more then anything it is really boring. Even the supposedly emotional part of the movie when his parents were talking about this dead son, they barely flinch. The father does not even take the time to put on his indoor glasses and looks like he wants the interview to end cause he is boring himself... Then there is this supposed decent into madness... The truth is he was already "mad" or at least a non functioning person of society before his bear love. However, he did the noble thing and when to live in the wood... That is a good cure for alcoholism which seemed to be his big issue. Then there was his internal regret of getting kicked out of University.... And then there is the fact that he is clearly a self hating homosexual. But after all that time in the woods he cant even be honest with his friend the fox and just admit that next to bear ass, man ass is what he really wants. If anything he should have died earlier in the documentary and a little footage of the bear attack would have been good addition...That might have bumped Grizzly Man up to a 3 or a 4 star.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but weird</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why is glorifying the insane and stupid an American obsession over the last couple of decades? The documentary Grizzly Man does not attempt to answer this query, yet it does its best to bring this tendency to its odd apogee, and is literally unlike any other documentary film I've ever seen. Coming off his participation in the great mockumentary Incident At Loch Ness, it should not come as a surprise that German filmmaker par excellence, Werner Herzog, would stick with the documentary format in this, his latest film. No, it is not a nature documentary, as most film critics, including Roger Ebert, have written, simply because it follows a man who spent thirteen consecutive summers filming grizzlies on an Alaskan wildlife refuge, Katmai National Park, on Kodiak Island, but a documentary whose subject matter is a man's flaming insanity, as it charts the life and death of a fey, severely mentally ill blond man with a Prince Valiant haircut, originally from Long Island, New York, named Timothy Treadwell, who spent summers filming bears, and the rest of the year going to schools, showing his films freely. I get tired of books and films devoted to the worst in society- the insane, criminal, selfish, greedy, shallow, etc. While watching the tale of this supposedly reformed drug addicted alcoholic-cum-New Age weirdo, I could not help but compare his life and death to that of another deluded narcissist who perished over a decade earlier than Treadwell, also in the wilds of a Alaska- Chris McCandless, whose delusions of being one with nature led to his death in 1992, chronicled in adventure writer Jon Krakauer's bestselling book Into The Wild. McCandless was another bored, spoiled, upper middle class white boy whose easy life was seen as something 'terrible' to deal with. So, he bummed around the country, using many aliases- including Alexander Supertramp, until he decided he would go and rough it in the Alaskan wilds, alone and ill-prepared. That he ended up starving to death in an abandoned bus made him a hero to addle-minded nature buffs, and a target of scorn to Alaska natives who respect nature, and resent twits like McCandless being seen as anything other than the fools they were. Yet, Treadwell was worse, and his end even more ignominious, because not only did he get himself killed and eaten by a bear, but also his 37 year old blond girlfriend- Amy Huguenard. And, when he died in 2003, Treadwell was 46 years old, while McCandless was only half that age upon his death in 1992.Yet, there is no denying Treadwell, was mentally unhinged, even as Herzog rapturously declaims his filmic abilities with a camera, and imbues the most banal shots with an intent and skill that just is not there on screen, lacking any real style. Herzog must have had to tell himself this to justify his fascination with Treadwell's bizarre antics?. I would have cut the film thirty to forty of its one hour forty-five minute running time, because much gets repetitive. This is a film worth seeing, but only if you bear in mind the wisdom of one of the helicopter pilots who flew home the duo's remains. He calls Treadwell a retard, then states, 'He was treating them like people in bear costumes. He got what he deserved,' a statement echoed by a Native American Kodiak Island museum director, who says, 'My people have been living nicely with bears for thousands of years and we know enough to stay out of each other's way.'That Treadwell did not only begs the question I opened this review with- why does Herzog feel this man's stupidity and idiocy are worth glorifying in film? Especially when he clearly believes Treadwell's philosophy is wrong. Where Treadwell sees cuddly things he'd die for, cooing he loves them, even as he actually taunts the bears, as if they were stuffed animals, like the teddy bear he sleeps with in his tent, Herzog sees indifferent creatures who could make a meal out of you at any time, and we see a well meaning idiot, the New Age nuts that revere him, and a film that is perversely fascinating. Ah, the answer!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting biography of a man that crossed the boundaries...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recap: Well, the footage and life of Timothy Treadwell, a self-named eco-warrior and grizzly enthusiast that spent most of his summers living close and intimately with his friends, the bears, and a camera. And ultimately he met his final fate in an encounter a little too close with one of the bears.Comments: First of all, forget every thought of this being a documentary about bears or the life of bears. This is a documentary and biography of Timothy Treadwell. Sure, much of what is shown, and what can be learned about Treadwell, is in the conversations and interaction he has with the bears. Most of it is his own footage. In between shots, the narrator Werner Herzog has interviewed family and friends that offer a little more insight into the background and life of this remarkable man.Because you may think whatever you want about Treadwell and his quest to live with and protect the bears, but none the less, remarkable he was. I found it very refreshing that the documentary itself was objective all the way, never being biased, and never openly praising Treadwell without merit - as might have been expected in a documentary of late eco-warrior. The documentary shows opinions and facts from all point of views letting you yourself make up your own mind what to think about Treadwell.It is clear that Treadwell was a complex character, not satisfied with himself all the time either. This he says in scenes of retrospection and reflection of his earlier life. He also shows a both humoristic and serious side in all the different takes he makes of one and the same scene. It is painstakingly clear that he crossed a boundary, right or wrong, I can't say. He did manage to come extremely close to some bears and foxes that led him to land some spectacular scenes. But it also led to his death.Luckily, his death (revealed right from the start, by the way) is not shown or played (although he manage to capture it on audio). Out of respect to Treadwell and his girlfriend Huguenard that shared his fate. But also, in some way, to preserve the persona that Treadwell carefully built over such a long time. I'm not sure if Treadwell was really aware of the danger he constantly was in. He often speaks of it, and says that he must be strong to overcome and master those situations. At the same time he behaves blissfully ignorant of them. He also states, repeatedly, that he love bears, will die for the bears. But not by a bear. Other times he says that it is in the wilderness he wants to die. Finally he did.My final conclusion of this movie is that you may think what you want about Treadwell. But whatever you think, this documentary captured his life - and it was very capturing to watch. This documentary really touched me, and I think most of us shared that experience - his experience.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bizarre dichotomy...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is the man Timothy Treadwell, and a fascinating subject for a movie. Although 'Grizzly Man' features bears, foxes and other animals in amazing wildlife footage, you find that it turns out to be more about Timothy than his self-styled peers. Going beyond that, it's more about all of us.I get the feeling most people, on viewing this film, would have one of two reactions - perhaps depending on your politics or world-view. One is, "What a brave/noble man!", for standing up for what he believed in so strongly, even unto death. The other is, "What an impossibly stupid man!", for ignoring and taunting the dangers he knew so well in his head. The strange thing is, I can see both viewpoints - and it reminds me of how my own ideals don't mesh with reality. He's more like us than most of us will admit, just to an extreme.Treadwell fashioned himself as a preservationist, standing up for the bears who could not speak for themselves. He did teach many children and others about their plight, which is undoubtedly helpful. Problem is, most of the bears he 'protected' were in national parks and not in much danger from humans, aside from necessary and controlled huntings. He became more of a Don Quixote figure, more tragicomic than effective. Most of the experts in the movie believed he may have done more harm than good.The bears became his family/friends, or so he thought. I actually thought he had a bit of the right idea early on - if you are going to try to stand up to them, intimidation/confidence would be important. Perhaps the bears sensed that he had that confidence, and that's why he survived so long. Perhaps it's like one of the contributors said, and they thought he was 'brain damaged' and not worth the trouble, or perhaps he got lucky. Probably a combination.And I find that combination is something of a parallel to our coexisting/struggling with nature, something most environmentalists don't acknowledge. Nature is beautiful, but harsh. You only see the bleakness and pain, and you'll miss the wonders there, like the awesome foxes that befriend Timothy. At the same time, to romanticize it is to do a disservice to truth. No matter how much Treadwell loved that bear, it remained hungry, and he was a convenient food. Keeping the balance in your thinking is the key, and the difficulty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tragic comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Grizzly Man' is a wonderful documentary by Werner Herzog. It is largely compiled of footage shot by Timothy Treadwell. This is a man who spent thirteen summers living with Bears out in the wild. Originally my thoughts of him were "brave man". However, as the film progresses you can't help but feel sorry for, what essentially is, a deluded, lost individual. His descent into drink and drugs resulted from being rejected as Woody in the show cheers. It's facts like this that had me laughing. Werner Herzog's voice also adds to the unintentional comedy. His death is sad, but the death of his mysterious girlfriend is even more tragic.At times this feels like a Chris Morris 'Mockumentary' but there are some genuinely eerie scenes of Treadwell. A man we know comes to an horrific end. Despite how bizarre I found him to be, it's comforting that in his last act he tried to save the life of his girlfriend. There's something unnervingly inevitable about Timothy Treadwell.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another fine film by Herzog</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The folks who snipe at Timothy for "getting what he deserved," including Sam Egli, no matter how they may phrase it, are just simply wrong. I believe they missed one of the major points of Herzog's film.Timothy's demise was an aberration. He and Amie died very simply because Timothy broke his own well-established guidelines to a very significant degree, perhaps intentionally. It's certainly possible, and perhaps even likely, that this intention was nothing more than another of his many passing fancies which had set upon him in the heat of the moment. I suggest that anyone who opines that this was his inevitable fate for hanging with wild grizzlies, including Mr. Egli, go back and re-watch the film and, in particular, the last ~15 minutes of the film. And this time, pay a little more attention to Herzog's commentary so that you can have the facts in hand.Timothy had finished his summer as per usual and thus flown out of the bush and to the airport for a flight back to what we call civilization. He then proceeds to get into a hassle with some airline person who questions the validity of his ticket. And so (surprise surprise) Timothy goes off the deep end and goes BACK into the bush.I obviously don't know what he was thinking when he went back to The Maze. Maybe he was just going to spend a few days until his ticket situation got straightened out or maybe he was going back to die there because he couldn't bear (hey, I made a pun!) the thought of actually going back to civilization.Whatever the case, this was an obvious and significant deviation from his prior well-established pattern of behavior. He'd never stayed there this late in the season before and he clearly didn't intend to spend the winter there. Ya can't expect to winter over up there in a tent.So why did he go back? Well, I dunno and I don't know that anyone else knows. But I think that question is largely why Herzog made this film.The bottom line is that his death was a proximate result of this deviation from his normal pattern of behavior. He died very simply because he put himself into a very high risk situation that was way outside his normal summer routine living amongst his "own bears." Did you watch the film, people? He clearly says that those bears over there (at The Maze) aren't his own bears! He says he wishes he could take Mr. Chocolate along to help him out with those bears over there.If Timothy had caught that flight back to civilization, I would expect that he would still be living amongst his bears. I saw absolutely no indication to the contrary. I don't know how he was able to do it, but there ya have it. Thems just the facts, folks. He had clearly been accepted by his bears (or at least tolerated by them) and I'm quite sure that if he had simply stuck to his normal routine, he'd have been fine. There was ALWAYS the risk that even one of his "own bears" might turn on him in the right situation. But I think he pretty much knew his way around and could have avoided that if he really wanted to. Whether he would have continued to WANT to is another question; and, again, I think this is largely why Herzog was interested in him. Timothy says he had no life before the bears and has no life but for them. Is it surprising to think that maybe he'd finally just had enough of civilization and just couldn't hack the thought of another winter with the humans? He did seem to be a tad impetuous, don't ya think?Note that at one point he's even hanging with The Grinch while she's clearly working on a kill behind him. And he gets away with it! (notwitstanding that she does give him a bit of a signal to "Back off, Jack!"). That's a high-risk situation for sure. My own beloved Golden once growled at me when I tried to take a bone away from him. This is Mother Nature, after all, and there ARE some rules.So Timothy broke the rules -- his own rules -- and he got what was to be expected. So in THAT sense, he DID "get what he deserved." But not in the way Egli and some commentators here thought. The real question is: "Did he get what he wanted (or expected)?" I think he did -- at least at some level and at that particular moment in his life. And this was clearly a guy who lived in the moment.Tim was very simply taken out by an old bear who's time had come. He had failed to build up sufficient fat reserves to survive the winter and he knew it. While the rest of the bears were well into hibernation mode, he was still hard at work very late in the season Desperately Seeking Susan or anyone else who might be the answer to his prayers. Did you notice him diving for already-dead salmon at the bottom of the creek? This was a guy in major desperation mode. The salmon run was over and he was too old to hunt effectively anymore. He was definitely in Dire Straits and I'm pretty sure he knew it.And then along comes Tim and Amie. That old bear must have really thought his prayers had indeed been answered. But for that Simple Twist of Fate with the ticket, we most likely wouldn't even be having this conversation. But I think Tim was fully aware of the risk.Whatever else you may think of him, and whatever else he may have been, Timothy Treadwell was an amazing guy who did amazing things and had amazing courage.9+/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I consider myself an environmentalist, and for the past few years I've been championing the return of wolves to my home state. I'll get letters or emails from someone stating how mystical wolves are, and how they would never hurt someone. I answer back that wolves, like cougars and grizzlies, are animals trying to survive in a violent world; that as carnivores or omnivores, they eat meat, and yes... we're meat. This simply the way of things, not good nor bad, and when appreciating the animal one needs to be aware in order to not become food.It's a lesson learned too late by Timothy Treadwell. His friends know it in truth, which you can discern by carefully listen to the dialog of this film. Friends of Amy, Timothy's doomed girlfriend, state that she was at home in the wild and knew what she was doing. Yet, in Timothy's diary, it's mentioned that Amy threatened to leave him, and that she was fearful of the bears and was convinced that Treadwell had a death wish.Timothy Treadwell was a man very much in search of himself, even to the point where he had to imagine up personas for himself. Bears and other wildlife on the other hand are brutally, fundamentally honest.Perhaps this is what killed Timothy Treadwell. This record of his life and death should be required viewing by anyone interested with working with large carnivores in the wild.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Treadwell Killed Bears</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Grizzly Man is very ironic in pointing out the fact that instead of saving the bears that Treadwell loved, he ended up having them killed since the bears killed him, thus showing no respect for the beast. Not only did he cause the animals to be killed, but he desensitized these grizzlies to the human presence which could lead to additional contact between man and beast and could possibly create more undue harm to the bears. In his selfishness he indirectly caused the death of his girlfriend-who I might add also lacks reasoning for even being a part of his cupcake "research"-and Treadwell's prideful, ignorant personality is put on full display in Grizzly Man. Treadwell is a disgrace to the Grizzly and should have been locked up in a padded room long before he could bring undue harm to another human and these powerful beasts. Insanity never breeds rational and Treadwell is a prime example.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the more engaging documentaries I've seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion this movie was a ten. I watched it on TV. It was three hours with commercial breaks but it kept my interest the entire time. In these days of shorter and shorter attention spans, it unfortunately rare that something that long can keep my attention.The story of Timothy Treadwell is both fascinating and sad at the same time. It is really (as Herzog) points out , a story about what's inside of all of us. Treadwell comes off as an eccentric nut at times but you can't stop watching him. The longer I watched, the more I thought about how different I would be if I was in Treadwell's situation. I think that if I was living for half a year in the wilderness by myself while trying not to be killed by bears and trying to avoid the Forest Service then I would become slightly paranoid, angry, talk to myself and come across as a nut to the outside world.More then a documentary, this is a compelling story. Herzog is not strictly a documentary filmmaker and his stamp is strongly imposed on this film telling the story that he wants to tell. Even more the Herzog's influence, it's also hard to determine where Timothy Treadwell the character is separated from the man inside. He was certainly "on" whenever he had his camera turned on. He wanted to escape reality and you can see him actively trying to shape what the rest of the world saw in his videos.All and all, this is as close to perfect as any movie I've seen in a long time. I highly recommend it to anyone regardless of whether you have any interest in bears, nature, Treadwell or Herzog. This movie will engage just about anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Thin Line Between Genius and Insanity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One must ask why, why does someone go out into "nature," out into an area without man's society and "man's nature" and decide to associate with brown bears? Why? This question I believe is what defined Treadwell and his personal society for 13 years. Ironically, what really killed him indirectly was society, a society in which he did not fit and which found him mentally abnormal.Was this man abnormal? Clearly, his view on life, nature, and idealism versus reality differ from the rest of us. However, he tapped into a level of personal discovery and spirituality that but a few seem to find in their time on Earth. To find happiness is a tent collapsed by rain, or by shoving his hand in a pile of bear poo clearly asks what does one want out of life? People say it is the little things in life that give us the greatest satisfaction.I think Treadwell took his life, which he felt needed a change to have meaning, and found it. Needless to say, no one else before or sense has been able to spend such an up-close and personal interaction with wild animals deemed "man-eaters" and find them to be merely ten-foot tall furry neighbors.Such personal satisfaction with something so seemingly crazy brings up the point of genius and insanity. It is said that they are divided by only a thin line, and that what some people consider pure genius is propped up by a level of insane behavior and a lifestyle which people just shake their head at in disbelief and disgust.I guess this is why man classifies people into simple to comprehend categories such as liberal, conservative, smart, stupid, normal and weird. Whatever Treadwell intended his legacy and lasting image to be, I view him not as a bad or stupid person, but as someone who found something deep within life that the rest of us cannot find or deduce by watching this film, but can be made aware from this film that man's primordial connection with nature has never left us, but lies buried deep within us, found and used by but a few.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really liked it for reasons that most people probably don't agree on. I thought the movie was funny. Yes thats right funny. The people that were interviewed were so bizarre and larger than life. Especially the coroner, that guy was a freak. Throughout the movie me and my friends were just cracking up at the insanity of Timothy Treadwell. But later when we were discussing the movie in a more serious perspective did we see how sad it really was. The man was in a different world that you or I and no one that was close to him could stop him. There is no doubt about his love for the bears, but he was horribly deluded and had some fantastic image of himself being bear communicating superstar. This movie is a must see documentary. Timothy Treadwell is someone you will never forget.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Was this crusade ever really about the bears?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Werner Herzog examines the life and death of self-proclaimed Grizzly bear researcher and protector Timothy Treadwell in this fascinating documentary. I had never heard of Timothy Treadwell until he made the news by being eaten by a grizzly bear. The news story I read made the most of the irony of concerning Treadwell's death, and, to be honest, I sought out this film hoping that it would serve as a punch line to what I considered to be the worst, most simplistic aspects of the environmental movement. In a sense, "Grizzly Man" was exactly that, but it was also something more: a penetrating examination of a sad, mentally-unbalanced man desperate to find meaning for his own life. It is easy to make fun of Treadwell, but I couldn't help but feel sorry for a man who felt so disconnected to his society, and indeed, his own species, that he felt the need to become something else. Sadly, nature didn't prove as kind and serene as he imagined.Herzog was an excellent choice to bring together the various aspects of Treadwell's personality. I understand his admiration for Treadwell as a filmmaker, based on some of the amazing images Treadwell captured, but Herzog's world-weary cynicism proved a perfect counter point to Treadwell's naive view of nature. Normally, I don't like to hear the filmmaker narrate a documentary. I prefer documentaries where the subjects and the footage manage to tell their own story. However, I enjoyed Herzog's narration. I felt it accented the material perfectly.Herzog is a remarkable filmmaker. What other documentary filmmaker would recommend that an interviewee destroy film, as Herzog did to the woman who had Treadwell's last tape, which captured his death. Herzog displayed excellent judgment by not using the material. To actually hear Treadwell and his companion being killed and eaten by the bear would have so disrupted the tone of the piece that it would have been impossible to maintain a balanced viewpoint of Treadwell's life and "accomplishments." Treadwell deserves to be defined as much by what he did with his life than merely by his death itself.The DVD disappointed me in one aspect. I was hoping that there would be a director's commentary so that Herzog could answer a question I was curious about: What percentage of Treadwell's footage featured him talking, as opposed to footage of the bears alone? I think the answer to that question would reveal once and for all whether this crusade was ever really about the bears, or simply Treadwell himself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why was Treadwell there?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought it was an excellent documentary, but I seen no evidence of Treadwell actually studying and learning about the grizzlies. Matter of fact, he seems to have had little knowledge about grizzlies. Also there was no evidence of what he actually did to protect these animals. Timothy Treadwell was remarkable that he was able to survive living that close to these animals for 12 years, but it was luck more then knowledge. I have to wonder if more then one bear was involved in his death. It's very probable that there were, and it may have been obvious in the audio of the mauling itself. But I believe and agree that to protect the other bears from an unfair death, that any information indicating this be withheld. The blame should not be placed on the bears - they eat their own - why would they not eat Treadwell? I, too, have a great fondness for grizzly bears and the wilderness, but I'm not planning on living among them any time soon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was terribly sad. I watched a man try desperately to find a place in this complex world where he fit in. Some would have called him crazy, I would call him lost. When he walks into the water where one of the Grizzlies is swimming, my heart stopped. But instead of the bear attacking, he just meanders away. Timothy was very lucky. I respect him for his conviction in trying to protect the bears, I am saddened by his ignorance which got one killed. He did not understand at all that he was a visitor in the park. The bears allowed HIM to be there. Unfortunately, when they had had enough one of them killed Timothy.Thirteen years of work, undone by not knowing the signs.</fullReview>

Apart from his claim to "be with the bears alone", he used to claim he was an Aussie orphan to get attention.,,,He ranted on about his sexuality being hetero (he claims), with a very noticeable "gay" voice. This idiot acted like bears were really something akin to Winnie the Poo.

		<fullReview>I found this documentary to be very intriguing. 1. Timothy is so passionate in what he believes, and truly loves what he was doing, however he takes it over the severe limit. Mess with the bull, you get the horns. 2. He is a very likable guy just by his on camera actions, but he is also someone who you would call quit eccentric, and very much, to the normal expression, "out there". 3. Watching this mans obsession unfold, you can clearly see he is thrilled to be near the animals, and the wild. However, it is so depressing to hear how he died. He died as he wished. I believe he knew it was coming. Sooner or later..... I don't know whether to be proud of him, respect him, ignore him, hate him, or think he's nuts. Either way, Timothy Treadwell, was either very very gutsy, or he was completely insane. Watch it, make your own bias. However, no matter what way you look at it many people loved this guy, and now he is gone... So to many, this is a tragedy, to others it is a lesson. Take Timothy's treak however you want. But just remember, he did not make it out of the place he loved.R.I.P Timothy..... R.I.P</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>why the controversy?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As i have read reviews of and comments on this film after seeing and being moved by it, I cannot understand the controversy. The more I read, the more it becomes apparent that the gist of the matter is whether or not timothy deserved to die and whether or not people in general who hold on to romantic/sentimental views of the nature and have difficulty accepting the normal roles should be considered self-absorbed lowlifes. First of all, what a deranged question to debate whether or not he deserved to die whether or not he crossed certain lines. Timothy was very self-congratulatory, self-absorbed, and seemingly bipolar but there is incredible beauty in the fact that he was able to finally find consolation in the world through communion with nature. How can one be so callous as to say such defiant closeness with nature was so warped as to make his death seem appropriate. Anyone who does so is just like the taunting poachers who threaten timothy in the film. I think his life was incredibly moving and his death neither deserved nor a romantic and inevitable end. I was moved by his maintaining a child-like wonder about nature amidst a world so full of cynicism, cruelty, and hatred. Timothy rejected such things, even scorning nature when it exhibited such seemingly human acts as murder--a point on which I disagree with Timothy. But there what moved me was what Herzog points out as his ostensible belief in justice, balance, and perfection within all things nonhuman. Is it really so heretical to want to withdraw from society?! Maybe it is to do so, I don't know, but it seems a difficult case to argue when the only ones who suffered were Timothy and his consenting accompaniment Amy (who I believe it is wrong to cast as some prisoner of Tim or victim of his ego and self-absorption). I think Tim stands for the very things many people feel deep down inside, intuitively about the world. Things that, as Herzog poignantly asserts, drove Muir and Thoreau into the wilderness. Tim stood for timeless values that may have been unrealistic (e.g. perfection and peace in nature) but his life is a testament to his own courage. People who reject him as a tree hugger are people who see politics in everything, even the life and death of another person. I personally was moved by his courage and belief in something more real, complex, and accessible than conventional religious myth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie, Better Poster....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Grizzly Man" is one of the best documentaries I have seen, and Werner Herzog can be congratulated for making such a moving film. The footage is of Timothy Treadwell, a bear-enthusiast/protector who spent 13 summers with Brown Grizzly bears in Alaska, by himself and with no weapons. He was a partial celebrity, appearing on Late Night talk shows and started a successful wildlife organization called Grizzly People. The film is a study on a man who gave all his time and love to a creature that could have and eventually did, kill him. The film is earnest in how it presents itself, with beautiful footage, neutral interviewing, and appropriate editing choices, Herzog has made a welcome homage to a unique and heroic individual. The soundtrack is especially good, as are the unbelievable shots of Treadwell with his bears and foxes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is not for you if you are looking for footage of bears and their habitat. It also a movie about a man who gave his life to bears more than it is a movie about a man who was killed by bears. Timothy Treadwell seems to be very eccentric and peculiar in his ways. All the people in the film fittingly match his persona, making this film difficult to enjoy if you do not appreciate the idiosyncrasy of others. The film beautifully explains the value of a simpler and slower way of living that is forgotten in the world of today. In viewing Treadwell's this life one can come to one clear understanding, and that being; Treadwell must certainly be happy with his fate but not with the fate of the world. Productions that do include more of the footage that Timothy Treadwell captured would be spectacular and make for very enjoyable cinema, but again this film is not entirely about that subject.</fullReview>

Very little footage Timothy shot is used, and the very few scenes they actually did put into this film are ones that make him look like a complete lunatic. This has to be put together by the absolute worst filmmaker of all time. If you want a better look at the real Timothy Treadwell, go watch the miniseries that highlights his footage (so many amazing shots!) and his diary entries. You will hear his side of the story, and find there is more to him than just being "the idiot who thought bears were fluffy harmless things".</fullReview>

Although, I'd advise parents to use discretion. Not one for the kids to see! Has strong language. The way Timothy interacts with the animals is so touching and inspiring. One can see how much he truly adored the animals. He only wanted to protect them, and love them. Werner Horzog narrates the film, as well as interviewing family and friends of Timothy's. Watching this documentary you start to understand what he was trying to do. It touches one's heart. Not only does it contain beautiful images of the Alaskan wilderness, but you also see Treadwell open up, and let us in on his most personal thoughts, and beliefs. This is meant to be viewed more than once. Every time you watch it you discover something new. Highly recommended!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is nothing better than a good, thorough documentary. Grizzly Man is just like that. Entertaining, sets your mind into a spin of laughter and serious thinking. Hilarious &amp; unbelievable. But oh dear oh dear, Werner Hertzog (a great director!) made a few, tiny, essential,l mistakes in 'his' documentary. First he himself is the voice over. A strange &amp; somewhat irritating German accent gives it all a 'Schwarzenegger' effect. A useless 'terminator sound' a friend told me. Perhaps he should have used a more neutral voice. But hey, who am I to judge..... The second essential thing..... During the whole 103 minutes of the documentary Hertzof doesn't appear before his camera, only once: the scene when Hertzog (at Jewel Palovak's place)is listening to the tape which contains the horrifying sounds of the bear attack. Why does he show himself? His appearance doesn't give the scene more value, more depth. If a director needs to be in his own documentary, let it be with a reason. Still, Hertzog, I do admire you!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>He was no fool to me: he actually demonstrated how to live in peace with those animals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen this movie twice by now and think that people misunderstood the Timothy Treadwell situation. This includes fellow reviewers and also some of the people who gave their opinion in the movie itself.Basically, some people think that Timothy Treadwell got what he deserved; that it was just a matter of time before he'd be killed.It's not that simple to me, because he was actually living in peace with those animals and would get out of there when summer season was over, because of the lack of food for the bears. When Grizzly bears don't have enough food, they even eat their own. Timothy Treadwell knew this, and would leave when summer season was over. In fact, he already left the bear maze (the territory/bear area). The reason why he returned, was a problem with his travel documents and thus he decided to stick around a little longer, which was a risk that he would normally never take. To me, THAT is why he and his girlfriend died. I believe that if this would not have been the case, if he would just have returned the next summer season, he would probably still be alive because he really understood how to live in peace with the bears. He had done so for a long time already and captivated the proof of that on film.His relationship with foxes was also VERY impressive. Especially when you realize that these animals will never come close to anybody. But they sensed that Timothy Treadwell was different and the foxes trusted him. This guy was probably in harmony with any animal. Can't we learn a lesson from this instead of killing every being that looks dangerous when running into them? Of course I am not saying that it is recommended for people to massively go out camping in those area's and invade the bear's territory. I am saying that Timothy proved that you actually CAN deal with those animals in a peaceful way instead of killing them when you run into them. Some other wildlife pioneers did the same thing with white sharks and I've also seen a man doing something similar with a lion. This is important research and when those people do die at some point, I think they earn a little more respect than to be called 'idiots'.I am very disappointed that lot's of people didn't even understood this very important message while it's so clearly demonstrated in the movie. Instead of understanding this, they focus on details that are not important. Who cares about the face of his girlfriend or why Timothy did this or that. Just make sure you get the true message of the movie.I'm scoring it a 8 instead of higher, because of the length of the movie; some parts where too long in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Man In Conflict With The World Around Him</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>GRIZZLY MAN is an intriguing and deeply disturbing look at one young man's end of life experiences in the far reaches of the Alaskan wilderness, living, "working," and isolating himself with the most deadly creatures on Earth: the Grizzly Bear.Timothy Treadwell is this man, and although the documentary takes on the initial look and feel of a nature film, it is anything but. Tim, as we come to know him, is the focus of this strangely watchable documentary, inserting himself in almost every shot and speaking about how he's there to "protect" the bears (even though he spends much of his time in a National Park where they're protected anyway), to bond with them (a definite no-no as we learn through the film's machinations), and to rant about the outside world and how they (we) don't understand what he's trying to do out there.For those looking for a feel-good documentary about a man living with bears in a beautiful landscape, you'd best look elsewhere.To me, this film showed how a man with an obvious mental illness can become so obsessed with an idea ("loving" the bears) that it ends up killing him. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy nature films as much as the next person, but I think if you're looking for information about Grizzlies and how to interact with them, this just ain't the film to watch. Tim constantly puts himself in harms way and even goes so far as to take a dip (swim) with a Grizzly, and then proceeds to pet it! He turns his back on the bears and hides his tent in brambles, a risky way to camp in Grizzly country.The mental illness aspect of Tim's psyche was smackingly obvious to me. The man's preconceptions of right and wrong were very bizarre. Initially he praises the park service, but later rants about them and their "F-ing" policies. He becomes paranoid about everyone and everything, moving his camp into dangerous areas. He befriends every animal as if it had human qualities, even some pretty cute little foxes, and tells them how he "loves" them and won't let anything happen to them (I've never heard a man say "I love you" more often to animals than Tim). How about loving the race you belong to? You know, the human race? But even with all these issues, the film pulls you in in a very strange fashion, and this can be two-fold depending on your stance on certain nature issues; some (like me) wanted to scream at the screen and warn Tim about what he was doing and how it would all end if he didn't take precautions (he does get killed and eaten by a bear in the end, by the way); others might say, "go ahead, let him get killed. Who cares."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never judge a 'DVD' by its cover.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like several other reviewers.. I feel completely ripped off. From the back cover of the DVD: "In this mesmerizing film, acclaimed director Werner Herzog explores the live and death of amateur grizzly bear expert and wildlife preservationist Timothy Treadwell, who lived unarmed among grizzlies for 13 summers."The first sore point for me, is the use of the word "preservationist". While the word is technically correct.. its use is deceiving. While Mr Treadwell certainly 'pleaded' for the the preservation of Grizzlies, he 'did' nothing but harm them. There are even a number of dense reviewers here at IMDb that think that Treadwell was some sort of environmentalist, a protector of nature. Nothing could be further from the truth and it angers me that a documentary director can't convey this sincerely to the audience.You don't need bias to understand that Treadwell is a manic-depressive (aka Bipolar disorder) who was in need of his medication (which, we find out, he quit taking). Herzog doesn't explore this beyond the ex-girlfriend's confession that Treadwell 'wanted' the extreme highs and the lows. It's frustrating to see her say that she 'respected his decision to' do this or that, but that she can't understand just how sick his mind is off the medication. How can you respect the decisions made by someone who is suffering from a mental disorder?Why didn't Herzog interview any of Treadwell's indirect relationships? By only interviewing those closest to him, Herzog ignores objectivity. We get people who only knew 'of' him to criticize him. Nobody who knew him was willing to criticize him? I find this very hard to believe. Where's the objective review of the tapes (post mortem) by a qualified psychologist? Where's the interview with the Park Service personnel that explained the reasoning behind the park's rules. Why did Herzog leave the audience to decide uninformed, and for themselves, whether or not the rules that Treadwell was breaking were for good reason?Why did Herzog resort to all the fake stuff? All the interviews were painful to watch thanks to the underwhelming acting by the interviewees. One of the the interviewees actually is an actor, so that's understandable, but the rest were just prepared. The utter lack of candor turns what would be a respectful documentary into a sideshow act. Why stage events in the documentary? (the removal of the wristwatch from evidence) The reason I feel most ripped off is because Werner Herzog only hinted at what needed to be said. He was willing to point out where he felt Treadwell was wrong, but not willing to explore anything beyond the surface, nor willing to actually say what needed to be said: Treadwell was a very normal sufferer of Bipolar disorder who suffered massive delusions of grandeur and died on record, as a result of them.This is a sad, pathetic documentary of a sick man and his sad, pathetic friends.</fullReview>

To his credit, Herzog does an admirable job of portraying the dedicated, intelligent and dare I say noble side of his quite goofy subject, as well as giving both his friends and detractors equal billing.... Treadwells nature footage is incredibly beautiful and the fact he got away with what he was doing for so long only makes his inevitable demise that much more fascinating.. and as a bonus almost alone worth the price of the DVD, there is an excellent documentary of the great Richard Thompson and a host of other quality musicians recording the soundtrack under the production of the equally great Henry Kaiser.. For anyone who is a Thompson fan.. also a must see... and yes, Herzog is a German but is very understandable and despite the host of racist criticisms of other commenters..does not sound like Simpsons character or Ca Governor...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but sad animal documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a huge fan of animal documentaries, especially since I'm an animal lover and after watching this, I felt sad, not so much because Timothy Treadwell was killed by the very bears he loved, but because his incompetency led to the deaths of two of those very bears, which was something I think many people feared in the first place.Treadwell seems to think he's "at one" with the bears and his footage is great, but you can even see the hesitation when a bear is close to the camera, as if Treadwell knew at any moment that bear might go nuts and try to bite him. Unfortunetaly, it's also obvious that Treadwell didn't really have all his marbles. Besides his odd rants on camera many times and his repetitive ramblings on occasion, the fact that he's told his parents he almost got the part of "Woody" on "Cheers" I think adds to his persona as someone who wasn't all there. Many wannabe actors who actually get an audition for some TV and don't get it, are always sure they were so close, second in line, and just missed, when in reality they were just one in a long line of actors who didn't get the part. I'm sure he really thinks he came in second for the part on Cheers but I'm sure no one outside of his parents actually believes it.The worst thing about this documentary are the secondary "characters." His ex-girlfriend is featured prominently and it's never really stated why. She was not his current girlfriend (his current girlfriend was killed with him) and not the place he would leave from when starting out on one of his trips (that was another friend). So what connection she had with him other than being an ex-girlfriend is never clearly stated. She "overacts" throughout, including a scene where she is the recipient of Treadwell's watch (that he was wearing when he was killed). She acts like she's getting the Medal of Freedom. She is also the holder of his camera and when director Herzog listens to the sounds of Treadwell being killed and tells her she should destroy the tape, you can see the look in her eyes as if she was thinking "but if I did, no one would ever talk to me then since my life is completely empty otherwise." The other terrible "actor" is the coroner. I can't believe he was real. He seemed like a character in an SCTV skit or Christopher Guest movie. He overacted and seemed to almost be reading from a script.I wish Treadwell had stopped doing what he was doing a couple years earlier. If he had, he'd still be alive and so would his girlfriend. And so would the two bears who did nothing wrong other than do what they normally do, try and look for food. And because of Treadwell, they are gone, so in the end, he may have done more harm than good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Running with bears for the insane</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>!! SPOILER !! After some unintentionally funny narration and dialogue, I discovered that I was bored, and sleepy. This is the story of Werner Herzog acting as a documentarian and interviewer, taking some clips from Tim Treadwell as he shot maybe 100 hours of video of grizzly bears in the wild, in Alaska, talking all the while about poachers and protection when these were protected federal reserves. Who was this Treadwell? He was a failed actor, who apparently tried for the role of Woody, on Cheers, and losing that to a fellow lunatic in Haroldson, Treadwell decided instead to get together with others to create a special interest group called, Grizzly People. And for that he appeared on Letterman. That clip is shown in this documentary. And Letterman asked if we wouldn't be hearing that one day Treadwell had been eaten by a bear? Not going to happen, said Treadwell.Letterman figured it out, in trying to crack wise, without knowing what a dangerous loon his guest truly was. That Treadwell camps out with his childhood teddy bear is probably okay. But he sometimes speaks in a sort of high-pitched falsetto for the camera, sounding sometimes like an old woman, and breaks down into violent fits otherwise, screaming profanities into the camera about the park service rangers. Marty Stauffer he's not (unless there's something there that I never heard about). Treadwell complains of his troubles with women, increasingly as Herzog cut the documentary. His relationships with women appeared to be 'platonic'. And the woman killed with him seemed deathly afraid of the bears. At one point, and this is twisted, Treadwell walks over to excrement just left by a female bear walking by. And he runs his hands through it, slowly, saying for the camera that this just came out of her, it's a part of her, and I love her, etc. He otherwise is said to generally dehumanize people, according to Herzog's narration, while trying to childishly humanize these large predators in the wild. Others said he wanted to somehow be a bear, in a sort of anamistic transformation, though that's not shown in any clip used by Herzog.As for Treadwell's footage, most of this documentary seems filled, instead, with Herzog's interviews of people. In one of these, there is apparently audio of the bear's attack on this woman and Treadwell, both, as they were at a camp near a lake and expecting the float plane to arrive shortly. Herzog is shown wearing headphones, supposedly listening to this. It's never played in the documentary. In a video clip from just hours before the attack, which Herzog includes, it's blowing hard and raining. And Treadwell said he loved being there. He said that his method of camping in the brush was as dangerous as dangerous could be. Other people trying it would surely be killed by bears, he said. But not him. Famous last words. Seems other bears had moved in, not as large as the big bears he had filmed, but more vicious and hungry. And one, previously tagged as #141, came after him and the woman. It's suggested that he was attacked first, though perhaps others listening to the tape might decide she had been attacked first? Herzog almost demands of the woman holding the tape that she immediately destroy it. Presumeably she did. The pilot coming to pick them up spotted the bear as he approached the camp site. He fled. But then he returned with armed forest rangers who spotted the bear, opened up on it and killed it. When they opened the animal up, they found the remains.There's a scene where Treadwell sort of hides from a photo tour on the lake. They probably saw him, up on a low ridge. But he pretends he's hiding. The people beach because a bear, which Treadwell had personally named, was nearby. They shoot photographs while Treadwell's up there hiding like a little kid. To keep the animal from coming too near, they throw rocks to keep it back. Treadwell is utterly horrified. You don't treat people like this, he seems to say to his camera. But he never comes down to say anything. So Herzog at least makes the key point in the film. And I agree with him. Maybe in another life, and another world, we can all be St. Francis with the wild animals. Maybe there are some like that, today. But Treadwell wasn't one of them. These animals, at least in the wild, need to have a fear of man. Frankly we need to maintain a healthy respect for their life, and their world, which Treadwell did not in his violently childish Bambi-like fantasy. He wanted to be strong, like a bear, in the face perhaps of the evil that men do, or his own sense of physical weakness. He was in the wild. He was 'roughing it'. He saw the power of the grizzly bear, which has always impressed people. And perhaps he did try to identify, as some might try for a moment after a movie is over with a strong character. But he didn't see the reality of it. He saw what he wanted to see. Clearly, no one could have talked to him. He was delusional and dangerous. And, when not in the protected park areas of Alaska, there are photos of him being allowed into classrooms to interact with grade school children. One gets the sense that he planned to splice his movies together for some sort of classroom presentation, or series, or whatever, at some point. It's frightening.Don't get me wrong. I'm not saying anyone deserves to be eaten by wild grizzly bears. But this is a case where the park service should have sent someone in there to arrest this nutjob, for breaking all the even reasonable regulations. And while Herzog isn't particularly interested in the woman who was killed, it's the particular tragedy of this true story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Herzog slaps in the face of a dead man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since I was a young girl of 15 and I'm 51 years old now, I was an admirer of films made by Werner Herzog. He seemed to be a sincere man and filmmaker. However recently I saw Grizzly Man and that changed my mind.I'm angry and upset after seeing Grizzly Man. Not because Timothy Treadwell is dead, although it's quite sad he and his girlfriend died so tragically. He himself might think it's okay to 'be one with a bear' ending up in the bowels of a hungry straying bear who probably had negative experiences with people before meeting Treadwell. No I'm upset because Herzog has misused the hours of film-tape of Timothy Treadwell that ended up in his hands. In Grizzly Man he presents Timothy Treadwell as a crazy man with a death wish. But haven't we all our twists? Many people take risks every day when they smoke tobacco (risc of lung-cancer), drive a car (risc of a car-accident), eat or work too much (risc of a heart-attack), walk in the street at night (risc of robbery or rape) or like Herzog himself stand on top of a building and be shot etc. It is just not fair. A man who dedicated his life for helping the bears and who filmed them so beautifully does not deserve to be portrayed the way Herzog did. Timothy Treadwell filmed himself like someone else writes in a diary. In my opinion it was also an outlet for him. He planned to make a film but I don't think he would have chosen the parts about himself Herzog chose. Herzog lacks respect. He undermines all Timothy Treadwell was fighting and living and dying for. With Grizzly Man he confirms the prejudice that bears are so dangerous and should be dominated and controlled by human beings and hunters. The fact that Timothy Treadwell loved bears and talked kindly with them, does not turn him into a lunatic in my eyes.Herzog really disappointed me. He says Timothy Treadwell crossed some nature's line that shouldn't be crossed. As if we should draw a line between nature with its wild animals on one side and ourselves at the other side where we have to stay in the human part. How ridiculous. We human beings are animals too. We are part of nature and that's what most people have forgotten. And this forgotten or unknown part scares them and makes them destroy it. According to my opinion people try to separate themselves more and more from nature. We create jungles of concrete and in stead of being happy that there are some animals who want to live with us, we want them out of our sight and have them killed (mice, rats, pigeons, seagulls, crows etc.) Unlike bears, these animals can't eat us, but we invent an other excuse to kill them for these animals might spread diseases. In reality not many people die because of these animals and not many people are eaten by bears either. With his film Herzog encourages the idea that we should fear nature instead of loving it. Why didn't Herzog interview Charlie Russell for example in his film? Russell is a bear-expert too and he knew Treadwell and even advised him a few months before his death to have pepper-spray. Treadwell however didn't want to use anything that could harm or even make a bear sneeze. Herzog used Timothy Treadwell's tapes and made his own film showing his own limited ideas about bears and nature regardless the ideas and ideals of the man who made the tapes. When Herzog had made a fiction film showing his own material only, I would not have a problem with this. I would disagree with the message of the film, but I wouldn't be angry with him. But now I am truly angry with Werner Herzog for he took Timothy Treadwell's material to promote an idea he hated. How wrong and unjust towards the man who filmed it originally! And that is not fair nor sincere.In Alaska live 35.000 bears and the authorities think it's okay to kill 6% of them annually. On Kodiak Island 160 bears are killed each year. Timothy Treadwell wanted this hunting to be stopped. Werner Herzog does not agree with Timothy Treadwell and agrees with the authorities. The fact that Herzog uses the material of Treadwell to turn it against him and his ideas, is not sincere and inappropriate. Grizzly Man is not a requiem for a man who lived and died for animals living in the wild. On the contrary, it's a slap in the face of a dead man who cant't defend himself anymore. Shame on you Werner Herzog!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a credible documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Timothy was exactly what he professed to hate. An idiot who knew nothing of bears that will harm them in the end. After watching this movie I was extremely confused. What education did this idiot have? The "documentary" gave no real scientific insight on bears or their habitat. It was merely a dork with a camcorder ranting and raving about people and giving bears ridiculous names. I live a mere 60 miles from Glacier National Park and have bears near my home. Any idiot knows, you don't screw with the bears! Hell, even my 5 year old daughter knows that.I have asked Glacier Park workers what they thought of this movie and they said it could single handedly bring Grizzlies back to the endangered species list (they are on the protected list now). Many have stated that this movie gives the average tourist (Californians in particular) a false view of bears. They are not cuddly animals that can be baby talked too. Many hikers are now warned to the extreme, "STAY AWAY FROM THE BEARS". Does Timothy realize that in populated parts of the world, if a bear attacks a human it is more often than not killed? These bears merely tolerated Timothy because they weren't hungry enough. Did you see him trying to pet the swimming bear? It did not like to be touched, I'd say it also was not "his friend".I think they should have played the tape of the couple getting killed, maybe it would make people think twice about invading bear territories and respect their privacy! Bears are not pets or can ever be our friends. They tolerate us until we get too close.Timothy was a self absorbed lunatic who had a foul mouth and liked to hear himself talk. His girlfriend should have left him when she had the chance, he himself said he wished he was gay. I thought he was till the girlfriend showed up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't reviewed on IMDb before but this documentary is so overrated that I felt compelled to vent. I wouldn't have even finished watching if I hadn't been a guest at someone's house. The film was poor on many levels: First - Treadwell's video footage was contrived. The more I watched, the more he seemed to be acting as a person desperate to be famous instead of one acting out of conviction.Second - The others in the film, with the exception of Treadwell's parents and the airline pilot, were just as contrived and corny as he was. God, they seemed artificial.Third - Treadwell's mission to protect the bears doesn't even make sense as he did more harm than good by making the bears grow accustomed to human presence. I believe that Treadwell really did love the bears but there is much research which indicates his efforts were misguided. Sometimes we have to sacrifice our enjoyment of wildlife to really help.Fourth - The film's entertainment value wasn't half that of other wildlife films such as "March of the Penguins" and "Winged Migration". The filmmakers, in my opinion, did a poor job of sequencing scenes and gave little incentive to keep watching.As a person who loves Alaska, bears, and other wildlife, I would love to see more people dedicated to the preservation of our wildlands. Hopefully their efforts will be less people-centered.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching about 20 seconds of Timothy talking, it was obvious he was a delusional half- wit. When I see people like him on the street, I walk to the other side. I'm sorry that he did not get the mental help he needed. But he should not be glorified or made to be a martyr or even preserved on DVD as a freakshow. Because I trusted Herzog, I watched the whole movie and regretted it. I felt dirty afterwards. There is nothing to be praised about a person who idiotically endangered another. I'm referring to his poor girlfriend. Yes, she made the choice to follow the idiot, but I'm sure she was not in the best place in her life and probably lacked self-esteem. She is the victim here. To have a movie devoted to her abuser is an insult. I have nothing but sympathy for her and her family and friends. Just as Herzog suggested that an ex-girlfriend of Timothy never listen to the video of the murder by grizzly and should destroy it, I would strongly suggest that you not watch Grizzly Man. My DVD of it was promptly smashed and thrown in the trash.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Idealism or Madness and Obsession?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For thirteen consecutive summers, the American Timothy Treadwell moved to Katmai in the Alaskan Peninsula to live among the grizzly bears, with the pretext of studying and protecting them. In 2003, his girlfriend Amie Huguenard and he were surprisingly attacked and ate by a bear. Werner Herzog somehow accessed more than one hundred hours of footages filmed by Timothy and released this documentary, showing the life and death of Timothy Treadwell."Grizzly Man" is a good documentary, but too long and overrated. Director Werner Herzog edited the footages of Timothy Treadwell without chronology, inserting interviews with friends, relatives and acquaintances of Timothy and the result is quite confused. First of all, as a narrator and interviewer, Herzog should omit his personal opinions about the subject of this documentary, and I believe this is a basic rule. The footage where he listens to the tape of Jewel Palovak disclosing the last minutes of Timothy Treadwell and Amie Huguenard during the attack of the bear shows a behavior not natural, as if it had been previously rehearsed. The image of Timothy Treadwell sold in this documentary is of a deranged ex-addicted, frustrated actor and quite mad man that has never found a spot in the world of humans that escaped to the wild world of the grizzly bears and foxes, trying to give a meaning for his attitude and solitude. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "O Homem Urso" ("The Bear Man")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i have NEVER, EVER, EVER been as incredibly disappointed by any television show, film or documentary as i was by this contrived piece of trash. The footage that the subject shot in Alaska is absolutely gorgeous and i believe so much more could have been done with it and with his crazy story. It disappointed me terribly that all this documentary focuses on is his death when there was so much more to his life and times with these bears that would have made a better story had maybe a bit more research been done.The people he chose to interview are ridiculous. All of the interviews are forced, blatantly acted out and terribly at that. I don't see how the guy who flew the helicopter to pick up his body has ANY right to make a formal statement about what the subject was doing with the bears, it is already obvious that he did not belong there and messed with the bears too much and we do not need ANOTHER person to say it. The scene where he asks the ex-girlfriend to never look at the footage of the attack was EXCRUCIATING to watch.Not to mention the interview with the "curator" at the museum in Alaska who struggles so obviously to have something to say that might be interesting and applicable but instead he repeats what every other interviewee had already said 15 times before in each of their interviews and adds some comment about the Alaskan "way" of respecting bears that just sounds completely made up.i could really go on for days about how horrible this documentary was, and what a total disappointment it was. i mean i honestly can't get over what a train wreck this was and i don't understand what people see in it. the bears and the personality of the subject are really interesting and great in and of itself but what the director does to this story is just disgusting, and a terrible waste of 2 or more hours of life.but half the people i talk to absolutely loved this documentary, and the other half hated it so... go ahead i guess and take the time to see it and draw your own conclusions. but am i the only one who realizes what a SHAM this is?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grizzly Man as mockumentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While any filmmaker naturally approaches a subject with his own preconceptions, documentary films are often most effective when the filmmaker strives for impartiality. In choosing to amplify the story of Timothy Treadwell, Herzog is sending a very specific and political message. The morality is not inherent in the subject matter but is instead injected by Herzog in choosing to discuss Treadwell and in the choices Herzog makes while crafting the film. The film is problematic in that it is one-sided and does not seek to understand as much as to make an example of Treadwell. Great documentary is created with a spirit of openness and appreciation for the complexities of life. This film seeks to moralize and judge, which is why it is a mockumentary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is so bad that not only is this my first review of a movie on IMDb but it's still playing while I write this because I couldn't wait until it was over to share my thoughts. Simply put, a man who enters a bear sanctuary (a sanctuary which was designed to protect bears where humans are not allowed specifically for this reason) and gets one of the bears killed because he antagonized it until it ate him and the park rangers had to come and kill it is called a hunter. Not an activist. Since that bear would have lived if Treadwell had never invaded their territory.A pariah, an alcoholic, and a failed actor, this is not the story of an artist or a protector of innocent creatures. This is the story of a very selfish man who left the human world to find the happiness he was denied there in the possibility that it would be granted to him among a group of animals about which he knew nothing more than he did their stuffed animal counter part which his parents bought him when he was a child.The one thing that the director, during his voice over, (and some IMDb reviewers) seems to cling to is the so called art of Treadwell's photography. This is simply ignorant. I prefer National Geographic. Other than their ability to keep subjects inside the frame of the camera, they are also mature enough to accept death in nature and will never incessantly monologue about it.If you have seen this movie and you are shaking your head in disagreement allow me to offer this: Everyone in the movie who actually studies bears thinks this guy is an idiot. The bear museum curator who holds a PhD refers to him as "the ultimate of disrespecting the bear and what the bear represents". The bear biologist says he tried to be in a world that we can never enter because we are very different than the bears are. Even the air haul helicopter pilot said, "he got what he was asking for, he got what he deserved". But his ex-girlfriend, whose only work experience is waitressing in a renaissance-themed restaurant, thinks he's brilliant. There are documentaries that will make you feel the pain of humanity (Deliver Us from Evil) or allow you to enter an entirely different cultural world (Jesus Camp). This is not one of those. Neither the subject nor subject matter nor the documentary itself is very compelling (other than to make me write this scathing review). Life is too short to watch a movie like this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An inquiry into the human psyche</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must be frank; I didn't appreciate Werner's (the documentary makers) narration in the beginning. There is little intonation, his sentences are somewhat chopped and he has an unusual accent. During the whole journey however, we get to know Werner better because of his very personal opinion, sharp analysis and sensible and intelligent commentary. Near the end, I even viewed him as a companion with whom I was delving deeper into the mind of Timothy. Werner does an extremely good job of complicating Timothy's character with sharp analysis and good footage selection and arranging. I like the honesty of the selection process too; he both incorporates the opinions of Timothy's confidantes and of critics. The honesty and plainness with which the interviewees speak also touched me.Like with the narration, I also adopted an opinion about Timothy polar to the one I ended with and for Werner to achieve this is a great feat. In the beginning, I thought Timothy was a great guy. Due to the directness and authenticity of his footage (this because of his own shot camera footage and the lack of social control thereabouts), the enthusiasm and pure, passionate love is tangible (and adrenaline too), even through the obstacle the medium is. You cannot but sympathize when Timothy talks about his life and how he found purpose in his lifestyle. He reminded me of Cesar Millan in the extreme, someone with a pure love and one vision. His genuine and childish enthusiasm and affection for nature is truly heart-warming, this man is all passion for his job. What's also great is Timothy's respect for the majesty of these grizzlies and his knowing that the only thing that keeps him from death there is the bear's tolerance that he wins by his own mental strength. He is a person to be admired because he lived the way he wanted, even in the face of danger and opposition. Sadly enough however, I don't admire him for his work because I feel from watching that Timothy was at fault in invading the bears' lives and playing their unwanted protector.The documentary does a great job of complicating our initial image of Tim as a fighter for good. Timothy's diaries also reveal a flawed side, a side very hungry for recognition and being rebellious for the sake of it. It is quite disturbing to see Timothy talk to the bears as if they were humans, his long periods of loneliness may account for this, but it is still remarkable and strange. After finishing the documentary, the question of how Timothy actually helped these animals in doing what he does remains vague, and it doesn't help that the narrator explicitly states in the beginning of the movie that the bears filmed actually already live in a wildlife park. These and other facts suggest that Timothy might have actually lived among these bears not with the primary goal to better their lives, but that it might have been a solution for a broken man that was done with society and needed some time to figure himself out. I strongly suspect that his living in this wild, primordial nature might have largely been a therapy for him, a way out of the complicatedness and disappointments that human society brings, although I do not immediately condemn him for seeking this out. I'm convinced the bumblebee-footage answer our question about why Timothy wishes to die there of any places. Timothy liked living on the edge (as his childhood story suggests too), and I think he kicked on the adrenaline and tension that comes from the knowledge that to fail mentally in this wilderness is to die. It was a challenge to him to survive every day and every hour, of which each moment he lives works life- and character-affirming; each moment is a celebration of his mental strength. I believe he didn't want to die the way the bumblebee supposedly did, quite unexpected and in a very non-heroic and meaningless way. That was not his lifestyle, he wanted to live in the present and live to the fullest. Therefore I believe that while his friends talk about his death being tragic, Timothy is delighted in the fact that he died in this way, always fighting with something greater than himself. This is the second reason why I think Timothy was there more for himself than for anything else. Another problem comes in his revering of the poop of one of the grizzlies. He absolutely sees them as divine, which makes us again question if we should search more meaning behind his death than someone dying because he was enchanted by a crazy ecstasy. His direct interference in nature and crazy pleading for the help of higher powers also reinforce the belief that Timothy's problem was mainly a personal problem. Timothy seemed to have had appropriated this piece of Eden for himself and any offense to it he may have seen as offense against his person, which makes his fight too personal and vicious for what it should be. He has a way of wildly dramatizing the importance of his self-imposed and self-created mission and his narcissism. In the end, you do ask yourself whether this is a documentary on nature or a documentary on a troubled human psyche.I think the message of this documentary is inspirational in that it shows that everyone can live their life to the fullest if they want to, however hard their dream may be. But coupled with that, there also comes the ironic, tragic lesson that we must accept the way things are and that we are not almighty, nor should act as Gods."I never have days when I grieve for Timmy, as I have for friends who have died. They feel dead, Timmy doesn't feel dead."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Documentary with the identification of a narrative film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Grizzly Man is one of the nicest surprises I've had in watching movies this month. Werner Herzog collects so much information on the controversial man and allows us to view the evidence of this man for what it is, not what the news would doom him to be or what a narrative film would embellish to extracted our sympathy. If Timothy Treadwell would have made a documentary about his life, this would be it. I'd even go as far to say it is one of the great documentaries of the past decade.Werner Herzog pieces together the real life footage of Treadwell recording himself with the bears he lived with, aided by real-life interviews (some are emotionally arousing), photographs, and voice-over to convey Treadwell's life. There's an underlying narrative feel to the documentary, almost like it could be a fake documentary that's constructed fictionally. Grizzly Man doesn't operate as a boring, informational documentary, it let's you bring that carry-on that story-telling luggage some of us cannot let go of.The impressive factor of Grizzly Man is it's representation of Timothy Treadwell's personal life and inner demons. Why did he live with the bears? Why? That's what we all want to know: WHY?Seeing the footage of Treadwell talking about his personal aches, then hearing the preceding circumstances that comprised him to reach that point from the narrator sparked something with me. Treadwell uses bears as his "makeover" or his "get out of jail free card" to start over. The world is bitter and life is hard. Everyone know that, but how people deal with that failure is what gives us our individuality. Ironically though, I understand Treadwell's focus on bears as an escape.On the outside it may look like I had a decent upbringing, but I have come face to face with a lot of hardships and problems with no solutions. I have been emotionally and mentally abused by just about everyone who "matters". I formed an attachment to Gwyneth Paltrow that's similar to Treadwell's with bears. I'm not subconsciously suicidal or wanting to change my human form, but once I felt like I exhausted all my hope of improving my life with the people around me, I found solace, inspiration, and drive in Gwyneth Paltrow. Paltrow has publicized how to improve yourself and be "the best version of yourself" with tips on lifestyle habits, understanding beliefs, and personality. I'm not as intense about it as Treadwell, but I did identify and understand his actions.Treadwell was an optimist, he had a sunny outlook on the world around him, even if things were dark to him. Werner Herzog seems to weigh down his films with a grim outlook, even citing this in the documentary, saying he thinks the universe functions on "chaos, hostility, and murder." Therefore, the subject matter and the creator balance out. There's craftsmanship from both authors here. Grizzly Man represents its subject with accuracy, while still allowing an identification gene to be born from it.Rating: 8/10Grade: A</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this documentary. Right from the get go, you know that you're going to hate Timothy Treadwell. He was annoying right from the first scene, and when you know that he died, you feel no remorse whatsoever while watching him and his closet-homosexual antics with creatures that, as in the words of one of the interviewees, "probably thought he was retarded".Two things that bugged me are:1) Treadwell's friend Warren Queeney.He is such a douche-bag. He seems to be attempting to do a screen test for some stupid melodrama acting job or something. He gives this really forced monologue, complete with wrinkled-brow looking-in-the-distance, unnatural pauses for dramatic effect, and amateurish looking deep into the camera, about when he found out Treadwell was dead. It's embarrassing to watch.He is awful, and I can't believe he has ever had any acting jobs other than commercials for car insurance or something. Looking him up on here, I'm astounded that he had some actual work.2) His ex-girlfriend, Jewel Palovak. Whenever she opened her mouth it seemed scripted.As the documentary goes on, Treadwell gets odder and odder. It's like he was going crazy, and he probably was. His pathetic hissy-fit about a cub being cannibalized, and the attempted rerouting of the stream so salmon can get through, make you hate him even more.I have never known someone who died such a tragic and horrific death, who I didn't feel even slightly sorry for.Anyway, this is a great documentary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bloody tosser is what comes to mind seeing this documentary, sure great story, nice scenery, lots of nice critters, birds, butterflies, flowers, and lets not forget huge man eating bears that eat you if they feel like it. I think its great to look after nature, protect all the animals, preserve the forest and so on, but what this air head does by coming close to wild animals is wrong. It makes bears get used to people's smell, and in time could and will endanger the bears own life's, and to top it off airhead and his girlfriend got eaten. Wild animals are to be left alone, for their own sake. Overall a good story but very irresponsible behavior by a tosser.8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In summary, it's a documentary following the summers spent in the Alaskan wilderness by Timothy Treadwell. Treadwell is an energetic, sensitive guy who is out there alone, observing and interacting with the bears. His hope is to show people that bears are beautiful creatures, instead of dangerous beasts. The result is a highly emotional and disturbing introduction to a man, whether you like him or not, that you would want to meet.I've never seen a documentary by Werner Herzog, but after seeing this, I would love to. He presented this story brilliantly, giving the viewer just enough information. By the conclusion of the film, I really felt like I knew Treadwell. This is because Herzog included footage shot by Treadwell himself; he was out there alone (ehh..) with a camera, and the camera turns into a confessional kinda thing, which makes the movie that much more effective.I get why there's so much debate over personal feelings regarding Timothy Treadwell. One side sees him as this environmental wacko and the other side sees him as a funny, caring guy. I personally felt that although his mission was too much, he was a good guy. The cool thing about Grizzly Man, though, is that whether you like him or not, it's a great documentary.It's educational, it's incredibly interesting, it's emotional when it needs to be, but not too much, it's very funny, and it's a beautiful portrait of this man and the bears. It's a really great film. I definitely recommend it, and I want to buy it for sure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grizzly Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From director Werner Herzog (Nosferatu the Vampyre), he directs, interviews and narrates in this critically acclaimed human and animal study documentary. Amateur grizzly bear expert Timothy Treadwell, who journeyed across Alaska studying and living with these beautiful, dangerous creatures. Sadly his love for the animals was so strong, that he was attacked and eaten by a bear, along with his girlfriend Amie Huguenard. Using the footage left by Treadwell, Herzog pieces together the story of his life with the bears, and he talks to the people who knew and liked him, including Warren Queeney, Willy Fulton and Jewel Palovak. It should be said that Treadwell was a very eccentric (and quite camp) character, who was so in love with the bears that he became paranoid, a little aggressive about hunters and other people spoiling the habitat, and believing so much that he was almost saving the world. His passion however was meant very well, and he captured some extraordinary footage, not just of himself, but also the bears he cared so much for, and even knowing his tragedy, it is a wonderful docudrama. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this documentary to be captivating on many levels. Beautiful scenery, interesting story, and a glimpse into the mind of an extraordinary man, Timothy Treadwell. I hear a lot of people criticizing him, but I think he was just a regular person with issues, just like most of us -- but he just handled things in a different way than most. We all want to get away from people at times, and we all enjoy the beauty of nature. It seemed that society rejected him, and then he took refuge out in the wild, where he felt most at home. I see him as a true adventurer and nonconformist, and his death was a real tragedy which will not soon be forgotten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Timothy's "work" more for him than the bears.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I am sorry that this troubled guy lost his life. I wouldn't go as far as saying he deserved it, but his death was to be expected; I think there's a great reason that humans and wild animals live apart, and always should.That said, this film was a letdown. Aside from Timothy's CONSTANT reminders that he's doing a lot for the bears, I didn't really understand what exactly he was doing other than keeping himself entertained in his little private bear fantasy world. From the first clip of Timothy, he's instantly unlikable and self congratulatory about the "work" he's doing. He's like one of these people that give themselves nicknames.As the film progresses, it becomes more evident just how troubled this guy was. Again, I want to stress that I don't think this dismisses his death, but, as a film viewer, it's less tragic when something like Timothy's tragic end happens to someone you don't really care for.The story is interesting, but I would have liked it much more had the main character been a bit more altruistic and a bit less annoying and self-centered. I believe Timothy was doing more for himself than the bears. His private sanctuary gave him something to do and it wasn't clear to me that the bears got anything out of it.It reminded me of a clip from "Born Free" where her husband realizes that Joy Adamson (right name??) has interfered in the natural course of the cubs' lives and has caused possibly irreparable harm by interfering. Joy, to her credit, agreed and turned everything around for the benefit of the animals. She successfully un-domesticated the cubs and set them free. She also agreed never to touch any future offspring, no matter how tempting. All interference was undone.Timothy ain't Joy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A major waste of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I read the great reviews by major film critics and the numerous awards this movie received, it made me want to see this documentary. I was very surprised that I was unable to watch "Grizzly Man" in its entirety. I could not get past the 30 minute mark. To be fair, I did not give this movie a vote but I suspect that I would have given this film a 1 or 2 out of 10. I had more sympathy for the bears that for the subject of Werner Herzog's documentary, Timothy Treadwell. I am not a medical professional but it seemed obvious to me that Treadwell had some major psychological and social problems. I found Treadwell to be an annoying individual who put his own life and his girlfriend's life in danger and interfered with the bears in their natural environment.It's very rare for me to give up on any movie. I have stuck with some very bad movies until the final credit was shown on screen. "Grizzly Man" was a major exception and I do not expect to watch this movie in its entirety in the future.Update: I saw an unreleased short which parodied "Grizzly Man" and that short film was more entertaining than the first 10 minutes of the original. The original documentary was so serious, it is ripe for several parodies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a horror &amp; Sci Fi fan, so I have seen some of the most graphic movies available. I enjoyed some moments, especially the bear fight where one pooped in middle of battle. But you can see the up &amp; down emotions of this man, as he appeared to be a bit on the paranoid-skitzo, as he was trying to treat them as pets at times. What annoyed me the most was I bought the movie with the understanding there was the scene where he was eaten...but that was never shown...nor was the audio played...which made this a bit of a waste, as the movie was mediocre at best of a disturbed man trying to find his path in life. Some of the people who knew him gave colorful interviews, but I loved the one towards the beginning where one of the men said the bears usually left him alone because they probably thought he was retarded. Lets put it this way....you must watch the movie not in a "straight" state if you know what I mean...lol</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Salvation via grizzly interaction...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A radical and unusual concept; Tim Treadwell was certainly an interesting person, even if he may also have been bi-polar, desperate, suicidal, passionate, and unorthodox.At first, I had only briefly heard about his story. So when watching the first hour, it seems mildly interesting, that he decides to camp at a federal preserve to "protect" the grizzlies.Director Herzog does a very objective and professional representation; we see many different comments, including one from a bear biologist who is rather matter of fact when he states that he does not really understand Treadwell's psyche, but that bears while beautiful and intriguing also have a world of their own, which no human could really enter into without devastating results.A few have commented on the coroner. While he does give us the feel for the death of these two people, he is a bit of a ham, and seems to also have lost out on a casting call for some TV show or other.That being said, this is a very interesting documentary. It is not the usual fare, as we also have the pathology of Treadwell's issues thrown into the mix. This is not necessarily a bad thing, although he does go off a bit; and when on a high, it is easy to imagine his audition for "Cheers". How sad if that really was the cause of his downward spiral, as suggested by Treadwell's father.Some of the footage is incredible; the bears capering and playing, and the later shot of the killer bear, as he dives to the bottom of the river, hunting for salmon. This shot alone evokes reaction from the audience, in that the bear appears playful and happy (to a human) when we become anthropomorphous this is perhaps our downfall. The narrator noted that the bear was starving at that time, desperate for food, and capable of eating a human.Treadwell did respect these animals though, and for that I give him credit. I do not agree with reviews complaining about PETA and extremists. Anyone who reads up on factory farming and some practices of hunting will realize there are many atrocities still being committed, and Treadwell has hopefully contributed to public awareness. While it is certainly tragic that he and his companion died, it is noteworthy that he had worked with the bears for thirteen summers, and most likely had a notion of the possible risk. 9/10.</fullReview>

It was touching to see a man, broken from alcohol drugs and a failed acting career finding his on peace out in the wild. The other thing that interested me was that he recorded every part up to his death, even the bear that killed him (olly) and he always said that he wouldn't want to be killed by a bear not because he'd be mutilated but because he didn't want that bear to be killed. I will admit sometimes he was a bit overzealous but It was nice to see someone who had found what they were looking for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Far from not acknowledging the cinematographic achievements this documentary may have and definitely has, I must admit that watching it made me feel very uncomfortable. The documentary is somehow a reflection of our time and fascination for the reality TV - it is a sort of a big brother TV-show in the wild. it exploits the 'united freaks' (its characters) and exploits their intimate information to the point that you start to think whether some journalistic ethics should have played a part. It shows the life of a very unbalanced person but seems not to celebrate the fact that this person chose to live the way he did and paid the price he knew that he might have to pay. When the director listens to the famous tape, the scene is so repulsive in its hypocrisy that its voyeurism is sickening. I don't think the director tried to understand the person whose life he is 'documenting' but wants to present a some kind of a photography of craziness almost as a clinical case - but shouldn't there be some kind of limits of what we are allowed to exploit of other people's lives?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly tragic definitely not comic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having read some of the comments for this film I have to disagree with this being a humorous film. The characters in it are very real, and sometimes it is very painful to watch them coping with life. Everybody suffers in this world, but some suffer more than others and that's not something to laugh at. On another point, whatever one may think of Werner Herzog, he is undoubtedly a formidable personality and gigantic film director. Reducing him to a character from a Mel Brooks film, as one commentator suggested, is silly and ignorant. However, I speculate on what might be more frightening, having a confrontation with a killer brown bear or a confrontation with Herzog.My feelings about Treadwell are that yes clearly he had emotional problems but at the same time he had found is own outlet to cope. The positives and negatives of his actions can be weighed up but I believe he was ultimately a fairly harmless character who meant well. Ultimately, it's hard to imagine the story having an ending any different to him being killed by the very things he loved so much.Finally I wonder whether Treadwell secretly had a deathwish and that being the personality he was that deathwish would one day come true. My reasons for believing this are that he wanted to be at one with the bears so much that the only way he could do this would be to be devoured by one. It's a little like being in love for the first time and with such intensity that you want to be one with the other person. It's an immature feeling but perfectly understandable also. The description of his moaning as he was being killed could also suggest that he was in ecstacy rather than agony at that moment. My view may sound crude and callous but as Herzog mentioned that is the way of the world.The result is that life is paradoxically tragic and beautiful at the same time. Treadwell is well atuned to this as illustrated when he focuses on the bee that seemed to have died while collecting pollen. Perhaps this is the films message, and why it should be regarded as a piece of art rather than a simple documentary, an episode of South Pk or whatever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If Klaus Kinski were alive today...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If Klaus Kinski were alive today...He would have kicked that grizzly ass!Werner Herzog, one third of the triumvirate head of New German Cinema, has enjoyed a long and illustrious career galvanized by films dealing with the haughty concept of man suffering under the unflinching weight of his desires (check out the aptly titled BURDEN OF DREAMS). Common themes dealt with include selfishness, oppression, hubris and of course the brutal honesty (or honest brutality) of nature. The story of Timothy Treadwell is so dominated by such virtues/vices, it almost seems as though it were all a prelude to a Herzog film.Herzog's austere documentary style (one of his earlier documentaries, THE LESSONS OF DARKNESS, is nearly silent except for a haunting Wagner/Stravinsky score) serves the subject matter well. We are left to provide our own judgments on Mr. Treadwell, an ebullient, humorous and (surprisingly) fiercely angry soul on a severely misguided crusade (he was protecting animals in a wildlife refuge!?). After watching a few hours of his video confessionals, it doesn't take a PhD to diagnose that he was severely bipolar.I expected a polarizing picture with the director painting his subject in contrasting hues. What we get is a surprisingly even portrayal, despite Timothy's violent fluctuation in mood between takes (some even seconds apart). There are no interviews that spout vitriol, although some hate mail is shared. And those in Treadwell's support circle do not try to canonize the man for his actions. They all seem to have basked in the glow of his enthusiasm and sincerity, but nobody seems to have shared his "mission." I feel that they actually seem to acknowledge the error of his ways, short of verbalizing this sentiment. There are no regrets, however, because they all knew this was how the man they loved wanted to go.Fans of this documentary will be well served to find Richard Proenneke's ALONE IN THE WILDERNESS, a sublime account of one man living entirely alone in Alaska for 30 years. The contrast between himself and Treadwell is astounding. If Proenneke were a god, poor Timmy would probably be the Antichrist! The former filmed his video journal to show his family he was OK, Treadwell's filming was a transparent attempt at notoriety (tv stardom, to be precise, but the term "stardom" seems inappropriate) or at least as a tool to widely spread his message. Proenneke was gentle and appreciative of his new habitat, but he would most certainly shoot a bear if it attacked him. Timmy was so grandiose, i don't think the believed a bear would ever threaten him to the point that such action would be necessary. I quietly speculate how much effort he spent in escaping his final encounter.Treadwell inevitably perished not because of his hubris or delusions (in one particularly animated scene, he spews profanity proclaiming that he "conquered" the land. Could this have been the beginning of the end for him?) but because of his inability to function in human society. He probably could have helped himself, and especially the natural resources he was trying to protect if he could have worked with other humans, but perhaps Treadwell's greatest flaw was that he couldn't share nature. He saw himself as the feral king of his private natural empire and he absolutely could not share it. Upon second viewing this became very apparent to me, and my judgments of the man much harsher. His rage at photographers' trying to provoke a bear to stand for a photo do not seem rooted in concerns for the bears safety at all. Timmy is furious that there are other men with HIS bear! I imagine that he had several companions over the years before Amy Huguenard, but none could ever appear on camera because there wasn't enough space in Timmy's Alaska for anybody else.8/10* Great documentary! For fans of Herzog, a must!also see: ALONE IN THE WILDERNESS</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly wonderful film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Grizzly Man is one of the greatest examples of a human character study ever committed to film. Whether the central character, Timothy Treadwell, intended to record his life in the wild in such a way is unknown. This film provides an insight into the life of a man who was immensely troubled by the 'new world' and sought solitude with nature. He recorded over 100 hours of footage in which he filmed wild grizzly bears in the American outback. He got so close to the bears that he would stroke them and tell them that he "loved them". Within Treadwell's study of bear's lies a study of himself that director Wernor Herzog has uncovered. The resulting documentary shows a man in turmoil. There are moments that those watching will surely identify with Treadwell; at the same time it is clear that Treadwell himself was lost. So far gone are his beliefs in the righteousness of the bears and his role as 'protector' that it echoes strongly of religion. This film shows what the human spirit and belief is capable of; whether watching invokes fear or admiration depends on the viewer. Regardless of whether Treadwell was reckless in his actions or righteous, what cannot be denied is that Treadwell has provided the world with both; unprecedented and unique unseen footage of bears, yet perhaps more intriguingly, an insight into the elements of the human spirit that we all have; and yet seldom use. Liking this film is not a case of liking the central character, but recognising that Treadwell's actions were both incalculably brave yet incredibly foolish. Director Herzog puts his own view across; on Treadwell's story, in a way that is non-intrusive to your own view, however, Herzog's views are sound and in many ways utterly correct. The Treadwell character study is the main focus of this documentary, yet the bear's provide a wonderful, and metaphysical, backdrop to this unique story and truly unique film. For anybody who is interested in the human mind, why we do things, why we are compelled by things, why we can hold such strong beliefs, this film is absolutely unmissable, there is nothing like it. A truly inspirational and pioneering documentary.</fullReview>

There was no imagination and no originality in his film-making and the whole story was summed-up in the first few minutes, leaving me wondering why I should bother watching the rest of the movie. No effort was made to hide cuts during interviews and the parts he had staged to assist in telling the story were wooden and embarrassing to watch. To add to this, the sound dub was terrible and I found myself constantly turning the volume up and down.This documentary would have been lovely as a 30-45min TV piece - but why a 2hr film?

		<shortDescription>Timothy Treadwell - Ecological idealist or someone who cared for bears?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This documentary is a sort of reflection on a man's life. In this case, German director Werner Herzog puts together footage shot by Timothy Treadwell and his own documentary footage to make a highly interesting film about an ecological idealist, in this case Treadwell. Treadwell loved bears and the Alaskan wilderness. His footage is both sentimental idealism and some of the best footage of bear behaviour in the wilderness. From this documentary, Treadwell genuinely cared about bears and felt they were in danger from mankind and the outside world in general. His footage documents life in a sort of wilderness, his interaction and affection with his fox friends and his love of bears. Herzog tries to put together the pieces AFTER his death. He interviews the coroner who appears a bit stage managed and Treadwell's friends, all of whom come over as very affectionate and very loving and respectful of the man. To me, he seemed as if he was the epitome of the term "do no harm.". Unlike other people in the wilderness when confronted with bears, he didn't shoot them and he did get very up close and personal with some of them. The only tragedy is that he eventually lost his life, but was it really a tragedy? To love a creature and then be killed and eaten by it, in an area that you loved? For him, that was probably the ultimate end and the world is all the poorer for it.</fullReview>

If Tim really was an activist, he would still be there in the flesh to protect the critters, but he is not. Amy mentioned Tim was "hellbent on destruction" and in the last scene in the grizzlymaze shows him as being very aware of their very dangerous location. He even states that anyone there at that time of year deserves to die by bear. I do not think he should have brought his girlfriend with him when he obviously intended to make that his last summer and last video segment. I am convinced he committed suicide and possibly used Amy as bait. His research was immediately negated once he prompted the last audio scene. If he really cared about the critters, he wouldn't have made them responsible for his death that he intended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a documentary based on the life and death of Timothy Treadwell, and his video footage of living amongst the grizzly bears in Alaska. Werner Herzog puts it all together, adding interviews, music, and even some of his own distinctive thoughts. While I do feel that Treadwell was a confused nut who was just begging to be mauled over by these animals, it all makes for a pretty fascinating watch. Though his up close and personal interaction with the bears is a questionable practice, to say the least, Treadwell does record some cool wildlife footage. Several of the Herzog interviews do seem like they could've been staged though (like the crazy doctor, who could double for Lloyd Kaufman) but they all add to the eccentric flavor of the film. At any rate, I enjoyed the movie, despite my thoughts on Treadwell, and I have to wonder why it didn't get nominated for Oscar.</fullReview>

The coroner, his ex girlfriend and other lady friend also seemed a bit nutty too.This guy did not belong in the wild with grizzly bears, more so he belonged in a mental asylum with a video of Grizzly Adams, real shame he probably still would have been alive if that was the case.I really don't know what to make of this film - whether it was made as a documentary or a "serious" movie.Found myself feeling quite sorry for the guy at the beginning of the film but toward the end you could obviously tell that he wasn't all there....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Treadwell broke every unmentioned law of natural boundaries. With most of the bears, he formed a bond unbroken for 13 years. I read some of these comments saying that he cared only for the bears, or that he deserved to die because he invaded on their habitat. This is just foolishness coming out in people. Even on one occasion he films a bumble bee laying dormant on a flower, and tells the bee he loves it, AND he keeps a close friendship with all the foxes as well. This man didn't impose on the habitat as some suggest, but rather made himself part of it. He simply blended in with the wild and didn't impose at all, which is why he was able to survive for 13 years among them. In essence he was part of the wild. Also, some people say they could never find out what he was protecting. In Alaska, for 13 years NO poaching incidents were reported where treadwell resided. 1 year after his untimely death over 8 were reported in the season where he would have been there. This man DID protect all wildlife. He was a dark, troubled man but he was a man with a mission to fulfill and reached a point of enlightenment that most humans only dream to achieve. 13 years he did this, and defied the boundaries. He knew he was going to die in his "home" but simply didn't care. He was killed by one of the only grizzlies he did not befriend at the park, an old already human tormented animal on the edge of survival. This film had a melancholy feel to it and a somewhat fitting depressed feel about it. There are some generally beautiful scenes in this movie and some of the most gripping animal footage ever caught on video. The only pet peeve I have about Grizzly Man is the narrator sometimes inputting his own opinion into a story made only for the man who lived it. I think he should let the viewer make up his mind, and keep it a documentary. Also, a little more focus on the wildlife instead of Treadwell would have been appreciated. Overall this is still a pretty good flick and has some great imagery. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What I love about IMDb is the recommendation that appears at the end of the summary. In this case, IMDb recommends ... Legends of the Fall! Can someone please tell me why someone who liked this movie might like Legends of the Fall? How about Bio Dome (Treadwell abandons society; two anti-social characters abandon society by entering a large glass construction in the desert - sounds hot!) or Battlefield Earth (Grizzly = Humans in the future; Treadwell = some crazy Scientologist based apparition from the future)? Well, lets see the plot for Legends of the Fall: "Epic tale of three brothers and their father living in the remote wilderness of 1900s USA and how their lives are affected by nature, history, war, and love ... and how they are dragged away by Bear 141 screaming in shock and agony as their loved ones scream and scream ..." Ahh, I stand corrected.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grisly tale of the Grizzly man.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an outstanding documentary on an un-ordinary human being. Herzog competes his gallery of obsessive and self destructive characters with the story of Timothy Treadwell, an ideal heir of Aguirre and Fitzcarraldo.This time though, having at hand several hours of real film footage shot from the man itself, Herzog decides of delivering his tale through the medium of documentary. Of his own Herzog adds plenty of interviews with both followers and detractors of Treadwell and he doesn't even shy from expressing his views while functioning as narrator at times. What we end up with is a perfect, 360 degrees portrait of a borderline insane yet totally humane character that you'll love or hate or both, but you won't be indifferent to.Absolutely indispensable viewing for both eco-activists and their detractors; forget about "An Inconvenient Truth" and "March of the penguins", this is the markpiece from which any other modern documentary should be judged.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Good Movie and an Amazing Person</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From watching the movie, Timothy Treadwell was an amazing person. It has nothing to do with being an animal activist or anything. It's that he had such a great passion and he died for it. In certain parts it has bits of his journal and he states he was willing to risk his life. He knew it could happen. The movie is really a very happy movie. Nobody lives forever and he probably wouldn't want to die amongst any other than the bears and the fox. He wouldn't be happy wasting away on a bed, too old and weak to see the animals again. The movie has so many joyful, funny moments. No person or movie is perfect, but this is as close as it gets. He would be so happy to know it was made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch it for the unintentional comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A decently shot and produced documentary about Timothy Treadwell, an aspiring environmentalist who goes to live with the bears and protect them.......in a preserve. Yep, that's right, he's protecting the already protected bears. What can be be protecting them from? That's the big mystery. Certainly he didn't protect them from himself; he caused one of them to get shot.The unintentional comedy is the best part; you can't help marvelling at the hubris and naivete on display. Even though Herzog tries his best to edit the commentary from those who knew Treadwell, a lot of disparaging remarks get through.Watching him interact with the bears is one of the funniest things in the film; despite his calling to protect them he obviously doesn't know much about bears. He tends to humanize them and talk to them as if they were babies. Well, he definitely paid the price for that mistake.This documentary would serve as a good object lesson for those uninformed and misguided people who want to get back to nature in some unrealistic way: nature will eat you and gnaw the bones.Is it enjoyable? Yes, it certainly is, in the way that Dumb and Dumber was enjoyable. I suppose all of use like to see a stooge once in a while, if only to make us feel better about ourselves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wtf?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There were times that I couldn't decide whether this movie was a comedy, drama or just plain weird. Timothy Treadwell wasn't a "savior", he was a stupid guy who met his match appropriately. The only unfortunate thing about this man's death was the fact that he needed to bring his girlfriend along with him. In every clip I wondered how schools allowed this man to come in and talk to children. There were obviously deep psychological flaws to Timmy, and he was nothing more than a deranged camper. If he were out to protect bears, he did a fairly mediocre job.This movie wasn't very well put-together. Unless the director was trying to show me how much was wrong with Timothy. Some of the clips were inappropriate to the theme of the movie. I didn't need to hear about Timothy's girl trouble, or see him touch a pile of crap because it was a part of his "bear-child". I felt no sympathy whatsoever for him. I don't think he "found himself", and I think it was selfish what he did to those bears. Wild animals are just that, and I don't think he should have attempted to domesticate them, as it appeared so with his fox friends.This could possibly be one of the worst, most boring documentaries I've ever seen. I found myself wishing by the the end that they would just go ahead play the audio clip already, or I threatened to nod off. I will not recommend this movie to anyone- human, bear or otherwise. Unless they need a good laugh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>intriguing... very conflicted film content</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this via Discovery Channel (thanks to the Cosmos for DVR!). As someone who lives with bipolar disorder, Tim was clearly bipolar. So to me, his craziness is very familiar and unthreatening. Most reviewers' negative commentary about his lunacy is just ignorant prejudice and nothing more credible than that. "Craziness" in humans doesn't discredit their "sight" or genius, it's just part of being alive. Tim was unique too in what he could "see" in the world, a sight few others had/have. His death was a logical outcome, a mere event. It's profane to claim he "deserved it" or that he was somehow "asking for it." Before seeing this film I'd read dozens and dozens of accounts and watched other footage about him as well as some outtakes from Herzog's film. That addtl matl provides a lot of the context that the film omits. Also, the chauvinist view that Amie's death is the tragedy ignores her as an adult human being with experience with bears and who made a choice. There is no shame in death, no matter how violent. It's part of life and just happens. We're animals too. I would love to have heard more of the Native POV, rather than merely the museum guy. Why did Herzog (who has done so in the past) not go to native people, their holy people to get more of a range of views? That was disappointing for me. Native people are like all human beings, every community has a range of opinion. All we get is a stand-in, one voice for a thousand. I wouldn't recommend Tim's choices to anyone. They were Tim's and I'm glad he made them. It serves as a marker, a warning and a benefit for the rest of us. We all have our own areas of genius and risk, and ultimately a moment to die. I wish the audio of his death was available, not for entertainment or casual consumption. But I believe that humans in the U.S. don't have the experience of death, violent or otherwise, that they desperately need. It would complete the marker of Tim's life. At least we have footage of his other experiences, and at least one native view that he did cross a line the local indigenous culture recognized and respected. Lesson learned. I'm glad to see the crazy actor and the savant naturalist altogether. Thanks to Werner for at least showing us that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Timothy Treadwell is surely one of Herzog's greatest unintentionally comedic documentary subjects. This film is a testament to the depths of human ignorance and stupidity. Treadwell is the poster boy for a life out of control, and certainly not in touch with the nature he claimed to know and love. Watch this movie and then go look up your favorite Darwin Award winners! Don't be fooled, this movie is not about the bears, it is about one man's struggle with his own sanity. What is most disturbing is not the fact that Treadwell and his girlfriend died as a result of his fanatical obsession, but that people can actually come to his defense at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A man who cannot deal with his sexuality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To me, this is all so simple. It is clear that Timothy "Treadwell" was a homosexual and that he could not live with that fact. To see him talking in the movie about how he doesn't understand why girls don't like him and how he sometimes wishes he were gay would be comical if it all didn't end so tragically. The "white elephant" that the director refers to in the film is not the audio-tape of the death of "Treadwell" (I use quotations around his last name as it is not indeed his given name)and his companion, but the fact that NO ONE in the movie dares to mention the patently obvious: that Timothy was a homosexual! He couldn't deal with it and left civilization for the comforts of Alaska and the bears and foxes that could not question his sexuality. And another observation I would like to make is this: when Timothy 'discovers' the stacked rocks and the single rock with the smiley face drawn it...has anyone stopped to consider the fact that he did this himself?! He did it to make his life look more exciting and dangerous. He wanted the viewer to think he was in peril from the humans he fought to protect his beloved Alaskan brown bears from (I don't think they were actually grizzlies at all as they are far smaller than these giants are) when in reality, he was in no danger at all. At least not from humans. And on the occasion when people really DID show up and lob some rocks at his beloved bears, what did he do? He hid timidly behind a tree! Some protector he turned out to be! I think this poor guy was as deluded as could be. The real tragedy here is the fact that his companion was killed and a bear was also. That is the sad part about this movie. I will say one thing for Timothy. Stupid or not, misguided and ignorant about how to deal with wild animals or not, the guy had guts. It took some serious courage to go out there for thirteen seasons and live among these ferocious beasts. Why they didn't kill and eat him long before they finally did is a mystery to me. But I wouldn't get within a mile of one of those bears.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before I watched the movie I made a lot of judgments about Timothy Treadwell. I really had only heard the details I never understood him as a person. The movie gave me a closer look at him. This was never about the bears... this was all about Timothy Treadwell. He cared about the animals of course I'd not question that, but he definitely cared more about Treadwell then the bears. I thought that was all very obvious in his footage. I gave the movie an middle rating and I can't believe it actually got any awards. The footage of the animals is incredible but mostly due to the proximity which was definitely in violation of park rules or even common sense. I like how the film runs the whole gamut and covers all the angles. It'd have been too easy to just make Treadwell look like an idiot and more than he made himself look like an idiot. But it would have been to cheesy to just make him look like a hero, which he most definitely was not. They brought a lot of people together that were touched by what he accomplished which rounded out the film a bit. The movie was OK but I won't watch it again!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm going to review it, but not by complaining about how little concern he had for his life, but by tremendously admiring him.There are so many things I love about this beautiful work of art, love &amp; adventure. 1) The way its editing with all the exceptional, special stuff they left in that NO OTHER MOVIE would have the guts or glory to leave in. 2) The brilliant, warm, distinct narration. 3) All the people who appeared in it that had something valuable to say. 4) The stunning man-vs-bear scenes. 5) And most of all the man who is Timothy Treadwell.It's true that thats what it takes for a man to make a name for himself, as he put it before he was killed. But now since he's gone the world will not be the same... and we'll only have this magnificent movie to remember Timothy as the brave, passionate, free soul. So how can we thank him enough for giving his life, and then for Werner to come along and honour it? It's one of the most important films ever, documenting one of the most influential individuals ever. Somehow though I think he's still with the bears... in spirit or by reincarnation. Go Grizzly Man!!! Oh yeah, and fuk the park service! ;-)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now, why would anyone want to live with grizzlies? I keep driving down the roads near where I live and hope one day to spot a Florida black bear, but I have no intention of moving to the Ocala Forest and have them looking in my window. I leave that to the Rainbow people and those who are avoiding society for some reason - maybe because they have meth labs in their kitchen.But, for 13 years, Treadwell spent his summers with the grizzlies. This was his mission in life - a life that was scarred by alcohol and drug abuse. He found some peace in the wilderness and overcame his addictions. That's great, but you are still living with grizzlies! The footage he left us was tremendous, and it certainly added to the film and made it a pleasurable experience, but, make no mistake, this film is not about grizzlies, but about Treadwell.He was an interesting character, and I do mean he was a character in every sense of the word. I would not doubt that he was probably bi-polar and, had he been on meds, would not have done this. But, like many of us, the level feeling produced by meds is not the personality we wish to exhibit and so we quit them. I was fascinated by his paranoia at the end. At one point he used the F-word so many times (hence, the "R" rating) that I thought I was watching Tony Montana in Scarface.It was a great film and certainly deserving of the numerous awards given to it and to the director, Werner Herzog. If I was not already rooting for March of the Penguins, I would hope it won an Oscar. Maybe it will at least get a nomination.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grizzly Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Grizzly Man is a documentary about Timothy Treadwell a man who for thirteen summers went to Alaska alone to camp out with the grizzly bears. While there he would film them and when the summer was over he would travel around talking about the bears and what he has learned from them. Timothy eventually got relaxed and comfortable with the bears and they became his friends and he was very much against poaching or anyone who would try to harm the bears. Eventually, Timothy started a non profit bear appreciation group called Grizzly People. On the 6th of October in 2003 after he was going to be going home for the winter, Timothy and his girlfriend Amie Huguenard were attacked and killed by one of the bears. This documentary shows some of Timothy's own footage he shot with the bears and the film's director Werner Herzog goes around and interviews friends and families of Timothy to find out more about him. Winner of The LAFCA Award for Best Documentary/Non Fiction Film at The Los Angeles Film Critics Association Awards; The NYFCC Award for Best Non Fiction Film at The New York Film Critics Circle Awards; The SFFCC Award for Best Documentary at The San Francisco Film Critics Circle; The Alfred P Sloan Feature Film Prize for the film's director Werner Herzog at The Sundance Film Festival and The TFCA Award for Best Documentary at The Toronto Film Critics Association Awards. Grizzly Man is a fascinating movie about a very interesting man and subjects. The shots of Timothy Treadwell's own footage are beautiful to look at and just watching him with the animals and how he interacts with them is really quite astonishing. The film is also very well made and can be disturbing and also quite riveting at times. The film works on many levels. It works as a film about Timothy Treadwell, it works as a look at bears and nature and it works as a character study which is studying Treadwell and what he is doing. It makes us the viewer decide whether what he is doing is more harmful than good or if he really began to lose touch with reality. The film is thought provoking and it will you the viewer with your own thoughts, questions and opinions after you see the film. Grizzly Man is a powerful, disturbing and sometimes touching film about one man's life doing something he loved that eventually was the end of him.</fullReview>

What is so beautifully depicted by Herzog's fine direction and Treadwell's own intimate footage is not the tragedy of an apparent ironic death, but the majesty of a no-holes-barred life -- at least 13 summers worth of one. Regardless of one's agreement or disagreement with Treadwell's philosophy and opinions about the necessity of the protection of bears, it cannot be denied that he was living his life, on his terms and to a degree that most of us perceive as unfathomable. And he died in the midst of his personal nirvana, of the 'natural causes' of his most beloved environment. For me, this was not a sad or tragic story.Moving and fascinating, this is an exceptional film that holds up the complexities of our modern human condition against the simplicity and glory of a breathtaking natural backdrop.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Grizzly man tells the crazy story of steve-irwin-wannabe Timothy Treadwell who lived among brown bears in Alaska for 12 seasons before pushing a bear's limits and being attacked and eaten by one of them (as well as his girlfriend). The director Werner herzog has done a brilliant job by showing all the different sides of this story and focusing on certain characters in this story. Especially when certain characters were interviewed and the camera was left rolling for another 20 seconds just to "focus" on that particular person in isolation was really brilliant. To me the story is not about the bears; its about a troubled man fighting its inner demons and desperately seeking for attention. This story could just as well have been about Kurt Cobain or Jim Morrison. Timothy believed he was fighting a good cause (protecting bears) but as many people agree, bears are extremely dangerous creatures and to quote my favorite writer; Bill Bryson "The only thing nature requires from us is our absence". In the end he probably did more harm by making bears familiar to man. Anyway there is no right or wrong in this story, I believe protecting wildlife is good but maybe not in the way Timothy did it, especially as it cost him his and his girlfriends life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I find it amazing the lengths people go to in order to fool themselves into thinking they are doing something important. I guess it helped him (Treadwell) lead a terribly interesting life.What he was doing though, was not work. It was self indulgently moronic. He endangered the bears and other WILDLIFE (who seemed to be doing fine without his help) by acclimating them to see people as approachable. He was doing nothing that could really be considered research, didn't seem to be following basic principles of science that would have proved he had a reason to be there, he just adopted an idea that bears and other wildlife could be infantalized (not a word, I know but ?) and treated like misunderstood children. He was nothing more than an adventurous neophyte in his chosen field of "work".The people he surrounded himself with didn't seem too bright either (see ex-gf story in the movie about serving soup in a restaurant). Just the type of people you need around you to support dangerous indulgences.This movie is an interesting story about a self serving idiot. On that basis it is almost worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never knew Timonthy Treadwell existed before this movie. But sometimes, that can be a good thing. While his work will someday be appreciated when we wipe out Alaska and all of the bears and wondered what it used to look like, history will simply regard him as yet another loon with a death wish. I look at it in another way. He was a brave and stupid person that took a personal conviction and created beautiful images. Never has any documentarian dared to do something like this before, making us remember what life would have been like if humans never existed in the first place.I found his story very interesting, one filled with sadness due to his loss of reality and his appreciation for the daily struggles of nature. What I didn't like was Herzog's biased view of Treadwell. Sure, someone had to say it and tell us that he was crazy, but that's up to the audience. Any reasonable person would know that Treadwell was off the rocker, and we didn't need some snide German filmmaker telling us. Herzog may be a legend, but sometimes he should just shut up and let the story tell itself. Perhaps a Hollywood movie of Treadwell's life would have been better, leading us into origins of the false realities he conjured up in his head. Either way, the photography and the power of the associated images were incredible, and I thank Treadwell for providing all of this footage that a typical, scared, paranoid, ignorant American would never see. While his delusions may cloud his longevity, at least he left something substantial to validate his existence, which is more than most people will ever do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unsympathetic and riveting Grizzly Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Werner Herzog has long been my favorite director and though he's best known for films such as "Aguirre: The Wrath of God", Nosferatu the Vampyre", and "Fitzcarraldo" he's also an incredibly underrated documentary filmmaker and here he seemingly has found an ideal subject to analyze. Story is about Timothy Treadwell who along with his girlfriend Amie Huguenard were killed and eaten by a grizzly bear in 2003 but this film delves into who Treadwell was exactly as a person and why he spent every summer for 13 years living among the bears and foxes.*****SPOILER ALERT***** The story of Treadwell starts with his upbringing in New York State where he eventually went to college on a diving scholarship but after an injury he started to hang out with the wrong crowd and became a gun carrying alcoholic. After a failed career as an actor he meets Jewel Palovak and together they start an organization called Grizzly People and this is when he started heading to Alaska to spend his summers at the Katmai National Park and Reservation. Treadwell shot over 100 hours of some truly astonishing footage of the grizzlies in that area and during these tapes he talks of willing to die for these animals but not to die from them. Treadwell wrote a book and ended up on the David Letterman Show to talk about his exploits but there are some real questions to be asked such as what purpose did his being out there really accomplish?It would be easy to say that Treadwell was merely an eccentric but the truth of the manner is that he was an extremely angry man who had become totally disillusioned by life itself and the people that he had come into contact with. Herzog is no fool and he easily see's through Treadwell and correctly makes sure that the audience doesn't make the wrong assumption that he's portraying a sympathetic view of this man, because he's not. In a startling scene Treadwell rants and raves and drops F-bombs in the direction of the Park Service whom he blames as being against him but what the shot proves is that the reason he's out there to begin with is because of his perception of not fitting into the real world. Palovak has in her possession the audio tape that recorded the screaming deaths of Treadwell and Huguenard but Herzog correctly does not allow the audience to listen to what he hears for a few seconds and tells Palovak that she should burn it not only out of respect for the friends and family of the victims but more importantly because a persons death is a private matter. Herzog's approach to this film is what really works for me and at times during his narration I felt some real anger coming from his voice and his fair reaction helps diminish the perception that Treadwell was just a goofy guy trying to do good because his actions not only resulted in his death but the even more tragic death of Huguenard who was afraid of bears and didn't even want to be there! Herzog is a master at deciphering someone like this and his film is riveting from start to finish and I'm definitely hoping that I hear the title of this film when the Academy Award nominations are announced.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst Direction Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never seen such an awful movie in my life. Grizzly Man is a pathetic excuse for a film and definitely undeserving of the minor awards it has earned. Werner Herzog is a disgrace to film writers everywhere. His film is organized and written with the same quality as a high school essay. The editing is absolutely horrendous, as if the raw footage was just spliced together. There are awkward lengths of time when a shot is completed that nothing is happening. Herzog's interviewing skills are that of a child, and his ability to narrate this story is truly disappointing.Timothy Treadwell's raw footage is professional compared to the mess that Herzog has created. Though Treadwell himself can be classified as strange, weird, and flamboyant he at least knows the basics of creating a shot, and conveying the information he wishes to. The final product shows Treadwell capturing many takes of a scene until he feels it is right. It seems that Herzog closed his eyes, hoped for the best, and cut the first take of everything.There is a massive amount of stupidity portrayed IN the movie mostly centered on Treadwell's deadly adventures, but we soon become accustomed to his character and begin to expect him to do certain things. However, the stupidity exemplified OF the film cannot be disregarded. Movies in the 21st century should certainly have a better creative and production team than what seems to be high school students. For example the angles of shots taken when Herzog is interviewing resemble some sort of face-warping effect that one can create in any photobooth type program.In the closing sequence Herzog essentially pulls evidence out of his talentless ass, creating 'facts' from nothing. He asks rhetorical questions in an attempt to sound insightful and intelligent.At least Herzog does the audience a favor in recognizing that this Treadwell's footage is not so much a look into wild nature, as it is a look into ourselves. He even says admits that the point of this movie is not to point out the flaws, mistakes, or triumphs of Timothy Treadwell. With Herzog's last insightful line giving a decent ending the audience feels some closure.In conclusion, the screen writing of this film (if it can even be called film) is elementary, so much so that it crushes the potential for this touching story. Treadwell's improvised lines are many levels more professional than Herzog's methodically planned out script.I would recommend that Werner Herzog never again narrate, write, direct, or produce another movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Short &amp; sweet: I gave the rating of 3 only due to close up films of animal life and dangerous animal life at that. The self proclaimed 'protector' of the bears manages to call his extended stay camping trips "work" but never manages to say what that "work" is other than filming wildlife for the ultimate goal of making himself famous.The "star," as he would call himself, was nothing but a flaming gay who denied his self and claimed to be straight and into women. His attempt at commentary throughout his self filming was pathetic with scene after scene after scene of him saying "I love you" to wild animals and not much more.Was he in danger? You bet. Anyone could have done what he did but most everyone else doesn't want to get killed by a bear as he did. (The death is not in the film). Anyone could have walked into bear territory and put self at extreme risk. The film was like another film of a self proclaimed 'shark expert' who ended up nearly getting eaten by sharks but managed to survive and enjoy a malfunctioning, shark damaged leg for the rest of his life.What was his background? Well, one of his spacey, old hippie type, sprout eating "friends" said she met him while working at a restaurant where he was apparently a waiter.So, there you have it. He was a waiter who took a camera into bear territory and managed to avoid getting killed for 12 or 13 summers. As the helicopter pilot who was hired to remove the remains of the "star" and his "girlfriend" said post bear attack... "the only reason the bears didn't kill him sooner was because they probably looked at him like he was retarded. He got what he asked for. He got what he deserved." If you can't stand to listen to or watch exercise fatty Richard Simmons, you won't want to waste money on this film. One possibility, though, is to turn off the audio so you don't have to listen to the utterly stupid dialog and just watch the wildlife which, after all, is the "star."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This documentary is more about Herzog than Treadwell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Apart from the fact that Herzog should have hired a ghostwriter and voice talent (he doesn't know the difference between 'deduct' and 'deduce', and his accent is excruciating), his objective seems to be to focus on himself and his own opinions about Treadwell rather than simply letting Treadwell's footage speak for itself.For example, at one point Treadwell is going on about how he doesn't have a girlfriend and how it would be easier if he was gay (which he probably was, judging by other footage), and much later we find him lovingly stroking a pile of fresh bear dung. Had Herzog juxtaposed those two scenes and simply kept his comments to himself, the result would have been far more eloquent.Then there's the bit where Herzog films a glacier and compares it to Treadwell's tortured soul. But the glacier has no apparent connection with Treadwell at all. There's no evidence Treadwell went anywhere near it. So obviously it is included partly to make the documentary more cinematic (by breaking up the monotony of the Alaskan wilderness in Treadwell's footage), but mainly to give Herzog an opportunity to trot out his metaphors in a demonstration of how 'perceptive' he is about Treadwell. (A guy he never even met.) None of this gets us any closer to what made Treadwell tick.Then there's the point where Herzog tells Treadwell's ex-girlfriend to destroy the tape recording of Treadwell's death, as if he is somehow protecting her - and our - dainty little ears from the contents. But this is after he himself has already listened to it! In other words, while it's okay for Herzog to hear it, heaven forbid anyone else should.But the main problem is that, despite his 'insights', Herzog only skirts around the central issue, which is Treadwell's developing death wish. It's clear Treadwell committed suicide. He WANTED to be killed by a bear, and probably provoked it. It was no accident that the attack happened just before he and his girlfriend were due to be picked up. It's unlikely he wanted his girlfriend to be killed as well (he probably expected her to just run away), but like so much else in Treadwell's life, things didn't quite go according to plan. Herzog, unfortunately, seems to miss this entirely.So all in all, while the subject matter itself is fascinating, Herzog's treatment of it leaves a great deal to be desired.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not what I expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this with no prior expectations except maybe I expected to see a serious scientist studying bears. Not so. What I saw was at best an enthusiastic amateur who didn't really study bears like a scientist, but merely observed them and basically wished to be one of them. It wasn't made clear to me if he actually did anything of value with the film he took.But putting that aside, Tim Treadwell was a deeply disturbed and haunted man who had a very sentimental view of nature. Everybody with a modicum of common sense knows that nature is neither good nor evil, that she simply is. She can seem horribly cruel sometimes and Tim was unable to comprehend that in nature, life can be short and meaningless by our standards. And his idiotic rant sprinkled with various expletives that "animals rule!" towards the end of the film doesn't even merit further comment.However, I did find it interesting that Tim did manage to forge unlikely relationships with these wild animals.And finally, Tim's constant use of the F-word indicated to me a lack of education and vocabulary that was quite distracting from the film at times. If you want me to take you seriously, you must at least use a level of vocabulary that indicates you graduated high school.3/10 rating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have lived in Alaska my entire life (21 years) it's a cold brutal and dangerous area, the Americas last frontier, unless you count the ocean. Everyone who lives here learns quickly that certain animals are very seriously lethal, the two main ones being Moose (particularly mothers with young lings in the Vincenty), and the more ferocious less seen bears. There is also wolverines and variations of the mountain lion (however far less seen). Now I have had many encounters with moose and a few scarier ones with bears when I was very young, they all involved me going as quickly as possible in the other direction. Bears can run up mountains carrying animal corpses at 45 MPH. Also getting the sneak on a bear is nearly impossible because they have better sniffers than dogs. My point here being that this California couple might as well have opened up their cooler full of fish and let it sit out for the evening. It would have been another story had they been monitoring a water based species such as sharks, where you can avoid them entirely than I would have had a bit more empathy. If anyone becomes inspired by these poor dead fools. I HIGHLY recommend you do some damn homework and of course bring a very large caliber hand gun or rifle, I'd recommend a .45 and up for a hand gun, and a 30 OT 6 rifle will bring them down rather quickly though be sure to dodge if they charge. I realize this was more of a warning than a review regardless it is connected to the film and I think a good message to anyone who might get some not bright ideas. Just remember kiddies don't go stirring up s*it without a gas mask.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I am unclear as to whether Grizzly Man celebrates a life or exploits it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 100 years of keeping records in Alaska, less than 12 people have been killed by grizzly bears, according to German director Werner Herzog. Herzog's film Grizzly Man documents two of them, the first known bear killings in Alaska's 4.7 million-acre Katmai National Park. In October 2003, the bodies of environmentalist Timothy Treadwell and his friend Amie Huguenard were found near Kaflia Bay when a pilot arrived to pick them up and take them to Kodiak Island. A starving thousand-pound, 28-year-old male grizzly, unknown to the area had mauled Treadwell and Huguenard to death. The film tells the story of the self-styled protector of bears and co-author of the book "Among Grizzlies: Living With Wild Bears in Alaska." Treadwell spent more than a dozen summers living with bears in the area he called the Grizzly Maze and videotaped over 100 hours of footage during the last five years. Complemented by narration from Herzog, Treadwell tells his own story in front of the camera. He was an aspiring actor who dealt with drug and alcohol problems in California before he moved to Alaska in the summer of 1989. It is unclear how much of his determination to live among the bears resulted from his love of nature or from his need to escape his problems at home. In any event, he became a friend to the bears and developed a brash confidence around them, giving them names such as Mr. Chocolate, the Grinch and Sgt. Brown, and often getting so close he could touch them. Though the image of Treadwell is of being reckless and foolhardy, according to John Rogers, owner of Coastal Bear Tours who knew him, "his (Treadwell's) knowledge and understanding of bears was equal to the experience of any commercial bear viewing guide or bear specialist in Katmai National Park, better than most".Far from being delusional or failing to deal appropriately with nature and recognize its dangers, Rogers says, "he was not one to blithely walk up to a bear, he was cautious, even fearful, around bears he didn't know, but he developed relationships and mutual trust with a few individual bears over the years". Though the film raises complex questions that do not lend themselves to easy answers, it has nonetheless been seized upon by the corporate media to denounce environmentalists and those who dare to live on the edge of society. Treadwell has been called a nut, a certified madman, foolish, obsessive, an egomaniac, bipolar, paranoid and schizophrenic. While his on-camera behavior is often bizarre and at times repugnant, we don't know how much this represents who Treadwell really was or even whether Mr. Herzog selected particular footage to produce a desired effect.Bizarre or not, the fact remains that Timothy did what he said. He lived in open and honest communication with wild animals for thirteen long years, a feat that required mental and physical toughness, endurance, and commitment. In the process, he educated thousands of children by speaking in schools without compensation, and founded "Grizzly People", an organization devoted to preserving bears and their wilderness habitat. Though he does express admiration for his film-making ability, Herzog makes clear his antipathy to much of what Treadwell stands for. He refers to environmental activists as "tree huggers" and sees nature as "chaotic, hostile, and murderous". Treadwell's nature photography is beautiful, showing things that we may have never seen before, particularly a fight between two huge bears, yet Herzog cannot resist getting in a dig at unions with his remark that his footage is something "studio directors with their union crews could never dream of".Grizzly Man, under Herzog's direction, veers toward the sensational. In one sequence Treadwell demonstrates the emotional maturity of an eleven-year old in an expletive-laden rant against the Park Service, but the sequence has no time frame and no context. Herzog also criticizes Treadwell's celebrity status, describing him as "a star by virtue of his own invention." (He had appeared on David Letterman's Late Show, the Discovery Channel's Discovery Sunday, and other television programs.) Although interviews with people who knew Treadwell appear to be balanced, some of them seem staged for melodramatic effect. Herzog films Timothy's parents awkwardly clinging to Treadwell's childhood Teddy bear and we watch as he presents Timothy's still ticking watch to a former girlfriend, Jewel Palovak in a bizarre sequence that feels contrived. In another scene that can only be described as maudlin, the director listens to the audio tape of the bear attack (pretending to hear it for the first time) and cautions Jewel never to listen to it, yet at the same time titillating us with its contents.Many critics have called Treadwell delusional for thinking he was protecting the bears. Yet perhaps the most telling fact is that during his time in Katmai, no bear was known to have been killed by poachers. In the first year after his death, five bears were poached. According to leading Alaskan conservationist and filmmaker Joel Bennett, "The recent poaching of bears in Katmai National Park shows that Alaskans should never be complacent about the protection of their treasured wildlife resources. Tim Treadwell's vigilance may well have saved other bears from the same fate." Was Treadwell a friend of the bears or their worst enemy? Was he a man that only wanted to share his observations that grizzlies are not the ferocious beasts we have always thought them to be, or a sick egotist, obsessed with his own demons? It is hard to tell from this film. Perhaps the answer is a little bit of both. Though I am grateful to Herzog for exposing Treadwell's work to a wider public, I am unclear as to whether Grizzly Man celebrates his life or exploits it. "For now", in the words of friend Louisa Wilcox, "it is enough to honor the dead and celebrate a rare life, and the places and creatures he brought into ours."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nick Drake was a Brit singer/songwriter from the 70s. His acoustic guitar playing was average, the folk songs he wrote were largely forgettable. So why am I writing about him in 2006? Because he died at age 27.Let's not forget this important fact: documentary Grizzly Man would NEVER have been made if subject Treadwell was not killed on-tape in dramatic fashion, and you would NEVER watch this if your friend didn't say to you, 'hey, you seen the movie about the guy who gets eaten by a bear?' I suppose the reason we watch Grizzly Man is we wish to see the sequence of events which leads to Treadwell's death. We wish to analyze the man who chose to put himself in this danger. People without Discovery Channel may also enjoy the chance to see wild animals.Does director Herzog satisfy? No. We don't know what happened on the day of Treadwell's death. What went wrong? Did Treadwell 'show weakness'? Did he resist or fight? Could he have possibly encouraged the attack? Treadwell the man remains a mystery. His camera confessionals speak volumes, some facts are given for background, but interviewees seem phony and irreputable. Instead of illumination, Herzog contributes nothing but doubt and suspicion. A good director has better techniques of sparking discussion than just by leaving questions unanswered.So why 6/10? Thumbs down to Herzog who capitalizes on the sensationalism of this story, but thumbs up to Treadwell who unintentionally inspires. He's deluded, narcissistic, full of sh*t... viewers could find unlimited number of reasons to criticize his motives and his actions, but I choose to look at his result. He's a f*ck-up who harnessed his passion and had the carry-through to capture some wonderful images and have experiences with nature which you or I never will.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Unfortunate, Empty Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over the last few years, I have heard many opinions regarding this film - some pro, others con. Until today, I hadn't had the opportunity to actually see the film. I had already read many of the reviews on this page and couldn't understand why I had heard so many negative opinions. Today I know why. My advice to anyone who hasn't seen this film: Don't waste an hour and forty-five minutes of your life on this worthless drivel. The documentary follows a portion of the life of Timothy Treadwell, a misguided man-child who, for some reason never revealed, decides to spend 13 summers of his life living among grizzly bears on the Alaskan peninsula. While we discover early on in the film that he and his girlfriend have been killed by a grizzly, as the film wears on one must wonder why it didn't happen sooner. Clearly Mr. Treadwell chose to ignore one of the basic rules of nature: Dangerous, wild animals will eat their own when faced with a shortage of food. In addition, this foolhardy, self-proclaimed 'kind warrior' thinks of himself as a hero who is 'saving' the bears from the evil Parks Service and imagined poachers. Yet, although director Herzog uses a great deal of the video footage taken by Treadwell himself, not one bit of tape shows anything definitive perpetrated by his perceived villains, other than a rock being thrown at an oncoming grizzly bear by a group of photographers.To make matters much worse, Herzog presents a parade of Treadwell's bizarre friends throughout the film. In fact, the only characters in the film (including the director) that display any semblance of mental balance are the very people Treadwell seems to think are 'out to get him'. In one ludicrous scene, the watch Treadwell was wearing at the time of his demise is presented to a former girlfriend by the coroner. We're told beforehand that the watch was found on the wrist of Treadwell's dismembered forearm. The entire scene was concocted to elicit tears from the girlfriend - a concoction that fell flat on its face. Although the film contains some strikingly beautiful footage of the Alaskan wilderness, nothing can save the audience from the inane prattling of this young man and his acquaintances. Herzog should be ashamed of this disaster. The film, as well as the meaningless life of Timothy Treadwell, should be forgotten as soon as possible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Grizzly Man is the story of Timothy Treadwell. Who for some unknown reason takes up a voyage to Alaska to study Grizzly Bears. Treadwell has no formal training studying wildlife and no informal knowledge either. Treadwell's character is a general failure, who dropped out of college, and as a waiter set his tables on fire. Not exactly someone who should be idolized. As a university student completing my degree in zoology I was extremely offended by this film. I don't think Treadwell could have even given you the scientific name of the Grizzly Bear. His efforts were for the most part useless, as the bears in Alaska where he was haven't been poached in almost 30 years. The bears there are in no real danger. I feel that Grizzly Man gives the portrayal that environmentalists are all manic, overtly emotional people who curse at Park Rangers and slap bears in the face. I found it amazing Treadwell lasted 13 seasons without being eaten by a bear. This movie idolizes a man who should have been reprimanded for his actions. Besides the fact that Herzog is so arrogant throughout the movie that it's sickening.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have come away from this film feeling downright ripped off.The marketing literature claims that this film tells you as much about human nature as it does about the bears our main protagonist is "studying". I don't know where to begin correcting this.Firstly, as one guy tells us at the beginning, Treadwell seems to do more harm than good. He consistently violates park authority rules - which are there for the comfort of the bears and the safety of the humans - and rants about what a waste of time these rules are. In fact, he badmouths just about every human that comes into his head, notably in one extended diatribe about two thirds of the way through the film.It's like watching an extended episode of Big Brother set in the wild. We have a camp, insecure little nobody who purports to "love" just about everything except the authorities which are genuinely designed to ensure the safety of the bears. All he does is camp out (no pun intended) and try to get as close to the bears as he can and, in so doing, clearly annoys them. He constantly talks about "protecting" them and/or "studying" them, but all we see him do is film himself talking sh1t.He doesn't actually seem to know anything about the bears, nor does he do anything to protect them. In fact, he has nothing to protect them from, as is also made clear to us. The only exception comes in one scene where a bunch of guys are antagonising a bear (throwing rocks at it I think) and Treadwell hides behind a rock crying. Oh courageous warrior...Ultimately, he's little more a two-dimensional caricature of a insecure, repressed little man, whom one could have figured out in a ten minute short. The idea that this is a "study of a man's struggle with his inner demons" (as one review claims) is a farce. Nonetheless, we are dragged through 90 odd minutes of inane, self-important dribble which is supposed to pass as a significant insight into the human psyche.No.There is no insight into humanity, nor is there any insight into the lives of the bears. In addition, all of the "breathtaking", "awe-inspiring" footage he supposedly filmed, as is described so proudly in all of the marketing literature, is not included in this film at all. We barely see the bears unless his pompous face and annoying voice are in the foreground obliterating our view. All he filmed was himself talking a lot of contrived sh1t and crying like a little 15 year old pseudo-goth drama student when he comes into contact with the harsh realities of nature, which he claims to be so "at one with".All in all, this film is a complete waste of time. I am staggered that it received such unanimous critical praise. All I can say is that the critics must've been watching a different film to the one I just saw.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Treadwell yes, Herzog no</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Timothy Treadwell was a true American original, choosing to live a life of danger, discovery, and childlike wonder, during a time in history in which personal freedom was (and is) being increasingly curtailed. He explored how to live as a human amongst wild animals, by the rules of the animals. He discovered a great deal about himself, the state of the human psyche, the state of the planet, and much more, and documented it and shared it with style and heart.A star-struck and envious Werner Herzog posthumously wags his boring finger at a man who lived his life on the edge and had something original to say. Much like what he did in his doc on Klaus Kinski.Maybe it's fortunate that Herzog decided to lend his name to this project, allowing it to reach a wide audience, but rather than letting the movie to unfold on its own terms, he constantly and maddeningly injects his own schoolmarmish persona.At one point Timothy goes on a hilarious rant against all the people that have in any way obstructed his mission. This is clearly Timothy just letting off some steam, and not something he would have ever made public. And it's really funny stuff. But halfway through it Herzog starts accusing Timothy of being paranoid and biting the hand that feeds him. He simultaneously steps all over a wonderfully funny monologue, and utterly misses the point. He seems weirdly competitive with Timothy, and of course gives himself the last word.I also found Herzog's moralizing over the audio of Timothy's death rather hypocritical. He has no problem listening to it himself, but then turns around and sanctimoniously states that the tape should be destroyed. I think a strong case can be made that Timothy would have wanted that audio to be heard. In the course of the movie he repeatedly says "I would die for these bears," and that his death was captured on tape I don't think was an accident. Similarly, the decision to reveal Timothy's death at the very beginning of the film seems like an unfortunate concession to supposed good taste, and takes away from the rich drama of how Timothy's destiny unfolded.At the end of the film, over a close up of a bear's eye, Herzog tells us he sees nothing but primitive instincts in the eyes of these animals, as if he's made some big discovery, as if there is anything the least bit perceptive about that point of view, as if we didn't walk into the theater with that preconception. The great thing about Timothy is that he chose to look at reality through a personal prism, opening doors of perception and taking us on a journey to a place we've never been. And Herzog sits there going "no, reality is just boring old meat and potatoes." But despite Herzog's best efforts to turn this into a film about himself (and maybe to some extent because of it) Timothy's spirit shines through, making this an unforgettable movie.</fullReview>

Furthermore, Herzog is NOT a naturalist as is obvious when he opens his mouth and babbles something about how "the universe is chaos, hostility and murder." What a sourpuss.To anyone paying attention, it becomes obvious that this "documentary" is actually an opinionated COMMENtary from Herzog's biased perspective. For years, Herzog has been trying to tell audiences that "nature sucks" and that naturalists are wackos who invariably get themselves killed. If you agree with that statement, then you will definitely enjoy hearing it repeated for 2 hours. But if you're more sensible than that, you'll find yourself saying, "Wh-o-o-o-a, what sort of rhetoric is this director trying to shove down my throat?"If you keep this in mind while you're watching, you suddenly realize how obvious and tactless the film is. Herzog even steps on camera in one scene to try his hand at acting (lol). But he just can't act. He comes across as insincere, laughable and cheezy which is what this film becomes very quickly. Grizzly Man will certainly irritate you. But don't blame Treadwell. Blame Herzog.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eerie and paradoxical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frankly, I went hoping to hear first hand the grisly (no pun intended) footage of Treadwell and his girlfriend's death. It was frustrating and disappointing when Herzog took the higher moral ground of listening to it himself on earphones and making the audience watch his tearful reaction; then advising the woman, Treadwell's friend, who owned the tape, to destroy it.I thought the documentary was good when it delved into Treadwell's upbringing and past connection with friends; and his ability to find entertainment in narrating himself among the bears. It was eerie, how many times Treadwell paradoxically contemplated the method of his own death. The fact is, Treadwell was something of an odd, irritating person...apparently bi-polar, with manic highs and sobbing, sentimental lows. In some scenes as he narrates the bears behind him he practically acts like Pee Wee Herman among the Grizzlies. It is no surprise when some of the documentary guests state their beliefs that Treadwell "got what he deserved" from risking death in his delusional bond with the bears.I like everything, but the fact that Herzog would not allow the audience to hear the actual, final tape, or see photographs of the aftermath that are luridly described by a coroner but not shown.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What we have here is the story of a single human being who just had no place in the world. He was about as distanced from humanity as one could get, and the thing that he was closest to took his life. Timothy Treadwell, was a man who died on a Autumn day in Alaska from a Grizzly Bear attack. He was not much older than twenty. The last few years of his life were spent living in the Alaskan wilderness documenting himself with these creatures, trying to show the world that they are not monsters but animals and should be respected and eternally protected. The Alaskan bears became so accustomed to his presence that they treated him as one of their own. No bear laid a paw on him until that fatefull day. His mental instability led him to believe that he was the one destined to save this bear population from the harm of humanity, and ironically he was killed by one of them.Herzog is the ideal storyteller for this tragedy. Not only is he a non-bias, emotional thinker, but he specializes in human nature. The movie looks at Treadwell's life as a whole and not just the last chapter of it. It is clear that he had major troubles in the world, so it is no wonder that he felt tempted to cut himself off, but what he did is almost beyond comprehension. We go back and forth from the footage that Treadwell took with a handicam while he was in the wilderness, to Herzog interviewing the people in the Treadwell's life (and there wern't many)Grizzly Man probably deserved an Oscar nomination. The story is so heart-breaking, that it feels like more than a documentary. Herzog shows us a whole new side of humanity in one extraordinary individual.</fullReview>

People who have never seen another Herzog film and would doubtless shrink in confusion from Stroszek or from Jeder für sich und Gott gegen alle quit simply loved this film.Wonderful Herzog touches bring to mind Woyzek in sweeping shots of grasses blowing in the Alaska wind and these will delight the fan. Herzog proves himself a master documentarian and a charismatic screen presence even when he brings a slight touch of absurd comedy to the film (knowingly perhaps?) in having the Grizzlyman's "widow" destroy the tape of his brutal death.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tribute to The Bear Stalker...(Contains Spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Man, I am afraid of bears... that Treadwell guy who roughed it in Alaska was insane...Werner Herzog knew that the real horror of the film was a man who was his own worst enemy. Werner Herzog did a great job of exploiting Treadwell posthumously. I can't believe that one scene where Treadwell picks up a piece of fresh bear feces and caresses it. Perhaps, he got what he deserved ...if that guy was bothering me and caressing my bowel movement...I would have done something drastic too. Shoot me ...I sound mean...but honestly...it is inhumane to disturb the wild to the extent that Treadwell did. At one point, he was even rerouting water for the bears...why was he disturbing their natural habitat...intruding upon it the way that he did? Actually...he was STALKING THE BEARS. Furthermore, his ex girlfriend at home whom he replaced (with younger meat that was gnawed to death in the film -obviously not shown nor heard) was so ecstatic to have a cheap diving watch that was on his dismembered arm back...I'm telling you...some people out there are either not too bright or sick in general...she grabs the watch and says..something similar (not a direct quote) "oh, good, it still works..." While the average woman would be saying... "yuck...get that watch away from me..."Great film...Werner Herzog rules in exploiting a rare oddball self-proclaimed environmentalist who has done more harm than good. All this, done on a low budget...with the victim's footage. Amazing. Well, at least the victim is no longer upset that he didn't get Woody Harrelson's part on Cheers. Instead, he's famous for being an idiot character too but without the hassle of having to learn lines or be looking for another job after the stint of a long running sitcom--(actually short running had Cheers chosen him. Yes, I did write that this commentary contained spoilers even if everyone knows that this nature tampering Treadwell is bound to get mauled by angry bears from the onset whether you've seen the film or not.) Moral of the Story: Does a bear defecate in the woods? Yes, and heaven forbid... don't caress it... nor video tape yourself caressing it if you know what's good for you...</fullReview>

It seems he was just a loner who had a hard time in reality and tried his damndest to convince himself (under the pretense of his documentary tapes) that he "belonged" in the bear world and that he was "needed". I don't think the bears needed him at all, and I think it was just a sad story of one man's obsession to feel wanted.

		<fullReview>This movie or documentary is more like a portrait of an insane man. A story about a man that couldn't live with people and humanity. A man that went further and further in his insanity during the time-line of the film. If you expect beautiful nature and animal views, this movie won't give you what you're looking for. Instead you get the view of an insane man on nature and on bears. Luckily they give you the opportunity to choose for yourself. They don't show him as THE nature lover or bear lover in all his beauty. They give you a portrait of Timothy Treadwell and let you decide what you think of it. In this film you see that Timothy is more attracted by the idea of death and danger, always being around. More then nature or the bears itself. You don't see a real connection with the bears. The connection is more in his twisted mind. And again, you can choose for yourself to get your opinion. But as the end comes near, you see that Timothy is getting more and more insane, naming himself as the protector of the bears. And that when actually he doesn't do any good to them. He's more like Steve O from Jackass, showing the camera: Hey Look, how close I dare to approach those bears. And thats a good summary of this film: 1 and a half hour of the same Jack-ass trick. And those guys of Jackass are close to nuts. But this guy... has completely lost his mind and is over 100 % nuts ;-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a disservice to environmentalists</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Grizzly Man is largely a disservice to the environmentalist cause, and i suspect Herzog had a mixed agenda in doing it. Out of probably hundreds of hours of original footage to work from, he deliberately chose scenes where Treadwell sounds, looks and acts like a childish, closeted gay nitwit with no real knowledge of how nature works and a dreamy yearning to bring all those dangerous beasts into his own teddy-bear collection. There's even a scene in which the word PANSY is clearly to be seen on the side of a truck. That, of course, is EXACTLY the way environmentalists are often unflatteringly imagined to be and actually depicted and talked about by their right-wing, big-business, let's-muck-the-world detractors. So what's Herzog trying to achieve here?Prior to this movie, i'd never heard of Treadwell, so i had no preconceptions or sympathies to be confirmed or refuted by it. I say what i saw. He may well have been what Herzog edited him out to be. I mean, what could have driven Treadwell if not some sort of half-witted, troubled stubbornness that had in fact VERY LITTLE to do with real environmentalism? But the dynamics of film-making (the choice between what will constitute entertainment and what will not) makes Herzog's final cut seem like it owed more to a barely disguised anti-environmentalist agenda than to the actual heart-rending, bilge-ridden story he's telling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Treadwell's Anti social behavior</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I find it unfair of the director of this movie to turn Treadwell's work into some kind of study of abnormal behavior. According to the director, he was anti-social, but if the interviews that was shown to us, including parents that found it necessary to inform us that he use to smoke marijuana (what person born in 1957 didn't smoke it?), and an estranged girlfriend who claimed to have lived with Treadwell for 3 years and worked for him, knowing so little about him accept that he had a dark side, was any indication of the kind of people that surrounded Treadwell, I don't blame him that much for hanging out with the bears.I wonder what this director would have come up with if he did a documentary on Jane Goodal, Dian Fossey, or even the Crocodile Hunter on Animal Planet. Are these people also anti-social? Or is our society so snobbish that it won't take any footage of wildlife seriously that isn't recorded by a zoologist or scientist. I'm sure Dian Fossey's love of the gorilla she named "Digit" that she literally gave her life due to his death from poachers is just as fanatical as Treadwell's love of bears. Fossey even made gorilla noises to talk to the gorillas, and gestures that the gorillas would make, but nobody accused her of wanting to be a gorilla, though the director matter of factually told us that Treadwell wanted to be a bear for imitating their behavior.We were informed that Treadwell did over 100 hours of footage of bears in the wild, that he filmed them in their natural habitat so that the world would come to love them as he did, and this would help prevent them from being endangered, to be totally ignored as we were shown footage of takes and retakes, clearly footage that Treadwell meant to edit out, I'm also sure that Treadwell didn't intend for us to see him walking through the woods talking to the camera about his personal life either.Too bad we weren't shown too much footage of the bears in their natural habitat as Treadwell wanted us to see, who knows, we may have even learned something instead of getting crash course on human behavior.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Documentary about the man who lived and died with the Grizzly Bears of Alaska.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Treadwell died in 2003, after a number of years returning to spend the spring and summer with the Grizzly Bears of Alaska. They believe it was a rogue bear that did him in, after all his "friendly" bears had gone to their caves in what he called the "Grizzly Maze" for winter hibernation. That he was there at that time, at all, was a result of his immaturity and hot-headed response to disagreement. When he was to fly away, there was some question about his plane ticket, so his response in anger was to return to the wild, and that was the end of his story, and the girlfriend he had with him.I realize the significance of the tragedy of his death by Grizzly, and have no intention to minimize that. But the whole film, with interviews with Tim's parents, friends, and officials often looked and sounded like a Christopher Guess "mocumentary". I half expected Treadwell to appear at the end and say "Hey folks, I'm really alive." The film just had that silly tone to it.The film was interesting, if only to observe the absurdity of Treadwell himself. Almost all of the filming was done by him, with camera on a tripod, and his talking with a Grizzly or some other wildlife in the shot. He often spoke of being the "protector" of the Grizzly, but it never was clear what he thought he was doing out there to protect them. And his comments mostly were self-serving, drawing attention to himself and his "dangerous" adventure.</fullReview>

He said he loved the bears - I don't believe it. He only believed himself and wanted to get famous, but the way he chose is a very doubtful one.The bear is an animal and he is interested in food and sleep. He does not need this attention from a person that just walks around with a camera and disturbs his normal course of life. Consequently, the bear/bears just decided to get rid of the nuisance. It is that simple - nothing heroic...His friends, however, are even worse since they tried to get on the screen while mourning their friend. Shame on them!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The lives and deaths of Timothy Treadwell and his girlfriend Amie Huguenard in the wilds of Alaska are far from simple. Treadwell fancied himself a lone man holding back the evils of civilization from the bears he loved. As to whether he actually did that or any good is open to debate.Werner Herzog took the hundred plus hours of footage shot by Treadwell, adding his own footage of interviews with people who knew Treadwell and formed it into a documentary that tries to get into the mind of man and to understand what he was trying to do.(The film is almost totally silent about Huguenard, who barely appears in any of the footage and who's family and friends refused to speak to Herzog) Its a riveting portrait of an obsessive man who ultimately had his own view of the world and of nature. Its an up and down portrait that makes you think and feel and think some more as we travel along with Herzog in his attempt to get to know a man who died doing what he loved.As with many of the people that Herzog has profiled in the past you both love and hate the man, who turns out to be far more shaded than most black and white portraits ever are. Frankly I don't know what I think of Treadwell and his mission to "save the bears" since its never clear what he was actually doing other than being a "bear" himself. I'm troubled by the fact that the one time we see other people come close to the bears Treadwell remains in hiding as these "tourists" throw rocks at his friends. Its an interesting turn from a man who professes endlessly that he is keeping the bears safe. Which is the real Timothy Treadwell? I don't have an answer. Its a question thats going to be haunting me for several days to come. Its the sort of reaction I love to get from a movie since it forces you to think about what you've just seen instead of having it spoon fed to you.See this movie. Its a movie that shows you more than just cute little animals roaming in the wild. Its a film that makes you wonder about mankind and his place in the world and in the wild.

		<fullReview>I really thought this was more of a comedy than anything, it almost seemed like one of those Christopher Guest mockumentaries. I think i laughed more than anyone else in the theater (and the audience in general was laughing quite a bit). I think i probably thought it was funnier than it was really intended to be, i was laughing at pretty much everyone on screen, not just Treadwell. It really brought out the mean-spiritedness in me, almost like a Todd Solondz film. Everyone in the film struck me as pretty laughable, including his ex-girlfriend when she got his watch from the coroner. I thought that was pretty funny. I guess some people might be able to see Treadwell as somehow being a noble, heroic figure, or that his death was a tragedy, but to me he just seemed like a buffoon. He barely seemed like a real person, more like an Andy Dick character (except that Andy Dick really isn't that funny). He took some nice footage though. I should say too that this was the first Herzog documentary i've seen, and i was somewhat surprised by how in-distinctively Herzogian it was. Apart from his narration, i probably would have never guessed that it was a Herzog film. I guess i associate him with a certain vague aesthetic that carries through his fictional films, but this was really just like any conventional documentary in terms of it's presentation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Grizzly Man (2005) **** (out of 4) Werner Herzog's latest film ranks as one of the greatest documentaries I've ever witness and also shows that Herzog is one of the greatest and most overlooked filmmakers out there. The documentary takes a look at the life of Timothy Treadwell, a man who for 13 years lived in the Alaskan wilderness with dangerous grizzly bears before finally being eaten alive by one. Most directors would have shown this as a Discovery channel type film or would have shown Timothy as a fun loving, animal lover but Herzog doesn't play sides and unlike Michael Moore, that's what makes this such a fascinating film. Herzog doesn't shy away from the fact that Timothy was a very warm hearted guy but he also doesn't hide that fact that this warmness comes out of some deeper issue that made this guy very dangerous to himself. There isn't a false step anywhere in this film as Herzog asks all the right questions and gives some very insightful opinions himself. This is the type of film that Hollywood could never make with their $200 million dollar budgets. This film has more heart, soul, suspense and tears that money simply can't buy. The amazing footage of Timothy being inches away from 10 foot bears to one scene where he cries over a fox that has been killed by a wolf. The most tragic thing, much like the characters in Herzog's Aguirre: The Wrath of God and Fitzcarraldo, is that Timothy was eventually killed by the things he loved most. When Timothy was eventually killed it was recorded on audiotape and a morbid curiosity makes one want to hear what actually happened but Herzog made the right choice not to play the audio. We get to see Herzog listening to the tape and his facial expressions give us everything we need to know about the events. In the end this is truly a remarkable film that people should certainly seek out.</fullReview>

I'm not usually a fan of documentaries but Herzog's involvement and the positive buzz created by this movie on HTF led me to give it a try...and I'm certainly glad I did so. The film elicits an emotional response from the viewer, not only because of its eccentric protagonist and his (and girlfriend's) eventual fate, ironically, at the hands of the same creatures he so ardently wanted to protect and bring to the world's attention, but also because Herzog (for the most part) wisely lets Treadwell's own uniquely fascinating footage - down to a few hours before his death! - do most of the talking for him.</fullReview>

I find the fact that Werner Herzog managed to make a movie about a man that was trying to make his own movie, but would not have been able to sell that film, somewhat appalling. No one in their right mind would have released this film if Timothy Treadwell was alive, but attached Herzog's name to it and we can do nothing but heap praise upon it. It seems as though someone is profiting from Treadwell's deranged, narcissistic existence and bizarre, untimely death, and that makes me a bit uncomfortable. Another point of contention I have with this film, as well as Herzog's White Diamond, is the sense of unreality they have. Some elements just seem partially staged. Maybe this has to do with the way the filmmaker approached the documentary genre. This is too is unsettling and adds to the bizarre vibes the film gives off. I will not, though, discount Herzog's films. I am very interested other work he has produced, and will try out the next documentary he makes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched the grizzly man last night on the Discovery Channel. I have lived in Alaska for over 50 years, and have been charged at by two grizzlies. These animals are very dangerous and should be avoided in the wild. The grizzly man is not about saving bears in Alaska, but is about an opportunist, a very dumb one at that, using the Alaskan bears as a futile attempt at fame. He should be held accountable for leading the girl to her death. Her relatives should sue Herzog and all for every dime of profit made from this movie. Several years ago just five miles from here (North Pole) at a recreational lake a grizzly ran a family of four into the lake and kept them there until they all died from hypothermia. I have watched a grizzly and two cubs eat a moose calf while it was still alive near Rainbow mountain on the Richardson Highway. You should never hike in Alaska even near civilization unless you are armed with a large caliber rifle or pistol. These animals are very dangerous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grizzly Man Is Unintentional Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm baffled as to why this joke of a movie has received such acclaim. The hero, Timothy Treadwell, is obviously mentally disturbed and an annoying screen presence. He comes across as a psycho child who never grew up. I don't think he really gives a hoot about the bears he professes to love. I think he is only interested in being on camera and "acting out." At one point he says, "Is my hair all right?" When Treadwell's parents are interviewed, I thought I was watching a skit from Saturday Night Live. Although they are indoors, the father wears clip-on sunglasses, flipped up, and the mother sits next to him stroking a Teddy bear.Treadwell's demise is completely believable and probably was inevitable. In my opinion, this movie is a waste of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a stupid film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What on earth is all the fuss about? This is stupid. What is up with Herzog's involvement in bad documentaries? Incident at Loch Ness was even worse than this. Herzog seems to put Timothy Treadwell in the same league as Dian Fossey. Treadwell is a jerk, a nut and a lunatic. Even the thought of comparing of his work with Fossey's is like comparing Citizen Kane to Porky's. You play with bears, you get eaten. Duh. It is irritating also that Treadwell claims vehemently how straight he is but this man is as gay as Truman Capote. What does his proclaiming his straightness have to do Grizzly bears anyway? If you like seeing a nutty gay conservationist get exiting by placing his hand on bear crap describing it as a gift.....this is the movie for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chalk One Up for the Bears</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm torn between rating the high quality of the documentary and low quality of the self-absorbed prat that is its subject matter. Herzog displays terrific film-making prowess but Treadwell's mugging and grandstanding only convince the viewer that the bears are a secondary issue to Treadwell's attempts at self-architected stardom. Why is Hollywood lionizing this guy? Because he died and nobody wants to hurt the feelings of his surviving family members and friends by telling them that the jackass had it coming, that he didn't protect anything (let alone bears and foxes) and was most likely responsible for the death of another human being? I feel sorry for families in these situations. They want to think good thoughts about the departed loved ones and overlook any faults. This is normal. The problem arises when these same family members, or filmmakers or authors decide to make media martyrs out of cretins who are dead because they exercised extremely poor judgment. Rather than state the hard truth (e.g. that my son or daughter or the subject of my film or book exercised very poor judgment died as a result) to help others avoid making similarly bad decisions, they glamorize the idiocy potentially encouraging other impressionable people to do the same stupid things. I'll bet as those animals were cracking open his skull with all the psi bear jaws are capable of, Treadwell must have been kicking himself that hadn't toughed it out in LA a bit longer, auditioning for bit parts on "Frasier."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The funniest and greatest doc. ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is by far the funniest documentary I have EVER seen! Move over march of the penguins, Super Size me, and Farenhite 911, there's a Grizzly Man on the loose, and he's more pshyco than Michael Moore at the Oscars! This movie was funny because the Grizzly Man is an extremely odd doper, who screws around with dangerous animals. He talks like an idiot, and has the most hilarious views on everything! Plus all of the comments will be with totally dull people who will say, "We filled about three trash bags with humans," and have little to no emotion, or worry. Throughout this whole film I was cracking up at Timothy's stupidity! Besides that, there's a lot of interesting things to learn, from a friendship with foxes, to how bears live. I personally think Timothy's acts are harming our environment, and you should see the film to decide for yourself. His journey isn't really amazing, or beautiful, or heartwarming, but it will keep you interested, mainly because Tim has ahem, 'a way with words', and very 'interesting' opinions. Be sure to rent Grizzly Man, you won't regret it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was boring and silly. It had some great wildlife cinematography, but the scenes where they interviewed people were really boring. The narrator was bad and asked dumb questions. This movie could have been done in 15 minutes but they dragged it out to 1 hr 40 min. Within the first 5 minutes I started laughing at how childish and naive Treadwell sounded. That part of the movie was actually interesting because it was a marvel how someone can get so out of touch with reality. But it got tedious to watch him throughout the rest of the movie acting like a toddler. It was still worth watching, just for the wildlife footage - I would recommend fast-forwarding through the rest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I understand the motivation of trying to understand the "wild" in human beings, but this guy's attempt was way beyond sanity. Treadwell went far beyond what humans should do. HELLO!!!! WE CANNOT LIVE WITH GRIZZLIES. WE CANNOT LIVE WITH ORCAS. WE CANNOT BE EAGLES. WE are human beings, we cannot be or become another species. Treadwell seemed to want to be something other that human. I can certainly understand that point as I see how we are continuing to treat one another today. HOWEVER, we are human. Which means we are not grizzlies, nor are we foxes, nor orcas, nor whatever species we would all like to become. For myself I would become a wolf. Go figure. It was a scary doc, but this guy took his girl into danger and unfortunately (HELLO) they got eaten by the same thing he was studying. Let this be a lesson. I would rather (personnally) have studied the foxes. As for the DOC. IT SUCKED. I've seen better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tim Treadwell Used The Bears To Justify His Existence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have no choice but to voice my comments about this movie. When I saw the previews I was excited about seeing a great caliber movie about a guy who lived with and studied wild bears. I love nature documentaries. I thought he would be like Jane Goodall or someone like that dedicated to the study of an animal specie for its and our, as humans, benefit.Instead, I was confronted by a seriously mentally ill person whom used the bears to justify his own petty existence. Almost every scene has him using the bears or other wild animals with which he interacts to tell his own pathetic life story. He paints himself as this selfless "bear savior". Over and over we hear him say, "I'm the only one that protects these bears and I'll die for them". One scene shows a fisherman throwing stones at a bear and he does absolutely nothing. If he cannot protect a bear from a stone throwing fisherman how would he protect them from a poacher with a rifle. He did an wonderful job of protecting the bears!!The movie shows a history in which Timothy has a pathetic existence and is essentially a complete "loser" whom was searching his whole life to find something to justify his existence. In the end he found the poor bears as his cause and reason for living. He was also delusional and paranoid which only fueled his self importance and justification of his role.Why was this movie even made? It only further serves Timothy's pathetic end of self importance. It is no doubt terrible that he and his "soon to leave him girlfriend (again)" we killed by a bear, just as it would be for any couple to lose their lives in a bear attack.Don't waste your time watching this movie, find something better to do with your time.Craig</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Apparently "Grizzly Man" is about Andy Dick spending his summers with bears in Alaska, or so this unwatchable footage would lead you to believe. We never find out anything about this "naturalist's" background (besides the fact that he was an alcoholic) or his unsubstantiated claims that he is the bears' protector. Interviews with the Grizzly Man's melodramatic friends seem rehearsed and don't ring true. Werner Herzog's (poor) decision to narrate the movie himself gives the impression at times that Arnold Schwarzenegger is commenting on the boundaries between man and nature.If you make it past the first five minutes...don't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't mean to imply I'm pleased at the death of another human being. Nevertheless, after seeing this "movie," I found myself reflecting on how annoying, terminally self-centered and self-important Mr. Treadwell made himself out to be, and UNlike most movies, had to constantly remind myself of the REALITY of his death within the documentary. It was on FEDERAL LAND. There was no danger to the bears. Tim simply needed to feel important and self-absorbed, so he got himself (and his friend) eaten alive. As someone else has also posted, the bears do appear to be "Brown Bears" and not grizzlies. While appalled at the idea that someone would have to die in this manner - being torn literally limb from limb while still alive (6 minutes of it), it's hard not to smile at this pompous, silly ass of a man.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beware The Negative Slant of The Director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am disappointed after watching this movie that Timothy Treadwell (the "Grizzly Man") was portrayed the way he was by Werner Herzog. The director narrated his opinion often over video of Treadwell, whom he never knew personally, many times stating his beliefs as fact. Herzog would never have been able to make this movie if not for more than 100 hours of footage Treadwell left behind, but the director didn't even credit Treadwell for the footage at the end of the movie. All of Timothy Treadwell's footage was superb and was the heart of the movie, as it should be. Unfortunately, too much of this movie was director Werner Herzog trying to fill in puzzle pieces of a man he never knew and most importantly didn't understand. Timothy Treadwell's life and death had been about protecting animals without benefit of anything but his love for them. He wanted us to see these animals, to understand them so then maybe people might stop harming, hunting, and killing them. This was not the focus of this movie. Be aware when watching this that Werner Herzog's approach to this documentary was to focus on Timothy Treadwell's death and not on his life's work. What Herzog didn't understand was that the man Timothy Treadwell was his life's work. So know when watching this film, that until a respectful filmmaker, who shares Timothy's love for animals, can go through those many hours or footage, we'll never see an honest depiction of Treadwell's work, but "Grizzly Man", a tainted depiction of Treadwell himself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Werner Herzog was gift wrapped an unbelievably unique story with hours of beautiful and bizarre footage to make into a watchable movie. He blows it. Anything beautiful about the original footage is completely overshadowed by Herzog's Reineer Wolfcastle-esquire narration over the top of it. Please do not tell me if and why something is beautiful. Please do not assault me with unsolicited gems of film making know how. Do not let me live vicariously though your emotions because they are more finely tuned then my own. Finally, every interview seems to be more mock-umentary than reality. It sounds funny that these people all give horrible, obviously dishonest, scripted responses to Herzog's penetrating questions, but for some reason it's not. It's terrible. I could not finish this movie. It's not a question of boredom; this movie is offensive and irritating. I would rather watch any given two hours of Animal Planet than this movie, including "Dogs with Jobs". If you were in the right mood this movie may hold some satirical value, but it certainly didn't for me, and, next to Ignatious, I'm the first person to watch for satirical value.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating Docu about an insane man who became bear breakfast.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's get one thing straight- Treadwell isn't Tim's real name and he is a theatrical wanna be that was obviously working an angle to try and get famous. I think there was an initial experience of healing Timothy went through in the natural wild with the bears.Once that wore off and reality set in, he became wackier and more detached in a mad attempt at denying a reality so undeniable it would occasionally come out and bite or claw him to try and remind him.One thing never mentioned in the documentary is the obvious- he didn't get eaten until he brought a woman out there with him. It is known that Bears can get frisky when they smell a woman who is on her period and possibly attack. Taking her out there was basically bringing bear bait and rubbing it on himself. Tim had a deathwish of sorts it appears.Tim's narrative moments in this documentary are not genuine- he did multiple takes and created a fictional character that he acted out as for more impact in front of the camera. This whole thing looked like a desperate attempt to try and get some 15 minutes of fame in Hollywood.The one thing that isn't faked is the footage of the Bears and that alone is worth watching but you will want to keep the ff button ready for some of Tim's rants- he's simply not well in the head.The museum guy had it right- Tim didn't belong where he was and he wasn't honoring the bears by being there- he was tempting them with dinner.</fullReview>

I don't see anything artsy or anything that would cause deep reflection in the film. It also seemed to me Herzog just took advantage of someone's senseless death by making a profit off society's morbid fascination and curiosity.

Treadwell has it in his head that dangerous wild animals are just misunderstood fuzz-balls and that "all they/you need is love". Seriously, he literally says that to the bears, "I Love YOU!" Their response is they eventually get tired of hearing him say that and eat him and his girlfriend (urrp). Even in the movie people that new him said things like "he asked for it" and "he got what was coming to him". Can't really call it a snoozer, just a demonstration of stupidity.

		<shortDescription>The Exorcism of Timothy Treadwell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This documentary film is really unbelievable. It is one of the worst and dullest movies I've ever seen. I'm having difficulties grasping what the hell Herzog is doing here. If it's irony, I think it hasn't been pointed out strongly enough. Not that it's necessary to "underline" irony three times, nevertheless I feel it has been left out here. If it's a soft-core snuff movie, no problem, I'd keep my respect for the man.I doubt it is.So what's left is a small-minded American idiot, who of course can do with his life whatever he wants to, but he got another naive soul killed, hence the title above. At one point Herzog, as the narrator, said that there is some remarkable footage in the recordings Timothy left behind. I didn't find any. Even some older documentaries have better scenes. But the main thing is that Timothy wasn't making a movie about the bears; he was filming himself adoring bears. He is practically in every shot, the bears somewhere in the background. In Timothy's own words, this is what this film is about: "If there was a God he'd be pleased with me and the way I'm living my life". This is actually an auto-erotic movie about Timothy jerking off at his life with some bears in the background. It is a tragedy that a living human being can be so two-dimensional to resemble a South Park character. Timothy is exactly the same as Mr. Jefferson (which is actually Michael Jackson) in an episode from the ninth season, saying: "Hello bear, hello, I love you bear, thank you for being my friend. I love you and I love being here, I love you all. I love you fox, thank you fox".This guy has some serious problems. I mean; the bears are not endangered, they don't need him, or any help what so ever. The bears were perhaps helping him to stop drinking. I hope that Americans won't prescribe this as a regular therapy 'cause, God help those bears! Finally, Timothy and his girlfriend were eaten by the bears. He got what he was asking for (literally, in one point he said to his friend: "I know my message won't be as strong as it would be if I was to die out there), but he second degreed his girlfriend. No one ever answered for that. So what's the "moral of the title"; if you're a religious fanatic like that idiot priest performing his ritual bullcrap on that poor sick girl, or like Timothy patting droppings that came out of the most desirable female bear (that was his Michelle Pfeiffer, by the way), you can kill someone out of recklessness. In America, it's no biggy.</fullReview>

It was simply a anti-socials horrific cry for help. God took this poor soul out after making a spectacle of himself for over a decade. In no way would Tredwell have been able to live in society and put up with the media scrutiny for the rest of his life. What was on this DVD was a cry for help that should have been given to the nearest shrink instead of mass production to Blockbuster. I am more stupid for having seen this ego-maniacal video diary. I don't know who bothered me more, Tredwell, his "girlfriends", or the coroner. The coroner by the way should be looked at by medical professionals and given a psych evaluation. Perhaps he shouldn't be handling knives?at least he deals with dead bodies right? You may want to pop this movie in a see what we saw for yourself. Don't bother watching the beginning, go right to the last 45 minutes, you will see the climax of Tredwell's insanity and get the picture?the bear's never really liked him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After reading/hearing about this "wonderful" documentary of this extraordinary individual, I goaded my girlfriend to go along with me and view the film. Although I knew what the story's ending was going to be, I thought that it would give me some insight of what drove Timothy Treadwell and to see his life's work. I hoped it would reveal some compassion for the man. Maybe he did have a higher purpose and was not as foolish as some made him out to be.Well after seeing the film, I felt that I had just wasted an hour and a half of my life. Timothy Treadwell was just a nut whose ignorance earned him to what he deserved. This was a despicable, loathsome person who retreated in the wilderness because he could not fit in amongst humanity. It's obvious that he was not an expert, and had no respect to what these animals could do. His apathetic rant towards the fish and wildlife bureau must have amused them to no end upon viewing this. His claim that he was there to "protect" the bears throughout the movie is ridiculous. How could he protect an animal that was in no danger of being harmed by anyone in the first place? And how did he protect them?As for the film itself, I would advise anyone curious of the film to save their nine bucks. Wait for this lunatic's life story on the Discovery channel or National Geographic as they would do a much better job if they chose to waste their time on it.Overall the world and the bears are much better off without him, and you won't waste $9 to $18 like I did.</fullReview>

There were also clips of film selected that were obviously personal and not intended for public viewing. What is the purpose of this movie? Ostensibly to support Herzog's personal hypothesis that nature is nothing but chaos and destruction. Obviously Herzog has never looked into a bee hive. Herzog's personal agenda screams out throughout this film down to the "interviews" he conducts with Timothy Treadwell's friends and relatives. This is not a movie about Timothy Treadwell.

Tim is totally weird and borderline insane. He is not evil, just doesn't fit into our world. He believed that all the evil in the world was due to MANKIND. He had this girlfriend AMIE who looked just mysterious the entire time they showed her. She died with him. Very tragic if you ask me. The part where Tim marveled at the bear's bowell movement was very strange but then again, so was TIM. The coroner was strange the way he just stood there after making his little speech. Little does anybody realize that it's possible that Tim's death was orchestrated by the park service. He was a thorn in their side and they could have arranged for that grizzly bear to kill him. Just a though!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I took a fifteen mile busride to see this movie, which was, I think, twice too long. I came close to leaving it before it ended, but that would have meant a longer wait for the bus to return home.Timothy Treadwell was a bit de trop. There was far too much of him and his hokey views of these uncommonly dangerous animals. The chief tragedy of the film was the loss of his female companion, of whom we saw far too little.Grizzly Man attempted to do more than it could. It could have come closer to success had it been half as long as it was. The point that it made near the end about limited hunting was a good one. Likely there are too many animals in the space available; hunting would open up a touch more space for them.Timothy's gratuitously long outburst of obscenity near the end of the film did it little good. It ill-served both the actor and the film.Thanks, Tom Taylor West Vancouver, BC</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How I spent my summer vacation becoming bear scat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If anyone on this planet deserved to become a bear's lunch, it was probably Timothy Treadwell. Let me first point out that I usually love Werner's work, but this film was so hard to stomach (pun intended) because the "naturalist" was so completely unlikable. Watching this lunatic unravel on film was a little funny at first &amp; then quite disturbing. His she-male toned narration was just dreadful &amp; it's pretty obvious that he knew little or nothing about the nature of bears. Amie Huguenard is little more than a footnote in this because most of the footage is of Treadwell's insights &amp; strange diatribes. Herzog starts the film with his usual empathetic tone but as the film progresses even he has to point out just how misguided Treadwell was. I score this one: Bears 2 Timothy Treadwell, Amie Huguenard &amp; Werner Herzog 0</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrible waste of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went in watching this "movie" thinking this could be decent. After watching the, oh say, first five minutes I knew something was wrong with this guy. I mean he lived their all those years and didn't really seem to do that much to "save" the bears. He carries on about how he hopes he doesn't ever get attacked by one, yelling at wild foxes to give his hat back, almost crying over bear poo, and then at the end says he wishes he were gay, because life would be easier. My view is that he was gay,and he couldn't deal with it so he went to live away from society. He had his "girlfriend" there to keep him and everyone to make it look like he wasn't. When she no longer wanted to be there, thats when it,well, ended. Horrible!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>:Caution: May contain spoilers. :Caution:Don't watch this movie. I watched this movie and my very soul started hurting. This man... Timothy. He only cared for himself and no one else. Doesn't anyone else see that. Charles Darwin is probably turning over in his grave and chewing his way to china to escape this man. He was irresponsible, selfish, and completely arrogant to the actual enviorment. He didn't care if he destroyed the habitats of other creatures as long as his precious bears where happy.This movie is an abomination to nature and those who cruelly care for it. People watching this movie should see a warning.:Warning: Do not treat animals like he does.It results in fatal accidents.I mean honestly. He gets not only himself killed but his lover. He thought himself the great bear protector, but he broke ever rule of nature. 1. Observe only, interactions cause negative effects.2. When dealing with predators. Do not challenge them.3. Never were sunglasses when dealing with large predators. They will see their own reflection and see a challenge.4. When dealing in a national park and/or reserve, follow the house rules. Those rules are established for a reason.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Give Timmy credit for the footage he has given us.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really enjoyed the courage Tim had to go into the wilderness and live there with the grizzly bears. Most of all we would not ever have seen the unique footage of bears in the wild if not for him. He did make a tragic mistake going back and staying longer in bear country near hibernation and I wish there would have been someone to talk him out of that one! This is a wonderful DOC on adventure, passion and for what Tim thought was a great cause. He just wanted to be someone, excepted and LOVED. He did some very scary stuff in the DOC that keep me at the edge of my seat and he made me laugh too. Timothy Treadwell walked to the beat of his own drum. As he said he would die for the bears. He died doing what he Loved. How many of us get to die doing what we love? Take this film and enjoy it! Bears are indeed the TOP OF THE FOOD CHAIN.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't do it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is awful. Treadwell has no training of any sort and his continued presence in the Grizzlys' habitat made the bears become accustomed to humans, making it easier for tourists (like the ones pictured in the film) to come within feet of the bears and throw rocks at them, or cause the bears other physical harm.The absurdity of Treadwell aside, the movie is very oddly made. Camera angles are strange, making people look very creepy, who I do not think are intended to be. It really seems like you're watching a parody. Also, Herzog's voice sounds like a cross between Schwarzenegger and an automated help line.Don't waste your time or your money on this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrible director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Timothy Treadwill is obviously an interesting subject to make a movie about. He is weird, probably insane, and lived an unusual life. However, one could not fail more in portraying him than director Herzog has. I want to see a movie about Timothy, not Herzog. The director puts himself in focus, and sometimes almost seems to forget about Treadwill. It's ridiculously bad journalism, and I can't believe so many comments seem to have missed that? I almost started laughing sometimes during the movie. I don't want the directors personal views... at least not in the narrating. If he had some skill he could let the viewers decide for themselves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Timothy Treadwell may have gone to Alaska with good intentions at one time but it seems his ego took him away. His actions ended in the killing of the animal he professed to protect even though I saw nothing in the film that appeared to be protection on his part. Treadwell's actions were more harmful than good for bears because he gave the false impression they can be treated like pets and paid with his life, and unfortunately the life of his girl friend.Herzog was able to show some amazing footage shot by Treadwell who indeed captured some incredible moments on film, but does a disservice to the viewer by trying to make Treadwell larger than life.The film isn't and shouldn't be marketed as a documentary, simply an interesting story about a guy who got killed by his own actions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Proof that Werner Herzog writes for Fox News</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For decades I was the most devout fan of Werner Herzog. I found his films (particularly the Kinski pictures) to be powerful and sublime. True, I didn't agree with his nihilistic philosophies, but his subtle presentation made it intriguing to watch--as if I was getting a peek into the mind of my opposite.Well, in Grizzly Man, he goes over the top. All subtlety is lost, and Herzog descends on this sensational story like a reporter on Fox News. I can see him just rubbing his hands and drooling at the concept of a young man who was torn to shreds by the nature which he sought to protect. Dear Timothy Treadwell, I lament your passing, but even more am I disgusted at the sarcastic carnival that Herzog made of your life.In this film (as with all of Herzog's documentaries, I assume), Herzog sticks his fat face in front of the camera in order to comment and belabor his views and philosophies. He comes right out and says, "I believe the common character of the universe is not harmony, but hostility, chaos and murder." Nice. Not exactly an unbiased presentation now is it? At least the Fox news reporters have the decency not to announce their vampiric, bloodthirsty opinions on camera. Herzog, you're an idiot.Werner Herzog claims to be a naturalist. Yet in "Fitzcarraldo" he had 75 acres of Amazonian rainforest flattened for the sake of his production. He claims to be an animal lover, yet in "Even Dwarfs Started Small" he crucifies a monkey and throws chickens through a broken glass window. In this, his pinnacle of hypocrisy and sociopathy, he really lets us have it. If you want to sit through 2 hours of gruesome details (though no actual blood is shown, sorry to disappoint you, kids) about how nature is your enemy, then enjoy the movie. Herzog, I don't know where you picked up such a vendetta against the planet on which you were conceived. Perhaps a possum bit you when you were a kid. Well, quit crying about it already. Nature is not out to kill you. Unfortunately.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I agree with the Blair Witch analysis....but I believed that BW was real and then found out it was fake. I swear I thought this was fake. Was he funded for this? I would have been so mad if I paid to see this in a theater. The only interesting thing (heavily promoted by the way) was that he was killed by a grizzly. I cannot believe this won awards. Are you sure it is real? The narration and writing were terrible...there is something to be said for hiring a narrator if you sound like you are from Transylvania. It had no flow whatsoever and more importantly..no point. I never understood what he was protecting the bears from...other than the humiliation of being a part of this movie, I learned nothing about grizzly bears, which is why I watched the movie and in the end I thought Herzog exploited this man and duped the public, shame on him, he made a lot of money. I only wish we could convey to him that this was not art, talent or anything noble. It was in essence, a snuff film, without the snuff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is very little story here. You have probably seen all the interesting footage on the promos. Most of the footage is from footage actually shot by Treadwell featuring himself saying the same thing over and over about the bears. The footage which is left is not interesting and the interviews are basically boring. A failed actor who was delusional and had a history of drinking and taking drugs began "protecting" the grizzly bears in a wildlife sanctuary in Alaska. He was living with them, talking to them and felt that they were his "friends" who cared for him and respected him. Eventually he and his girlfriend were killed and eaten by one of his "friends", a grizzly bear. End of story. No surprise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This guy was good at acting weird. But don't let it fool you, it is an act.The whole thing is fake, no raw emotion, no nothing.Pointless. I felt more emotion watching The Aristocrats.... though I laughed more during Grizzly Man.If you liked this you probably have some hidden beastiality issues you need to deal with ASAP. Please find help as soon as you can.I truthfully turned it off when the one dude was talking about destroying the tape. I am not sure if that woman he was with was the bear freaks mother or what, but those were not real tears. The only sad part of the movie was that it was in fact on TV and people were watching it.We can only hope in years to come, more crazy people like this go into the woods and don't come back. If you are one of those people, please please please don't bring a camera.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Without a doubt, the worst movie experience!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dependency and identity issues, depression and drug addiction and a foul mouth are the defining characteristics of "Grizzly Man". The unfortunate Bears and Fox that put up with him for 13 years, I believe, finally had enough!Timothy Treadwell repeatedly stated "he'd die for the Bears", whether it was a wish or desire, it came true! Treadwell, with his insane rants, and careless disregard of rules intended to protect him and his girlfriend, showed that man and nature are still in fact two separate worlds. This movie in my opinion offers some rather stunning wildlife footage. However, the "value" of Mr. Treadwell and his "work" remains dubious. As most of the people in this advanced screening seemed to feel, "a whole lot of tape was wasted on Mr. Treadwell and not enough spent on the Bears". This was not a film documentary, but a home movie of a mans' search for himself. A search that eventually took him completely out of the world of reality and into a world comprised of only him against all other entities. One thing I found interesting about the audience reaction was the almost complete lack of sadness or sorrow over Mr. Treadwells death. Unlike the tragedy of Open Water or Touching the Void which elicited feelings of remorse and regret, no such feelings seemed to be generated by Mr. Treadwells eventual demise.</fullReview>
