		<shortDescription>The best of the Italian neo-realist films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vittorio DeSica's wonderful "Umberto D" was one of the last films of the Italian neo-realism movement and by far its best one. It is also one of my favorite movies ever. The movie's premise is simple: it is a slice of the life of a poor lonely pensioner, Umberto. Throughout the movie, we see Umberto struggle to find money to pay rent to his horrible landlady, love his dog Flike, and deal with the loneliness and disillusionment of the postwar era."Umberto D" is a character-driven film. It works very well because of its sharp observations on loneliness and poignant gestures. The gestures evoke powerful feelings without necessitating dialogue. Many of the scenes, even the ones that do not necessarily advance the plot, are hypnotically beautiful in their simplicity. Take, for example, a beautiful scene where Umberto finally needs to beg for money but cannot physically bring himself to do it. He extends his palm up, but when a passer-by stops to give him money, Umberto quickly flips his hand over, as if testing for rain. The film is full of these small gestures that quietly emphasize the desperate loneliness and poignancy of Umberto's situation.The acting in this film is absolutely superb. Carlo Battisti, despite having never acted before, is wonderful as the titular character; his face is a fascinating blend of stubborn dignity and weariness of life. Maria Pia-Casilio, who plays the maid, is just as good as evoking life's loneliness and quiet desperation. The supporting cast is also very strong.One of the very few criticisms I have heard of this film is that it is too sentimental and borderline sappy. While some scenes with Umberto and his dog Flike are sentimental, never is it "too" sentimental. DeSica knows how far he can push his film without making it sappy, and he wisely shows it as it is. Nothing feels forced. The subject material itself and the simplicity in which it is presented will bring tears. (If you don't cry in this movie, you need to have your heart professionally de-thawed.) But "Umberto D" is never dumbed down into sappiness and clichéd corniness. It is a very powerful film."Umberto D" is the masterpiece of the Italian neo-realist era. It's a rather bleak and very realistic movie, but it makes some fascinating commentary on the human condition, specifically the loneliness we face. Highly, highly recommended. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Wherever you go, I'll be here."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I watched Umberto D., by Oscar nominated actor and legendary Oscar winning director Vittorio De Sica, I knew clearly one thing for certain- Carlo Battisti, playing the role of retired civil servant Umberto Domenico Ferrari, is the most convincing non-professional actor in any given decade of European movie-making. He knows the purpose De Sica is after within every ounce of his soul (one can see it repeatedly in his eyes, the small mannerisms)- this is a story of loss, sad yet in an outlook and outcome that is cruel up to a point and never fiddles with the viewer's emotions dishonestly. Therefore, one can see him, in a sense, for what he is- he's us, merely you and I at the end of our lines of life with one wrong step sent to us after another.Battisti's Umberto is retired, known fairly among his past employees, and living in a dank, infested one room who seems to be on the standard downward spiral for such a neo-realist effort (indeed, like The Bicycle Thief, many of the elements against him are from society's natural pitfalls). His health starts to go, as he gets a fever, and is sent unsympathetically to the hospital and returns to find the place being torn at each wall. The landlady wants him out, since she will only accept full rent instead of partial rent, and the maid of the house (Maria Pia-Casillo), while kind and friendly, lives in a similar prism of fear and emptiness. However, even she can't help him in the financial difficulties. This leads him out into the streets outside of Rome, where the film plays out like a Chaplin movie, without the humor and female companion- only with his best friend in the world, a little dog named Flag.By the 3rd act of this epitome of heartbreaker movie-making, a quote passed through my head that Michelangelo Antonionni once stated: The actor is a moving object. That sentence, I can guess, is true of Battisti, as well as for his little dog. Aldo Graziati's camera follows him and his companion like another piece of the frame, which makes our focus on them all the more compelling. They're just their, acting the ways an old man and his pet act with one another, which is care and devotion. Battisti, in turn, delivers for De Sica an over-whelming performance of emotion. The very last scene is one of the definitive milestones of the movement at the time in Italy - despite it all; a relationship between a man and his "best friend" can be stronger in desperate times than a man can have with a fellow human being. Truly, this ending is quite suitable for one of the best films of it's time, and for De Sica a memorial tribute to his father. A++</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's hardly been a better film ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Umberto D. may be the single most powerful film ever made. It's pretty much impossible not to be affected by it, and I'd imagine only a monster could get through it without shedding a tear. It's not all sad, and certainly cannot be called unrelentingly depressing. There are plenty of beautifully funny moments. The main character, Umberto, is one of the greatest characters I've ever met at the movies. It would be simple to make him just a man to pity: he is a poor old man who is down on his luck. But the artists behind the film have fleshed him out into an incredibly human character. The supporting characters, even those who show up for just a moment, are just as well created. And the acting is godly. 10/10, without a second thought. It's one of the best films ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Appreciation.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much has been written about this landmark masterpiece from Vittorio De Sica. I first saw it (with my parents) as a young man in high school, at the Uptown (Columbus) Theatre in Providence, and at the age of thirteen I was thoroughly moved by this story of old age, poverty, and near-despair! Perhaps that was a precocious reaction from a youngster, but as the years moved on and I've become closer in age to its sad hero and am retired just as he was, I've never ceased to be moved by this story. The truly stirring scenes are those between Umberto and his dog Flaik. The moment when he saves it from impending death in the dog pound and clasps it to himself as the only thing in the world he can love and be loved by, is utterly overwhelming. Willy-nilly, the dog returns the favor, the gift at life, at the end by saving his master from a suicidal leap before an oncoming train. These scenes are justly extolled by Martin Scorsese in his documentary tribute to the Italian cinema IL MIO VIAGGIO IN ITALIA. Yes, the film seems to have an almost Dickensian outlook on the world. The bad are truly bad, gargoyles in fact, like that hideous couple that shelter dogs and to whom Umberto wisely decides not to abandon Flaik, and like the caricatured bitch of a landlady that is Umberto's nemesis. And the good are long-suffering, like the unwed pregnant servant girl and like Umberto himself. Through it all the message of director Vittorio De Sica and screenwriter Cesare Zavattini radiates. Life is a treasure. This film celebrates that idea so poignantly and so wisely. We live. We suffer. We are Umberto D.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unforgettable masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is storytelling at its simplest and most beautiful. An old man - his sole companion, a dog - tries to survive on a fixed, tight income while being mistreated by his landlady.DeSica brilliantly captures the despair of his protagonist and makes this film unforgettably powerful. This film deserves to be seen by everyone, not just those who enjoy foreign-language films.This film is touching, memorable and manages to draw us into Umberto's life without ever becoming maudlin. The denouement is heartbreaking, but the film never lapses into sentimentality. "Umberto D" truly is one of the greatest films ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An elderly retired civil servant in Rome is about to be forced onto the streets due to the loss of his pension, with only his little dog to comfort him. I'm not even a dog lover and this movie STILL got to me. I rented this on video when I was in high school and my mom ended up watching it with me. The ending (which I won't spoil for those who haven't seen it yet) is the only time I can remember when we have both been crying at the same time during a movie. This is truly a beautiful film and I have to see again soon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Neorealist Classic (A story of an old man and his dog)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Umberto D was made towards the end of the Neo-realist period in Italian cinema, following on from Roma Citta Aperta (1945),Riso Amaro (Bitter Rice 1946),Paisa (Paisan 1946) and Ladri di Biciclette (The Bicycle Thieves 1948). Many critics see Umberto D has the finest example of the genre and Vittorio de Sica, the director, himself considered it to be his best work. Set in post-war Italy, it is the story of a retired public worker, trying to survive on a meagre state pension and being threatened with eviction from his landlady. His only friends are his small dog 'Flick' and his landlady's young maid Maria who has just discovered she is pregnant. Filled with despair over his situation he finally contemplates suicide.The film sticks firmly to the neorealist conventions; the lead actor is a non professional actor (a college Professor who agreed to play the role), the use of studio sets is kept to minimum and the everyday lives of people are examined in minute detail. One could say that for long parts of the film nothing much happens, for instance when we follow Maria's early morning routine of grinding some coffee, but from these detailed vignettes, we learn a great deal of the thoughts feelings and emotions of the characters. These sequences are why it is a great film. The acting is wonderful, the impossible situations of the old man and of the unmarried but pregnant Maria are really brought to life for the audience. Although a tragic tale it does include many moments of humour and the ending although non-committal is uplifting. All in all a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a very touching and wrenching film. It is indeed hard to watch because everyone is so dismissive of Umberto. But people can be like that, especially in desperate times, such as post war Italy when all the money was going to rebuild churches, not feed people. Better for proud hard working Umberto to put on a brave face and quietly disappear so nobody has to worry about him or be concerned about him. At the end he did find that he and Flike still had each other, this little dog didn't care if Umberto had any pride left or not, he loved him just the same. And Umberto needed him to be reminded of the simple joys in life. A very profound and moving film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Neorealism at its best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is Vittorio DeSica's simple but powerful story of a retired civil servant named Umberto Domenico Ferrari and his pet dog Flag. Umberto cannot afford to live anymore on his meager pension and is about to be evicted by his evil landlady. Umberto's only friend is Maria (Maria-Pia Casilio) but she is pregnant by someone that even she is not sure of. Umberto gets sick and goes to the hospital for a few days and when he gets out Flag is gone. He goes to the local pound and finds him. Umberto is a man who once had a very respectable job and has an immeasurable amount of pride. He has to think about begging in the streets but just can't go through with it. One of the great things about these Italian neorealist films is that we really do see what conditions are like in post-war Italy. The authentic locations are priceless to these films and it also creates a docu-drama feel. DeSica's "The Bicycle Thief" is my favorite of these type of films but this is also a classic gem! *****SPOILER ALERT*****The last 20 minutes of this film is tough to watch and it can easily bring tears to the most jaded eyes. Unable to find a new home for Flag, Umberto tries to commit suicide by walking in front of a train with Flagg in his arms. A gut wrenching scene where Umberto is unable to go through with it and Flagg is temporarily upset with his master. The last scene of them together is classic neorealism. Umberto realizes he is a survivor and is just going to try and eke out an existence. The two of them playfully bounding down the road. Umberto's fate is unsure, thats the way life is. We have all come to expect these ambiguous endings and when they're done properly like in this film, it helps to create a truly haunting and memorable experience. Martin Scorsese said in an interview that this is one of his all time favorite films. The man has great taste!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Test your own compassion rating with this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Enough has been said about this wonderful movie already and I'm not going to repeat what others have written at length except to say that I've just come to this film totally unprepared and now feel emotionally shattered. I've watched it as the 44th movie in a collection of 50 so-called art-house films in a DVD collection from Criterion. These allegedly "essential" movies are presented alphabetically and that is how I've viewed them, so it's taken me quite some time to get to the letter U. If I'd started with this De Sica classic I may have felt disinclined to watch any of the others! Indeed, in a lifetime of over 50 years of watching movies - everything from the truly execrable to the totally inspirational - this is the first and only film I've ever sought to review on this site. I know there are a few detractors out there on the message-boards who cannot see beyond their own cynicism, but I pity them. This movie remains timeless, as potent as when it was made in 1952. You don't have to be old, you don't have to be a dog-lover (although it helps), and you certainly don't have to be a fan of neo-realist Italian cinema. All you have to be is a good human being. Watching this movie is a sort of 'humanity test' and thankfully most of the reviewers here have passed it.I'm sorry, "Cinema Paradiso", you've just been relegated to Second Best Foreign Film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saw this for the first time last night</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...and was blown away. This is now one of my top 10.This film, to me, is pure cinematic perfection. Stunning, understated camera work, beautiful, subtle lighting, photographic crispness, a complete lack of Hollywood moralizing (except, maybe, the character of the landlady), an equal attention to what's NOT said or done, as opposed to making everything so bloody obvious, and, of course, the story.The ending seems to have been subsequently used after for other films like "Nights of Cabiria" (and the subsequent "Sweet Charity") in its ambiguity and lack of closure.The scenes at the dog kennel are so incredibly moving without trying to "tug at your heartstrings." and the scene with the train and the dog's immediate unforgiving nature really strike a chord. This film remedies for me what I find so troubling about Chaplin efforts like "City Lights" and "Limelight." There's something so false about the Chaplin characterizations and they seem designed to force "aahhh"s from the audience. This is the real McCoy and the relationships seem so unstrained and real.I especially loved the friendship between the servant girl and the old man. Again, no moralizing. Each seems stuck in their own set of circumstances and help each other as much as they can and no more, though its obvious that they respect each other enough to understand that, without saying it, they each have lives to lead. We all have our own problems. I was most struck at how subtle the camera seems to float, pan and track without being obtrusive or obvious. The scene that's shot through the hole in the adjacent room to his and the slow track seems symbolic of so much of the film. Every single element serves the story and the characters.FYI - according to something I read, the dog's name is "Flick" (pronounced "Flyke").Sigh.Sometimes a dog is enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Sad Story in Post-War Italy, 1952 . It Could Be in Brazil, 2003</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Minor SpolerUmberto Domenico Ferrari (Carlo Battisti) is a lonely retired old man with no family. His companion is the dog Flike. His small retirement pension does not allow him to pay for his room, his food and his debts. The first part of the movie shows Umberto trying to resolve his life, participating in a public protest for improvement of pension, selling his few assets and trying to borrow and even begging for money. Then, the owner of the pension asks him to move from his room and he tries to save his dog. And the last part, when the old man tries to suicide with Flike. Vittorio de Sica, together with Roberto Rossellini and the Taviani brothers are the masters of the Italian Neo-Realism, filming with non-professional cast. This touching drama about third age solitude, selfish society and misery is remarkable and unforgettable. The fight of the character, trying to keep his dignity and save his only friend will certainly touch even the most hard heart viewer. Only yesterday I have the chance to watch this movie, which has not been previously released on video. Fortunately, again, the great Brazilian distributor Versátil offered the chance for us, lovers of great movies, to watch this film completely restored in a marvelous DVD. Unfortunately, we realize that this sad story in a post-war Italy still exists in our present days, where a great part of the retired persons live in a situation similar to Umberto D. A mandatory film! My vote is nine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's an old guy in my family. He's down on his luck. If you try to help him, he uses it as a quick fix and soon goes back to his old ways. He's cantankerous, self-obsessed, contrary. He can light up your day with moments of genuine kindness and cutting humour. People he used to work with would come by now and again when he retired, but gradually they drifted away, leaving him all alone. The people he comes into day-to-day contact with tend to treat him condescendingly, thinly disguising their view of him as a pest.Every family has one such character. There is no magical solution. You can feel sorry for the guy without really liking him. Umberto D isn't a likable character, but he is all too human. The small journey from down-at-heel to suicidal is carefully drawn in this quiet, subtle, thought-provoking film. The dog begging, the train speeding past in a whirl of dust and noise, the stranger lying to get away from Umberto's whining; these are small moments of crushing defeat for the human spirit that are finely pitched in this well-crafted film. The film may not be timeless, the score is overly-sentimental and there are jarring jump-cuts. However, the message is universal - Umberto D is an antidote to the white plight movies turned out by cookie cutters in Hollywood about rich misanthropic lawyers who have to take on bad guys. Poverty, isolation, loneliness, and a kind of redemption at the end - unfortunately, they don't make movies like this anymore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An obedient dog is a man's best friend.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vittorio De Sica once remarked that why should film makers go in search of extraordinary events when in the course of their daily lives they are confronted with ordinary events of extraordinary beauty.This statement sums best the very essence of this Neorealist classic. Umberto D directed by the master Italian filmmaker Vittorio De Sica is a sad albeit ordinary tale of the loss of human values in Italian society after the end of second world war.Everything about the leading character Umberto D is told in an ordinary indeed prosaic manner.It is rather bizarre but mention must also be made of the poor light in which women characters have been shown.This is due to the fact that in Umberto D,both the grumpy landlady and unmarried pregnant girl representing loss of moral values are women characters directly associated with the old man.The great thing about Umberto D is its canine protagonist named Flike who serves his master so well that he even prepares to die for his master's sake.In Umberto D, by showing a faithful dog who remains loyal to his old master,Vittorio De Sica has rightly depicted that animals are more truthful than some human beings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Elegant Simplicity of Emotion *SPOILERS*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Umberto D. is handsome, elegant film by the great Italian Neo-Realist director Vittorio De Sica. The story is simple - one might even say sentimental - yet poignant; it tells the tale of a crumpled old man struggling to retain what he has left in the world, which consists of little more than an apartment run by a spiteful landlady and an affectionate young dog. Though the world is ignoring him (and, as De Sica hints, perhaps many of the elderly) he feels the necessity of hanging onto these things - but he is old, and more importantly, he is poor.Thus his apartment, one which he has kept for twenty years, slowly ceases to be his. But the dog does not, and herein lies the crux of the story: when our man gives up on his apartment, he decides to give up on life. Yet the dog, the young and living dog, is still with him, and he can find nowhere to dispose of it.Like himself, this dog is unloved and unwanted, and thus the protagonist must remain with it, and more importantly, remain with life.This plot sounds syrupy and cheap on paper: an old man who can only go on living because of his lovable pet dog? And yet nevertheless De Sica manages to take the surface simplicity of the tale and fabricate it into a deeply moving story, and that is just because De Sica is a 'Neo-Realist' director; the film never tries to pluck our sentimental heartstrings or wetten our eyes, rather it remains comfortable in simply presenting itself. The execution of the film is sparse: the characters are not heavily elaborated on, the plot is kept confined to its core, and the images - though stunningly handsome - never become overly sumptuous. A viewer might point out that many find their inner selves 'plucked' and twanged by the movie, but this is because De Sica knows how to use those few moments of sentimentality a movie need, and thus the glorious moments when the old man leaves his sole friend the young maid or when he decides on life again and dances with the dog are all the more powerful. Umberto D. is a sentimental film, but it is its simplicity of style and modesty of emotion that prevent it from becoming a syrupy one.7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I call this post-realism ... but it's great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoiler alert.When I plunged into Italian neo-realism ? Paisan, Open City, Bicycle Thief ? I had seen most of the earlier movies before I encountered Umberto D. It took me by surprise. The tough- mindedness of the earlier films did not prepare me for the naked emotion of this story of a proud pensioner trying to maintain his dignity while on the verge of becoming a homeless person.He couldn't bear to beg, so he teaches his dog to beg, but couldn't bear to acknowledge it was his dog!What was this? Sentimental stuff? A man loves his dog? He tries, but fails, at begging? Major pathos? Come on!So, here I was, thinking de Sica had gone all maudlin. Then came the final 20 minutes. I am not ashamed to admit I was reduced to a puddle. Only one other movie ending had had this effect on me ? La Strada. Umberto gathers up Flag and stands in front of a roaring train.Umberto ? we'll go to death together. Dog ? Get the f*** out of here!!!I don't blame that dog a bit for scampering away and hiding. "Whoa, dude, how could you pull such a stunt? Can I still trust you?"Those who criticize this film from an academic standpoint that it betrayed the unsentimental ideals of neo-realism may be correct. I'll subtract a star. Happy?But this is one powerful movie. I'll not apologize for loving it. At least, it doesn't go all Hollywood with "Mr. Umberto, don't you know you're secretly rich?" Who knows what will happen to Umberto and Flag? He's still broke. Nowhere to go. But they are survivors. Dig it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS "Umberto D " is the follow-up to "Miracolo a Milano" and it easily outclasses it .When an user goes as far as to write it even surpasses " ladri di biciclette" ,I cannot agree more."Umberto D "is De Sica's masterpiece.Leo McCarey had already tackled the problems of getting old in his excellent "make way for tomorrow" (1937) but they were two,husband and wife ,and even if the ending was desperate ,the love they were still sharing made their lives worthwhile.Umberto is old,poor and ALONE:was he married ? It seemed her landlady used to have a love affair with him,but he says that it' s because he provided her with food during the war ,and anyway ,now ,she despises him as much as it's possible.Unlike the heroes of "make way for tomorrow ", we are not sure that Umberto has even sweet memories to cherish.Being old ,he cannot change his fate anymore.Around him,the world keeps going round,and he's no longer part of it.People 's selfishness and cruelty is often unbearable in this work. See the way the woman dressed in furs looks at Umberto as she comes down the stairs after the party.See how even his former friends run away when he asks them for some money.But he will not beg.He tries but he cannot resolve.These scenes are sheer genius ,Italian neorealism at its absolute peak.The old man's friends are the humblest of the creatures:the young maid who plays around with soldiers and gets pregnant and mainly his dog.They are his brothers in misfortune :the young girl is an exploited person whom the landlady treats like a slave.Umberto's dog plays a prominent part in the tragedy:the dog pound where the hero finds back his faithful pet becomes a metaphor for his position itself.Later,when he wants to leave the animal to a couple's care,there's more to the picture of the tied up dog desperately barking than meets the eye .The shadow of death hangs over the entire movie.Suicide seems to be the only way out.Twice ,Umberto tries.As the "ladri di biciclette" finds solace in his child's smile,the old man can lean on his dog.The very last picture of the movie : children playing.De Sica's strength is extraordinary:being able to show some optimism after such depressing scenes is proof positive of his absolute command of the seventh art.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I appreciated Umberto D. much more seeing it the 2nd time on the big screen. The music was annoying when viewing on TV, but on the screen I barely was aware of it. The movie is compelling throughout; strong feelings of disgust were evoked by the miserable and heartless landlady. But the strongest feelings of all, and maybe because I recall a beloved dog I had in my teens, were evoked by the dog, "Slike." When the trust between dog and owner is broken, the dog's reactions overtake (for me) the dilemma of the human protagonist. And though I am once again thrown back into the partnership of master and pet, I leave the theater still overcome by the animal's vulnerability. And though the ending is unresolved for some, for me it is jubilant in many aspects.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A sad but at the same time, touching and meaningful, movie like few I have seen, I came across this gem in the cable today. But instead other movies which use all kind of possible gestures to invoke the tears of the public, this movie is a real show of humanity like I've hardly seen before.Geez, 50 years after, this movie has not dated in its subject of loneliness and aging. In the age of selfishness, a simple display of profound human feelings like this is completely necessary.Would hope everyone was ready to appreciate this magnificent piece of Human Art. Thanks, Vittorio.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>very simple film yet exceptional</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>According to the director, De Sica, this film was a "neorealistic" film--in that it shows a sort of polished version of real life people and events. Because of this, the plot is VERY simple (just as in his film "The Bicycle Thief") and the actors are not really actors but real people from the Italian streets. You might think this would make the film seem cheap or amateurish (like Plan 9 From Outer Space), but thanks to exceptional direction and writing, this is definitely not the case.While I would not want a steady diet of these sort of films, they are a very welcome relief to the completely unreal and over-the-top characters and plots so often found in films. This movie is a work of art and deserves your attention.UPDATE--Since seeing this gut-wrenching film, I've seen quite a few of DeSica's other films, such as THE BICYCLE THIEVES and MIRACLE IN MILAN. Amazingly enough, despite giving UMBERTO D a 10, there is actually another barely known film DeSica made before all these films that is his best movie. Like these other films, THE CHILDREN ARE WATCHING US is a neorealist film but it manages to make one of the strongest emotional impacts of any film I have ever seen. Like UMBERTO D, it is brilliant and a must for any serious film lover or film student. Because the film debuted during WWII, it was not seen in much of the world and that's a pity. Now that it's on DVD, you must see this movie as well as UMBERTO D.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The antithesis of all things Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Neo-Realism, as it was in the Italian first wave, and as it is today in the form of Gus Van Sant films, always leaves cinema audiences fidgety and illuminating their watches. It is the cinema of anti-cinema. Filming the mundane aspects of life which movie goers are in the theater to escape. Certainly the few long-winded negative reviews were penned with contemporary concerns over pacing and plot confusion. Looking for that which is not there, whilst missing that which is. The experience is best enjoyed on DVD, where one can pause and ponder the images while leafing through a pulp novella before the second and third acts.Umberto D. portrays an intelligent man slowly forfeiting his dignity to cold post-war indifference. As his pension is too merge to sustain his retirement, he gradually parts with possessions of symbolic importance of his working life. Trying to sell his watch to other pensioners, selling books of strong sentimental value to a callous street merchant at a loss, the nameless others he encounters seem to survive by adapting to modern change, while Umberto struggles fighting against it. In a conventional film Umberto's plight would have large dollops of pathos spread thick, and many sympathetic ears from supporting characters. However, in Neo-Realism it is as absurd as it would be in life. When he relays his story of a bitter feud with his landlady to a former colleague, it just seems somewhat pathetic. Regardless of his problems, he will never go hungry or homeless. A private war being waged only by himself.A friendship with the apartment maid, Maria, also departs strongly from cinematic values and is true to life. Pregnant to an unknown father (a moral crime of the time tantamount to witchcraft) and with no other place to go, her situation is far dire than Umberto's. But in her ignorance she is content with her lot. And Umberto's old world shock at her shameless honesty, and the class conscious nature of their friendship (she is still the maid after all) mean that the film skews sentimentality. When they part, it is with much awkwardness. And as in life, there is a gaping emptiness after Umberto has said his last goodbyes, boarded a bus and watched her wave farewell in the window of his old apartment. He continues to look up at the windows of buildings after she has faded from view, as you do when you know you are never going to see a long term friend ever again.As audacious as this film is in severing cinematic ties, there is an odd conceit in a manipulative score, which one would assume prompted Michelangelo Antonioni, Robert Bresson and others inspired by The Bicycle Thief, to drop music completely from their films. Another sentimental aspect at odds with this very unsentimental film is Umberto's dog with the aurally hideous name, Flike. Flike's loyalty and companionship ultimately becoming the one aspect in Umberto's life which he simply can not part with. Choosing acceptance after a failed suicide attempt, it is the purity of the dog's actions which bring Umberto around.The cinematography of Umberto D. is beautiful, and the acting of a largely untrained cast is superb. Despite the fact that it was later bettered by those inspired by it, the film remains the best of the Italian first wave.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** Touching and simple film about a 70 year old retiree from government service who's life falls apart when his greedy landlady decides to throw him an his pet dog out on the streets for non-payment of rent.Unberto Ferrari's, Carlo Battisti, pension can't keep up with the rising cost of the post-war Italian economy and for the first time in some 20 years has fallen back on paying his rent. Umberto's landlady, Lina Gennari, sees his money problems as a golden opportunity to throw him out of his apartment. Mrs. Gennari plans to turn it into a dance hall where she can party with her boyfriend Paolo, Alberto Barbieri, and her high class friends.Having no one to turn to for help Umberto is forced to sell all his personal possessions in order to cough up the money, 15,000 Lira's, to pay his back rent to Mrs. Gennari before the end of the month. Falling short by some 5,000 Lira's Umberto now faces becoming homeless with his dog and companion Flike becoming a stray and being put to sleep at the local dog pound.With Umberto feeling helpless and even suicidal about the future two things happen that give him a new lease on life. Umberto's young maid Maria, Maria-Pia Cosilio, who's in a worse situation then he's in helps the old man see the better side of human nature. Maria is always there for him with her just being a friend to Umberto when no one else even bothered to care if he lived or died. The 15 year-old Maria is afraid that her boss landlady Gennari will find out that she's pregnant which will have her fired from her job as a maid in her apartment building. It's Maria confiding to Umberto her pregnancy that has him try to find the person who put her in a "family way" to live up to his responsibility and marry her giving Maria's, as well as his, unborn child a proper name.It's later in the movie where a now homeless Umberto wanders the streets of Rome with his pet dog Flike that he tries to get someone anyone to adopt the cute little mutt, whom the day before he just saved from being put to death at the local pound, as their pet. Not being able to give Flike away and not willing to beg for food money or a place to stay all that's now left for Umberto is to end it all. ****SPOILER ALERT**** A deeply depressed Umberto together with the only friend he has left the world Flike is about to jump in front of an oncoming locomotive and it's then and there he sees just what a good friend little Flike really is! It's the only time that Flike didn't meekly go along with his masters commands saving both his and Umberto's lives.The last ten minutes of the movie are almost too depressing to watch with Umberto desperately trying to give Flike away with no one bothering to take him and give the sweet little dog a home. By the time the film ended it was Umberto who turned out to be by far the luckiest person in town by having a friend like Flike who was there for him when he needed a friend most. Little Flike made the depressed old man realize that life, despite all its drawbacks, is precious and far more worth living then having it mindless and compulsively thrown away in order to avoid facing it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An old man and his dog</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Show me a dog-lover who doesn't immediately sympathise with the friendship between Umberto and Flike, and I'll show you a dog-lover who actually bought a cat by mistake. As I write this review, my own pet canine, Cassie {a Rhodesian Ridgeback cross}, sits on the floor behind me, staring upwards with intelligent, brown eyes, and we share a connection and an understanding that really is rather difficult to translate into words. Italian director Vittorio De Sica evidently also understood the bond between man and dog, and this touching relationship forms the centrepiece of 'Umberto D. (1952),' arguably the final major film in the Italian neo-realism movement that was established in the mid-1940s. De Sica is, of course, best known for 'Ladri di biciclette / The Bicycle Thief (1948),' a masterpiece that remains one of the most powerful films I've ever seen. For my much-awaited New Year's Eve double-bill {following Sidney Lumet's '12 Angry Men (1957)'}, I decided to try another of the director's most-respected works, 'Umberto D. (1952),' which, though initially unsuccessful in its home country, has come to be considered one of the foremost examples of the distinctive Italian film-making style.As was typical for neo-realism films, the title role was played by a non-professional actor, Carlo Battisti, a retired professor of linguistic science. Considering that 'Umberto D.' was his sole film appearance, Battisti gives an incredibly sincere performance, his dreary, downcast eyes betraying a lifetime of fruitless existence. Umberto Domenico Ferrari, having completed a mildly successful career in public service, wishes for nothing more than to live out his remaining years in peace and security, but the minuscule government pension doesn't afford him many luxuries; his debts with the wealthy, heartless landlord (professional actress Lina Gennari) are regularly compounding, and so Umberto struggles to feed himself, let alone his faithful canine companion, Flike {occasionally translated as Flag; played by animal actor Napoleone}. Though he occasionally comes across some wealthier friends from his younger days, Umberto has too much dignity to ask them for money, and his half-hearted attempts at begging result in some genuine Chaplin-esquire flourishes of humour {a characteristic that sets 'Umberto D.' apart from many other absolute works of neo-realism}. Indeed, aside from the ever-enthusiastic Flike, Umberto's only other avenue for friendship comes from the young maid in his apartment building, Maria (Maria-Pia Casilio), who is currently pregnant, but cannot decide which of her two boyfriends is the father.All things considered, not very much happens in 'Umberto D.,' but it is the hapless plight of the title character that keeps us dutifully watching, for his eventual fate is continually shrouded in uncertainty. When all security and dignity has been stripped from him, Umberto decides that it is time for him to die, but his love for Flike prevents him from taking an drastic measures, for the greatest tragedy imaginable is a loyal dog without the care of his master. The ending of the film, after Flike fearfully thwarts Umberto's attempts at a "noble" murder-suicide {the shot of the train roaring past Umberto, heaving a cloud of dirt about him, is absolutely incredible}, is something that would not have looked out of place in a Charles Chaplin film. Having returned to each other's arms, Umberto and Flike descend down the road, playing amongst themselves, their futures uncertain, both hopeful and bleak. Where are they going? What will they do now? Will they survive? More than half a century later, we're still asking these questions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An examination of the old age we all fear</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In spite of all the praise I have read about this, I can't see it as a masterpiece. However, the story of a lonely, indigent, pensioner and his struggle to retain his dignity is admirable in many ways. It is hard to imagine that a contemporary movie would have the fortitude to address this issue in such a forthright and non-sentimental way, in spite of the fact that dealing with an aging population is an ever-increasing concern.We are made to feel Umberto's humiliations and indignities in the face of an uncaring society. Nobody wants to deal with his situation. His landlady, who had become accustomed to renting his room for afternoon trysts when he was working, has decided that it would be in her best interests to evict him. Umberto's acquaintances from the past seem to be superficially genial, but are always too busy to relate to him as a person. Umberto does establish some contact with the young maid Maria, but she has her own problems - she is three months pregnant and the paternity of the baby is in question.One of the most impressive scenes has Umberto packing and leaving his apartment before suffering the insult of being evicted. As he descends the stairway, on his way out, for one brief moment his landlady understands his plight, but not enough to reverse her stance.In the end Umberto has only his faithful dog Flike to turn to. Indeed Flike is more honorable than most of the humans Umberto encounters and the love between the man and the animal is touching, but not played with undue sentiment. There are minor annoyances. I could never figure out what the weather was. In the street scenes you had some people wearing suits and heavy overcoats while others were in T-shirts. Umberto, wearing heavy clothes, would close the windows on a sunny day, but Maria would open them in order to wave to her boyfriend. And the deal with Maria's burning the newspapers to ward off the ants was disconcerting - she would have been burned. And was the housekeeping so abysmal that there was no concern about ashes being scattered on the floors? Such scenes compromised the realism for me. Was the mood in Italy after the war so cynical that everyone would treat a decent older man as a cypher? It would have been good to know just how Umberto wound up in his situation. Partway through the movie someone asks "Will there be war?" What was the meaning of that? I thought the time frame was post World War II.I watched this on the Criterion Collection DVD and can report that the film quality is pristine.Umberto's situation is the nightmare we all fear as we age and, if presented, one can only hope to face that situation with Umberto's quiet dignity and acceptance. He looked into the abyss and drew back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sublime slice of quiet human desperation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, let me admit that I love nearly all of the films generally grouped into the category of Italian Neorealism - whether it is works by Rossellini, De Sica, Fellini or Visconti or even the comedies of Comencini. To me, these films explore what it is to be human, and they do so with an eye for the mundane, the extraordinary and the exquisite, so that we are shown the boredom, the challenge and the joy of being alive. Because they want to do this, they play by different rules. These movies, even when their subjects include war or human passion or death, do not omit the everyday aspects of existence. For this reason, some viewers may find them slow, or ask why certain elements are included that do not directly serve the main plot. But that is precisely the point with films of this kind: the film is not the sum of its action, but the realisation of a tangible, fallible, fragile world in which certain actions take place.Vittorio De Sica's "Umberto D." is about a retired civil servant who cannot survive on his pension. For the first time in his life, or so it seems, he is in debt. This shames him to a degree, but he has for the most part learned to cope with the shame and even work a few desperate angles to his advantage. However, what he cannot seem to surmount is the debt he owes to his landlady, who wants him out of the building in any case. That the man has nowhere to go but the poorhouse, and that in going there he would have to give up his dog Flike, troubles no-one else except his landlady's sympathetic young pregnant and unmarried maid (played wonderfully by Maria Pia Casilio in her first screen role).That, essentially, is the plot of the film. In showing this, De Sica manages to give us glimpses at sexual double standards, indifferent government, cold capitalism, the practical use of religious piety (a wonderful scene in the hospital involving a sister of mercy)and faithful canine love.The performances are very good across the board, but the star, Carlo Battisti, a professor of linguistics who never again starred in a film, is outstanding. On his slight shoulders he carries the weight of a world now vanished, a richer and better world that can only be appreciated to its fullest when looking back with wistful eyes.This film isn't perfect, but for me, it will do until perfect comes along.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After lifelong service to the fascist government, a retired worker struggles to survive on his meager pension. As with De Sica's "Bicycle Thieves," this is a simple film employing amateur actors. In the only film he ever made, Battisti is fine in the title role of a man who basically wants a bed to sleep on, but finds that society does not consider his problems relevant. Also good is Casilio as a maid who is sympathetic to Umberto's plight but has problems of her own to resolve. Nothing much happens, but this is a gentle film with moments of humor. It is ultimately a love story - the love between a man and his dog! The dog is cute.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Out of a land where cultural decay is called "local color"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Italian linguist Professor Carlo Battisti (1882-1977) plays the main role, Umberto Domenico Ferrari, in this movie by Vittorio De Sica (1952).The film opens with a confluence of people who demonstrate against the low pensions that the state of Italy pays to its former long-standing employees. One of them is Umberto D., who lives, together with his dog with the mysterious name "Flaik", in a shabby chamber in one of the big old Palazzi whose owner is a singer of more than dubious and heartless character who wants to thrown him out as soon as possible. One should be aware that the portrayed situation of "housing" was nothing extraordinary in post-war Italy: People who could not even afford a 1-bedroom apartment had to move into a huge apartment whose rooms were rented with only limited access to fluent water, electricity, phone, bathroom, toilet. Some people who had inherited such huge apartments with 10 or more bedrooms could make a fortune by renting them to ludicrous prices to the poor old people who fell victim to state's bankruptcy.The movie shows that poor old Umberto D., who has nobody but his dog left, cannot even afford to bring up his monthly rent, starts to sell his most private belongings, spends even one week in a hospital, because there he is nourished in food and spirituality (by a bigot but warm-hearted nun if you know the trick to ask her for a rosary), but in the end, everything goes down the creek. Umberto had even to leave back his dog in the guardianship of his only friend, the young and pregnant maid of his place, but when Umberto comes back, also the dog has been chased away, and there the real downfall of Umberto D. only starts.</fullReview>

I really don't want to say too much, you should view the film as I did - knowning nothing about it. This is a must see.

		<fullReview>Lost between the glare of his earlier The Bicycle Thief, and his later films with Sophia Loren, Vittorio De Sica's 1952 film Umberto D. stands as an almost forgotten masterpiece of Italian Neo-Realism, and one of the last films that could claim to be of that movement alone. It was pilloried by myopic critics upon its opening- mostly Left Wing dilettantes who thought that the formerly middle class civil servant's tale was not 'socially conscious' enough for the filmmaker to waste his talents on, and a few cineastes who felt it too maudlin and weepy. They simply did not understand the chasm between true sentiment and false sentimentality. The film flopped, but has steadily risen in De Sica's pantheon to being thought of as an equal to The Bicycle Thief, or right behind it. The truth is that it is very easy to portray the struggles of the impoverished, as De Sica did in The Bicycle Thief, and Shoeshine before it, as both were laden with struggling children, but to elicit the grandeur of feelings for an old man, Umberto (Carlo Battisti, non-professional actor and retired college professor from the University of Florence), alone in the world, takes a bit more. This is especially so since the lead character is not a particularly warm man. No, he's no Ebenezer Scrooge, but he's a proud and stubborn man who keeps himself emotionally withdrawn from life. He's an everyman, in that he was a civil servant, retired with a meager pension, and has lived in the same small room for decades, harried by a bitch of a bleached blond social climbing poseur of a landlady (Lina Garrari), who loathes him for unspecified reasons- she says he's behind on the rent, but how many people have never been in such a predicament, and are not treated the way she scorns this old gentleman? She even debases him by renting out his room to horny couples while he's away, and a scene of him returning to his soiled bed after strangers have copulated in it is precious- the look of disdain on Battisti's face is utterly priceless.That some people have also misread the film to indict the old man for failing to prepare for the consequences of old age shows how out of touch with reality many critics, then and now, are. These are the same people who would deny Social Security to their grandparents who contributed to it for years, and claim the old are selfish for wanting their fair share. Yes, Umberto is behind on his rent- but he was also living in a time of runaway inflation, that would have eaten up any of his meager savings. And, despite the characterizations of Umberto as cold, at times, he is never disrespectful, not in the blatantly obvious ways the landlady is to him. Thus, when one reads criticism of the film that jab at Umberto's character, or defend the landlady's sadistic actions, one is misreading the very 'realism' that this Neo-Realistic film purports. And the truth is, that just as the dilemma faced by another aging civil servant, in Akira Kurosawa's Ikiru, made the same year as Umberto D., has not changed in half a century or more, and across continents, neither has the dilemma this film shows really changed, and therein lies the timelessness of this tale- which will likely still be as relevant in five hundred years, albeit unfortunately. Sadly, I've known too many real life people like Umberto D., and the foolish criticisms of the film manifest flaws in the critics more so than in the film.The camera movements by Aldo Graziati never intrude on the simple tale penned by longtime De Sica collaborator and novelist Cesare Zavattini, which has some minor things in common with the more recent American film My Dog Skip, another great man and dog film. The DVD by The Criterion Collection is very crisp, and the white subtitles never are obscured, although, like the DVD release of The Bicycle Thief, an English language dubbed soundtrack should have been made, as well as a film commentary by some historian or scholar. The disk does come with a 55 minute Italian TV documentary called This is Life: Vittorio De Sica, a 12 minute interview with Maria Pia Casilio, and writings by Umberto Eco, Luisa Alessandri, and Carlo Battisti. Memories of the film by De Sica, and a new essay by film critic Stuart Klawans, are in the insert.Umberto D. is a great film, and like its kissing cousin, Ikiru, it shows that films on old people can be every bit as engaging as those about the young and beautiful, and not just run of the mill crap like the Grumpy Old Men fare Hollywood spews. Those who criticize this film and its ending are likely the same sort of cretins who find Steven Spielberg and Ron Howard films to be deep and/or moving. Neo-Realism was a movement that should never have flagged, and the world would be better off if a younger wave of filmmakers picked up the banner dropped over half a century ago, for it showed new ways to tell tales and core at the thing that is human in all things- even in the will of a small dog to live with his master, and what that will generates in return.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The dog's name was "Flag." (I think...)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm bemused by several previous reviewers here who variously give the name of Umberto's beloved terrier as "flaic" or "flick." My copy, taped from TCM's Italian film festival introduced by Scorsese's VIAGGIO, clearly identifies the pup as "Flag."That said, "Umberto D" is one of the greatest masterpieces by any Italian filmmaker and, with each viewing, comes ever closer to being my favorite European movie.The film is everything other posters have claimed: terribly sad, deeply moving, and yet with a gentle wisdom behind the tears which enables us to endure our human tragedy just another day.Umberto himself is a wonderfully realized character. Embittered by his fall from the respectability of civil servant to the poverty, desperation and irrelevance of a needy old man in an uncaring world, he still has pride, and pride, along with his deep attachment to his nice little pooch Flag and his own real humanity, keeps him alive.Umberto is not always pleasant to be around: sometimes he is querulous and curmudgeonly, and you want to scream at the unbending pride which prevents him from directly asking for help from old friends, but who can blame him for being human? To him, the poorhouse is a fate worse than death, and he's probably right. A previous poster referred to the great scene where Umberto ALMOST summons up the will to hold his hand out for spare change...and what about what immediately follows that scene, where Flag sits up on his hind legs and holds his master hat in his mouth to beg? He'll do anything -- even sacrifice his own dignity -- to help Umberto survive, even if Umberto himself can't. Whatever his flaws, you quickly come to care very much about Umberto and Flag, and it's because you identify with him, for Umberto, ultimately, is you and every other person who is born and dies.All of the characters in Umberto D are wonderful -- even Lina Garrari's callous landlady is a full human portrait. Sure, she's mean to the old man and wants to evict him for non-payment of rent and because he is declasse, but she IS running a business, she's a person of some culture and sophistication, and her friends seem to like her. When Umberto suffers a "heart attack" and calls to be taken to the hospital, she is transfixed in the doorway, her face an ambiguous mask of...guilt for her treatment of him? And something more, of course...maybe a little shame that now she'll get her way?Umberto's only human friend, the maid Maria, is the perfect complement to these characters. Young, but not innocent...kind and caring, but completely aware that life sucks, and that that's just is the way things are. She empathizes with Alberto and shows him whatever kindnesses she can, but she accepts his tragedy as inevitable. She is pregnant, but understands that neither of her lovers will recognize her child, and that it's her problem -- that's life.And, then, of course, there's Flag. His acting in the final scene at the park and railway track is just magnificent.There are many, many wonderful moments in this movie which remain indelibly marked on the memory, the acting is superb across the board, and it just goes to show that "low-budget" has never stopped a great master from creating a great movie, as de Sica has done here.10/10 -- one of the very best ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm glad others like this so much -- many say it's the best film they've ever seen -- but it falls short of that for me. It's in the "neo-realistic Italian style" using "ordinary people" rather than trained actors which sometimes leads to more realistic films.Not for me in this case. To me, it seemed needlessly "jumpy" -- almost like its sequencing and development followed sort of a "comic strip" model in which actions are briefly portrayed followed by some later ones (or preceded by others), and it's up to the viewer/reader to fill in the gaps in the sequences and development. Also, I've had dogs for over half my long life and they've been very loving companions. While "Flike" (Umberto's dog) was a trained 'actor,' I NEVER saw the emotional reaction of genuine mutual love and affection that usually intermittently, spontaneously takes place between a man (or woman) and his/her dog. Trained obedience? Yes.Companions? Yes.Bosom buddies? No. No sign. Great story. Great plot.Execution? -- so-so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The plot of UMBERTO D. is again straightforward, a characteristic of Vittorio de Sica's films. Threatened with eviction from the seedy boarding-house room he has occupied for thirty years, retired civil servant Umberto Dominico Ferrari (Carlo Battisti) looks for ways to raise money to pay the rent. He tries every avenue, including begging, but the cause proves hopeless. He contemplates suicide but cannot summon up the courage to do so.The film brilliantly encapsulates the central character's plight through small details: the bed in his boarding-house infested with ants; the suitcase with one neatly folded suit and a pair of shoes, Umberto's sole worldly possessions; the way he tries to hold a hand out while begging and then clasps it to his chest, as if aware of the potential shame involved; and the medium shot of his boarding- house room, now with a large hole in the wall as the landlady wants to convert it into a reception-room.No one in postwar Rome wants to know about his suffering. His landlady (Lina Gennari) is a nouvelle riche social climber inviting well-to- do guests in for a soirée while supplementing her income by renting her rooms out by the hour for secret trysts (including Umberto's). Umberto encounters two of his erstwhile work colleagues on the streets; both of them are too busy to stop and talk, even though they pledge their loyalty to him. Later on Umberto wants to leave his dog Flick with a couple inhabiting a seedy apartment; all they are interested in is how much money he is prepared to pay, and when he will collect the dog. He even tries to give the dog to a young girl, but her nurse and her boyfriend dissuade her from accepting in the belief that the dog will spread fleas around the house.Umberto's only friend is the maid Maria (Maria Pia Casilio), who tries to help him but faces ruin herself as she has managed to get pregnant by an unknown boyfriend. Sex, it seems, is one of the few available outlets for the dispossessed to compensate for their lives.Shot in precise black-and-white by G. R. Aldo, the action unfolds in a series of lengthy takes focusing on the characters' relationship to their often dreary environments. Postwar Rome looks an unfriendly place with its deserted squares and dilapidated buildings. The Roman Pantheon is brilliantly used in one shot, its spires extending far into the sky proving the enduring nature of the ancient world, that contrasts with Umberto's ephemeral world which looks to be enduring prematurely.Umberto's relationship to the dog Flick is the film's emotional center. We share his worries when the dog goes missing; and his almost unendurable anxieties when he tries to leave the dog once more in the park. The final sequence looks to be cataclysmic for the man-and- beast relationship, but this is eventually resolved.UMBERTO D. is a relatively short film (only 85 minutes long), but it crams so much social comment into its running time that every moment seems precious.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Man in an uncaring universe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Does anybody really care? Italian neo-realist director Vittorio de Sica paints a picture here of an elderly man with no meaningful human connections. People may give him a little face time, but no one's going to lift a finger to help him much.Umberto D., played poignantly by the non-actor Carlo Battisti, is a government pensioner who has fallen behind on his rent. Though he'd helped his landlady, Antonia (Lina Gennari), a few years earlier during the war, she's forgotten all that and is crudely threatening him with eviction -- withholding any hope to the point of rejecting Umberto's hard-gotten partial payments. Antonia is as implacable as she is statuesque. Others in Umberto's world may seem kinder, but they don't really help either, nestling into their comfort zones such as they are. Umberto stands for old-world values whose dissolution leaves one discomfited. Maria-Pia Casilio as a pregnant young maid encapsulates Umberto's concerns about where the world is heading, as she doesn't know who the father is -- both sex partners "deny it" -- and neglects her grammar lessons."People take advantage of the ignorant," says Umberto, as we sense his warning falls on deaf ears.At one point Umberto goes to the hospital with a fever and even there he doesn't garner much sympathy -- at least not compared to the younger, more suave patient on the cot beside him. Lacking looks and virility, Umberto has lost traction.It bothered me that Umberto finally resorts to thoughts of suicide. The guy had survived that long; his maudlin glancings toward the train seemed a cop-out to me.However, I think that de Sica pretty much nailed a universal truth in our world -- once you've aged, people often pretty much seem not to give a fig, and elders must look to themselves for validation. ===== Coda: From an obituary for Simin Bebahani in The Economist: "She dismissed all the attention paid to the fact she was a woman." And a paraphrase from Eleanor Roosevelt: No one can make you feel like a second-class citizen without your own approval.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad story, cool cinematic style.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first, the film takes a while to get going, and one wonders what this story is about. Throughout the film, Umberto's trouble with money gets increasingly intensified, as he ranges from pawning his belongings to near begging. In the olden days, this style very much shows the true realism. It had very little montage, in the sense that it didn't guide our associations, and more of the realistic filming that Andre Bazin favoured. (Bit of history for you). Everything to the shots, acting, and settings, were planned to give the most realistic portrayal as possible.The actors were mostly newcomers to the industry, and they did pretty well considering. Though maybe it would have been better to have actors with more experience, as the acting felt awkward at times. The film was well made in terms of continuity, and though some parts dragged, this could just be a depiction of life going on. It doesn't add unnecessary drama to fill in the time like most movies do nowadays.As the movie goes along, I find myself sympathizing with Umberto, and wish that he will be able to find a solution to his troubles. The end though, is pretty surprising as it is not a typical ending with closure. In fact, as with the rest of the film, it shows a more realistic ending and was really heartfelt. The addition of Flike as his companion is such a great idea as they played that angle perfectly. Flike is so cute!Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An elderly man (Carlo Battisti) and his dog struggle to survive on his government pension in Rome.Ingmar Bergman cited "Umberto D." as his favorite film, which seems appropriate considering it stands with Bergman's "Wild Strawberries" as one of the great portraits of old age and loneliness ever brought to the screen. According to Robert Osborne of Turner Classic Movies, this was De Sica's favorite of all his films, which really says something when the man made "Bicycle Thieves" (1948). The movie was included in "Time Magazine's All-Time 100 Movies" in 2005.Film critic Stuart Klawans says people today look at the film and love the "astringent" parts but dislike the dog. An unusual observation. Are people so cynical that they want the old man to be even without some sort of friend? Shame on them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Umberto D. Ferrari is an elderly retired government worker attending a demonstration. The police disperses the group. His landlady Antonia threatens to kick him out. He is a proud man and tries to sell his watch for the money. Maria is the friendly maid at the boarding house. She is pregnant by one of two soldiers but neither are willing to help. He is hospitalized for tonsillitis. When he gets out, Antonia is demolishing his room and she lets Flike escape. Umberto would end it all but he needs to find a place for Flike.I love the scene where he can't bring himself to beg for money but he lets Flike to beg with his hat. I like a lot about this movie but I find Umberto too bitter. It would so much better if he is the kindly old grandpa type. Maria is a bit too inexperienced to give the needed emotions. However it's poignant in so many other ways. His love for his dog and his isolation are both heart breaking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Umberto D</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From director Vittorio De Sica (Bicycle Thieves, The Garden of the Finzi-Continis), I knew nothing about this Italian film before I found it in the 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die book, and I had no idea of the concept or plot before watching it, so it was going to be interesting to try. Basically elderly pensioner and retired civil servant Umberto Domenico Ferrari (Carlo Battisti) is taking part in a street demonstration held by other pensioners who are demanding an increase in their money, but the police clean the streets of the crowd, and all he can do is return to his cheap furnished room in a boarding house and his dog Flick. Umberto is threatened to be evicted from the house by the landlady Antonia Belloni (Lina Gennari) who is demanding the rent he owes, all he can do to make the money he needs is sell his books and his watch, he does not want to beg in the streets as he has his pride. He is not able to get a loan from any of his acquaintances as well, his only true friend is the boarding house servant and simple girl Maria (Maria Pia Casilio), she is pregnant with the baby of one of two soldiers, neither of them will admit they are the father. Umberto's financial difficulties are delayed more when he contracts a sore throat and is admitted to hospital, when he is allowed to leave he has a frantic search for Flick who has disappeared, he eventually locates him in a dog pound, but he is indeed evicted from the house and is now homeless. Umberto feeling at his lowest plans to kill himself, so he first wants to find a home for his dog, unable to do this he decides that his pet must die with him, and cuddled up together he stands in the path of an incoming train, but he cannot go through with suicide and moves away, so the film ends with Umberto and Flick just playing together in a park, reaffirming the love for his dog, and for life. Also starring Alberto Albani Barbieri as Fiancé and Elena Rea as Sister. The director said "the ideal film would be ninety minutes in the life of a man to whom nothing happens, that statement does almost seem true as not a lot happens, but the poignant moments definitely work well, with Battisti certainly giving a fantastic performance as the old man going into despair and attempting to fight it, he is supported by non professional actors, shot on location this film works really well as an observational piece of a man ostracised from the society he formerly helped secure, it is a watchable drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Motion Picture Story. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moving Glimpse into One Man's Struggle Against Hopelessness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I should preface by saying that this is the first Vittorio de Sica movie I have watched, and at the time of writing this, I have yet to see his earlier works. I had wanted to watch Umberto D. to get myself familiar with the Italian "Neoverismo" or Neorealist movement, and it helped that my library held a copy of Umberto D as opposed to these other tales.But what a story it is! Umberto D. Ferrari, after working his whole life in a government position, finds that his meager pension can no longer support himself; it's either rent or food. Umberto has months of back-rent owed to his monstrously conceited landlady, who holes him up in a bug-infested bedroom and constantly taunts and threatens the man with eviction. We watch Umberto struggle as he seeks to maintain some semblance of dignity and humanity, primarily through his relationship with the landlady's dark-eyed, disingenuous maid, and his one true companion and love, his pet dog, Flike. As the movie progresses, we watch as Umberto becomes more miserable, desperate, and dejected, as society no longer has need of an irritable old man, and Umberto increasingly contemplates drastic solutions to end his suffering.Carlo Battisti, the eponymous character, emotes with a fussiness, irritability, and resignation that I know all too well in the faces of elderly people in my own family and community. Umberto D. is a man who has worked his whole life and now finds himself without family, without friends, and increasingly, without a roof over his head. His slide into destitution is heartbreaking to watch.Lina Gennari plays the landlady as a never-ending wellspring of inhumane, bourgeois pretension. La Padrona has delusions of turning her tenement house into a place of class and high culture, plans that are frustrated by the presence of a dejected old man and his mutt.Maria Pia Casillo, discovered as a high-school student by De Sica, plays the landlady's maid, and is the closest thing to a human friend Umberto has. She is hiding a pregnancy from la Padrona, fearful that once discovered, she will lose her job as housemaid. She does not know who got her pregnant, one of the soldiers who daily parade outside the house (the one from Naples? the one from Florence?); this frank admission of sexual misconduct horrifies Umberto, who acts, in his limited capacity, as a grandfather for Maria.Flike the dog's expressiveness and liveliness justify all the affection and praise Umberto lavishes on the dog. Umberto won't go a conversation without talking about how lovely Flike is, and as the film progresses he is increasingly more concerned about Flike's well-being than his own.Aside from the landlady and Flike, all the characters in De Sica's Umberto D. are played by non-actors. This gives an earthiness, a weight to their performances. Hard, pockmarked faces inhabit this Rome, whose tall, soaring Renaissance architecture seems to emphasize the smallness of its inhabitants. Ugly faces, old faces, weaselly scoundrels and smiling nuns... all these and more populate the camera as it follows around Umberto and Flike. The camera moves in a lifelike fashion, like an observer, and we watch Maria grind coffee beans in tears as she reflects on her pregnancy, or we watch as Umberto tries to beg but can't bring himself to debase himself in public. These little, mundane human actions are what make the film for me, whether it is Maria dropping everything she's doing to watch the soldiers outside her window, or as an elderly man contemplates taking his dog from the pound or having him put down, and you can see the thousand different painful emotions playing in his hard, worn eyes. They sound unimportant, and they are, but De Sica infuses them with dignity and empathy.We get the sense that this is a real story playing out. From the opening, ineffectual protest of retired pensioners, to the penultimate, wretched scenes at the train tracks, we feel that De Sica has us in his confidence, and is sharing a deeply personal story with us (the film is dedicated to De Sica's father). The film's final moments end on an open note, but ultimately one of hope and humanity in a world that has progressively and aggressively sought to dehumanize Umberto and throw him away with the rest of the trash.The film's notes mention the vicious criticism it received at the hands of the bloated, bureaucratic Christian Democratic Party and corrupt, ineffectual Communist Party, both who hated the film for its subversion and pessimism. Considering post-war Italy's turbulent history, this pessimism might be justified. But this pessimism is ultimately tempered with hope. Because at the end, a man can still love and live for someone, even if that someone is a dog.NOTE: This review is based off of the Criterion DVD. For those more interested in the DVD itself, the picture looks well and the quality is what you would expect from a Criterion release (that is to say, very good!). The monaural mix had no problems (though I listened through headphones on a laptop). The film's liner notes contain a short essay on the film, plus thoughts by Vittorio de Sica on Umberto D. There is no film commentary, but the DVD's extras contain a 51 minute documentary on De Sica's filmography, often narrated and hosted by De Sica himself. Also included are some thoughts and notes by Carlo Battisti, Umberto Eco, and others on the film, and an interview with Maria Pia Casilio about her relationship with De Sica and how she came to work on the film. All of this is excellent and informative and the documentary in particular was a fun watch, if only for De Sica's magnetic personality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like Renoir's The Rules Of The Game, Umberto D. is at times a flawed masterpiece, but it holds together like a true motion picture classic of its time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oscar-nominated for Best Writing, Umberto D. is a film biography of a fictional aged man living in post-war Italy whose pension is unable to support him through his final years. Staying in a rented room of a building owned by a scheming landlady, Umberto struggles to pay his rent and is literally living on borrowed time in the compound. He falls ill with a throat infection one day, and goes on medical welfare for about a week, before returning to his hellhole to find out that his room is vandalized and is almost inhabitable.The film has two central characters, and relies on them almost completely - Umberto and his faithful, loving dog, Flike. The relationship between both is at times strained, but is mostly of an affectionate nature. Through the ups and downs of this particular relationship, Umberto realizes the joy of living comes as simply as it gets. He knows his days are numbered (due to poor physical and financial health), and has even contemplated suicide. But because the bond between him and Flike is so well-forged, he is unable to handle the fact that when he himself is gone, would his dog be able to survive? Umberto and Flike need each other to keep moving in life no matter how dire the circumstances are. Throughout the film, viewers will witness this aspect. Moreover, Umberto doesn't wallow in pity (he cannot see himself as a street beggar). The pride and self-respect that he has allow him to face a bleak life with more optimism and dignity than most. Director Vittorio De Sica (Bicycle Thieves) uses non-professional actors here with stunning results. There's never a moment of cheap emotional manipulation that's vacant and devoid of sincerity.Another likable trait of Umberto D. is its cinematography. Beautifully-composed shots of old rustic streets of Italy are integrated with that of its elegiac architecture, giving viewers an opportunity to view 50s' Italy in its full glory. De Sica's neo-realist drama may not be appreciated by most due to its limited prints and lack of appeal in today's society. Like Renoir's The Rules Of The Game, Umberto D. is at times a flawed masterpiece, but it holds together like a true motion picture classic of its time.GRADE: B (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Umberto D</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this movie is some random movie list about the 5 best movies about loneliness. Taxi Driver was at the top of that list and his one was at the bottom.Quite often I have observed that a director's most famous or critically acclaimed film is seldom is best. 8 and 1/2, the seventh seal and Bicycle Thieves are the movies that come the most to mind when I think of this.Umberto D for me is De Sica's masterpiece. 1952 was the year I guess in which old age and loneliness came to the fore. 1952 was also the year that Kurosawa's Ikiru was released. And an underlying theme in both of them is how unkind people can be. How inconsiderate but they do it all very unknowingly.The only person in the movie who wasn't trained was the dog. All the others were non professional actors which De Sica had handpicked because they suited the vision that he had in mind while writing the screenplay.Umberto D unlike Ikiru is about an old man's struggle to survive when he no family to look after him. As usual there is the helpful young person who is a maid in his apartment played by Maria Pia Casilio. It could have fallen into the clichés but it subverts them. Because De Sica tries to keep the movie as real as he can. I love the scene where Umberto has to buy the glass so he can get change. I have been in a similar situation many times. I didn't know shopkeepers refused to give change even in the 1950's. I always though it was a recent trend.While Umberto D is an ode to loneliness it is not a movie that will depress you or leave you down in the dumps. It is one of the most humane movies I have seen about the human condition. It is about the courage of the human spirit and the will to live through the toughest of times simply because...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No doubt that these Italian neorealistic movies are great ones. They all have in common that they are very simple with its story and set up and often feature non-experienced actors in it, to give the movie all the more a sense of realism.This movie basically follows one person in his everyday life. A pensioner after the war, who not only gets confronted by his old age but also that of the changing world around him and their perceptions of him. It gets more and more hard to get by, also especially financially but luckily he still always has his loyal dog by his side.It's a real simple story but also always an intriguing one to follow, even though of course nothing too spectacular ever occurs in it. The story gets made compelling due to its entire set up and atmosphere that it has. This is what makes basically every neorealistic a pleasure to watch, even the lesser ones.I like the fact that most of the actors in this movie were inexperienced ones. They somehow give the movie more life with its emotions and feelings. The principal actor Carlo Battisti never appeared in a movie before and also never appeared in anything ever since. Sort of the same story can be told about some of the other persons who appear in this movie.There of course also is a social commentary and deeper meaning to it hidden in it but this movies always do a good job at not ever putting the emphasis on that and don't be preachy and all about it but instead let the images and main character tell the entire story for themselves. This also always has as a result that these type of movies will stick to your mind, even when you didn't liked or understood everything when you first were initially watching it.Simple and pure, great Italian neorealistic film-making, from the director of the other great genre example "Ladri di biciclette".8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Umberto D. is one of the most simply told films I have ever seen, yet for some reason I feel I don't understand it. For that, I have to blame the fact that nearly every film made today could not and would not do what Vittorio De Sica did here. It has become so standard, that many film goers are programmed to wait for a big turnaround and hopeful uplift. This film has neither. I will not reveal the ending, but I will say that it is so unique unto itself that I almost rejected the film based on that.Fortunately, I thought better of it and now resort myself to feeling that it is not as powerful or moving as The Bicycle Thief, but it is still a staple of Italian neo-realism and should be recognized as such. The main reason to love it is the dynamic De Sica creates between Umberto and his dog, Flike. In this world, all they have is each other. They rely on one another for friendship and warmth since it seems that practically everyone else they come into contact with are ignorant of them. They do find a friend in Maria, the landlady's maid, but she has her own mishaps and uncertainties. Again, this is not a formulaic film, but a thought-provoking story about what to do when all hope is gone but pride still remains. Do we try and stand strong like Umberto, or do we crumble?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a set up for a ten-handkerchief movie. A man of about 70, a retired petty bureaucrat in Rome, can't pay the rent his selfish landlady is demanding. He only gets his pension of $25 (1951) once a month and he's in arrears. In the end he loses the apartment and everything else and is trying to commit suicide but is interfered with by his dog, Flag.It turns out, in fact, to be a moving film, a bit slow at times, but so intelligently and tastefully handled that its manipulative properties sail under the radar. We get too caught up in the quotidian details to slump in our seats and weep.The pensioner, Umberto D. Ferrara (Carlo Battisti), is above all a proud man. He's on the edge of homelessness, true, and reduced to feeding his dog scraps of spaghetti from a cheap cafeteria. But he's defiant, has his wits about him, and always well dressed in a suit, tie, and hat. He sees other men in rags begging on the streets and making a few lira, yet he can't bring himself to do it, no matter how much he needs the change. In a scene that's both ludicrous and heart breaking, he trains Flag to sit up on the sidewalk holding a hat upside down in his mouth, a canine beggar. But Umberto can't bring himself to be associated with Flag and hides behind a pillar to see if the trick pays off. It does not. Passers by pause for a second or two, staring down and wondering what the hell this dog is up to, before bustling off. Umberto rarely smiles. Neither does he break down and sob. In the course of the film his expression slowly deteriorates from determination to exhausted resignation.His landlady hates him -- she wants him out so she can rent the apartment as a meeting place and make more money. (Meanwhile she rents rooms by the hour for assignations.) But he has a few friends too. He meets several of his cohort on the sidewalks and they exchange pleasantries, but the moment he brings up the subject of material subsistence, they find they have to catch a bus. His most caring acquaintance is a young chambermaid at his apartment house. She does him small favors, fetching him a thermometer when he's ill, or bringing him a left-over slice of cake, or visiting him in the hospital, but there's not much else she can do to help. She's poor too, and dominated by that gross and venomous landlady. (Come to think of it, that concierge could have been played by my ex. Oops. Sorry, Grimhild.) Furthermore, the careless young maid is three months pregnant and isn't sure about who the father might be, although she manages to narrow it down to two soldiers.It's a sad and ultimately depressing tale, the Little Match Girl of Rome. I don't care that, at the end, Umberto dashes out of danger and sweeps the little dog up into his arms, determined once again to face life and all its travails. The indisputable fact is that he's no better off than he was before. Worse, probably. And it won't get any better with the passage of time unless he wins the Powerball Lottery. There is no way his pride, dignity, and defiance will save him from defeat. He may rage against the dying of the light, but the light will go out anyway -- and his dog will probably have to get along without him.Yet, I'm willing to give this movie a number of bonus points for two chief reasons. One is that the story is handled with such good taste, as if made for adults instead of ten-year-olds. Not once does little Flag slobber over his master's face. Not once does Umberto have to explain to anyone (ie., the viewer) how badly off he is -- because the director, Vittorio De Sica, is SHOWING us visually. The second reason is that this film established a convention that was to be repeatedly imitated over the years -- the suffering victim of life's circumstances who never complains and faces his loss bravely. See "Harry and Tonto" and "Terms of Endearment" for examples of what I mean, though both are more commercially oriented. Well, I'll give this an extra half point for having been made on a budget that was probably less than the amount De Sica was leaving as restaurant tips later in his life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth Looking Into</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie draws much of its power from juxtaposing the caring with the uncaring. It's Umberto's caring relationship with his homely little dog that's so compelling. It's his one solid attachment to an uncaring world that has cast him aside like an empty bottle. He has something of a caring relationship with the youthful maid, another cast-out, yet most of the time he only cares about what she can do for him. At the same time, we see what the old man and the young girl maybe don't see?that each offers a human bond that could grow. Perhaps she sees this potential which is why the long wistful look at his departing streetcar, but the old man may be too defeated to risk anything new. I like to think that with his new lease on life, which the ending implies, he goes back to offer the fatherly relationship the girl needs. After all, families are more than blood kinship.The opening scene shouldn't be overlooked. There we find out that Umberto's predicament is not just personal, but derives from government policy to depress pensions on which the old man and thousands of other seniors depend. Of course, from that point on, the narrative follows his personal attempts to cope, but the problem's source should not be forgotten. By implication, Umberto's struggle for old age dignity is a struggle other elderly deprived Italians are facing, though the movie quickly departs from that larger aspect. Yes indeed, the movie is shot-through with emotion. But it's not done on the cheap. Note that Umberto is something less than a winning personality. He's a cranky old man, seldom smiles (count them, I stopped at two), and doesn't pay much attention to the girl except to fetch the thermometer. We feel sorry for his plight, but without that attachment to the dog, the compassion would likely remain abstract and not the arousing emotion that generates the movie's unusual power. On the other hand, the screenplay does rather stack the deck by making the landlady such an uncaring ogre. She comes across like a lacquered manikin with regard only for herself, her operatic parties, and even rents out Umberto's room for afternoon assignations. She could care less what becomes of him after illegally turning him out. At least, the uncaring handlers at the dog pound have something of an excuse for their indifference. She doesn't. Compared to her, Umberto is something of a saint, though he, in turn, is not above exploiting the charity hospital for a place to stay.Note too, how Umberto is trying not only to survive, but also to survive with dignity. He's always immaculate in appearance, dresses carefully in his one suit, as though he can't abandon his white-collar station in life. There's also an uncertainty about begging for money on the street. He's desperate to get the funds to stop his landlady, yet turns over his hand at the last moment to avoid taking alms from a stranger. Also, he can't bring himself to solicit help from the man who acts like a former office superior, even though the man's friendly demeanor suggests he would comply. I'm not sure whether Umberto is preserving his dignity as a human being or as an ex-government official. The contrast is not idle since we're inclined to praise the former but not necessarily the latter.Surprisingly, the movie is not without a touch of humor. Please, couldn't the Marshall Plan of post-war aid to Europe have included some insecticide for the kitchens of war-torn Italy. I couldn't believe that maid Maria lit a torch of newspapers to incinerate the ant invasion. The blaze was big enough to ignite the whole house and neighborhood, yet she treats it like she's washing dishes. At least I thought her deadpan expression the whole time she's acting like a pyromaniac was funny. Anyhow, at a time when Hollywood was convincing America that big screen Technicolor, well-stacked actresses, and million-dollar budgets really do produce more, there was this little film that proves how so much less can in fact produce so much more. It couldn't have cost more than 50 bucks to make, with a lead actor we pass on the street every day. I suspect there's a moral here, and if I'm not mistaken, I think it has a lot to do with the moral of this great humane classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Emerging from a likeminded mass of jilted pensioners with his adorable Jack Russell terrier in tow, it's clear from the opening scenes that Carlo Battisti's Umberto D. is not your average avatar of populist sentiment, and that this movie is tougher than your average mushy humanist parable. Grumpy and pushing back against the ever-changing society that threatens to render him obsolete, Battisti is (happily) anything but a kindly grandfather, and his failings and constant struggle to stay afloat make him that much more recognizably human amidst a postwar gallery of indifferently greedy opportunists. Consequently, his gradual loss of dignity and self-worth is so affecting because it represents a triumph for anonymous gain over human empathy. He's comforted to a certain degree by a maid who's too young and inexperienced to offer true succor; the sundry acquaintances he visits outside his old office seem vaguely embarrassed by his ruffled, needy state. Then there's the grotesque landlady, so possessed with her gentrification project that she's all too happy to throw her 20-year tenant out in the streets to rot. His dog, Flike, is his only reason for enduring the indignity of everyday life. This is not a pretty picture of growing old in an economically progressive society, and poignancy and topicality increase if one considers parallels to our current Social Security crisis.Assaulted from all angles by forces of modernity, the poor guy gets no respite even in bed, as streetcars rumble in the street below and his callous landlady belts out arias nightly for her movie-theater-owner fiancé. Battisti's alienation to this changing world is concisely encapsulated in an upside-down shot taken from his perspective as he leans out the window and glimpses a cinema's doors slowly closing, the projector's grainy light seemingly receding underground. Aside from a few fleeting vestiges of neorealism, this is an expressive vision of hope and suffering, buoyed by emotive music and operatic tonal shifts that convey life's untenable vicissitudes. Brilliantly, it's simple enough for a child to understand and filled with enough pathos and wisdom to ring authentic to adult experience. De Sica gives Umberto a few questionable attributes?how did he amass such debts? what of the other pensioners who make due under the same circumstances??and has enough faith in our empathy, and Battisti's performance, to present his story sans pandering. And Battisti, an amateur in his first and only acting role, is serendipitous, the weight of the world persuasively evinced in his vacant stare and sagging eyelids?where did De Sica find this guy and why did he never act again?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A superbly crafted and singularly poignant film that educates as it engages. Among its many strengths, perhaps the greatest is the performance of Carlo Battisti as Umberto. While I am echoing the comments of many others here, I must add my voice to those in awe at the strength of the performance delivered by a man who was not a professional actor ? an accomplishment made all the more remarkable as he was not 'playing himself'.With a little regret, I will arrest my review here, not because I do not wish to say more, but rather because in the particular case of this film I feel it is probably best for people to see it knowing less rather than more about the story. I would encourage anyone reading this who has not yet seen the film to stop reading, and simply see it ? better to consult these reviews afterwards I would think. Not to worry if it's too late for that though, even so I should think you'll still very much enjoy the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The dog's name is Flaik or Flike (to rhyme with "like") - listen to the dialogue!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>According to various different DVD/video sleeve notes I have seen over the years, Umberto's dog is called Flaik or Flike (both pronounced to rhyme with the English word "like" - as in "I like that").This appears to be borne out by the pronunciation heard in the original dialogue.Great film, bordering on the sentimental at times, hence only 8, but still extremely powerful, and at times simply beautiful.The theme of alienation so crucial to this film would have felt achingly immediate for film-goers in 1950's Italy. It is a testament to the power and timelessness of the film that this theme still seems relevant to us today. Not all neo-realist films have weathered so well - but then "Umberto D." reflects the mature period of the genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw this film today in film class, and for the first time in two years of film studies I was moved to tears by a chosen film. This film was amazing.It's a fairly simple story, and not one that I haven't heard or seen in other films or books, but it just seemed so real. It was heartbreaking to see this proud man reduced to thoughts of suicide, and try to leave his only friend in the world.I want to use the word magnificent to describe the acting done, but it is too showy a word for something so real. I find it hard to believe that this was a first-time gig for both 'Umberto' and 'Maria'. I have never felt so much pity, sympathy, and distraught at watching characters undergo similar situations.It also gave a pretty bleak view of society. It is horrible that nobody is willing to help, and this was fifty years ago. It's unfortunate that things are even worse now. It should not be so difficult for someone to simply survive, which is all Umberto strives for. He wants to live in the room he's occupied for twenty years, and have food for he and his beloved dog. It's disgusting that the world he lives in cannot help him achieve that.It was absolutely heartwrenching to watch Umberto attempt to abandon Flag. The desperate determination that is evident on Umberto's face is almost enough to make you wish that he does successfully leave Flag with a new family, and manage to end his sad existence. I am glad that he was not, because if he was I think I would have been a blubbering mess in the school theatre.Truly inspirational. And that is the first time I have ever felt the need to use those words.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I noticed that this movie was playing in town for one night only, so I checked IMDb for more information. Based on the user ratings and comments, I figured I shouldn't miss this opportunity to educate myself with such a classic, but I was somewhat apprehensive. I haven't had a lot of luck with, say, pre-60's movies. Especially not ones about hard social conditions, which I suspected would be a little too heavy handed or self-absorbed to reach a late 20th century person like myself. I felt safer with Hitchcock or the Three Stooges if I were going to go that far back.But I think Sica did a great job. There was real human depth which almost entirely erased all sense of historical distance, as if I were reading great literature, able to forget it was written hundreds of years ago. There was great atmospheric depth, more than I've learned to expect from B&amp;W cinematography. (The scene with the cat night-prowling as seen through the glass roof is evidence of the director's subtle aesthetic sensitivity, and there were many such touches throughout.) Also, the story was very well-developed, and with many real comedic elements, along with very sad and anxious elements. I could easily relate, and that's what eliminated the distance. No cultural distance was produced either, even with the very rich depiction of Italian culture in Rome, (but, thank God it was subtitled, of course!). This is not just a work of art of a particular time or place. It's not even ahead of its time--this movie is for all times and people.I wonder what will happen to Umberto, though? Was his dog, Flick, his salvation, or the prolongation of his despair?I'll definitely be on the lookout for more Sica films, though I hear this is one of his best. Maybe I'll even extend my education further into other "neorealist classic" films of this era and learn to embrace more of the early B&amp;Ws!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Umberto D.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Post-war Italy was reeling after the fall of Mussolini which led to a broken economy and those suffering civilians such as Umberto D. Ferrari. There's a cruel irony to the fact that former government workers such as himself have been reduced to poverty after acting as the backbone to the fascist party for so many years. And we see remnants of this ideology immediately; the opening presents many Umbertos protesting the state of affairs, and whom are chased off by the police (closely resembling the military) because they do not have the right permits. This isn't quite the free democratic society we are often so used to seeing depicted. Of course critics then and now did not respond so eagerly to De Sica's masterpiece - expressions of a pandering sentimentality and even criticised by the government for its shabby, depressive representation of the society at the time. With age however it has become a cornerstone of Italian neorealism. The stylistic choices the De Sica mastered showcase their full effect; who could accuse the sweet, patient way in which the camera observes the maid go about her morning ritual in long take of sentimentality? It makes routine into something tragic, because even in the endless chores and the neglected, ant-infested building there is some brief security that will soon be gone once she starts showing. And even as Umberto tosses and turns for an agonising length we know that it is highly preferred to sleeping on the street.In the amateur actor Carlo Battisti De Sica found something of a marvel. In his weathered, lean face we see that he knows all the tricks of living in poverty - he cleverly manouevers a meal to feed his loyal dog Flike, he makes an impassioned pitch to sell his old watch, and when he needs change for a taxi, it doesn't descend into desperation for desperation's sake; he quickly buys and tosses a glass cup because his objective is much more important. De Sica's long takes are unprejudiced and unsympathetic, and there is never a sense of exploitation of a scene for dramatic purposes. There are moments of such startling tragedy and poignancy that do not seem the least bit theatrical or played out - the subtle way in which Battisti flips over his palm as if to pretend to be only checking for rain, not wanting to look like a beggar. Or the way he slowly backs out of the door while staging a distraction for Flike who would otherwise protest his master's leaving. Or the little moment of realisation that leaving Flike at the shelter would be an act of slow cruelty. It is a slow, deliberate staging of dignity being stripped away, but none of it feels manufactured. Opposing neorealist tradition is the dog behind Flike, a trained acting dog, but because we do not scrutinise an animal as much as we scrutinise a human's mannerisms, it because a natural and dependent relationship. It becomes heartbreaking and true when we realise that Umberto is looking for a place for Flike to stay; for a while, indefinitely, forever? We do not know for sure, but the mood is grim all the same. And when he makes what seems like a decision with no other alternative, after trying everything else (even hiding and hoping Flike will run away), he cannot commit to the double suicide. This is powered by a tiny vestige of selfishness which we all have - a striving for companionship in even the darkest of times, and there is no better role for that job than a dog. And watching this magnificent film, we can only hope that we are never pushed into a corner like Umberto, but if we were, that we too would possess that little bit of humanity left in us to coax that dog back to our side.</fullReview>

Instead of that, he is able to make, us the viewer, feel identified with him, see him as somebody close to our reality. And that's why this movie is so marvelous and have to be seen, even if it could a very sad and depressive experience.The ending is moving to enough to make any viewer cry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"It (my film) is the tragedy of those who find themselves cut off from a world they helped to build, a tragedy hidden by resignation and silence, but one that occasionally explodes into loud demonstrations or is pushed into appalling suicides. A young man's decision to kill himself is taken seriously, but what does one say of the suicide of an old man already close to death? It's terrible. A society that allows such things is a lost society." - Vittorio De Sica Vittorio De Sica's "Umberto D" opens on a group of street demonstrators. They're an orderly mass of retirees, all demanding a pension rise. De Sica then focuses on one particular protester: Umberto Domenico Ferrari, a retired civil servant. He shares the name of De Sica's own father, a retried bank clerk, to whom the film is dedicated. Of all his works, De Sica would regard "Umberto D" as his personal favourite. In the West, it is regarded as one of cinema's seminal neorealist works. Upon release (and still in many places today) the film was harshly criticised for its saccharine and sentimental qualities. In truth, the whole neorealist movement tends toward contrived manipulation and sentimentality, often romanticising suffering and sanctifying the impoverished. De Sica would be ignored when he "left" the neorealist movement (in the mid 50s), but some of his best films were made in the 1960s and 70s.After hitting us with a flurry of billboards and angry chants, De Sica has the police arrive and the protests quickly squelched. White handkerchiefs wipe sweaty brows, subtle hints at white-flag surrenders. Men, organisers and union heads then squabble. We learn that the protesters were denied demonstration permits, the state planning in advance its motive for disbanding the crowds. The point is clear: in post-fascist Italy, fascism is far subtler. Cunning and manipulative, the authorities "contain protesters" under the guise of "restoring order" for the majority of the citizenry. What's staggering is the ordered, well behaved methods of both the protesters, the public and the police force. De Sica stresses obedience, professionalism, calm. Throughout the ordeal, traffic flows incessantly, the pensioner's cause invisible.The film then nosedives into its central plot, De Sica watching as Ferrari - who we learn has little money and was depending upon a pension rise - struggles to survive from one day to the next. And so we watch as friends and officials feign deafness when Ferrari asks for help, as landlords turn blind eyes to his plights, and as he pretends to have an illness so as to get admitted into a hospital which offers better accommodation than the outside world.Several scenes follow which resemble De Sica's earlier "Bicycle Thieves", Ferrari selling watches and items in an attempt to generate cash. Much of the film then revolves around Ferrari's attempts to locate his pet dog, which is lost on the streets and being hunted by a municipal pound responsible for capturing and exterminating stray animals. The dog's plight, of course, echoes Ferrari's. Neither seems to have a right to live, both are overlooked, both seem unworthy of care, and both are categorised by a bureaucratic state as being part of a social strata which it deems "necessary", "logical" even, to allow to wither and pass away. All Ferrari's struggles thus have a larger weight behind them, the audience always aware of the political forces obstructing the remedies to the problems encounters. The film then enters Visconti territory, in the way it shows various generations subtly pitted against one another. The postwar economic recovery benefits some, but others have been left behind as the nation moves forward. To the new, remobilized Italy, they are not essential. Ferrari thus exists in a kind of stasis, consigned to anonymity. People see him, but he is too distasteful a reminder, a totem of political memories which post-war Italy seeks to discard. The film ends with hints of suicide and shots of the old, feeble Ferrari inter-cut with happy, playing children; Italy's past and future, old and young. The film as a whole, and its climax, strongly resembles Kurosawa's "Ikiru", released the very same year as "Umberto D".The film boasts clear, crisp black and white cinematography by Aldo Graziati and continues De Sica's use of nonprofessional actors. Ferrari is himself played by Carlo Battisti, a former university professor. Ironcally, De Sica's film found itself, like Ferrari, battered upon release, the state and various film boards ashamed of both its subject matter and style. Indeed, the whole neorealist movement, with its socially investigative qualities, progressive voice and often Marxist overtones, proved worrisome for the Catholic Church and various Italian arms of power. There are even documented cases of Hollywood producers, distributors, studios and financiers pushing for the movement to be squelched (after the US conquered Italy, it extorted many favours from the new governments), as it was cutting into Western profits.Modern viewers unimpressed with "Umberto D" (it's a bit schmaltzy), may want to check out two excellent, similar recent films: "Wendy and Lucy" by Kelly Reichardt (obvious De Sica influences) and "Land of Plenty" by Wim Wenders. De Sica's last masterpiece was the overlooked "Garden of the Finzi Continis".8/10 - Worth one viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Exemplary Piece of Italian Neo-Realism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quite simply, this film is brilliant. Building on his previous triumph, the Bicycle Thief, de Sica uses the same techniques to document the trials and tribulations facing an ageing, impoverished pensioner in the economic turmoil of post-War Rome.The use of non-professional actors gives the film a heightened sense of realism and each hurdle the protagonist overcomes is laden with external and internalised drama which is vividly conveyed. Likewise, the simplicity of each shot with the use of close-ups to convey what characters think, is so utterly effective that it is a text-book example of good cinematography. Unfortunately,there are some moments in the film where de Sica is a little too blatantly manipulative of the audience's emotions, most notably with regard to the scene at the dog pound and the potential fate that awaits Flike there.The callousness of the landlady and the sluttishness of her maid convey both the lack of concern for the poor and the general moral decline and chaos of the era as Italy tried to reinvent itself after Mussolini.Perhaps this film falls just a little short of the Bicycle Thief's perfection but it is still an exemplary film about suffering, fear and uncertainty and the small hopes we cling to as we strive to a brighter future. In that sense, it is a perfect representation of the immediate post-War era.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>State pensioner Umberto (Carlo Battisti) can't live on his meager monthly stipend; his bossy landlady is demanding back rent, his throat is scratchy, his sweet nurse is pregnant by any of two national guardsmen, and his beloved mutt has to eat scraps from a food shelter. Amongst all this devastation, sadness, and post-war economic criticism, Vittorio De Sica and Cesare Zavattini fashion their most enduring portrait of survival, and though it's a struggle that will bring Umberto and his dog to ruin and back (possibly), with thoughts of suicide and a future of homelessness, it's a triumph of human spirit. But De Sica never betrays the possibility, in the best Neo-Realist tradition, that Umberto is destined to fail because his social system has let him down, put him out to pasture as it were, as the film's most startling metaphor ? a frantic trip to a dog pound ? suggests in not so subtle detail, and further expanding on the themes he and Zavattini helped to invent with "Bicycle Thieves" and "Shoeshine", a potential "happy" ending, Umberto and his dog walking off into the sunset, after forsaking suicide, as children run towards the camera in joyous glee, is fraught with implications of further poverty and nowhere to go. It's a conflicting message that left critics, and Italian audiences, scratching their heads, but time has been kind to this greatest of all Italian films, and the balance between tear-jerking sentiment and harsh national criticism blends with a very pleasing aftertaste.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You won't laugh ... You won't cry ... the film transcends these banalities ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My first encounter with Vittorio De Sica's "Umberto D." was through Scorsese documentary "My Voyage to Italy", an insightful introspection into the Italian roots that deeply influenced Marty, the film-maker and Marty, the man. And you could tell from the gripping realism of his New York streets' portrayal to the burning torments tearing his characters' souls apart, that Marty's creations wouldn't have been the same without the Italian neo-realism that enriched post-War Cinema with so many humble but no less glorious masterpieces. It's like the dust of Italy's destroyed cities planted the seeds of a new universal faith in human spirit ? as if there was no creation without destruction, and no redemption without an action.My expectations were already high when the 'Scorsesian' journey halted in "Umberto D." and I knew the movie's reputation enough to figure that I wouldn't be disappointed by an Italian neo-realist film, probably in the same vein than the glorious predecessor from the same director, "Bicycle Thief". As surprising as it sounds, I was completely misled by the excerpts I saw, and for the better. With a movie's premise such as an old man and a little dog, I expected many emotional moments, waiting for my tears to shed in an almost pervert thirst for emotions, but my eyes remained dry, while my heart melted inside. I realized there was an inner intelligence in "Umberto D." that prevented it from falling in the typical pathos, we're eager to forgive when it comes from an old black and white movie, foreign in addition."Umberto D." rises itself above any attempt to play with your emotions with such dignity and maturity, it almost diminishes the overly emotional aspects of "Bicycle Thief" for no more dramatic issues. I feel guilty to criticize De Sica's indisputable masterpiece but in my defense, he was the one who started. Umberto Domenico Ferrari is a retired civil servant man struggling to keep his small room in a modest state pension owned by a greedy landlady who'd rather kick him out so she can use his room for more libertine and lucrative occupations. Unfortunately, his pension don't cover the fifteen thousands Lire he still owes to the landlady, even if he skips some meals or calls himself sick to spend a few nights at the hospital. Through funny tricks or gloomier acts of despair, the film features a slow descent into poverty, with the heart-pounding question: where will this all lead? Especially, in a realistic film where the hero has less chances to win in a lottery game than his landlady to get struck by a bolt of lightning. The film doesn't invite for optimism.But any attempt of total pessimism is swept off by two important elements. First, there's Flike, Umberto's dynamic pet dog and the second more important character. Flike represents Umberto's remaining bound to Life, whatever Umberto does is about surviving, but for Flike, it's a matter of living. Flike inspires a sense of responsibility and duty to Umberto preventing him from falling into the spiral of misery and sorrow. His room is Flike's room, his life is Flike's life, for men, working is living, for a retired man who can't work anymore, and being responsible is the ultimate way of feeling alive. Umberto is loved and trusted by Flike, and you can tell from the great chemistry they have. But the intelligence of the script is not to totally outcast Umberto and makes him more than 'the man with the dog'. Umberto has a poignant father-and-daughter relationship with the young maid Maria, abandoned in pregnancy by two soldiers, among who hides the father, she knows she'll be fired sooner or later, but like Umberto, she blindly hopes for a brighter future. Maria and Umberto's growing complicity, goes beyond their misfit status, reminding them that each one is carrying a something significant enough not to make them feel useless, something whose weight gets more palpable as time goes by."Umberto D." realism reaches a powerful state of neutrality, faithful to real life where even the hottest tears are cooled down by the little something that gives life its value back, there's never constant misery in life, because life is the quintessential antidote to this heart-devouring poison. That's why, instead of a character that carries all the weight of the world on his shoulders, we have a man admittedly looking tired but struggling to keep a sense of dignity in memory of that lost time where he was a respected civil servant. Dignity and maturity are values beautifully incarnated by the face and the appearance of Carlo Battisti, spectacular in his ordinary authenticity, proving again that some roles transcend the notion of professional acting as if realism could only work in a self-reflexive approach. Umberto's quest is more of respect than money, a nuance hinted in the first scene when a march of men demanding a raise of their pensions is brutally stopped by the police, highlighting a blatant lack of respect toward elderly men. And Umberto carries the tragedy of this fight for dignity in his tired eyes, avoiding by any means the dishonor or becoming homeless or a beggar, although what he does in the beginning looks like begging, there's a thin line between selling a watch and explicitly begging.1952 was a great year for foreign films, "Forbidden Games" was the classic French masterpiece about two kids playing with death during the War, and "Ikiru" a more similarly themed film than "Umberto D." featured a man in quest for dignity, eager to provide a meaning to a rather insignificant life. What do these movies have in common? An inspirational statement about the human nature, but for some reason, "Umberto D." manages to dominate these masterpieces, because it's the less cinematic of the three : no solemn music, not the typical "you'll laugh! You'll cry!" premise but simply the perfect balance of emotions, that makes the whole story even more endearing, and universally appealing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>1952 Italian neo-realism Masterpiece. society discards the unwanted elderly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Umberto D 1952 Directed by Vittorio De La Sica Much has been written about this landmark masterpiece from Vittorio De Sica. There aren't many serious films about aging. I first saw it as a young man in college in 1972 at the Texas Tech University Center Auditorium. At 19 I was thoroughly moved by this story of old age, poverty, &amp; near-despair! I cannot recall if I have seen his movie Bicycle Thieves. Umberto Domenico Ferrari, (Carlo Battisti in real life a university professor) an elderly &amp; retired civil servant, is desperately trying to maintain a decent standard of living on a rapidly dwindling state pension. But he's up against his tyrannical landlady, who keeps demanding rent that he can't pay (while renting his room out to prostitutes during the day), &amp; his only friends are the pregnant housemaid &amp; his little dog Flike. This is one of the greatest Italian Neo-realist movies of the 1950s &amp; 1960s. The plot has a very Dickens type outlook of bleak darkness &amp; almost despair. Purely character drive this is a simple story of an older man's loneliness &amp; poverty. The director &amp; screen writer allow this older gentleman to continue his downward spiral as we watch squashing our naive notion of deliverance (or escape). It is a great film without being to overtly sentimental. The acting in this film is absolutely superb. Carlo Battisti, despite having never acted before, is wonderful as the titular character; his face is a fascinating blend of stubborn dignity weariness of life. Maria Pia-Casilio, who plays the maid, is just as good as evoking life's loneliness &amp; quiet desperation. The supporting cast is also very strong. De Sica makes some fascinating commentary on the human condition, specifically the loneliness &amp; depression the older generation in our society face. I wonder what will happen to Umberto, though. Was his dog, Flick, his salvation, or the prolongation of his despair? A great unblinking film shows us how society discards the unwanted elderly. 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The thing I like about this film is that every character acts exactly as they would. There is no "forcing" or overplaying a role. While many talk of sadness, for me, there was no sadness because it played out the way it had to. Umberto D. needed assistance, but in his world, there was nothing to give. He couldn't rely on a girl who was pregnant and unmarried, or a landlady who disdained him and was trying to social climb. Even the nuns and hospitals had way too many charges.There was nothing left to give. And who knows...what was his life like before the present state? Why was he in debt? Was he profligate, or mean, or a gambler? The former colleagues who he met on the street seemed to be doing quite well...even at the beginning, the other seniors he enlisted to rebel revealed that they had no debts...unlike Mr. D.And so, there seemed to be a case that he had indeed made his own bed, even as it was being taken away from him.And that is the beauty of this spare film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hauntingly Beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this film back in 1986 in film class in college. This film got me hooked on foreign films. An elderly gentleman whose only friends are his dog Flic and the maid that works in the building that he lives. He's struggling to come up with the rent on an EXTREMELY tight income and the landlady treats him with a horrible lack of respect(Letting people use his room when he's out, for example). There is an incredible feeling of despair throughout the film (The maid is pregnant and you are aware that, once her boss finds out, she will soon be on the street, in worse shape as Umberto.) and the viewer gets caught up in it. Still, it is a hauntingly beautiful movie worth having in your collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite film of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I mainly posted this review to say that it is my favorite film of all time, and so I was flattered to read here that Ingmar Bergman said that it was his favorite film of all time as well. It is a must-watch as long as you are of the right persuasion and do not buy your movies at Walmart, because you will not find anything blowing up here; no product placement and it was not uber-market tested to appeal to the least common denominator. Nor does it feature played out actors delivering sound bytes disguised as lines. In fact much of the cast of Umberto D. were not even actors. However if you have an attention span longer than that of a flea and know how to appreciate a masterpiece then this is one for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Quiet Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Umberto D (1952) is a necessity for aspiring filmmakers to truly grasp the notion of loving and hating on-screen characters, and also to witness the Italian Neo-Realist motion in full swing. The fact that the actors were so able to confidently portray the delicate characters in this classic despite being non-professional actors is simply outstanding, a credit to director De Sica. De Sica, a proved genius due to his earlier film, 'Bicycle Thieves', manages to blend the camera work into the narrative, not making it an addition that the audience is aware of. Paired with the award winning script which constructs the beautiful characters, this is a film that'll make you feel a whole collection of emotions from sadness to glee. Some film-goers may yawn at the 'simple' plot, an elderly man struggling financially in post war Italy, but this absence of heavy narrative allows the focus to shift to other things, a risk that pays off perfectly. Umberto D is an undeniable masterpiece, and one that should be on every persons watch list.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The sad tale of an old man evicted from his home hardly sounds like a fun night at the movies and wouldn't set the box office on fire, but what we have here is arguably the greatest Italian neo-realist film ever. "Umberto D." tackles nothing less than the meaning of life in a seemingly offhanded way. And it takes a dog to supply some of the answers. Told in simple terms, the story exposes many of life's deepest moral dilemmas. Performances are spot on, especially by Carlo Battasi as the title character. And let's not forget about Flike, the dog! He deserved an Oscar!! Without a trace of maudlin sappiness, "Umberto D." is heartbreaking, uplifting, and unforgettable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Director Vittorio DeSica does it again...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a passionate film lover, it really is a very important event when I discover a "new" film that can challenge my top 5 favorite movies ever seen, but that also leaves me with the question: How come I didn't know about this movie before? As a filmmaker on the beginning of my journey, I'm trying to feed myself with anything I can use to stimulate my creative process and since I've been exposed to international cinema since an early age, when it comes to European Film, Italian cinema has a very special place in my heart, with so many influential movies that have changed me for ever. Bicycle Thieves is definitely one of the best movies I have ever seen. And it seems like a bad joke that even when I love this movie and I have seen some other of Vittorio's films, I just didn't know about the existence of UMBERTO D. So, again, How come I didn't know about this movie before?Synopsis: Umberto Domenici Ferrari is an elderly man who lives with the difficulties of being a retired pensioner who spends his time in the solitude of his very small room in Rome, for which he can't afford paying the rent anymore. These are rough times in old post-war Italy where poverty and unemployment were as common as for someone to need to beg for money or steal it to be able to eat a meal. You either ate or paid your bills, and when you are an old man with no family, things wont be any easier for sure. And Umberto wasn't the kind of man that could beg for money or take it from someone else.Umberto's days pass by with the company of his fellow friend Flick, a dog with more than average intelligence. Flick follows Umberto through a heart-breaking journey as he comes to the self-realization of his hopeless situation. He is continuously making every possible decision that could potentially resolve his financial problems but also ensure a good life for Flick.His lack of success at dealing with an angry landlady, Antonia Belloni, makes him go through different stages of desperation and unsuccessful attempts to raise the money for rent. His only companion besides Flick, is the maid of the house where he rents his room. She shares with Umberto the news about her pregnancy and also her uncertainty on who the father of the baby could be, she is the lover of two young soldiers. She helps Umberto while he falls under his "fevers", which he uses as a deflecting solution for him to stretch his due payment date, since he chooses to spend some time at a hospital so he can at least ensure that he will have a roof over his head for the meantime but also that he doesn't get kicked out of the house just yet. The story grows painfully worse when after been threaten with eviction, Umberto is left with the only imaginable option for him to finish it all and escape his debts, he decides to commit suicide. With a running time of 89 minutes, Umberto D is a black and white gem from Italian Neorealism cinema with impressive photography and storytelling. It's a masterpiece that contains a deep social commentary, underlining on principals and human values.The Director Vittorio DeSica does it again and brings together the writing of Cesare Zavattini, the incomparable music scoring of Alessando Cicognini and the delightful cutting of Eraldo Da Roma. These artists join forces again to make a picture as beautiful and iconic as they did in the past with Bicycle Thieves. And even though, most of the enduring cast members were non-professional actors, including actor Carlo Battisti, who claimed the lead role of Umberto, you feel satisfied with the delivery of every single character.Carlo Battisti brings life to an endearing character that you can't help but to feel empathy for him, with a very powerful and honest performance that will break your heart from beginning to end. Lina Gennari who is one of the few trained actors, nailed it at playing her role well as the stone cold diva, opera singer, who never showed an ounce of empathy. Maria Pia Casilio who plays the servant, performance reaches beyond the screen with piercing eyes and a simple talk. And the dog, well, the dog is great and you'll cry for that dog just as I did.Even though its opening weekend was only $1,664 the Unites States, and it Grossed just $74,308 (United States of America), This classic film holds honorable recognitions such as: An Oscar nomination in 1957 for Best writing 1957, Bodil_Best European Film (winner 1955), Cannes Nominee, Jussi (winner 1957) Best Foreign Director, NYFCC Awards (winner), Best foreign language film 1955 and the Movie was included in "Time Magazine's All-Time 100 Movies" in 2005Umberto D. brings it all together with an exquisite taste on simplistic but very smart storytelling and Art Direction, added to a mind-blowing composition on a Direction of Photography that will stay in history as of one of the most exquisite movies ever made. Its pace and realism builds up to a painful dramatic hit where you can't help it but to feel unbelievably emotionally invested, and your pounding heart will hope for Umberto to find a solution to his tragedy. I can't tell you how much love I feel for this movie Umberto D, that I just happened to be asked to watch by my teacher from my Cinema class, but what I can tell you right at this moment, is that moments like these one, when you discover a "new" movie that you feel it has changed it all in you, is probably one of the most amazing things that can ever happen to you as a passionate film lover. Do yourself a favor, and watch Umberto D.Dennis Velasco</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A hard reality that needs to be faced.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is a film that captures perfectly all the aspects of the retired, poor old man's life and his place in a miserable, dirty society.&nbsp;What happens in this film; the message it brings, can still be applied to MOST of today's societies, because unless if you are a millionaire, being old is a heavy weight, because no one cares about you. What really happens is the opposite: actually, everyone despises you. I like this kind of film, because while sad, depressing and all, is there to show us a truth that we often try to hide of, and this kind of film needs to exist to remind us that we might be the Umberto D. of tomorrow, so we, the people who got "the control" of the world, should be a bit more sensible and then respect the lifetime of these people who once contributed to the society with their hard work.&nbsp;About the film: I like the use of certain objects as metaphors (The old man selling a clock; as an example) and is much superior than the other neorealist films I've seen from Italy. Is very well crafted, very realistic.&nbsp;I just wished the acting _ of the entire cast_ was better. I thought the protagonist did good, but he's certainly not great at acting. I am aware of the fact that the neorealist directors preferred to cast amateurs instead of professional actors, and this was one of the weaknesses of their movement.&nbsp;My rating:&nbsp;*10/10&nbsp;*</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like "The Bicycle Thieves" It's Heartbreaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This poor man has done nothing wrong. He has lived a good life and wants only a place to be comfortable. But his pension is so small after a life of work, that he can't afford the rent on a fleabag apartment. In addition, his landlady, a mediocre opera singer, treats him like dirt. The young single pregnant woman across the hall is his only joy beside his dog, and she has her own problems. The story is so simple and yet so touching. The man just needs to have a little more money, but he is doomed. Other men either are comfortable or in nearly the same boat. He is also ill and ends up in the hospital for a while. We never know exactly what his ailment is but he is treated with disdain by a pompous physician who barely looks at him. The sad thing is that we know that nothing is going to change in this society, at least for a man of his age. But this is also a movie about dignity and purpose. At no time does he resort to compromise. He sees professional beggars on the streets and at one time has his little dog hold out a hat in his mouth, hoping someone will drop money in it. It doesn't work right away and he sees that this is not right. As with other realist movies of the Italian genre, we want to help him, but he has received a death sentence. This movie works on so many levels. I haven't even mentioned the scenes in Rome and the back alleys he must travel. One of our finest movies, certainly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>DeSica delivers another Neorealist Masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The profound simplicity of cinema is on magnificent display in Vittorio De Sica's Umberto D. The unspectacular story of a man and his dog slowly builds into one of the most powerful films you will see as DeSica somberly unfolds the storyline with a subdued resignation and then climaxes with an emotionally charged finale that will leave you drained.Pensioner Umberto Ferrari and his dog Flike are barely getting by in post war Italy when things go from bad to worse. His landlady (whom he shared food with during the war) is trying to evict him over unpaid back rent leaving him nowhere to turn for help. He runs into former associates who can offer no assistance since many of them are in the same situation. His only friend is the maid Maria but she has problems of her own trying to figure out which of two soldiers made her pregnant. After a brief hospital stay Umberto returns to his apartment to find his bedroom wall caved in for renovation. Now on the street he must now make even more difficult decisions.Few genres or movements can challenge Italian Neorealism for emotional impact on screen. Using amateur actors and actual locales it embraces the plight of the invisible (the commonplace,the poor, the elderly) and forces the viewer to take notice of them and their dilemma, drab and unheroic as it may be.As he did in the equally powerful Bicycle Thief, DeSica gets maximum performances out of his amateur actors. As Umberto, retired engineer Carlo Batisti is tragically moving as he faces the slights and casual cruelties of a society who has no time for him and just wishes he would go away. He can be difficult, diffident and rude at times but when the camera holds him in silent close-up absorbing more indifference from those around him your in full sympathy.While Umberto is the focal point of the film DeSica sprinkles in some incidentals and minor subplots to flesh out the cold and hypocritical environment he revolves in. Maria's pregnancy, the bougeoise, predatory landlady, a cheating wife who the landlady allows to use Umberto's room for an afternoon assignation and the hospital stay where a patient shows him the ropes while doctors think removing his tonsils at his age is a waste economically depict a callous and desperate society that the fragile and proud Umberto must contend with.Free of movie stars, car chases, shootouts, sex, blood, gore, monsters that wreak havoc on cities and nearly everything else that gets pictures funded and grabs the attention of the movie going audience Umberto D offers an intimate look at the human condition with simple story telling that packs an incredible punch. It's no surprise that it lost money at the box office.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An old man's struggle to survive in post war Rome</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a real gem of a film! I was too young at the time of its release to be able to go to see any film except a Disney. I was very glad to have been able recently to buy it on ebay UK. The film has moved me deeply. It shows a deep understanding, is full of genuine compassion with the predicament of the leading character Umberto.The abyss of the need and despair is going through and the response of his surrounding is harsh and revolting. It is of course set in post war Rome, but I think it very likely one could make it post war Europe. But the social drama that unrolls in Umberto's life is not in the past at all. There might have been some change for the better in our social history but I fear the response one gets from our fellow humans has not been altered that much!The same cynicism and indifference is still too often met and is there not much sign for change. So this film is of the greatest importance and social value even to-day and a must for everyone to see and reflect on it!The very striking moment for me was when Umberto tries to beg, reaches out his hand but looks up to the sky and just at the moment when a passer-by will give him charity he turns his hand around as for checking a raindrop. Here is a good psychological understanding, Umberto's sense of pride supersedes his wretchedness. Cesare Zavattini, writer of the story has not left the film on a bitter note, there is some hope... even if this too is a little cynical. After his attempt of suicide, Umberto hopefully will survive in some mode or other, thanks to his smart little dog Flike, doing tricks in the playgrounds and parks and maybe getting some coins in his hat! I would also like to draw the attention to the special feature of the film, which is a documentary on Cesare Zavattini. Zavattini finally directed one of his stories "La Verit?aaa" This is seemingly about a man locked up in a psychiatric ward and able to escape. The little part of the film shown during this documentary has such an impact on me that I wish I could find and buy it, was it only for these words addressed by the madman from a balcony : "It is a shame, so many people dying, from hunger and illness, it is a tragedy, people are dying without even once using their power of thought" And that is a bit of message we all can do with!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece of neorealism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen the film I read a bit about it. The Criterion Collection provides a booklet with an excellent review by Stuart Klawans and a bit of an interview with director Vittorio De Sica. What I learned was the Umberto D. was a big flop at the box office in Italy primarily because the Italian government didn't like the film because they thought it was insulting since it made Italy seem so unfeeling, poverty-stricken, and mercantile. I was struck by this because, yes, poor Umberto and his dog are pretty much set out to pasture without so much as some grass and a bone. But to say that such a film reflects upon an entire people is perhaps to protest too much.Italy was devastated by the failure of fascism and was just beginning to recover from the war when this film was made, and nobody wanted any downers. Vittorio De Sica's film is perhaps not so much of a downer as the early critics thought. The ending is ambiguous and while not hopeful for Umberto is somewhat inspiring in the youthfulness of his dog and in the sweet humanity of the maid Maria who shoulders her situation with alacrity while showing affection and kindness toward a bitter old man.I was not moved to tears as some have been in watching this. Umberto's troubles seem to me (from my privileged vantage point in time and place) somewhat of his own doing. I imagined that he supported the fascists, and I saw his poverty in his old age as a direct result of that support. Barring that, I imagined that he had planned poorly for his old age, and at any rate his values, represented by his always wearing a suit and tie and hat and his inability to beg or to take some kind of job, disqualified him for tears. Of course I was unfair.Even so my sympathy was with him, and I respected the decision he finally makes--although whether he will be able to carry it out is unclear. I respect his dignity, and identify with him in his struggle with the Teutonic and utterly bourgeois landlord who holds sway over him, played with a deliberately heavy presence by Lina Gennari, whom De Sica photographs up close and low to her large body to emphasize her strength and to make it clear to us that Umberto has no chance in his struggle with her.Both Carlo Battisti who played Umberto and Maria Pia Casilio who played Maria, were considered amateur actors, very much in keeping with the neorealistic school of film; yet for me they were both excellent and natural, whereas Gennari, who was a professional, seemed artificial. But that impression is an artifact of the neorealist school (which they say died with this film). The very fact of no flourishes and no modeling and certainly no flights of creativity by the actors, it was believed, helped to make the film realistic, about real people in real situations.Today of course this is a celebrated film, considered one of De Sica's best. He himself believed from the very beginning that it was one of his best even though he knew it would be hard-pressed to make any money for its producers.A word about the dog (the other professional actor in the film). Flike is extraordinarily well-trained, so much so he becomes part of the psychology of the film and is at the very heart of the denouement. The scene near the end where Umberto dips under the rail guard as the train approaches, Flike held close to his chest--and the scene after--is of one of the great sequences in cinema, and, ironically, as in a commercial film, stars a dog! Umberto D. is in fact one of the greatest dog films ever made. All dog lovers will appreciate the love that Umberto feels for his dog and the love that is returned AND the gutty realism that the dog displays.The DVD includes a documentary about De Sica that I didn't have a chance to view, excellent subtitles, and a video interview with Maria Pia Casilio.I would almost say, see this for the dog, but do see this for Vittorio De Sica, one of cinema's greats, here at his best, and for Cesare Zavattini who wrote the compelling script.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"

At the last moment, however, just as a passerby is about to put a coin in his outstretched hand, he turns his hand palm down, pretending that all he was doing was feeling for raindrops.

		<fullReview>Umberto D (1952) **** (out of 4) Vittorio De Sica's classic film is one I've often heard about but just now got around to watching it and I'm certainly kicking myself for not checking it out earlier. The film certainly wasn't what I expected so am much as I cared for it I'm quite certainly that affection will grow with repeat viewings. The film tells the story of the title character, played brilliantly by Carlo Battisti, who struggles day to day to keep himself and his best friend, his dog, alive. The landlady keep raising his rent and Umberto is just having a hard time making ends meet. Even though there's dialogue in this film it really plays out much like a silent movie. I'm not exactly sure what it was but I found myself falling in love with this old man and his dog, which wasn't a hard thing to do especially considering how depressing the film is. There are moments of comedy like a few scenes with the ants but overall this is a pretty dramatic film that really doesn't hold back when it comes to its viewpoints. One of the best moments for me is when the dog runs away and the old man frantically searches the dog pound for him. This scene is full of suspense and your heart can't help but to ache hoping that the man finds him. In a strange way this is a love story between two friends even though it's a man and his dog. The ending is so beautifully done that the images say more than any words could.</fullReview>

It is often said to be an masterpiece, and after seeing it, I can see why people say that. But it wasn't a movie for me.Umberto D is about an old man, Umberto, whose situation is grim. His pension is low, he is facing eviction and his friends are few. Ultimately he doubts his own need and will to live. It is a grim piece of reality. But just so. I can see why people think highly of the movie, but for me I want something else. I need a movie to either entertain me, or to touch me in some way. Umberto failed to do either. It certainly wasn't entertaining, and even though his situation is far from good, the filming and acting is good as well, it just didn't touch me. Somehow it was too ordinary, it was too good at what it aimed to be, a realistic movie. Unfortunately, perhaps.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD...Downbeat Italian film with bleak ending is not for everyone...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the heels of all the neo-realism coming from Roberto Rossellinni and others during the mid-'40s to '50s, Vittorio DeSica gives us UMBERTO D, a film that tells the story of an aged man's devotion to his pet dog but no means of providing food and shelter for himself during hard times due to a small pension. The indifference to his plight from a hard-hearted landlord lady provides the conflict.His only human relationship is with a young girl who happens to be pregnant and works as a maid in the apartment building he inhabits. Their relationship is at the core of the sub-plot that runs through the simple story and is nicely handled.The scenes with the dog are poignant and tender moments that give the story some sense of depth, but DeSica ends his film on an ambiguous note after a heart-wrenching moment when the man tries to give the dog away to a happy child--and then almost takes his own life before an oncoming train when the dog manages to escape his clutches--and in doing, saves his life.However, the final scene of reunion between dog and master doesn't really resolve the situation and it's here that the film is a letdown for this viewer. There is no future for either of them, so it's essentially a bleak ending to a sad situation. It's also a manipulation of audience sympathy.Despite its faults, this is a sometimes moving and eloquent but somber look at the desperation of one man's old age.</fullReview>

While attempting to record unfettered "reality" (real world locales, un-trained actors) it makes use of constraining dramatic devices, such as the ending on the train tracks- "highly emotional" and all, but in a way utterly false, pretentious and manipulative. Reality claims and artifice sit side by side uneasily in this one. It seems that age has merely shown up the films unabashed pandering and teasing of the audience now that the shadow of world war two seems so 'light' and temporally removed (itself having become the subject of a far more virulent and counter-intuitive form of artifice: Hollywood doctrine). Deserves a look, but for a better example of how this general film ethos could work look up some of the 'cinema verite' of the following decades. 5.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another tedious foreign film that flaunts the obvious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought it would never end...for the brilliant and original insight that life is unfair (surprise!) we have to sit through two hours of excruciatingly boring clichés, every scene of which drags on as if the characters had their feet stuck in molasses.What is it with these supposedly "great" directors like de Sica, Truffaut, and the phoniest of the bunch, Fellini? I've given them all more chances than they deserve, and they are all among the most pretentious and *dull* people on the planet. They spend hours preaching the most obvious lessons in the most uninteresting manner to the most gullible audiences imaginable.Apparently if some celebrity in the industry endorses a film, it must be wonderful, right? If someone doesn't quite get *why* it is so wonderful there must be something wrong with that poor unsophisticated wretch, right? Or possibly the film really does blow and we peons are too intimidated to say so, could that be it? (Or possibly the industry is hyping their "great work of art" to sell more tickets.)There is an old fable that applies to this sort of thing, and at the risk of insulting anyone's intelligence by stating it outright - which if the above directors ever did in any of their movies would turn an hours-long marathon into a five-minute public service announcement, saving the world a lot of time, irritation and pseudo-intellectual posing - it's the one where "The Emperor Has No Clothes!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not nearly as good as it's made out to be (Part 1 of 2)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw Umberto D for the first time last night on the big screen. Roger Ebert was in town and this is one of 3 films he presented while here. Roger has listed Umberto D as one of the "Great Movies" in volume II of his book by the same name. We were told the print was from Martin Scorsese's private collection, and it looked practically new.I was primed to see this film after hearing Roger's introductory presentation, as I had never even heard of it before. As a film school graduate, former film studio employee, and award-winning screenwriter, I enjoy seeing foreign, independent, and other films that are off the beaten path. I had, in fact, seen The Bicycle Thief when I was in film school, which Vittorio De Sica directed 4 years prior to Umberto D. However, I found Umberto D to be quite a let-down.I have numerous problems with the film. First, there is a great deal of business that does not propel the story forward, and seems only to serve as window dressing meant to show us the world Umberto lives in. That's all well and good up to a point, but this film really spends a lot of time on side characters and story points that have no bearing on the main storyline.For instance, the maid's character (Maria). She serves very little purpose to the story, and yet is given a great deal of screen time. In a scene that easily lasts 3-4 minutes, we watch her wake up in the night, wander to the kitchen, turn on the gas, make several attempts to strike a match, light the burner, fill the coffee pot with water, heat the water, grind the coffee beans by hand... well, you get the idea. The problem is, we don't learn anything by watching these mundane actions. Is the point to show us what boring, monotonous lives these characters lead? If so, then this scene is a failure, as we have to suspect that ANYONE who wanted to make a pot of coffee it Italy during the post-war years would have gone through essentially the identical routine. So again I ask, what's the point? Maria is really a sideplot, not a subplot. A subplot is a plot that weaves alongside the main plot, intersecting it at critical moments. Maria's story is completely independent of Umberto's. She is pregnant by one of two soldiers -- which one she cannot be sure. This hardly creates any meaningful character development with Umberto, except to show his opinion on the matter. It should have been a brief exchange of dialogue between them in a single scene, and yet it's revisited repeatedly for no apparent reason.Another problem is Umberto's relationship with the dog (whose name is "Flike", not "Flik" or "Flag" or anything else. Roger Ebert even commented on this during his presentation last night, saying he had mistakenly called the dog "Flag" in his review.) We almost never see Umberto and the dog interact, and when they do it's as if he's dogsitting for a friend. Because his relationship with Flike is so critical to the ending of this film, it stands to reason that we need to see a unique bond develop between them, and yet we never do. Umberto plays with the dog ONCE during the entire film, which lasts for all of 15 seconds. He never really pets the dog, or kisses him, or talks to him (other than to give him commands). So when the dog runs away and Umberto becomes distraught while trying to find him it feels like it comes out of left field. This also takes much of the power out of their reunion, since we have not been given a very strong impression that Umberto would go to great lengths on behalf of his dog.There are also several characters who appear out of nowhere, and then disappear just as suddenly. Umberto's fellow pensioners we meet at the beginning never reappear again later on. The soldiers Maria is involved with are seen once or twice but never heard. Umberto meets a friendly man in the hospital who promises to visit him after they are discharged, but never does. Towards the very end of the film, a man stops when he sees Flike begging for money, and it turns out to be an old acquaintance of Umberto's (although one we haven't met). Who is this man? How does Umberto know him? The movie never bothers to answer these questions, nor does their encounter lead to any deeper revelations. In fact, they only exchange a few words, with most of the scene consisting of awkward silence between them. It's an unnecessary piece of extraneous business that serves little purpose.(Be sure to read Part 2 of my review, where I discuss the ending in detail)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Be sure to read Part 1 of my review first)Finally, the ending. I think the director really dropped the ball on this. Here we have a man who is so despondent he's going to throw himself in front of a train to end his life. He takes his dog (you know, the one he supposedly loves sooooo much) to the park, and then walks away and leaves it behind while some children he doesn't even know are playing with it. (We might have assumed that the children will adopt the dog and care for it, except that the filmmaker precedes this moment with a scene whereby Umberto gives Flike to a little girl who is thrilled to have him, but her parents force her to give him back. So the director has taken care to set up the notion that Flike cannot be given away to a child, and then moments later he expects the audience to forget that scene and accept the notion that a different child WILL be allowed to adopt Flike?) Flike tracks down Umberto before the train arrives, and so Umberto decides it would be best if he ends BOTH of their lives! (that is, his own life and the life of Flike, you know, the dog he supposedly loves sooooo much). Standing next to the tracks, the uber-intelligent Flike senses what's about to happen, wrestles free from Umberto, thus sparing both their lives (Well, not exactly. Flike runs clear of the tracks to save himself, but makes no effort to stop Umberto from carrying out his plan, such as tugging on his pant leg or barking incessantly. Gee, what a loyal dog.) On a side note, I must mention there is a spectacular shot of the train rushing past Umberto while a gush of dusty air blasts him in the face, temporarily blinding him. It's quite an arresting image and remarkably gripping in its realism.Here is where the filmmaker almost won me over. Umberto stumbles away from the tracks towards Flike, who is now distrustful of Umberto. Flike hides behind a tree and avoids coming near Umberto, despite his best efforts to coax the dog with a pine cone to play with. This could have been a very "O. Henry" type of ending that would have resonated with me for a long time.Imagine this ending: Umberto wants to end his life because he has nothing to live for, wanting to take the only thing he really cares about (Flike) with him into the afterlife. But his plan is foiled by Flike, making Umberto realize he DOES have something to live for, changing his whole perspective on his life. BUT, the one thing he is willing to live for (Flike) has now turned his back on Umberto, because he betrayed his trust. And so we end with Flike returning to play with the children, looking for a new, more trustworthy master, while Umberto shuffles off down the path, dejected, a man who has lost the only thing he really cared about and now TRULY has nothing worth living for. Where will he go? What will he do? And what will become of him? Now THAT would have been a powerful ending that could have literally salvaged the first 90% of the film.Instead, Flike begrudgingly returns to his master's side, does a trick to show him that he's not really that mad at Umberto after all, and off they go together, trotting playfully down the boardwalk. Roger Ebert pointed out the Chaplinesque quality of that shot, and I agree, but he also feels that it's a sad ending, not a happy one. "Yes, they're alive and headed off into their future... but where are they going? And what will happen to them?" Roger asked after the screening. Still, it's an ending that's hopeful, which offsets the emotional wallop that had been set up in the preceding scenes.In closing, I should also mention that the audience I saw it with (composed entirely of true film buffs), was somewhat fidgety during the movie, which is only 90 minutes long but feels like it's about 2-1/2 hours due to the sluggish pacing. There was a smattering of polite applause at the end, but hardly what you would expect if the general consensus had been that this was truly a "great movie". Yet some people did have tears in their eyes, which I found strange because I'm a huge animal lover (I'm even a vegetarian), but I didn't even get a little misty at the ending. The film just doesn't build an emotional arc effectively, and so the ending felt contrived and mishandled, rather than inevitable and heart-wrenching as it should have been.</fullReview>
