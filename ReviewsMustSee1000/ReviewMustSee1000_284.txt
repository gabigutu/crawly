		<shortDescription>You know, I really enjoyed it. Michael Sheen is superb in a film where great performances normally don't happen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very rarely do prequels match up with their predecessors. As I'm not the biggest Underworld fan, I can honestly say that I wasn't expecting much. However, I should've expected more, as the latest, yet earliest installment is easily my favorite in the series. It ain't art, but it's the shining example of why we go to the movies: to escape into a world of mythology, fantasy, and crazy vampire/werewolf action.For the first time in the series, the filmmakers have decided to leave out the rock that probably was the reason the films have been successful: Kate Beckinsale. I'm guessing this was a production risk/choice, but it seems to have paid off. Selene's absence from the story is necessary to tell the story of how the Lycans rose to power, how Viktor was driven insane (though we pretty much already know how), and, as off topic as it may be, how simply awesome Michael Sheen is.Very rarely do the actors make an action movie good. Most action movies rely on explosions and (surprise!) action to enhance the quality and generally feature run of the mill copycat characters. Sheen's Lucian and Bill Nighy's Viktor will always stand out in the realm of action/fantasy characters to me, and it's easy to see why. Sheen's turn as Lucian is fierce, determined, and one of my favorite performances in an action movie I've seen in years. Despite playing a (mostly) villainous role in the first film, Lucian is the hero of this film, and it totally gives you a new spin on things. Sheen's brave and dedicated performance really makes the character work, while Bill Nighy is once again effectively creepy as Viktor. Rhona Mitra's presence as Sonja is welcome, though she doesn't carry the same charisma that Beckinsale does, making her an ill advised choice to be Selene's replacement (as she so obviously is).The action in Underworld, though obviously restrained by a lower budget, is once again great. There's some nice dueling, the obvious gore and blood galore, and a nice Lord of the Rings style battle at the end. What it comes down to is that Underworld does nothing new, but does everything right in maintaining a steady river of entertainment. I was never bored, and I don't think you will be either.The film does answer a lot of questions and provides some nice insight to the Lycans (which were my favorite parts about the first two films), though it suffers from the same fate as most prequels do...even a casual viewer of this series knows which characters will live, which will die, and how it will end. The film isn't really about the resolution, but rather the journey to the end. In fact, it's made in such a way that you can certainly watch the trilogy in chronological order.When it comes down to it, I liked 'Lycans' a lot. It's a worthy installment in the series, and certainly not a disappointment to me. It's got good action, a wonderful lead performance from Michael Sheen, and should satisfy fans of the series and fans of mythological stories altogether.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best prequel I've seen and worthy successor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I came back about an hour ago from the 3:45 showing here in Toronto. I've seen the first two movies, and I have to say I'm glad they brought back Michael Sheen and Bill Nighy; the second film just wasn't quite the same without those two. Lucian is the character you love to sympathize for and Viktor is the character you love to hate.I'm so very glad the story was more focused on Lucian as it's a nice change from Selene and Michael being in the spotlight (not to mention Michael Sheen's arguably superior acting ability). As for Rhona Mitra, I won't say she was better than Kate Beckinsale but I can't say she was any less of an asset. Not only did she look great, but she executed her lines superbly. I will however say that I find Sonja's character much more interesting than Selene's. The chemistry between Lucian and Sonja was much better than that of the chemistry between Michael and Selene.The story was much more intriguing, emotional and tragic than that of either of the previous two expeditions (this being of course subjective), as many who recall the flashbacks presented within will agree. It was also faithful to the material, and it's good that they didn't compromise for the sake of "improving" the story.Overall, I can't think of another prequel that brought such raw emotion to the table, and regardless of the fact that Len Wiseman was not directing this one (though he was at the helm in other ways), you wouldn't know by watching it as it did a good job maintaining the same feel as the first two. The score also added to a lot of the emotion.In regards to the possibility of a 4th movie: if they choose to continue on from this prequel as I think they should, they should bring in Amelia as she is one of the few characters that has yet to be explored fully.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All in all? This ROCKS!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What I wanted...I wanted an epically filmed visceral movie wherein thousands of Lycans are pitted against thousands of Vampires in full armor on horseback. Wow! What a great movie THAT would have been.What I got...was somehow...better. I honestly can't say that I'm disappointed, although I just KNEW I would be if they left off that bit. What they give us is story-driven rather than effects or action-driven. I know that sounds ridiculous when talking about a movie in which action and effects are completely necessary in order to properly tell the story, but in all too many cases, they end up overshadowing the story and eliminating any sense of storytelling. I am happy to say that such is not the case with Underworld: Rise of the Lycans.I won't spoil the movie as so many have. I will say that the obvious parallels between Sonja and Selene's characters are endearing, and Sonja's love of Lucien is breathtaking. The overall feel of the movie is as dark and Gothic as the original work, beautifully echoing the brilliance of that film which caught us so by surprise in September of 2003.This still leaves a few small questions, and I would have loved to see Kraven make the deal with Lucien and cut Viktor's mark off of him, but you can't have everything, and all in all, this will run back to front with the original. All that's left now, is an extension of the Story of Underworld: Evolution; one that either gives the viewers a satisfactory ending, or perpetuates the species...of Underworld films, that is.All in all? This ROCKS! It rates an 8.4/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Good Prequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are a fan of either of the first two Underworld movies you are going to like this one as well. This movie seems to take place a short time after the creation of both races but some time before the events that open Underworld Evolution. The entire story of the feud between the vampires and lycans is told in 90 minutes with plenty of action interspersed throughout. My only complaint is that the movie could have been longer with more character development. An hour and a half is hardly enough time to tell a love story, which is what is at the heart of this movie. Also, a little more depth could have been given to Raze's character as his origins are shown but not in much detail. These plot points are sacrificed to keep the action scenes rolling but the action is great. There are several clashes between vamps and lycans that put those of the first two movies to shame. The special effects are amazing as usual. My hope is that Rise of the Lycans will do well at the box offices and we will all be treated to an extended directors cut on DVD. The plot themes of slavery, forbidden love, and revolution could use a little more screen time in my opinion. Oh and lets all hope for another sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very EPIC -- at a smaller scale.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a nutshell:The GOOD: The storyline is great. It's a very appropriate prequel for the Underwolrd series. DEFINITELY for fans, and also for anyone that want to start getting into the series. There's a BONUS at the end.The acting is believable and somehow very emotional. Although, nothing Oscar-worthy, it's really worthy of your time.The special effect is quite amazing. Looks like those 1980's horror flick. Very classic, in a way.The tone is everything! I really love the moody tone of the movie. Very effective in this type of movies.The BAD: Although I mentioned some goods there are a few bads. Everything just wasn't enough.The castle looks very small. Hence, really takes away the epic feeling to it.The war was also quite small. Walking into the theater, I was hoping for an epic war between the Vampire and the Lycans. But no, the fight focuses on the main characters.I was also expecting more for the special effects and costumes. Especially in this era of movie-making. The filmmakers should've gone a step further in bringing us the realism of the picture.OVERALL: Underworld: Rise of the Lycans is a great movie to catch. Full of drama and action. Definitely worth the money and time, especially for fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WoW...Better then expected in all areas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was hoping it would be good yet I didn't expect it to be 'this' good.Honestly, this was 'so' well paced. Actually got me anxious, and thats a bit of a rarity. And in a good way.First off the story was very interesting from start to finish and the script very well crafted. All of the elements... Love, machismo, heroic, underdog, special abilities, honor, suspense, scandal, comradeship, good vs bad just so many elements. However the difference with this film is they were all intertwined so well. Not the usual 'chemistry cocktail' roll of the dice.The cinematic hat trick... acting, directing and the written story itself all melted like cheese on a hot Philly steak.I understand the "Category" this film falls near however, over all very well crafted. Some other "Film Makers" should take a few lessons.I hope there's another.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Phew!!! (may contain mild spoilers about all 3 Underworld films)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was going to wait until Sunday to go see this with my niece and her friends but I was a little apprehensive about how violent it was and wanted to check it out first...Okay, okay, that was part of the reason. The other reason I went to the first matinée showing on opening day was because I was so *nervous* about this film. I so wanted to like the Underworld franchise. I love fantasy, sci-fi and especially vampires and werewolves. I am always anxious to see how another writer, actor, director or other artist brings them to life (er, so to speak). I, however, have never been quite so underwhelmed and disappointed as with the first two of this series. I can appreciate what Len Wiseman and Patrick Tatapoulos were trying to achieve with their new version of werewolves - "lycans" - but I was actually embarrassed by their world's version of vampires. What a bunch of poseurs! Well, Bill Nighy aside. Even Kate Beckinsale, whom I do like as an actress, failed to give me, a female, that "you go girl" pumped-up feeling about a tough-as-nails heroine. In fact - and I'm not so sure this hasn't been the intention all along - it gave me a whole new appreciation for werewolves. Oh yes, and Michael Sheen.I'm not even really going to touch on Underworld: Evolution because it was excruciating to sit through and, except for Tony Curran (Marcus) and getting to see the proto-werewolf, William, it was a waste of celluloid. Underworld 3 *should* have been Underworld 2 (or 1, even).So, hence my apprehension. I really wanted this movie to be good, but had already been fooled twice by this franchise. What brought me back? Three things: Len Wiseman *wasn't* directing, Kate Beckisnale's Selene character was *not* an integral part of this plot, and Michael Sheen's Lucian was. Lucian and Viktor (Nighy) were the only things that kept me in that theater seat in the first installment. (The second I watched on a Starz movie channel, couldn't even bring myself to rent it.) Well, I went and saw it and my anxiety has abated and I somehow feel...vindicated. This movie seriously rocked it out. First of all, it made sense. I had to watch the first movie a few more times (in pieces) to really get a grasp of the whole story. Second, the characters were engaging. Rhona Mitra, while not really allowed to show off much but her gorgeous figure and face, was still a much more sympathetic character than Selene ever was. (Edit: After a second viewing, I've had a new appreciation for Mitra. She plays a perfect tough but tender kinda broad and that final scene between her and Sheen...guhhhh! Ripped my heart out.) And maybe this is because I'm a girl but I seriously missed the romance from the first two. (Truly, the Sonya/Lucian angle was the only one - forget whatever that was between Selene and Michael...and what *was* that???) Third, the creatures are absolutely fantastic in this. Rarely did I ever get that feeling in this film that I was playing a video game. And fourth- well, actually fourth and fifth- Michael Sheen and Bill Nighy. I don't know if it's their British accents (to my American ear) that allow them to bring gravity to an otherwise sparse script, or the fact that I'm still trying to rectify in my mind that these are the same guys that I just saw in "Frost/Nixon" and "Notes on a Scandal", respectively. Michael Sheen a sex symbol? Yeah, believe it. I'd love a nice life-size Lucian poster for my room. *blushes* Ahem, anyway, where was I......Right. The movie is only an hour and a half long and it flew by for me. The other two were hovering closer to two hours and they both felt twice as long and I was fidgety in my seat the whole time. It is a violent movie, natch, but with the bullets replaced by arrows, it was no less bloody but maybe a bit less jarring and a little easier on the eardrums. And maybe I enjoyed it a bit more this time with a nice balance of romance. It's no Academy Award winner, but then again I don't put much faith in Oscar these days. If you've never seen the other two movies, don't feel you have to see them to appreciate this one. It is a prequel but should have been first. It is a nice bit of fantasy escapism. If you are delicate about violence and gloom, this might not be for you, but I for one am looking forward eagerly to seeing it again on Sunday.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More than animals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Rise of the Lycans", on the surface, makes a perfectly well working prequel. The loss of Kate Beckinsale and Scott Speedman is compensated by a great Rhona Mitra and especially Michael Sheen's titanic effort. The look and the action are amazing, considering the somewhat lower budget, and the story makes sense to prepare us all for the things to come in the other two movies. All in all, the trilogy is round now and does not disappoint in any department, unless you are taking everything a bit too literally and wonder how werewolves can make babies.It is interesting, however, to peek below the surface. The makers mentioned in interviews they see similarities to "Romeo &amp; Juliet" insofar as Lucien and Sonja are lovers not allowed to get together. One crucial difference, however, is that Romeo and Juliet came from two noble families, whereas in "Rise of the Lyans", Sonja is a member of the aristocratic pale vampire rulers, who are sipping glasses of blood on the castle, while Lucien is with the ugly, hairy slaves, the werewolves exploited as cheap labor force. We don't really get to see what this work consists of except carrying stones around. Also the love story isn't explained enough in the running time of not much more than 80 minutes PAL until the credits start to roll. But the point is that "Rise of the Lycans" is a hardly disguised class struggle story. Similar to the Italian socialist cinema of the 1960s which would show the rebellion of poor farmers against the rich property owners, the working class has to realise their value (in Lucien's words: "we are more than animals") and claim their human rights. When Lucien says "this is just the beginning", it may seem to the audience that he jokingly refers to other other two movies which have shown us already how the story continues after this prequel. In the subtext, though, he is making a very serious statement that freedom is the foundation of a life worth living, and everything else will be built up now upon this basic condition. It's a pity that the movie doesn't elaborate more on that and doesn't spend some additional time on the character development, either, because it could have been the best of the trilogy. Alas, I voted almost equally 8-7-7 for the three movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Am Spartacus!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Underworld: Rise of the Lycans : In this prequel we get little of Romeo and Juliet and a dash of Spartacus. The vampires have bred themselves a race of Lycan slaves to guard them during the daylight hours, but when Lucian, the favored pet of Viktor the ruling vampire, falls in love with his daughter things go bad rather quickly. The CGI werewolves are leaps and bounds better than their previous incarnations in this series and the only CGI complaint I have is to the occasionally bad CGI blood spray. Rhona Mitra makes for a hot vampire, and Bill Nighy and Michael Sheen return to chew up some nice scenery. After watching the big battle one is forced to ask the question that pops up after watching any of the Underworlds movies, "How did the Lycans lose the war?" Seriously, the vampires in these films are as fragile as a 1978 Ford Pinto.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overwhelming prequel that explains the origin of taking on between vampires and Lycans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Again the eternal fight between vampires and werewolves in this exciting prequel set in the Dark Ages. This original and gore-soaked vampires film begins centuries ago. Unknown to humanity, centuries old blood feud raged between aristocrat vampires and subdued legion of werewolves known as Lycans who work as slaves. For centuries Sonja ( Rhona Mitra ) is a loyal soldier of the vampire clan, but she falls in love with the Lycan Lucian ( Michael Sheen ). The tale traces the origins of the confrontation between a ruling class of bloodsuckers and their onetime slaves, the werewolves . A young Lycan named Lucian emerges as a powerful rebel who rallies the rebellious werewolves to rise up against Viktor, Sonja's father and the brutal vampire king . Lucian is joined by his secret lover, Sonja, in his struggle against the Vampire army and his fight for Lycan freedom . Neverheless , the war was not as it had seemed. In one night, the lies that had united the kind vampire had been exposed. Sonja has formed a secret alliance with Lucian, ruler of the werewolf clan to overthrow Viktor ( Bill Nighy ), vampires leader who has enslaved them . But Viktor's lust for power and domination has failed. As Viktor was not the savior they had been led to believe . Soon the hunt would be on for his killer . As the war between vampires and werewolves get more personal and deadly , they decide to launch a full-scale attack on the hideout in order to extinguish the race.This amazing movie displays noisy action , thrills ride, stirring fighting , graphic violence , brief nudism with mild sex scene and is pretty amusing . It packs large loads of guts and gore , there's a huge body count, this one actually knocks off an immense amount, several vampires and werewolves are staked bloodily in the chest, even more impaled with large claws. There's really savage decapitation, plenty of bodies ripped in scraps and half, including some of the most tears ever, that spill lots of blood and numerous get shot up with arcs . Most of vampires, Lycans and humans victims are relegated to being bitten in the throat and neck and the breathtaking fighting scenes are realized with magnificent special and visual effects as well as excellent make-up department . The film blends horror, suspense, struggles, rip-roaring action, terror and lots of gore. Set design is of first class , settings are stylized, Gothic scenarios , and spooky and ghoulish atmosphere. Specials effects are breathtaking, part of them are made by means of computer generator and part by make up . Bone-chilling and atmospheric musical score by Paul Haslinger and colorful and dark cinematography by Ross Emery. Spectacular and moving direction by Patrick Tatopoulos. He's author of set design and production design of Underworld I and II and known blockbusters, such as ¨10.000 BC, Indepencence day, I robot, Resident evil, Pith black ¨, among them . The interesting screenplay is written by Len Wiseman, who directed the former entries , along with Danny McBride and Kevin Grevioux . All actors and technicians participated in the previous outings with exception Kate Beckinsale , being well replaced by Rhona Mitra as relentless action woman . Recommended to those who amuse those kind of vampires-werewolves films or those enjoy in general.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Trilogies Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the human son of a werewolf is born in a cell, the evil leader of the clan of vampires Viktor (Bill Nighy) spares his life and names him Lucian; forces him to transform other humans in the new breed Lycan; and raises him as a slave wearing a leash to control his ability. Along the years, Lucian (Michael Sheen) becomes a brave warrior with a great leadership over the other Lycans, protecting the aristocratic vampires during the daylight against the vicious and infectious breed of werewolves that are unable to take human form ever again. However, Viktor's daughter Sonja (Rhona Mitra) and Lucian are lovers and they secretly meet each other every now and then. When Lucian unleashes and transforms in a werewolf to save the life of Sonja in a battle against the werewolves, Viktor sentences him to be brutally whipped thirty times and then imprisons him in the dungeon. However, Sonja saves Lucian and he escapes with other prisoners to the woods. When Viktor discovers that Sonja is pregnant and in love with Lucian, he locks her up in her room to force Lucian to return to the castle to rescue her, in the beginning of the feud between the two bloodlines.I usually do not like prequels and sequels of successful movies, but "Underworld: Rise of the Lycans" is an excellent prequel of one of the best trilogies I have ever seen, and maybe the best of the three great movies. The tragic romance between Sonja and Lucian has elements of Romeo and Juliet and is engaging, providing a great justification to the beginning of the feud between vampires and Lycans. The cinematography is wonderful giving a stylish support to the outstanding screenplay. Rhona Mitra resembles Kate Beckinsale that makes a cameo in the very last scene, and shows a great chemistry with Michael Sheen. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Anjos da Noite ? A Rebeli?o" ("Angels of the Night ? The Rebellion")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For the most part this was a good movie great action, good plot and storyline. But the main problem with this movie (spoiler alert) the vampires in this movie were extremely underpowered . It was almost Luciana vs humans . the vampires showed no speed there was only one show of strength, but other than that they were humans. where as the lycans showed all of the typical abillities of werewolves speed, strength, blood lust the whole nine. but im just one person. like i said other than that it was a great action packed movie . it also was a great back story to the other movies.in the future i would recommend focusing more on the characteristics of the characters them selves .- Trevaris</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The series continues to entertain, but also not quite succeeding in winning me over. To be honest, if it hadn't been for the return of Raze, I might not have given this a chance at all; Kevin Grevioux is just plain a bad-ass. That's his *real voice*! Seriously, listen to interviews with him. While I would have liked more of him in this, I'm honest enough to admit that the entire 80 minute running time could have had him in every shot, and I'd still be saying that it's not enough. For Tatopoulos having relatively little experience at directing(I guess he got tired of being consultant for when giant mutated lizards attack), he does rather well. And this definitely has a *gorgeous* Gothic look, and the dark tone of the first two. The cinematography and editing are great, and the use of hand-held is effective, although several bits go by so fast that you can't tell what is going on. Nearly every(and certainly every lead) performance is impressive; Sheen continues the stellar work, Nighy(apart from being over the top at points) is marvelous, of course, and I wouldn't mind seeing Mitra be the lead in something else. I hadn't seen her in this large a part before, and she does well. The action is cool, intense and fun; of course, given that this is a prequel, you may miss the shoot-outs and car-chases of the prior 2 entries. With that said, the sword-fighting is great. The FX are excellent, and smoothly integrated. To its credit, at its core, this is a story about slaves rising up against their masters, and it does engage pretty well. There is plenty of brutal, bloody violence, a little sexuality(hot, though not graphic; and this has eye candy for both genders) and brief male, infant nudity in this. The DVD comes with an informative and amusing commentary track, three well-done featurettes of 9, 20 and 13 minutes length, respectively, a music video and a handful of trailers. I recommend this to any fan of the franchise(and this is best watched after the others). 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Prequel to Underworld. "Rise of the Lycans"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Rise of the Lycans". That's a pretty good thumbnail view.I liked this third outing of the Underworld series of movies. 7 of 10. No Kate Beckinsale as Selene, as this is actually a prequel to the Underworld series of movies. Enter the beautiful Rhona Mitra as Sonja. Folks may know Rhona Mitra was Claire Radcliff in the wonderful TV series, The Gates: A vampire and werewolf TV series that was sadly canceled after the first season. Off topic a second?, I can never understand that when one of the "networks" has a hit series they are compelled to dump it in such a way as to frustrate as many people as possible. The cables, like TNT, A&amp;E, etc., seem infinitely better at making the "cancel series" decision? but I digress.The point I slipped off of is that if you're inclined to beautiful goth women in vampire type movies, Rhona Mitra is not a step down from Kate Beckinsale.Rise of the Lycans is another double down of the Romeo and Juliet plot? which made Underworld as touching as it was exciting. Because of this plot, the movies, except perhaps "Evolution", should have at least some appeal to those who crave some romance in their movies.It is entertaining to see what they've done with this movie in relation to the other Underworld movies. They've taken some of the back-story that is hinted at in Underworld and filled in many of the blanks. I watched this third, as it came out third, but if I had better knowledge I would have watched this one first in the series of movies.If you're looking for a review that critiques acting, cinematography, CGI, how realistic stunts were, etc., this is the wrong review for you. I watch movies to be entertained, to relate to the characters, and essentially enjoy myself. Unless it is just bad, like SyFy seems they must fill that nook, I don't notice much of that because I'm into the story. And this movie has one. If some technicality made it difficult to watch I'd say something but this movie doesn't get in the way of the story."This movie is dark!" What does that even mean? Vampires, underground, no sunlight? dark. Or is it because the characters aren't politically correct? does that make it "dark". This movie does move quickly. A twist in the plot, a surprise, an unexpected turn? I call that fun. Only better way to get that kind of fun is to read a book or do exciting things, like skydive or something.Finally, a confession: I actually had no interest what-so-ever in the Underworld series until I checked up on an old favorite screenwriter of mine, J. Michael Straczynski. Turns out he is the writer of Underworld: Awakening. So, I wanted to get the earlier movies in my head before watching Awakening. That JMS associated with the franchise and even wrote a script for it was enough to spark my interest. I'm glad I took the time to watch this movie and the two earlier movies. Now on to the JMS screenplay, Underworld: Awakening.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK for a Prequel...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just wanna say that this is one fine prequel.. Although, they could have done better fight scenes.. Especially Lucian's fight with Viktor. It didn't have much of a spark in it.. Within moments, it's finished without any satisfying result. Well, for me. (^^,) Well, on with comment..Bill Nighy is so awesome in bringing the character, Victor, to existence once again. And so is Michael Sheen who brought Lucian back to life again. Rhona Mitra is superb, beautiful and "HOT" as she takes the character, Sonja, Viktor's beloved daughter. Kevin Grevioux returns as Raze, as does Steven Mackintosh as Tannis. Both are given considerably more to do this time and both are welcome familiar faces and characters. The single omitted character was Kraven, a slight dissatisfaction, but not one that discolors the film.There isn't a great deal to state here other than getting the full back-story of the prohibited love between Lucian and Sonja, which eventually leads to the Lycans's war against the vampires. Sheen and Mitra have an incredible chemistry and anyone knowing their love story on screen, is to anticipate fatal outcome. Fans of Underworld won't be saddened here. I wish that the next movie will get back up with Selena and Michael now that the origin of the story has been fully told.Well, all in all, one fine prequel</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A visually captivating disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I, like many this evening braved the frigid winter and long lines to see what I had anticipated to be one of the best movies of this year. However, I was left sadly wanting in many ways after the credits rolled. But to be fair, there were redeemable qualities (although very few). Let's start with what worked. First, the Lycans: on point in every way ? from their terrifying physicality to their sheer ferocity. The action: sublimely visceral ? when it did occur. Nighy/Victor and Sheen/Lucian: Perfect. Now, what did not (and there is plenty). This was less a movie and more a collage of sequences (and do not expect to see any supporting characters from the other movies except Raze and Tannis). Profoundly missing was a well written storyline and anything of real substance to bring these pieces of film together. The story seemed to start right in the middle ? at the cusp where Lucian had made up his mind to rebel. Therefore, there was no context; no tension; no sense of betrayal ? the devices needed to make everything else work. Moreover, it ended at where the climax should have begun (which needed to be after the feud had simmered for a bit). Oh and it was way too short. Purist will also find offense in some liberties taken to certain facts previously revealed in the first two movies?but judge that for yourself. In the end, this movie lingered to long on what should have been brief "background" scenes (e.g. various council scenes), and as a consequence we never really got to know or care about the principal players...or the movie (ouch). -D</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What an Underworld movie should be like!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first Underworld was good, the second one was a disappointment? But the third is, in my opinion, surprisingly better than the first two combined. Going into this movie, I wasn't expecting much, especially after the disaster that was Evolution. Evolution lost everything that made Uw1 so good ? the story, the characters, the dynamic between Lycans &amp; vampires, the love story of Selene &amp; Michael, and even the music. It seemed to focus around Selene kicking butt and mindless explosions and gore.But this movie totally blew me away. I'm writing this review over a day after I've seen it, and I'm still jittery from how good it was.**Okay, bad points (there are only a few main ones):The sex scene -- not as bad as the one from Evo, but we could've done without it. If I had a say in the matter, I would say just edit out the last part. Those who have seen it will know what I'm talking about. While very original, it made everyone go "WTF."Luka -- not quite sure what was up with her character, but it was kind of a meaningless character that they introduced?A couple of scenes or shots were a bit awkward? like Lucian falling off a cliff with two vampires ? it seemed like that scene from Psycho when Martin Balsam's character falls down the stairs? Some of the dialog was off ? either cheesy or too predictable.WAY TOO SHORT! I know a lot us would've liked to see more development in Sonja &amp; Lucian's relationship, and starting it where it did just kinda left some us going "??"**Good points (plenty here)RHONA MITRA. From the beginning I've been supportive of her taking on the female lead. The writers did a good job with her ? independent, strong, witty, rebellious without being annoying. She played the character extremely well! Going in I didn't think I would be so attached to her character at all ? and I wound up liking Sonja more than Selene in the end (and this is saying a lot!). Sonja has more depth than Selene did (especially after Evo). Kudos, writing staff and Rhona.Chemistry. I couldn't help but feel so much for these Sonja and Lucian, characters that weren't even on my "top three" until the end of this movie. Now they're at the top. Their relationship, although rushed, was truly touching. I found myself invested in their fates and getting emotional over something I knew was coming.The writing was pretty good ? better than Evo. There was a story, and the dialog did justice to all the characters. Tanis and Viktor, who I was afraid I would wind up hating now that Kraven is not there, were written in a way that you just had to admire and love the more. The addition of Raze, as well as some clips from the first Underworld tied ROTL with the first one.The acting. I think there may have been one weak character, and the rest of the cast worked well together and alone. Michael Sheen, Bill Nighy, Steven Macintosh, Rhona Mitra, and all the supporting cast were superb. You simply cannot ask for a better ensemble!The music, in my opinion, was added at the right time/scenes, at the right volume. The score and soundtrack have the same feel as the first movie (which it should, considering it's the same fabulous composer).The beginning and the ending? I would not change a thing. It was perfect. The beginning is a wonderful introduction to the movie, and the ending is a nice connection to the first movie.I think this movie worked out so well because it has a nice mixture of what made the first two movies good in my opinion. It had most of the original cast and characters, a strong female lead with a strong male counterpart, it wasn't so long that it lost your interest, and it had a strong enough plot line to carry the movie in spite of a few weak points.Overall, this was a pleasant surprise for devoted Underworld fans that waited 3 years and 3 days to see it, and any new-comers that were looking for a decent movie to watch in theaters.**VOTE: 9.0/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Underworld: Rise of the Lycans" is the third movie of the Underworld series and in this one we are back in time where the race of aristocratic vampires had Lycans as their slaves and we watch how they rise up against the cruel vampire king and what happened next.I liked this movie because it was something really different from all the other vampire movies and I also liked the thing that it turned us so back to show us how the things were there and how all this things started from the beginning of them. The interpretations of Michael Sheen who plays as Lucian, Rhona Mitra who plays as Sonja and Bill Nighy who plays as Viktor were simply outstanding.Finally I have to tell you that I strongly recommend this movie such as all of the Underworld movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Greatest Prequels.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This epic vampires versus werewolves prequel to "Underworld" and "Underworld: Evolution" qualifies as first-rate entertainment that resembles a combination of an old western and a variation on "Spartacus." The vampires are forted up in a medieval castle, and the werewolves lurk beyond the walls in the dark woods like hostile Apache Indians. The action is fast and furious and it sticks to the exposition from "Underworld" and concludes with Kate Beckinsale perched on a window ledge. Director Patrick Tatopoulos' "Underworld: Rise of the Lycans" occurs before Death Dealer Selene came onto the scene. "Lycans" chronicles the franchise when Viktor (Bill Nighy) commanded the coven and clashed with his rebellious daughter Sonja (Rhona Mitra of "Beowulf") who has an affair with a Lycan. The scene when the Lycan attack the vampire castle and Sonja's lover, Lucian (Michael Sheen of "New Moon") fires gigantic cross-bow arrows at the rampaging werewolves is unbelievably cool! Prepare yourself for an unhappy ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great film: definitely the best in the Underworld series. The story line is full of interesting twists, and adds a sense of completeness and maturity to the overall arching story of the Underworld series. The acting and script was very professional. The pace was just perfect - it isn't everyday that one gets to watch a film with just the right dose of action, drama and suspense. This one hits the nail on the head. The characters in this film are very rich and sophisticated, just like the story line itself. Now add to this the brilliant performances by the actors and you have a winning recipe: the film draws you in from the start right to the end, and you lose yourself to the story with a sense that you're living it as the characters are living it themselves. The FX, the set, directing, etc. all just gelled in so well. The resulting end product was a film well worth watching again and again and again - one for the DVD collection, without a doubt; doesn't lose its interesting aspects regardless of how many times I watch it. Can't praise it enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How the blood feud between the werewolves and the vampires seen in the first films started. Despite a lack of passion by the films director this is a well made and very well acted prequel to the earlier two Underworld films. Not a fan of the first film, I liked the second even though I had little idea what was going on. Here the plot is easy to follow and in some ways this is very good film, but someone behind the scenes didn't care so you're never completely drawn in, simply put there is a lack of passion in how the film proceeds. I can't blame the script which moves along at a good clip, nor can I blame the cast which includes Bill Nighy and Michael Sheen since they sell the material in more ways then it deserves. The film ultimately is a good little film, worth the effort to see, especially if you're a fan of the first two films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>well i just watched this movie, i'm a fan of the series, if you saw the first movie with attention, you will find that the whole thing of this prequel is there, the purpose of this movie was only, (i guess), to make some time to find a good script for the 4th part and to revive Victor and Lucian again because they found those characters were too strong and charismatic to let them die that easy , i dint like the vampires role here, they are so weak that they need to wear armors, the action is not impressive and you will only find lots of cut throats zooms, the story goes nowhere, all the movie happens at a pity castle , there are only one or two dramatic moments of Lucian and Sonya, and Victor is a great vampire, you will find he is the only vampire in this movie! despite all , i liked, i hope this franchise continues, and i enjoy when the studios at at least "tries" to make serious fantasy movies!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Underworld: Rise of the Lycans, kept close to the storyline and the fan base but I felt it missed that special something. It leaves me to wonder if Len Wiseman was present during the film making or just trusted Patrick Tatopoulos and left him to his own devices.During the movie I found myself looking for shots and moments that would make me get excited and tense my muscles but my thirst for them was never quenched. I find this issue common among people who have transitioned from other backgrounds in the film industry to directing. When you make a sequel or prequel, people go to watch the film for what they liked in the previous films. I don't feel this was the case in this Underworld installment.Raze is an important character. People love him from the first Underworld. We want to see him "Wolf out" for the first time as a discovery of his newfound power and freedom similar to how we got to personally discover how Scott Speedman wolfed out in the previous two movies. Unfortunately Raze "Turned" for the first time while running down a corridor partly blocked by columns. People love to see the transformations; I know Patrick talked about this in the previous Underworld commentaries. What happened? I hope the creative team decides to make a spin off movie starring Raze forming a band of werewolves and going on missions rising up to the battle between Kraven and Lucian.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad script, bad ideas and OK action.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First I must say that I enjoyed the first Underworld movie. I was intrigued and curious to learn about Vampires and Lycans and so forth. In this last part (hopefully) of the series I just feel sorry for how pathetic the vampires are. At least in the first part you had the tight leather clothes... now vampires seem like besieged victims of bad pest control problem. They look and act like haughty white pasty humans. Some ideas were neat... the whole thing with human nobles was interesting. Pity the acting was abysmal. The slave thingy too was feasible.Other things just hit me as pathetic. Spoilers now. Castle walls that can be jumped over in a few steps ? Enemies that don't attack during the day ? Big bad ancient vampires that take ages to join combat and then run away from a fledgling lycan leader after a minute or so ? Werewolves that den close to their enemies ? Lycans that raid armouries... for what ? They don't use axes and swords or armor ! A vampire leader so inept he manages to have just about everyone against him ? The romance is so unconvincing its sad.So I don't recommend this film unless you get it online or buy a very cheap movie ticket. Some of the action is good to OK. Certainly the vampires armor and weapons are interesting. Otherwise a very weak script that was badly put together and uses all sorts of inane plot twists.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brave Third One</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Number three in the line of the Underworld movies is another actionpacked one. It seems like a sleek romantic story initially, but the first thing that strikes me are the colours and the gloomy tones that creates an excellent atmosphere in the dark frames of the story - a great effect emphasising the night set scenes. The movie is told in a quite captivating manner, and this being director Patrick Totopoulos' first film, he has done it very well.The level of the entertainment is just great, the elements of action, horror and romance are smoothly spread throughout the structure as in the first two Underworld movies. Bill Nighy is unbelievable creepy as Viktor throughout the entire film, the evil is practical gleaming from his face. But Michael Sheen as Lucian is the star of the movie, he made a tremendous character - beast as well showing his "human" side. I did miss seeing Kate Beckinsale/Selene, but Rhona Mitra as Sonja is absolutely not a bad substitute in this fantastic sci-fi horror adventure.Very good entertainment, action with a persistent pace, and most of all, the terrific visual effects. The highlights were frequent, so I enjoyed it very much!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More of a fill in the blank then a true movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched Rise of the Lycans the first day it came out since i am an Underworld fan. I luved the first one, hated the second one, and wanted to see this one just to see if they would improve from the second ones disappointment. I will admit, they did indeed improve, but they did not surpass the first one. I understand though that this was really an entry to answer some long awaited questions about the rise of the lycans to become what they are in the first one. Sonja's character in my opinion was not well developed, i would have loved to have seen her more better developed and her actress was pretty good. My fav actor and character in this movie though was Michael Sheens Werewolf, he of course is the star of the movie, and is fantastic in his role. My only disappointment of the movie if anything is, i felt like this entry in the series was more of a fill in the blank then anything else, Hollywood trying to milk an awesome series. Well overall, its a great movie, but not awesome or fantastic like the first one. Worth watching, maybe a rental, but all in all, until they go back to the ways of the first one, will it truly be a return to the glory days for underworld.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When the human son of a werewolf is born in a cell, the evil leader of the clan of vampires, Viktor, spares his life and names him Lucian. He then forces him to transform other humans into the new breed - Lycan, and raises him as a slave wearing a leash to control his ability. Along the years, Lucian becomes a brave warrior with a great leadership over the other Lycans. He protects the aristocratic vampires during the daylight against the vicious and infectious breed of werewolves that are unable to take human form ever again. However, Viktor's daughter, Sonja, and Lucian are lovers and they secretly meet each other every now and then. Lucian unleashes and transforms in a werewolf to save the life of Sonja in a battle against the werewolves. However, Viktor sentences him to be brutally whipped thirty times and then imprisons him in the dungeon. Sonja saves Lucian and he escapes with other prisoners to the woods. When Viktor discovers that Sonja is pregnant and in love with Lucian, he locks her up in her room to force Lucian to return to the castle to rescue her, in the beginning of the feud between the two bloodlines. This Explains The Beginning Of The Lycan &amp; Death Dealer War. I Will Never See Viktor The Same As I Did When I First Watched 'Undeworld'.

		<shortDescription>Still solid after a 3rd outing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never understood some of the undercurrent of mirth or disparaging remarks toward the Underworld movies.Considering they are low budget by Hollywood standards, a surprising amount is on screen to appreciate.Take for instance the Lycans in this movie, a mixture of CGI and practical effects, and the end results make the Werewolf in Van Helsing look comical, and the Yetis in The Mummy: Curse of the Dragon Emperor look abominable in the worst kind of way! The sets are always very intricate and give no clue to the lower budget of the movie.The cast is probably the strongest elements in these movies, a plethora of whos who in British Cinema.Anyone making a Vampire movie these days has to make it in a genre that is well trodden and frankly, lacking these days.Not so the Underworld movies. They bring their own mythology to the fore, and its an interesting one.Too many people denigrate these movies as simply action movies, but personally speaking, I find that a description that does them a disservice. If only action movies had a storyline with the depth these movies have.The most surprising aspect for me is that this is the third movie, and, it also runs the gauntlet of being a prequel to the previous movies, and shouldn't work as we know some of the outcomes from flashbacks in the previous movies..... yet still works! Each Underworld movie has successfully been as good as each other, which is no mean feat these days.I liked it, and hopefully the 4th mooted movie will continue the tradition.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It really doesn't matter if you have seen the other two Underworld films. This is a prequel to them and it stands alone as an excellent film.Patrick Tatopoulos, who did the special effects for Godzilla and Stargate, has only directed one other film: Bird of Passage. He did an excellent job of telling the story of the rise of the Lycans from the birth of Lucian (Michael Sheen). Sheen, who was magnificent in Frost/Nixon and The Queen, is equally magnificent here, showing a full range of acting ability. He makes the film.That is not to take anything away from the vampire leader, Viktor (Bill Nighy). He is magnificently evil and easy to hate.The third character in our Shakespearean drama is Sonja, played by Rhona Mitra from Skinwalkers, and who actually got me to watch Ali G Indahouse just to see her.Sonja is the daughter of Viktor, and is carrying Lucian's child. That is not going to go over well with daddy when discovered.The blood flows freely, decapitations are numerous, and the fights are magnificent. And, oh, that final battle!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was left with reserved wonderings over whether this would be a good title to see. So many pro's and cons, no Selene... but Viktor and Lucian! The need to see how evolution was going to unfold into another movie... but the love story of Sonja and Lucian.. OLD SKOOL VAMPS AND LYCANS dueling it out. Turned out it was easy to say yes to viewing this one.Kate Beckinsale left a mantle as a leading hero that would be hard to meet the standards of. In fact I still miss her. But Sonja as a character had a good all round appeal, and she was played to a good standard that did not disappoint. Michael Sheen showed he still enjoys being the Lycan leader and portrayed his role yet again.... very well. And Viktor again was played viciously by Bill Nighy. He maintained the same arrogance and lack of mercy.. even on his own daughter, naughty, but it is what he definitely would have done. The last surprises in this movie lineup was the reappearance of Tanis and Raze. It was good to see their history in this bloody tale. Especially when Raze shows his allegiance to Lucian, and we see how they came together.I didn't know until after the film that this was not a Len Wiseman movie. However his influence has been noticed in the Killing methods, with no sensitivity shown in how to destroy an enemy properly. The killing methods have been what has made this series of movies great, as well as an excellent cast.The only real thing I have to raise a question mark over is the slight neglect of tie ins with the main story set in present day. Sonja was executed in front of the Coven in the flash backs of the first Underworld. Kraven was also missing. Also to jump straight to the beginning of Selene's story was a little rushed and sloppy at the end.For a film so vital to the integrity of this trilogy, it could have been done a little better.I hope for a fourth installment. In fact I think its necessary. Selene can walk in daylight, Michael Corvin is starting to ply his cross breed trade.. and he needs to make up for being dead or a bit useless in Underworld Evolution. It is top priority that Wiseman also directs again. His knowledge of this particular story is key if a final installment is to be seen. His knowledge of Killing is imaginative and he is the only one that can get Kate B to say yes to making another.Besides I want to see how this war ends!</fullReview>

My only criticism is that this film seemed to flow too fast and in my opinion it could have been a lot longer to add more depth to it. In some parts I wanted more, but was left slightly disappointed. The visual effects could have been a lot better. This is a very watchable film and by any standards it is an average film which falls short of its potential.

I will start with the complaints:1 - Kevin Grevioux's character, Raze, never had a collar on. 2 -Why when they recapture Lucian after he breaks back in to save Sonja, do they not put a collar back on him? 3 - When Lucian jumps off of the wall, the two vampires are turned completely to dust as they fall. Why does Sonja just become a charred corpse? 4 - Why would Vampires install a retractable roof to allow the sun in? 5 - Lack of Continuity in the movie: Sonja is executed through use of sunlight. Viktor comes to visit corpse and Lucian - full moon allows Lucina to transform to wolf. Lucian attempts escape. Battle ensues. Viktor runs for it - Lucian follows - Viktor and Lucian fight into a pit that stored the elders and THE SUN IS UP - charring Viktor. 6 - This is a complaint about the Underworld movies in general - why are the vampires so weak?Now the positives:1 - Excellent FX given the film budget. 2 - The film, generally, followed the history as presented in the 1st two films. 3 - I liked the development of Tannis in this film. 4 - The association of humans to vampires was a good development of the relationship. 5 -The love story between Lucian and Sonja was done well. 6 - The love scene was good (and I thought the intercourse scene with Lucian hanging over the cliff was hilarious) 7 - Michael Sheen and Bill Nighy had strong performances for their roles. Rhona Mitra presented Sonja as a very likable character.I would recommend this to my friends.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since this movie's plot drives most of the other two moviesit was good to see its story stand alone.If you didn't see Underworld or Evolution you don't need to.This movie does have a good plot and a lot of action/gore.Don't feel disappointed about knowing how the movie ends since first you watched the trailerand discovered this was coming to theaters (If you've seen the first movie).Thats like watching a prequel HP film about Harry's parentsthen being mad that Voldemort kills them in the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't honestly say that this was the best of the trilogy or the worst. But I will say that it does a great job of fitting in.The thing I really liked about this was that is really stayed true to the Underworld story line. Often times that is not the case with sequels or prequels, (aka Batman franchise). Any fan of the first two movies should be pleased with this. If you were to watch this first, then follow with the other two in order, you will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We've just come back from seeing Underworld 3 at the cinema.As a big fan of the previous two movies i was really excited to see that a new one had been released although i've still only seen one TV ad for it. Before hand i popped on to IMDb to see what the plot was and i was a bit worried to see that not only was it a prequel to the previous two but also that neither Kate Beckinsale or Scott Speedman wern't in it.I was pleasantly surprised as it is actually a good movie.I won't go in to too much detail as i don't want to spoil anyone's surprise but the story this time focuses around Lucian who was the first human/werewolf to be born and Viktor takes him under his wing although keeps him as a slave. Lucian falls in love with Viktor's daughter Sonja and want's to free himself and the other Lycans and be with Sonja. Needless to say things don't quite go as planned so the slaughtering begins.The special effects as in the previous movies are fantastic as is all the action. The end takes you virtually to the first frame of the first movie where Kate Beckinsale is squatting on that high building about to jump to the ground.If you enjoyed the first two movies then you'll definitely enjoy this one! If like me you're just a fan of anything Vampire and Werewolf then you'll love this too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still think the first Underworld was the best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Went to the first showing of Underworld: Rise of the Lycans today hoping to be entertained like I was by the first Underworld movie. Rise of the Lycans is a prequel and explains more about the conflict between the vampires and lycans. In my opinion the movie was good but not great. The action and special effects were excellent in some parts yet over the top at times. (Some of the scenes where swords cut down lycans was laughable.) The tone of the movie was dark and dreary because the vampires are only out at night. The castle where the coven lives seemed ancient and run down. The first Underworld movie took place in recent times and felt more current. I missed Kate Beckinsale; she was one of the main reasons why I liked the first two movies. Bill Nighy is very good as Viktor. Michael Sheen reprises his role as Lucian and does a great job. The end of the movie had a nice twist that brought things full circle back to the original Underworld. I think I'll pop the first movie into the DVD player tonight...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed the first Underworld, but not so much the second. This origins tale however is quite good. The love story, a sort of vampire meets werewolf gone Romeo and Juliet, becomes almost painful to watch near the end. In a good way though. The action is first rate, and Bill Nighy, as always, is quite creepy. It sets up the 'first' film nicely, and Mitra (amazingly beautiful) looks very much like Kate Beckinsale. It provides excellent back story that makes the 'first' movie have a greater impact upon reviewing. So if you haven't seen this but liked the first movies, you'll enjoy it. If you have seen it and liked the first movies, watch them again. The story will have more meaning, and make more sense. I'd give it a 7.5 if that option were available, because sometimes you just need a half. If there was one flaw, it is that the movie is VERY dark (visually) and that makes things hard to see sometimes. Worth a watch.</fullReview>

I loved the casting of Rhona Mitra as Sonja. It's very evident why Victor was so attached to Selene. Michael Sheen as Lucien as always was awesome, only in this one there's so much more of him, scenes and personality. The story is good, the action is GREAT!!! In this one you really see why Lucien was such a menace to the vampires and not just an inconvenient annoyance. Just saw it last night and could have gotten in line to see it again when it ended.

		<fullReview>The whole Vampires-versus-Lycans tale leaps back centuries earlier in "Underworld: Rise of the Lycans", a Kate Beckinsale-less prequel to the first two "Underworld" installments, which aside from providing viewers an extended look at the franchise's oh-so detailed mythology, has virtually no innovations to offer to keep it from being derivative. That the narrative is also predictably headed to a foregone conclusion proves to be the film's greatest undoing in whatever mild interest the script presents in bringing back its implicit societal classes allegories.Lucian (Michael Sheen) plots to rally his fellow Lycans into freedom from slavery by the aristocratic vampires ruled by Viktor (a barbarous Bill Nighy) but such goal is complicated by Lucian's clandestine romance with the latter's daughter Sonja (Rhona Mitra), a mere subscript to Lucian's expanded role. While Mitra adequately steps up as the story's central enchantress, her character's reduction to a deliberate plot device makes one wish for Beckinsale's cheesy-yet-sexy fight scenes, which are the predecessors' selling point.Long-time creature designer Patrick Tatopoulos steps behind the camera and his film (written by Danny McBride, Dirk Blackman, and Howard McCain) still captures the viciously frigid environment co-creator and erstwhile "Underworld" director Len Wiseman have brought. But the chintzy amusement, while still there, is scant, no thanks to a rote product that recalls its predecessors' B-movie goodness with not much success, and its confusing action scenes and perpetually dark cinematography that can't mask the absence of the genuine excitement in this third-rounder that's showing signs of debilitation. It's just the beginning, says Lucian. Yet somehow, it feels as if it's way past its zenith.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The origin story of the war between the vampires and the lycans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well this is the third in the series and it goes back to the dark ages to chronicle the beginnings of the war between the vampires and the werewolves. At this time the werewolves are pretty much animals in that once they turn they lose all vestiges of humanity and become little more than animals. But there has arisen a werewolf that can change form at will, Lucian (from the first movie), but the vampires fear their supremacy and thus enslave this new breed of werewolf (known as the Lycan).Prequel movies can be difficult to make at best as there is always more difficulties with continuity, especially if one imports a bad guy from one of the earlier movies, which occur later in the time line. In Rise of the Lycans the antagonist is the elder vampire Victor (who is killed in the first movie) and the protagonist, along with Lucian, is his daughter Sonja. It is clear that Selene does not appear in this film as she became a vampire after Sonja's death (which occurs in this film).The twist is that Sonja and Lucian are lovers, but it is a forbidden love, so they must keep it secret. However Sonja is out in the woods and is attacked by a werewolf pack. Lucian finds out about it, and rushes to save her, however he is prevented from turning into a werewolf due to a collar. He has managed to get a key, but he is forbidden from removing his collar, but he does so anyway to save Sonja's life. Instead of rewarding him for his act of bravery, he is punished. Thus, locked up with the other Lycans, he vows his revenge, and seeks freedom.This film seems to try to be a lot more political than the other films, but I feel that it does fail somewhat. The Vampire Roleplaying game was originally designed to be one of political maneuverings, but the clan based structure, as well as the large population of vampires (and the elders generally hiding in the shadows) make it much more possible to create the political air. This film, however, it appears that there is really only one coven, and Victor sits at the top of the food chain. Thus while they try to be political, I believe they fail. However, it is difficult to outline a huge and complex history in a film that lasts for only an hour and a half.Rise of the Lycans was somewhat more entertaining than the other films, but in any case, I still found it to be rather dry and lacking intrigue.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Rise of the Lycons is the third installment of the underworld series and pretty much follows the same mould as the previous films.The biggest difference is that Kate Beckinsale is missing from this but thankfully we get a much larger dose of Michael Sheen and the wonderful Bill Nighy. Where as , the previous two films mix modern day technology with ancient technology , this is all set in the past and i think the film suffers a little because of that . I also feel the portrayal of the Lycon wolves is a little bit "Jason and the argonauts" and could have been done a little better. Still , at a pleasant 90 minutes , i enjoyed Rise of the Lycons and i look forward to the return of the PVC suit in the fourth installment that comes out in 2012.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Falls short of what it could have been</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The third film in the Underworld series takes place many years before the events of the first film and explains how the war between the vampires and the lycans began. While the story may seem interesting at first, it never really captivates the viewer therefore leaving them to sit through lots if dialogue that is mixed at best.While this may suffer what the sequel had (too much story that is not interesting) the acting from Michael Sheen and Bill Nighy is very good and will keep the viewer entertained. Rhona Mitra who plays as Bill Nighy's daughter is good in places but the script does not allow for her to do much and despite what the poster may promise, she barely features in any of the action sequences. Usually there are scenes where the lead character has a chance to shine (Michael Sheen does) but she does not, which is a shame. However the action itself is again suitably bloody and is entertaining. I only wish there was more action to help compensate for amount of scenes where people are talking about matters that are not interesting. For those who are interested in seeing how the war began, you should watch this but for those who did not like the first sequel, it would be best to miss this. It is entertaining and I look forward to the sequel because the story is interesting. I only wish that it could have been told in a more captivating manor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The latest in the "Underworld" series, has revealed the secret that the Vampires and the Lycans turned into an all-out war. In the first movie it depicts the war for over 1,000 years between the vampires and the Lycans in the modern period, in "Underworld: Revolution" it was the story in 1202. The past secrets were revealed going through the series, and this time it is played out medieval times depicting the beginning of the war.The story was back in over 1,000 years ago. The vampires have been carrying out an experiment on the lycans as slaves and they succeeded to create a wolf man with a human feature for their first time. At the time, the lycans was under control by the vampires as their slaves with cruel treatment. A beautiful daughter, who is the old man of the vampires - Viktor-, was saved her life by Lucian. Soon after they fell in love. Viktor discovered that they were secretly meet each other every now and then and love each other. He decides to execute her by death penalty from the anger of her betrayal. Lucian takes out his revenge against Viktor. This was the beginning of the all-out war for over 1,000 years afterward. The previous two films were directed by Len Wiseman depicting the vampires viewpoint, however, this film directed by Patrick Tatopoulos was presented from the perspective of the lycans. I would sympathise the lycans rather than the vampires that the vampires treat cruelly the lycans like an animal and do an experiment on the lycans. Selene (played by Kate Beckinsale) in the first film is exactly alike for Sonja (Rhona Mitra) as if Selene is Sonja's replica so that Viktor couldn't kill Selene when he made an attack her family by the lycans. Indeed, Sonja looks very similar of Selene in the movie. Lucian who was in the previous movie, played the same role by Michael Sheen in this film. Therefore, there is a consequence in the stories throughout the trilogy. In the first film "Underworld", there were some funny contents in story such as a man will be the strongest when he was bitten by both a vampire and a lycan, or the vampires enjoy artificial bloods due to a mutually relationship between human and the vampires, or Viktor was paralysed in his old age when he was awake through over 1,000 timeless but he turned to be energetic feeding artificial bloods. But in this film, the degree of completion and consequence in the story will be at a satisfactory level. You will get the whole story at the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen and quite enjoyed the previous two films in this series, Underworld (2003) and Underworld: Evolution (2006). So I was quite interested to see how the third instalment would turn out. This film is set before the previous two and tells how the war between the Vampires and the Lycans started.The Vampires, led by Viktor, are aware of the Lycan race, immortal wolf-like creatures that are unable to change shape. That is until one day one of them is born in human form. Viktor knows he should kill it, but decides to let it live. They call him Lucian and they allow him to live among the Vampire race. Using his genetic material, Viktor breeds a race of Lycans that he uses to guard the Vampires as they sleep. He keeps them in check by force. Unknown to Viktor, Lucian and his daughter, Sonja have fallen in love and plan to leave the confines of the castle. Viktor finds out and this is where the fun really begins. I won't say any more, but it's not hard to figure out where the story goes from here.Quite a well made film with some good effects, plenty of gore and some decent CGI. Some great over-acting from Bill Nighy as Viktor and very decent performances from both Michael Sheen as Lucian and Rhona Mitra as Sonja. If anything I felt the film relied a bit too heavily on the special effects at the expense of a decent script. I don't think this one will feature in my end of year awards and I can't really recommend it to you.My score: 5.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a big fan of the first and second movies (in that order) and having been surprised at the quality of the second (what with so many sequels these days being God awful) I thought I should give Rise of The Lycans a chance. I wasn't wrong exactly - I didn't hate it, but there was something fundamentally wrong with it that I couldn't quite put my finger on. It wasn't nearly as captivating as the first two (and it should have been because the vampire back story is nothing if not interesting), with the exception of Michael Sheen and Bill Nighy who were excellent with the material they had the acting was okay-ish at best, verging on pretty average. The amount of CGI annoyed me too (it seems that with every Underworld movie the amount of CGI footage increases ten fold) and the whole plot felt extremely rushed - given the ridiculously short duration it wasn't a surprise. It made me wonder if the creators just got lazy and decided to skimp on material. There were parts that were interesting - the fight scene between Michael Sheen and Bill Nighy, Michael Sheen, Bill Nighy... The end was a surprising high point and I think the film makers really capitalised on the movie's potential. If I was to sum up all the problems with this movie though, that would be the number; the film makers just didn't capitalise on good material.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This franchise is reborn with Underworld: Rise of the Lycans. The production for this seems epic, although a bit short in running time. I was pleased to see such beautiful set design, and very little CGI.The Acting in this film was wonderful and passionate by the whole cast. I cant say enough about Bill Nighy. The man is just the most imposing thing in cinema history, I have nightmares just thinking about that face of his, such a great typecast for a head vampire; perfect in the role, in appearance, as well as performance. He was really into this role. He is a big vampire fan in real life which probably helped him.Another phenomenal effect in the film was that they went back to Rubber suits for the Lycan/Werewolves. These things were just scary looking ! I think anyone who enjoys Shakespearean noir should get this and include it in your DVD collection even if you haven't seen the two other films. This is the prequel and should be seen first anyways.SUMMARY: 7/10 Epic but short, only 90 min. or I would have rated it a 9. I think the character development could be a bit deeper.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A worthy addition to the Underworld series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the third instalment of the Underworld series that takes place before the original. It is a Sci-Fi that tells the story of how the centuries old feud between vampires and one time slaves, the Lycan's (werewolves) develops. Missing the two main stars from the original films (Kate Beckinsale and Scott Speedman) and a new director, I was curious as to how this movie would hold up to the originals. I went in with lower expectations, and surprisingly this movie was just as good as its predecessors. Billy Nighy is always awesome to watch, and he is really convincing as the menacing vampire leader, Victor. Michael Sheen was also fun to watch as Lucian, the werewolf who leads the rebellion against the vampires and Rhona Mitra did a good enough job as his love interest Sonja. This movie might have missed Kate Beckinsale, but you don't completely notice this as Rhona shares an uncanny resemblance to Beckinsale. This movie stays true to the Underworld stories and is an entertaining film. My Rating: 6.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>yeah well i thought that this movie was pretty good although I haven't seen the other two films. I was slightly disappointed that the whole movie was constructed of the werewolves breaking out of gaol, and then getting put back in. Breaking out, putting back in. In, out. That's actually all it was. It showed none of the outside world really, except for a few short scenes. The action scenes were pretty cool as well, although i am disappointed that these days in movies vampires are so easy to kill. They are supposed to be mighty, majestic creatures that are nigh impossible to destroy, but these days you prick one with a pin and it's dead. The werewolves looked pretty realistic, i assume they were either puppets or very good animation. I was pretty confused at the end though, i think partly because i haven't seen the other two. First of all i don't understand why the main vampire was still alive at the end, especially since out of all the kills in that movie, that blow right through his head would be the closest one to actually killing a vampire. One of the mighty, majestic, nigh impossible to kill ones, that is. Also i didn't have a clue what those coffin things were. I assume they had vampires inside although i'm not quite sure. All in all, a pretty good film, i wasn't disappointed by it, you shouldn't be disappointed by it. That's it. Good bye now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you think about it, there are numerous holes in the plot, but this was not a film that I started watching in order to find inconsistencies. Having started with low expectations (after all, there was no Kate!) I was not disappointed by the film, and was even surprised by the quality of the acting and the general directing.Well, it's not like I expected any less from Bill Nighy, but also Rhona Mitra was cool, sexy and acted very well. The biggest star was Michael Sheen, though. He played all the emotional range of a werewolf Romeo and made a third part of a franchise and a prequel look decent. But this brings me back to the start of this comment: too bad the plot was full of holes.Bottom line: a mix of 300 and the Savage video game, with surprising performances from at least three actors. My personal favourite was Steven Mackintosh, but hey, I am partial to scholars in interracial war movies :)</fullReview>

For those, with doubts...Lucian and his gang of human turned lycans used to protect the vampires from the uncontrollable, ones, who once turned were permanently werewolves.Yeah, apparently those born a vampire do age to a certain extent but those turned don't. Even lycans for that matter.As for lycans &amp; vampires dying by means other than sliver bullets and sunlight, I think apart from that what is meant is immortality with respect to natural causes. If someone were to severe a vampire or werewolf's head, how would one expect them to live after that? What they probably mean is if left alone to lead their lives they wouldn't die. This was there in part 1, 2 and 3. So, that's what my guess is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well it was better than Underworld 1, but clearly that isn't saying much. I skipped Underworld 2, but went to see this one at the Cinema since I had a 2-for-1 offer.Rhona Mitra is surprisingly good as the 'young attractive ish female vampire', which is usually done pretty terribly in this type of film. Her strong voice and general demeanor was surprisingly good. The main guy was also pretty good-- between the two of them they really tried to prop up the seriousness of the film, against all odds.Bill Nighy was totally miss-cast, and oozed with camp theatricality that unraveled any suspension of disbelief each time he appeared on the screen. Which is odd, he should be able to do this-- the old, dusty authoritarian head vampire is the one that films usually 'get right'. Clearly either he or the director weren't taking the film that seriously.The clip where the vampire girl and the wolf/ lycan guy are making love over the edge of a cliff was hilarious.Overall it was pretty epic, fairly non-stop in the action stakes, but a tad brain-dead and lazy in the storytelling department.p.s. Rhona Mitra's massive top lip got distracting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yes,it's really that good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes,when they said they were going to make third part of Underworld movie,as a prequel,and that that would be done without Kate Beckinsale I was very suspicious about the movie itself and the overall quality of the movie.I thought it would be only step away from the ,, straight to DVD ,, type of movie.Then when I learned it would be shown in theaters,and that the cast is great and when I saw the trailer I finally felt relieved.I didn't really think it would be good,but so-so kind of movie.Nothing spectacular,nothing original,just plain old fun.And was I wrong...For me this movie surpasses Underworld and Underworld:Evolution in many ways.OK,maybe I need to see the first two movies again just to jog my memory,but I think my opinion would be the same even after watching it...Let's start with the cast.First,Bill Nighty as Victor is great as in first two movies,maybe even better.Has anyone noticed that this is the role that was made for him,a perfect vampire in any way,just a joy to watch.Next,Michael Sheen as Lucian.I think he really gave his best for this movie,which is kinda strange because this was supposed to be action movie.In a 90 minute action flick he gave more than you would expect,and if the characters were more explored ( which would probably result in a two hour movie or more ) he would be simply perfect...And finally Rhona Mitra as Sonja.As much as I love watching Rhona,she is not Kate Beckinsale,but her character here was kinda one-dimensional so nothing spectacular from her,but passable anyway...There is action,there is gore,and there are of course effects.And at the center of the story is a tragic love story and the fight for freedom...Yes,there are some usual clichés and plot holes,and of course there is a problem of this being a prequel you know which characters are going to survive but it won't ruin enjoyment in this movie.The only thing that is not clear to me is that I have read comic book Underworld:Rise of the Lycans from IDW just before the movie was released and the comic was exactly like the movie,so in a way I have watched the movie before it was released,and it isn't clear to me why would they release it before the movie?All in all,great movie,not to be missed and one of the really great surprises from 2009 early movies.Go see it in a theater if you can,you won't be disappointed. P.S. Let's hope the next one will be as good as this one...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To begin bluntly, I am a fan of the Underworld series, so have no delusion about that. It's not so much that I am an action junkie, or am hot for Kate Beckinsale (as hot as she may be), no, it is that I am thoroughly impressed and somewhat enthralled by the whole vampire/werewolf world and its complex history that Len Wiseman and company have conceived.Laid out in flashbacks in the first Underworld film, the shady history of vampire betrayal and the beginning of the so called blood feud between the bloodsuckers and their once slaves, The Lycans, was wrought. Helmed by a new director, Patrick Tatopolous, Underworld: Rise of the Lycans delves deep into the lore and shady doings of one of the first vampire covens and their cruel treatment of the monstrous werewolf servants, born of the first true 'Lycan', Lucien. As the Underworld films have progressed their core has only become more rewarding and labyrinthine. Don't be mistaken, this film will win over few converts, but the world that has been created throughout the trilogy is worthy of praise.A monster only be association, Lucien (Michael Sheen) is the prized pet of the vampires. His disease gives the gift of slaves and daytime guardians for the death dealers, lead by the powerful Victor (A fiery Bill Nighy) and graced by the presence of his beloved daughter Sonja (Rhona Mitra who takes over in the absence of Beckinsale). A forbidden love exists however between Sonja and Lucien and the deceptions and betrayal that ensues leads to a rebellion of the Lycan slaves against the silky vampires that will last a thousand years.The narrative plays out in almost a Shakespearian way, with the powerful father and the forbidden affair. Backed with constant action and delightfully over the top and charismatic performances by Sheen and Nighy, this installment while beginning to wear simply from overindulgence, is a boatload of fun, and constantly entertaining. If anything drags the film down, it is that certain portions of this story have been drilled home by the sequel Underworld: Evolution and it begins to wear on the audience. The film, despite its new director, looks exactly like the previous films and the look suits the medieval theme nicely. With such an elaborate history at it back, this installment mixes a few things points up, but that isn't to say Evolution fudged them up. I'm sure upon even greater scrutiny, even more elements of the narrative would begin to erode, but I for one am happy to take it as is and appreciate the fable in its entirety.Underworld: Rise of the Lycans is certainly nothing completely new, but style and characters go a long way in a film like this, and with larger then life characters who are impossible not to hate and love in turn, the film achieves a new level of gravitas. So, if you haven't been bitten by the Underworld curse yet, you may want to take a look, because if loving werewolves and vampires duking it out at the castle wall in the name of love is wrong, then I don't want to be right.Evren Buyruk from the USA.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was one of those people who heard a local critic on the radio rave about Underworld the original and thought what the hay, but really what the heck can they do with Werewolves and Vampires that hasn't been done?...Sorry I was wrong and I ended thinking Underworld was GREAT. So original. It has a plot, great story line, great action, all of that in one film, lucky if you get one of those these days.2nd film I sooo looked forward to it, couldn't wait I was totally disappointed, dull for me. So I am wondering did I miss this one? It is true I didn't like underworld 2, and if you didn't like it don't be put off. RENT, DVR, Underworld RISE of the Lycans it is right back to where it ought to be.This time the ACTING saves the day, the leads are all excellent. We know what happens but the story and acting is soo well done, you feel so much for LUCIAN that it keeps you watching. And ole EVIL Vicktor...just great.WATCH IT!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I may hate Nazis but I loved this movie. It worked. Lucian and sonja were completely in love with each other.Lucian would go to hell and back for her and it showed (but then again who wouldn't for Rhona Mitra?) Also, there was the freedom angle w/the enslaved Lycan's. The CGI effects were great, especially in the final battle scene. At the very end they tied into the first move to show great continuity.Both Lucian and Viktor were exactly like in the first movie but Luician was far more noble.Overall, this is definitely worth seeing if you are a fan of the series.</fullReview>

It had that 'what will happen next' guesses with-in every scene.Computer graphic of the wolves was bit weird, they seemed as bears more than wolves some of the vampire world scenarios was bit too awkward. It made me feel like the vampires were regular humans, but they're not! Vampires are strong creatures, over here they seemed they're nothing really special. Vampires don't grow I thought, but either the way action and fighting of the film was worth forgetting about the vampire facts.</fullReview>

I just really like these kinds of movies. If you haven't seen the other 2 movies, Underworld and Underworld: Evolution, I suggest you watch them first. Missed Kate Beckinsale in this movie but, it dawned on me this one was the prequel story before she was a part of it. The sets and costuming were also amazing. When I saw this movie I was one of 6 people in the theater so glad I went when I did. I wouldn't have wanted to see this on a TV screen. For those of you who decided not to see cause someone told you it wasn't worth it, or it wasn't as good as the first two, I say see for yourself and you be the judge.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much better than what I expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I liked the special effects and the visual style from the first two Underworld films,I found their mythology unnecessarily solemn and complicated,so I did not expect with too much enthusiasm the third part,which is a prequel which shows the origins of the conflict between vampires and werewolves ("lycans" in the mythology of the saga) shown in the previous movies.But Underworld : Rise of the Lycans was a very nice surprise in my case,and I found it much more entertaining and exciting than the previous films.Director Patrick Tatopoulos lacks of the visual dynamism of Len Wiseman (the director of the previous Underworld films),but he could find a better tone for this movie and I think the action scenes are better filmed than in the previous films.Rhona Mitra was a very appropriate replacement of Kate Beckinsale.She shows credibility and enthusiasm on her role.Michael Sheen also brings a good work but I think the member of the cast who mostly stands out is the great Bill Nighy,who takes his character to histrionic extremes.Nighy shows conviction on his dialogs but he also shows a subtle touch of humor which makes his dialogs more entertaining.The special effects are very well done.I think the best element from this movie is that it does not take too seriously to itself,at the difference of the previous movies.I can recommend Underworld : Rise of the Lycans as a very entertaining and exciting movie with competent performances and good action scenes.I took a very nice surprise with this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Guilty pleasure that I definitely liked</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Werewolves and vampires are two monster that I have always liked. Lately we have gotten much more vampires then werewolves, but with Rise of The Lycans, that has definitely changed for this one movie because the werewolf takes center stage for once. THe first two movies dealt primarily with the vampires, so it was a nice change of pace to get the werewolves point of view, and I really liked the design of this movie even though it was dark and murky and the action moved very fast.In Rise of THe Lycans, we finally get Lucian's point of view and the answer to questions that were posed in the first movie. Lucian (Michael Sheen) as we know, was the leader of the Lycans, or werewolves. He fell in love with SOnja (Rhonda Mitra) who was Viktor's (BIll NIghy) daughter. It was this affair which led to the events of the other two movies when we find out that Viktor, the head vampire, had sentenced his own daughter to death for having an affair with the slave werewolf. Rise of THe Lycans explains these events and how they came about in great detail. We soon realize that the vampires are the real bad guys because they were the ones that created the mindless werewolves in the first place by using Lucian's blood.THe acting was rather good for a movie like this one. I have already explained the major players, but most of the other main actors from the first two movies return for this installment. We have Kevin Grevioux who returns as Raze, Lucian's most loyal friend, and we also have Steven Mackintosh returning as Tannis who at first follows the vampire way only to later help Lucian with weapons able to kill the vampires.I enjoyed the setting and the look of the movie, but was a little put off by how dark it was and how some of the fight scenes moved so quick that you were unable to see certain gory details. I see how this look fits into a movie like this one, but I still say it could've showed more details. THe other thing was that even though this was a movie dealing with two types of monsters, it was more of an action film then horror movie. THe gore was plentiful, but I did not find this movie to be scary at all. THat is why I can only give it a 7 out of 10. It is still a movie I would recommend, but just not quite up there with your classic horror movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's hard to enjoy a movie when you walk in knowing the ending. It's worse if you know it will end badly. That was what I thought before I walked in to the Friday night showing of Underworld: Rise of the Lycans. After I walked out, I knew I would never be able to watch Underworld: Evolutions without a barf bag again. Rise of the Lycans is pretty much everything a fantasy/action film should be. I give it 8 stars since I feel they could have made this a bit longer and shown more character development/background. I could have sat in my seat for an extra half hour without complaining.Bill Nighy as Victor and Michael Sheen as Lucian hold this movie together like super-glue. They are both riveting. You will forget about the generic plot, the constant darkness (which can generally be a strain on the eyes) and will fall in love with the lead couple. Knowing they are doomed makes it better in a way. Their chemistry was great! I never understood why exactly Selene and Michael were a couple by the end of the first movie. It was like the pretty girl has to pair up with the pretty boy before the credits roll, which was acceptable then. Sonja (Rhona Mitra) and Lucian are a very different story though. You feel their heartbreak and the intensity of their relationship through the length of the film, even though you don't see how they actually came to be together.Steven Mackintosh and Kevin Grevioux as Tannis and Raze respectively have very little time on screen, and are good enough to make you wish you knew more about their characters.The action scenes were good, just as long as they should be and above all, did NOT look like animation. There are a couple of scenes where the entire audience will collectively wince, but are not so bad that someone sensitive to movie gore (like me) would not be able to watch.One thing remarkable about this film is the fact that when it's over, you will go back home, watch the other two and find you like them much less than you thought you did. Especially the second one, since it lacks the two best things about the franchise- Victor and Lucian. It brings out the flaws in the other films since you WILL compare them! You can't say that about a lot of prequels/sequels.PS- If you're worried about missing Kate Beckingsale- don't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice prequel, even cooler then Underworld 1&amp; 2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this movie,we see how the war between vampires and werewolves begun. Centuries ago, in the Dark Ages,a Lycan named Lucian was raised by Viktor, the vampire king that enslaved the Lycans. Viktor treats Lucian better then he would treat any werewolf, specially because Lucian does Viktor's dirty job in killing his own species. However, Viktor is going to fall in love with the vampire Sonja, Viktor's daughter, making Viktor's and Lucian's relationship get a lot of problems and eventually change.Many things will happen until Lucian emerge as a leader and makes the werewolves to rise up against Viktor.''Underworld: Rise of the Lycans'' is one of the best prequels I already watched in my life! And look, when I went to the Movie Theaters, I wasn't even interested in watching this movie. I thought that the third film of this franchise would be horrible,specially because I didn't like Underworld 2 very much, but thanks God I was wrong! The werewolves in this version are incredible! I never cared very much about them and always preferred vampires, but in this version, the Lycans RULES! It is even funny to compare this prequel with the first movie, because in this one, the vampires look very weak compared to the werewolves. I think it was a flaw of the writers or maybe a way to compensate the weakness of the werewolves in the other movies, but since this movie is better then the other two, I can forgive their flaw.I totally recommend this movie for people who enjoy fantasy and the incredible vampiristic universe.Ps: Michael Sheen is hot as Lucian! Ps2: The werewolf/vampire battle, remembered me very much a battle that happens in the Twilight's series' books!Ps3: I don't buy vampires getting pregnant! That's the only thing I disliked in this movie. Come on, vampires are supposed to be dead, right? So how they can create a new life?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underworld 3: The Prequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit that it is at least interesting to see how the lycans and the vampires fight. This is a prequel which mostly features the lycans, fighting for their rights. I cannot say that this is very good but it is better than average. It is just an entertainment, it is not something to be taken seriously which is why some people cannot enjoy. I cannot compare this with the other two movies but this serves a great prequel to them.Th story: Patrick Tatopoulos is actually making this movie with efforts. Since this is his first big-budget movie, he did it great. He should be deserved to be recognized as he usually do special effects for movies. His first full-length movie is better than some of the other first-time directors' movies. He might be given some more movies projects to direct, depending on how well this movie does. The story is quite straight-forward, it is fun to see the two different sides fighting for their gains. The acting is not bad. There is blood/gore added. It is not a new thing to the Underworld movies. As the title suggests, Vampires are not really in the movie, only Viktor in action.Overall: Those who are fans of Underworld will catch this. Even fans of werewolves or vampires will check this out. Those, who want to know more about Underworld, can catch this and watch the two movies later. The Underworld trilogy is one of the best vampire/werewolf movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What was the point of this movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Besides being one of the most clichéd movies in history. Honestly, I had a notepad with me and I wrote down a list of clichés that would turn this into a B-MOVIE had it not been casted with some stars, and even then only Bill Nighy can be considered A-list. Rhona Mitra and Michael Sheen are debatable. Underworld: Rise of the Lycans includes:- bureaucratic, prestigious vampire class that are so far up their own behind, totally oblivious to reality. basically the vampires = Romans- introducing slavery to their House, then treat them like crap prompting an all-out rebellion - a treacherous daughter that defies and backstabs her father in every possible way - an obligatory love story involving the treacherous daughter and the leader of the slaves - the leader of the slaves rallies all the other slaves to rebel - a corrupt, power hungry member of the council - the hero escapes, then stops and goes back to rescue her love, falling into a trap - the vampires toy around with the hero despite knowing how powerful and destructive he can be, never killing him outright of course - climatic battle scene. bad guys get destroyed, good guys win/save the day/save the world/make the world a better place.I honestly don't mind movies with a bit of cliché, I'm not expecting every movie to be like No Country. But Rise of the Lycans is a glorified B-movie. I can't believe Bill Nighy signed up for this. The scene where Rhona Mitra points her sword at him and he yells I'M YOUR FATHER!!! was so cringing. Michael Sheen was completely miscast, he had only one expression throughout the entire movie and that is to widen his eyes as big as possible, which ironically makes him look more like the animals that he so vehemently distances himself from. Rhona was pretty decent, nothing terrible but also nothing special. The rest of the cast is nothing special, as a matter of fact I was shocked at how insignificant the rest of the characters were. The House was very small. The bulk of the film's $35 million budget must have gone to Bill Nighy's, Rhona Mitra's and Michael Sheen's salaries. This movie looked like it was made 10 years ago. I know it's a prequel but I'm sure the producers did not literally intend the movie to actually look like it was made/shot before the other Underworlds!Not surprisingly the film's highest votes come from the male and female under 18 crowd. Boggles the mind how this can be over 6 at all, but it is rated at 6.9 at the moment.</fullReview>

But my father and I went to watch it (I'm 17 years old) and towards the middle of the film I got to thinking "hey this is a pretty decent flick". I really liked it, it was a good addition to the other two. The acting was "so so" the f/x weren't half bad though I liked the way the lycans transformed and what not. There was some pretty good bloody mid-evil fun in this film. I think that the previous other two films were much better but it just feels like it wouldn't be complete with out "Rise of the Lycans". This movie is worth the 9 dollars it delivers on the action and special effects its a good hour and a half of eye candy. Watch "Rise of the Lycans" there is nothing wrong with it ;]</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't believe this movie is getting the rating that it is here on IMDb. Of course, I've come to conclude that IMDb is somewhat worthless for actually finding out if a movie is good or not as 99% of films are rated from 6 to 7. It's the conclusion and failure of crowd-sourcing on the internet. For this purpose an average is taken of most people, and unfortunately, most people are simple minded easily entertained fast food lifestyle morons. But I digress. The movie. I really don't want to waste my time writing about it. Let's just say I found it to be tailor made for seemingly two groups of people, young teens, at the age where violent action movies of any sort just hit the spot, and goth types that just love to choke down whatever Gothic vampire fantasy they can get their hands on. If you aren't in one of those categories, you will find this movie absurd. I did enjoy the first Underworld. It was fresh at the time and held a sort of edgy quality. The second was a bit trying in plot, but I did enjoy the direction and cinematography at times. But this whole movie felt like a sci-fi channel production or even a TV series. I found the actors to be over-directed. Their body language stiffened into un-natural idealistic poses that seemed contrived. Lines were spit out like young actors would spit out lines of Shakespeare, reveling in their own egoistic glory at being in such a role, but in doing so, crudely bludgeoning the role. The plot was dry and predictable right from the start. I found myself wishing things to just "move along" as it was so easy to tell what was going to happen. I tried to care at first, but my brain was forced to shut off. By the end climax, I actually caught myself falling asleep. There were so many parts that were inconsistent and didn't make sense that it's not even worth listing them all. If you're a pimple faced teen or a chronic goth, sure, have at it. For the rest of us, forget it, like I'm about to do right now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unique to Rise of the Lycans compared to the other two Underworld movies is the emotion and testament the writing, characters and atmosphere portrayed. Giving Kate Beckinsale a break and taking the prequel route was a very smart plan, leading to a movie that was better than expected. With Bill Nighly taking a central role it really strengthens the core characters of the movie around him. Rhona Mitra was impressive as well as Michael Sheen, who would be hard pressed for being a lead role in other movies. It is also nice to see on film the backstory that the viewers kept hearing about in the first two films. Although we all know what happens to everybody at the end, the film still managed to hold interest. In no way is Rise of the Lycans an original or memorable film but it is surprisingly entertaining and a better watch than Evolution.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A solid prequel that fills in much of the franchise's mythology</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film, set several centuries before the original two, tells us the story of Lucian; the first lycan who can take human form. He doesn't start off as a leader of a new race of powerful immortals; instead he and this new type lycan as kept as slaves by the vampires to protect them from the older type of lycan. Not everybody sees them as animals though; Sonja, the daughter of Victor the Vampire King, has fallen in love with Lucian. Lucian may be a slave but he is favoured by Victor? that is until he breaks the rules and leaves the vampire stronghold and removes his restraining collar? something Victor won't forgive even though Lucian did it to save Sonja. With Sonja's help he manages to escape with the other lycan slaves but Victor becomes aware of his daughter's treachery? if Lucian is to save her he will have to return to the vampire stronghold and ultimately face Victor in battle.At first I was a bit unsure about this film because it doesn't feature Selene, the series protagonist, and the fact that we know that certain characters must survive as they feature in films set later. Thankfully it was still gripping and impressively fills in much of the series' mythology. It was interesting to see a lycan as the main character and Michael Sheen did a fine job as Lucian. He is ably supported by Rhona Mitra who is impressive as doomed love interest Sonja and Bill Nighy who makes a welcome return as Victor. As anybody who has watched the previous films will expect there is plenty of impressive and rather bloody action but not so much that it gets in the way of the story. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to anybody who enjoyed the previous two films but it isn't essential to have seen them to enjoy this.</fullReview>

Anyhow onto the movie itself. The story in this one is pretty well thought out and help us understand the characters, they did put in emotion where you can just be surprised by how much it gave to the characters.Michael and Bill who reprise their roles as Lucian and Viktor respected both gave a strong performance it made you want to see what happens next with their characters both men just brought their A game to the film.The music is very well done. Also the action scenes in this film just make you want more along with twist and turns you won't see coming. The main problem I have with the movie is that some of the plot could be a disappointment and moments you feel could have been done better. But with a strong story well balance talented acting and for fans of Underworld this is a movie to consider if you're a werewolf and vampire film fan I give Underworld: Rise of the Lycans an 7 out of 10</fullReview>

Michael Sheen buffs up into Karl Urban, who as Lucian (bad ass Lycan) leads his species to a bloody revolt, and Kate Beckinsale has made way narratively for Rhona Mitra, who sexes things up. The action is pulse raising and the Gothic designs and atmospherics are first rate, while the battle royale finale is fit to crown any genre film of its type. Problems are evident, though. The constant flow of CGI blood becomes irritating after a while, and Bill Nighy (in spite of being a franchise regular) is still looking miscast! But it has proved to be a series with hairy legs and fangs that refuses to die, a popcorn munchers dream. So enjoy the spectacle and the screenplay homages, and I'll have a bag of tortilla chips and a choc ice please. 6.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good simple story without Kate Beckinsale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a prequel and an origin story of how the Lycans were born. Lucian (Michael Sheen) is the first werewolf born to take human form. Normally, werewolves turn into vicious animals and never turn back. Instead of eliminating the possible future threat, vampire king Viktor (Bill Nighy) decides to use him to create an army to protect the vampires from the nuisance of the werewolves. Viktor's daughter Sonja (Rhona Mitra) would fall for Lucian, and help him lead a rebellion against the vampires.It's a bit of a shock to not have Kate Beckinsale or Scott Speedman. Kate has some narration at the beginning. After I figured that out pretty quick, the story is watchable on its own. Rhona Mitra is a gorgeous actress. She just doesn't have the same level of loveability of Kate Beckinsale. Michael Sheen strips off his shirt and does a really good job. It's a fairly simple story. It's just maybe not what I was expecting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Surprisingly Good Prequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This prequel to "Underworld" is essentially the story of "Lucian" (played by Michael Sheen) and the evolution of lycans (werewolves) from full-time savage beasts to those who change from werewolf to human (and back again). The biggest problem I have with prequels is that the endings are generally already known, so much of the mystery has already been taken away. This film is no exception. For example, anyone who has seen "Underworld" knows that "Sonja" (played by Rhona Mitra) dies. It is also common knowledge that "Viktor" (Bill Nighy) and "Lucian" will live to fight another day. Further, for those who have seen the sequel, "Underworld: Evolution", then they know that "Tannis" (Steve Mackintosh) also survives. So all that's left are perhaps a few minor surprises here and there and the hope of plenty of good action or plot developments in-between. Because of this, prequels are seldom as good as the original movie. Add in the fact that the main star (Kate Beckinsale) of both "Underworld" and "Underworld: Evolution" is absent, along with the fact that another director (Patrick Tatopoulos) is calling the shots, and this movie doesn't seem to have much chance of success. Fortunately, this film beats the odds. Although not quite as good as Kate Beckinsale, Rhona Mitra steps in and gives a very good performance as "Sonja", the daughter of "Viktor". Michael Sheen and Bill Nighy also perform exceptionally well. Likewise, Patrick Tatopoulos manages to stay the course and remains true to the basic theme of the original and sequel alike. In short, this is a surprisingly good prequel and I recommend it to anyone who liked the two previous pictures.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Prequels are always tricky ground to be treading, especially when the movies they are trying to explain already told you everything you needed to know. Such is the case with the third installment in the moderately successful "Underworld" franchise, dubbed "Rise of the Lycans."As its title suggests, the movie tells the story of the betrayal and the raging war between the Lycans (a.k.a. Werewolves) and the vampires, as chronicled in the previous two "Underworld" installments. This time around, director Len Wiseman has stepped down, passing the reins to production designer Patrick Tatopoulos, who has done his time behind the scenes for this particular franchise, as well as an assortment of other blockbusters. Also missing in action is actress Kate Beckinsale who carried the previous films on her back, and although her absence is understandable given the story at hand, it is also sorely noticed.To be fair, Tatopoulos brings a strong visual sense to his installment that fits in seamlessly with its predecessors. Some dodgy effects here and there do little to hinder the mood; instead, the plot which is as lame as it is drawn out, offers nothing to engage the viewer in once the visual panache wears thin. Likewise, the performances range from droning to over-done, making the movie feel kind of like a special effects soap opera."Rise of the Lycans" isn't exactly playing with a full deck of cards, and while it may appeal to the fans that can't get enough of the "Underworld" universe, it brings nothing to the table that hasn't already been said or done. Aside from looking good and not punishing us by being overly long, it's a wonder it made it to theaters when it clearly screams direct-to-video. Best viewed when you've watched the previous two films and can't get enough, or, if you simply like a good vampire/werewolf drama that isn't "Twilight."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>should have aRisen first</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the movie that should have been done first off. The way it turned out, while watching, you know what is going to happen, having seen the story-line in the original UNDERWORLD. And that's a shame, because I can quite imagine how I would have freaked out normally at the sight of Sonja getting burnt to a crisp, the queen or the modern martyrs of female movie characters. As you can guess, I am a Rhona Mitri fan, especially because of PARTY OF FIVE, even if her character was grossly underdeveloped there, and NIP/TUCK to a lesser extent, because there her character regressed into a shambles. So, despite not really having seen her in anything worthy of her, I am a Rhona Mitra fan (and no, I haven't seen her in FHM magazines either) you know why? It's the age-old RavenGlamDVDCollector thing... that foxy face! She is just beautiful.I normally avoid the kind of slasher movie where girls get killed for the heck of it left, right, front and center, and it was a total bummer to have the lead lady killed off about 80% through the movie, but this film is just marvelously done in a most astounding way, including the death scene. It is just absolutely breathtaking. It cements Sonja as an unforgettable character.Actually, Sonja's more to my liking than that cold-as-ice deathly Selene. I'm not saying anything at all against Kate Beckinsale, no way, Selene is a scripted character and she is scripted that way to be played that way. But to those of you criticizing Rhona's Sonja as light- weight compared to Kate's Selene, I do not agree. I think everybody will concur that two superb stars were chosen for the two female leads.(Apologies to you seriously-into-gore and CGI mayhem dudes, I'm just a Rhona Mitra fanboy!)P.S. I should also mention that Michael Sheen and Ben Nighy outdid themselves. That is some compliment from a guy who is obsessed only with actresses. Take it as a feather in your caps, guys.Whew, after the trilogy set, gee, had my fill of wolfy violence! And dark blue screens! :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable, but unnecessary prequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Have you watched the first 'Underworld?' If you have, you may well remember a bit of talking about a female vampire who fell in love with a male werewolf (sorry, 'lycan'). Well, that three minute monologue from the original has been turned into an hour and a half story. And this is it.So, if you've seen the first film, there's nothing here that will come as a surprise. But that doesn't mean it's a bad film. For a start (despite being made by a different director) it has the same look and feel of its two predecessors and most of the appropriate original cast members return. Special mention to Bill Nighy who steals every scene as the evil vampire 'Victor.' There's action, romance and plenty of mutated wolves mixing it with medieval vampires. If that's what you're looking for (and, if you like the other Underworld movies then you probably do) then this should tick all boxes.However, behind all the action and gore is a strong romantic story - your typical 'forbidden love' debacle between two clans, in some crazy way, almost like Romeo and Juliet. Despite the Underworld series all featuring this as a central theme, it continues the tradition of being 'Twilight' for the older generation (who definitely don't like their vampires with big hair and sparkly skin).Warning: this Underworld movie does NOT feature Kate Beckinsale (not unless you could the five seconds at the end). I've seen a fair few people moaning because it doesn't. You have been warned (although Rhona Mitra isn't that bad as a replacement in my opinion!).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting Religio-philosophical allegory.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Underworld Quadrilogy is an interesting row of films. The plot and the stories with sequels and prequels aren't all that bad, even though highly illogical. The writers could, though, have scored a few pointers in studying fairy-tales somewhat closer. What really makes this series of films interesting is the religio-philosophical and allegorical idea that lies behind. Now, I will not go deeper into this realm in this review, lest I open the door to a Dantean inferno that I am not willing to enter, nor let others enter into. Thus I will just leave it to others there. Maybe others are willing to pilpul the matter further, and deeper - and end up with some kind of final halakha at some later date in the future. As a final conclusion to this review, I will give the complete series of films an evaluation of 7. And add that most of that seven comes from a combination of good dramatization and equally good special effects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>dark story but the best entry in the franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Normally the last in the trilogy of the Underworld saga takes us back to the time Victor (Bill Nighy) reign his world and saves the baby Lucian (Michael Sheen). But Lucian as a lycan falls in love with the daughter of Victor Sonja (Rhona Mitra). Of course this can't happen and Lucian is punished for that particular fact. Victor looks toward Lucian as his son and keeps him alive. But Lucian wants Sonja to help him to free the slaves of the vampires, the lycans. Big love between the two of them but Victor doesn't want it to happen. From there on you will see what you saw in part 1 and 2 in the flashbacks. This is a prequel and explains all your questions.It's the darkest entry with an excellent score and of course Bill and Michael carry this flick. Rhona is a copy of Kate Beckinsale only to be seen at the end of Rise Of The Lycans. It should be so because we all know that Victor killed Selene's parents and saved her because she looked like Sonja. And it does.The effects are again excellent, maybe the only complain is the use of CGI for blood here and there. For me this was the strongest entry so far in the Underworld franchise.Gore 1/5 Nudity 1/5 Effects 4/5 Story 4/5 Comedy 0/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original 'Underworld' dropped you into a situation without really explaining anything. But I think they must have had the overall story worked out, because hints or marginal matters in one film become central in another.Very nice plotting, though each film also stands alone.This one has a proper medieval setting and quite a few surprises, even though you more or less know the end.Unlike the other films, the lycans and vampires are not operating in a social vacuum but as part of a violent society and a society in which slavery is seen as normal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I kind of thought this movie sucked. The plot was pretty bad. Lucian, whose half human and half wolf, is a slave of the head vampire, Viktor. He's also having an affair with Viktor's daughter, Sonja, which of course is forbidden. Then there was something about Lucian making a key to unlock his collar, how did he make a key to do that? And way, that is forbidden, so Viktor punishes him with beatings. Lucian and some other prisoners escape and come back to the castle to rescue the others and take Sonja with him.The special effects were not good. They were shown without much light, making it hard to even tell what was happening. The blood was so fake. And the transformations from human to wolf were not creative. And why didn't the werewolves fight the vampires as a werewolf instead of human form. And the vampires never transformed into anything or even use their powers. It was silly.FINAL VERDICT: Lousy story, I would skip it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unnecessary prequel(..was there anyone who was crying aloud for another film in the Underworld series?)has Lycan(..half-human/half-beast)Lucian(Michael Sheen), a loyal slave / blacksmith under the rule of aristocratic vampire race led by Viktor(Bill Nighy), revolting against his masters, motivating his brethren, in bondage as well, treated as animals, imprisoned and ready for freedom. Lucian is in love with Viktor's daughter, Sonja(Rhona Mitra)and vice versa, committing an affair behind his back when they can find a chance..Lucian has a means to reach her room by way of an access tunnel underneath his place of work. While Lucian and certain human werewolves have their humanity, there's a pure blood race of wolf-beasts which live in a huge cavern, picking off vampires and the pure human "nobels" who the bloodsuckers need for nourishment(.."grass they graze")on a well traveled road which leads to Viktor's castle. The humans question Viktor's abilities to keep them safe after a werewolf attack leaves many who accompanied them from their village dead(..the humans mine silver for the vampires). Lucian, after saving Sonja's life from a werewolf attack, is punished by Viktor for removing his collar(..a silver collar keeps the Lycans from turning into beast form)in order to keep her from perishing..it is established here that Lucian has the ability to control the beasts, their listening to his command. As is to be expected, Lucian and Sonja's affair will be discovered, Lucian will be placed in prison and face certain death, and the war between vampires and Lycans will be raged, the full blood beasts finally unleashed on the bloodsuckers in a violent finale.Forbidden love between two different races(..or families, think Romeo and Juliet) along with the rise of a browbeaten people against those who rule over them with an iron fist(Braveheart) are quite familiar themes and Underworld:Rise of the Lycans doesn't really tread any new ground regarding them. The film is edited so madly, and shot in such a dark and blue Gothic hue, the action sequences featuring the beasts attacking their enemy fail to generate the expected thrills..heavy dependence on CGI, which might explain why the filmmakers shoot the gory ultra-violence in such a way as to not call attention to how much the wolf-beasts look like monsters from a video game. The moon is giant and bright and shown quite often. Sheen gets a showy hero role, while Nighy fulfills his duties as a pompous vampire leader whose contempt for the Lycans evident in how he treats Lucian. Nighy seems to fashion his role in correlation with the kings in Europe, how the aristocracy frown upon those in a more unfortunate position, the Lycans merely peasants, cattle. Kevin Grevioux has a nice supporting role as a deep-voiced human slave who is turned into a Lycan, becoming Lucian's muscle, his lieutenant in their newly formed army. Mitra is cast appropriately as Sonja, resembling Kate Beckingsale quite a bit, her pouty lips and well defined figure ideal in a role that requires a certain type of sex appeal. The vampires wear blue eye contacts, their skin pale white, costumed as royals. Lucian is sweaty with plenty of chest hair, carrying a "wolf-like" appearance.As is often the case when dealing with prequels, it's hard to build suspense when one knows that the villain and hero neither die because both show up in the other movies in the series.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Recap: A prequel to the Underworld series that tell the tale of how the war between vampires and werewolves began. Sonia is the daughter of elder vampire Viktor, and an accomplished warrior in her own right. But unknown to her brethren she has done something that her clan will regard as a deadly sin. She has fallen in love with Lucian the lead Lycan, or werewolf. Lucian is also the key card that Viktor got to keep his Lycans slaves, but Lucians is not content with his life. He wants his freedom.Comments: Not really much to say about this. I, like most people, expected a dark medieval action about the fight between vampires and werewolves, and that is what it delivers. But I will say this, it is clearly not as good as the first in the series, but a step forward from the second. However, it is somewhat hard to compare them equally as they are set in vastly different time period.Rise of the Lycans do what it intends well. It is brutal, full of fighting and with blood flowing abundantly. It is pure entertainment, it never tries to be anything more and I think it is the right decision. Far too many movies has imploded on themselves when trying to do too much. Rise of the Lycans holds it together well. It delivers its 90 minutes of entertainment in a fast paced fighting packed style. Just sit back and enjoy.7/10</fullReview>

Rhona Mitra was great...but I must say, Michael Sheen did an outstanding job in this film. I hope to see more work from him. Bill Nighy does such a wonderful job of being the villain. The lighting was perfect...not so dark that you couldn't see the spray of blood that came with nearly every death. The special effects were also great. I, as a viewer, appreciate the quality of effects in this film. Even with great writing, acting, producing, etc...poor special effects can ruin a film.

I admit, I wasn't expecting much from the UNDERWORLD series third film, I liked the first two but wondered how far they could take the series, thankfully I am happy to report that this film is (arguably) the best of the three. The direction &amp; acting are really good, the atmosphere &amp; set design wonderful &amp; the special effects are very realistic with much action &amp; suspense. This film is definitely one of the best action horror movies to emerge in a while, the villains are really hateful &amp; the hero's are very likable. Anyone who saw &amp; loved the first two films should definitely see this movie, if it's the final one in the series, then its definitely closing the series on a high note!***1/2 stars</fullReview>

Rhona Mitra has a great performance as the daughter of the vampire lord falling in love with the werewolf slave in Michael Sheen. Bill Nighy is great as usual and the action sequences were top notch. Most prequels do not give you what you want and leave you somewhat confused and unsatisfied but Rise of the Lycans surely delivers.

		<shortDescription>Decent Installment in the series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the third installment in the Underworld franchise, though it is set as a prequel. It also appears that they have neatly sewn up the entire series, with little to no intention of adding any other stories. This picture was very well done, and for fans of the first film, an enjoyable and satisfying installment. The film makers give us a clearer picture of the origins of both the Vampires and Lycans in the world they created.Clearly the female lead was essentially a carbon copy of Kate Beckinsale's character in look, dialog, attitude, etc. It might have been a bit more interesting to have taken Sonja's character in a somewhat different direction, as we'd already gotten the rebellious vampire chick. Bill Nighy is great as always. Though his character is extremely unlikable in this film; ruthless, plotting and selfish. But that is in accordance with the rest of the series.As this film takes place before the invention of firearms, it was interesting to see the use of hand to hand combat and sword play for the fight sequences. Something we only got a bit of a taste of in the first two installments. And the action sequences were well done. Overall the movie was good, a must for Underworld fans. However, this is definitely much more of an action flick, than a vampire or werewolf movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fine Addition To The Vampire Genre- More Blood, More Medieval Action Than Before</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My best and simplest advice on watching this movie- make sure you have a full theater experience going for high action immersion experience.. and then.. WAIT for it.. the movie looks like a DUD at the beginning but then it takes off VERY impressively!!! I give this movie an extra point since it is contributing a fine movie to a genre that has rather strict rules of admission- A Vampire film.This movie kicks Twilight in the teeth and gets on with the brutal killing that is part of being a vampire. In this segment of the Underworld series we go back to the time of when the Vampires ruled from a castle guarded by werewolf slaves who can walk in the day. They are restrained by collars with silver spikes that would kill them instantly if they attempted to transform into werewolves.The vampires let the werewolves loose like dogs upon the townspeople of the surrounding areas in order to collect tithes for "protection" from the "menace". Without a leader to unite them, they are mindless animals, easy to divide and trick into performing your will- until.. Lucien shows up... then things get rather damn uncomfortable for our vampire leader on ALL levels!!! Drama, blood and gore forbidden love ensue!! Give this movie a chance to begin.. when I saw it at the beginning of the movie I was like booooring Romeo and Juliet who cares blah blah and you have English accents that you are overly stressing, this is weak.. and then the ACTION started and the PLOT started.. and I was like HELL YEAH!!! So- wait for it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Underworld: Rise of the Lycans is set in the Dark Ages centuries ago where Vampires are the dominant species, one such Vampire Viktor (Bill Nighy) the ruthless ruler of a kingdom which is coming under attack from Lycans, a race of Werewolves. Viktor has some Lycans as slaves &amp; one Lycan gives birth to a human baby, the baby grows up to become Lucien (Martin Sheen) who uniquely can control his ability to change from human to Lycan. Viktor decides to keep Lucien alive a create a whole new sub-species of Lycan that he can control for his own selfish ends, things turn complicated when Viktor's only daughter the beautiful Sonja (Rhona Mitra) &amp; Lucien fall in love &amp; Sonja becomes pregnant with Luciens child. Viktor is appalled &amp; sets out to prevent the Vampire Lycan hybrid from being born as Lucien himself leads a revolt against Vitor &amp; the Vampires as their one time slaves the Lycans fight back...Directed by Patrick Tatopoulos this was intended as a prequel to the successful action horror films Underworld (2003) &amp; Underworld: Evolution (2006) &amp; attempts to tell a lot of the back-story of the war between the Vampires &amp; Lycans &amp; how it all started, while I didn't think Underworld: Rise of the Lycans was terrible by any stretch of the imagination I didn't think it was overly spectacular &amp; in my opinion not as good as either of the previous Underworld films. The script tries to deal with continuity established by the previous films &amp; tries to remain faithful to the series, the character's of Sonja featured in the original Underworld (played by a different actress) while both Lucien &amp; Viktor appeared in both the previous Underworld films (played by actor's Martin Sheen &amp; Bill Nighy respectively in all three) &amp; the events that take place in Underworld: Rise of the Lycans is mentioned. As a stand alone film Underworld: Rise of the Lycans is plotted like a tragic love story with a hint of political thriller &amp; an against the odds uprising by an oppressed minority set in a medieval styled fantasy setting that features two of the silver screen most famous monsters, namely Vampires &amp; Werewolves. It's entertaining enough I suppose, the story is fine, the character's serve their purpose well enough &amp; there are some nice sequences here but the pace isn't that good with a fairly slow going first hour or so although the final twenty odd minute battle is pretty cool &amp; some of the intricate backstabbing sub-plots do get a little tiresome &amp; I think it relies a little bit too much on the viewer already having seen &amp; being familiar with the previous Underworld films. Fans of the series should enjoy it but for anyone else it's not essential viewing, I liked it &amp; it tells a decent enough story but I didn't love it.In keeping with the previous two Underworld films this has a nice style about it although the constant dark blue, grey &amp; black colour scheme does get a little repetitive after a while &amp; the whole film is maybe a tad too dark to look at. The film has great production design &amp; a lot of time &amp; effort was obviously spent in creating a lavish believable world for these Vampires &amp; Lycans to battle it out in. It's like a medieval fantasy based film like The Lord of the Rings with a touch of Tim Burton's dark Gothic style thrown in there, this certainly looks very nice. The CGI computer effects are generally very good as are the on-set make-up effects &amp; creature prosthetics. The gore is a little disappointing, there's a few slit throats, some blood splatter, a few Werewolves are cut up, some people are impaled on large harpoons &amp; a Vampire is burnt when exposed to sunlight but there's no stand-out moments. The fights &amp; action scenes are also a little bit disappointing, the cool Matrix inspired gun fights have been replaced with sword fights &amp; while you can tell what's going on there are a few moments when the quick editing &amp; shaky hand-held camera annoys &amp; again there's no real stand-out moments, it's just alright &amp; nothing more unlike the previous films which both had some great set-pieces. Also I have to say I really missed Kate Beckinsale in tight fitting PVC, the costumes here are nice but just not quite as cool.With a supposed budget of about $35,000,000 this has sleek polished production design &amp; the film looks very cinematic with a distinctly dark medieval Gothic style with lots of wide shots that give a real sense of scale &amp; scope including a particularly impressive CGI pan up Viktor's huge Gothic styled castle at the end. Filmed largely in Auckland in New Zealand. The acting is good from an impressive cast including flavour of the month Martin Sheen &amp; distinguished British actor Bill Nighy, Kate Beckinsale makes a cameo appearance at the end.Underworld: Rise of the Lycans is a perfectly entertaining medieval fantasy film but isn't as good as the original Underworld or anywhere near as good as the excellent Underworld: Evolution which is my favourite film from the series. Good but not great, worth a rent on DVD if nothing else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>lacks any memorable qualities that define it as its own work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For many followers of the Underworld series, another instalment without the inclusion of foxy lead star Kate Beckinsale in skin tight leather seems almost null, void and utterly redundant. Indeed, much of the former movies (which take place after the events of this one) drew much of their entertainment value from that very element. Beckinsdale sure was easy on the eyes, and yet she also had enough charisma to pull of the role adequately. So one must first and foremost applaud Rhona Mitra this time around for filling a similar, albeit extremely easy disgruntling role that attempts to form a sort of prequel to the Beckinsdale movies. As such, Rise of the Lycans does well; it establishes the Underworld universe with vigour, and does so without resorting to cheap exposition and tie-in material, and yet the whole affair feels exactly like a prequel usually does; redundant. So not only do we have redundancy in casting, but redundancy in storytelling. Rise of the Lycans will do well to somewhat please those who simply want more of Underworld's vampire story, but everyone else who just wanted to see more of every other element of the former movies would be best to stay away.A common problem with prequels is that they often come across as superfluous and without merit on their own accounts; they attempt to tack on a prologue of sorts that sets up the movies that came before it. In this vein, Rise of the Lycans consistently disappoints in its tepid storytelling which simply lacks scope or coherency in terms of its own structure. The result is a tale that feels natural to the series, but one that is also tedious to anyone that isn't compulsively obsessed with that very same series. Of course, being set before the previous films allows Rise of the Lycans to something of its own design, and there are moments that the feature convinces in its dark, morbid and Gothic design; the action is decent enough and performances from all involved are compelling in direct relation to the source material they are working with. It's just that, with a bumbling structure and pacing that feels irregular to the point where yawns are just as frequent as moments where you are enveloped in the action, the movie boils down to one of complete indifference; Rise of the Lycans can be entertaining, but it lacks any memorable qualities that define it as its own work.- A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Underworld was entertaining, evolution more of an action affair, and rise of the lycans, was AWESOME! I sat up in my chair several times, I remember thinking to myself this is a great movie, and while it has become my favorite flick of 2009 thus far, it evades being a masterpiece by a major setback. The story was pitch perfect for me. I loved Lucian and Sonya and felt their relationship elevated the stakes in the movie. I was also surprised at the grandeur of the movie. In an aristocratic era, the time period felt much more suited for the story. Plus, I will always take sword fights over guns, ALWAYS. I loved Rhona Mitra in this movie. I saw her in doomsday, and although I didn't like that movie, I saw something in her. I thought she was amazing in her role. Now, the biggest issue I have. I was so moved by the narrative of the story, but every time there was a fight scene, I cringed. They are horribly edited, too kinetic for my tastes. And seeing how this movie works as such: the characters interact with each other only until they are poised for a breaking point, and then when words aren't enough, they battle. Because of the momentum of the movie, the fighting scenes felt that they were going to be epic. Nope. If whoever helms Underworld 4 can marry the narrative of this movie, with innovative and CLEAR fighting scenes, that will be a great day. I'm still waiting for action director's to express these scenes with methods outside of quick cuts, odd moments of slow motion, and way to close camera angles. &gt;.&lt; Either way, I am buying this movie, and unlike the other two movies in the series, will watch it again and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I loved you more than anything ? Underworld: Rise of the Lycans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You need to remember, this thing would never be a real success because of the sheer non-necessity of it. This story is told effectively enough in Underworld as flashbacks and history, to actually need a feature length showing us it all again is just overkill. That said, though, I really enjoyed it. The tone remained, the aesthetic stayed true, but the Beckinsale factor was missed?no, not because of her looks, but actually her acting. Something about her lent a vulnerability to the character, a softness that showed a bit of humanity behind the vampiric power. With Rhona Mitra, you just get the hard-edged badass, leaving the reality of her falling for a Lycan all the more implausible.One must give credit to the series on a whole for staying relevant and true to itself. I think that if it became anything less, some sort of caricature being churned out by the Hollywood machine, none of the original talent would have bothered to return, no matter what kind of cash was thrown their way. Bill Nighy is the kind of guy that definitely doesn't need to be doing action films anymore. After reading interviews with him following the initial film, he complained about the sheer physicality of the role and the amount of training he had to experience. Yet here he is, six years later, still getting into the dungeon water with swords and wirework, completing the story that he began. And by his side is an actor who's star has risen to the A-list, Michael Sheen, bringing credibility to a genre film that usually doesn't deserve it, let alone contain it. The Lycan leader, Lucian, is the role that brought Sheen into America's consciousness and you have to think his friendship with the producers and his belief in the material got him to reprise the role.It is that credibility that makes the series so popular, though. Ever since the first film, billed as a horror, gore flick, surprised by being something of substance, the mythology has taken on a life of its own. Its subtle spin on the immortality yarn was fresh enough to intrigue and rooted in reality to be relevant. This installment may actually hurt because of its time period taking place centuries ago. The neat gadgets and garlic clove bullets are replaced with medieval armor and whips, swords and horses. However, it works if you have embraced the complete story at hand. We always knew that the feud began ages ago, these two races do live forever after all, so to see it play out does excite on some level. We were shown a taste of it in Underworld: Evolution, but here it becomes reality.The reason that fact is also a detriment leads us to Rhona Mitra. In my mind I always saw Sonja as this girl who had love and compassion in her heart. Someone who saw beyond the cold, cruelty of her father to realize what combining the bloodlines could do for the peaceful harmony of their races. I thought of someone like Beckinsale, a former human that still held a shred of morality in her body, a softness to see why Lucian would fall for her. What we get from Mitra, and it is what she does, is a pureblood vampire, born and raised to kill. She is so steely-eyed and stone-faced that while her brazen attitude with her father and need to protect her people works remarkably, the moments when she needs to tear down her shield ring false. I don't necessarily blame her as much as casting. The filmmakers saw that young men wanted to see a hot woman kicking butt and didn't realize the other layers Kate's Selene added to the overall tone of Underworld. As an action film she is perfect, but as a story of love and a future above prejudice and civil war, there is just something lacking.Michael Sheen then attempts to do it all himself, showing incredible range with just a silent look at a vampire guard abusing one of his kind. Grabbing his arm to stop the whip, his eyes show the seriousness with which he makes the transgression, but also the pleading warmth for this monster to show a little compassion and respect. You can only beat someone so much before they either can't work anymore or they wake up to the fact they are strong enough to stand their ground and fight. Sheen's Lucian tries so hard to force those feelings of revolt down in order to keep his affair with Sonja alive, but sometimes the master's lashings can be withstood only so long. His dynamic with Bill Nighy's remorseless?although he shows some weakness in abandoning his daughter?bureaucrat is felt. It becomes old school versus the new and a beginning to the long war yet to be forged against the two.Underworld: Rise of the Lycans is by no means crucial viewing for the series to make sense, but it also isn't something to completely dismiss. Showing what we knew fully adds a layer that may or may not effect how you view the other two installments afterwards. If nothing else, it answers some questions about how each character became whom they do. I'd almost recommend seeing it just to experience the origins of Raze. Kevin Grevioux is one of the series' creators and killed himself off in the first film only to be resurrected here in the past. His history is an intriguing one and probably the only surprise I had watching, unthinking that how he becomes Lucian's right-hand man could occur as it does. However, it makes perfect sense and actually creates a whole new level about the relationship between immortals and humans. It's just one more thread to bolster the mythology and add some depth to an already fleshed-out premise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rise of the Lycans...in MY opinion!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd have to give "Star Wars - Episode IV" credit for being the best prequel that I have ever seen. However, Rise of the Lycans is in my opinion, quite good as a prequel.It was a good movie, but it wasn't great...and it could have been. There should have been more background on the love affair between Sonja and Lucian. How/when did it begin? How long had it been going on? Why Lucian instead of the males in the vampire coven? Curious, indeed. I had hoped that this movie would give more background on Sonja...a crucial character regarding the "war"...instead I left the theater only knowing a snippet more about her than I did from the 1st 2 films. To me, her character just wasn't developed enough. Considering the time in which she lived, Sonja should have been more of a bad-ass than Selene...and she wasn't. It's a lot harder to wield a sword than a gun. And although she was pregnant and burned alive...I didn't feel very sorry for her when I should have. I think I'd have felt different if there was more about her to go on.Also, it would have been cool to see them (Sonja &amp; Lucian) have a discussion about the dangers of their affair being discovered...escape for a little while... enjoy happiness, THEN got captured. That really would have made you feel more sympathy for them and why the war began. Will someone please give the other vampires in the coven some backbone!! They're a bunch of nocturnal, bloodthirsty cowards!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Directed by budget FX minnow Patrick Tatopolous, the man who inflicted Emmerich's Godzilla ? the 9/11 of creature features, on an a world barely recovered from the actual terrorist atrocity, this is further proof, not that any more was needed, that not only do visual effects people make poor directors but that inexplicably, and for reasons no-one really understands, their film's are almost always marred by middling effects work. If that's counter-intuitive, the finished film surely is not, as it's just as derivative as you'd expect, though thankfully not as long.Tatopolous sets out his stall early and invites you to pick over the knocked off tat on display. This Underworld adventure, we soon learn, is going to be saturated in the bleakest blue and lovers of grain should cancel their social engagements for the weekend, there's enough grit on these atmos inducing tinted frames to soak up Rancor vomit. In mid-budgeted genre fare the level of grain is usually proportionate to the use of sub-standard CGI, possibly because the likes of the Greek Geek imagine it hides effects flaws. It doesn't, and there's some lousy pixelage here, but it hardly matters ? Rise of the Lycans, that's the hairy brigade to you, has a human special effect that computer power can't hope to match ? his name is Bill Nighy.He's the centre of the old story about an overprotective father from an aristocratic family who hates his beautiful and well heeled daughter's boyfriend, particularly as she's predictably opted for a bit of rough - yawn. He's a grubby, long haired, stubbled up bruiser from the underclass and no sooner has he preened his way into her affections with a bit of macho posturing (he impales a wearwolf through the head with a sword), she's positively agape, not to mention as hot as a solar flare. Toss in the spectre of a probable insemination as a consequence of covert coitus, add Daddy's well known snobbery, plus a temper that could char flesh and the stage is set for familial gubbins with a bit of stodgy teen-friendly mythology added to keep the metal heads awake.So you may hate the plot but what about Daddy Cruel himself, the blazen blue eyed Nighy? He's a vampiric dandy having a wonderful time, so much in fact that it's nearly infectious. Nearly. A lank with fangs, he's the instigator of a dialogue chewing contest that spreads to most of the cast, with inflections and emphasis' all over the spectrum. Sometimes it's as if all the laws of pronunciation have been abandoned, but if phonologists are apoplectic with rage at King Viktor's murder of the language, Nighy couldn't care less. He's gapes and twitches and swills syllables around his mouth like fine wine. Sometimes it's as if he's trying to stab the air with his lines and if you like that, you'll love the way his dialogue oscillates from olde world 'I know not' nonsense to the contemporary vernacular in less time than it takes for a werewolf to have it's head severed with a broadsword. Mad eye fans are also in for a treat.Chuck in the man with the world's deepest voice and Underworld: Rise of the Lycans is a very odd bag. Michael Sheen doesn't have much to do except look angry and kill things ? his girlfriend does less and everyone else is on screen to be mutilated, sliced or chased. "It's over" the baritone piped brick sh*t house tells Sheen at the end and the rug was well and truly ripped from beneath my feet when he replied "No?it's only just beginning." Not for me it isn't Michael, I couldn't take another minute.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was very excited to see this movie. I was convinced I would love it. That being said, I didn't expect it to be that good. I was pleasantly surprised, then, when I left the theater with that buzz I get from a really good movie. It was true to the Underworld Franchise (even though there were a couple continuity issues) with blood and gore and a good (if not great) story. The acting could have been better (true for almost every movie), but Michael Sheen and Bill Nighy were fantastic. I think this movie is better than Underworld: Evolution, but no where near as good as the original Underworld. Nevertheless, it was a wonderful third installment to the series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You'll see worse films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this film with more than a little anxiety worried because I had never watched one blue-hued second of Len Wiseman's mighty "Underworld" saga. Would I be confused as to why werewolves and vampires hate one another? (After the film, I'm still a little unclear on this matter.) Would I learn why Kate Beckinsale, after a string of indies and respectable period paces, became the go to girl for b-fantasy? And would I learn what the socially appropriate term for a wolfman is? If you're with one of them at a party or workplace do they prefer Lycan or Werewolf? I'd rather not anger a wolf-person and I abhor species-ism.None of these questions would be answered, but I was able to follow the film. The first two "Underworld" films--as far as I can gather--tell the story of the ongoing battle between werewolf and vampire. The latest installment is a prequel and tells the story of Vampire Lord Viktor and the beginning of his feud with his foster lycan Lucian. Set in the middle ages, it is a murky tale--the better to hide CGI flaws with--that purports to tell a tragic tale about an interspecies feud of which we are still feeling the impact to this day. Like Stephen King's "Wizards and Glass" entry in the Dark Tower series or the ill-advised Episodes 1-3, this film wants to be a tragic aside in an attempt to give added depth to an ongoing series. Unlike King and Lucas, "Rise of the Lycans" is mercifully brief.The film clips along at a brisk pace never pausing long enough for you to try and suss out the story details. We're essentially dealing with vampires versus werewolves. The direction is adequate and the creature effects--what you can see of them--are interesting. Character actor Bill Nighy, playing the evil vampire lord Viktor, chews scenery, wears blue contacts, and scowls through much of the proceedings. The vampires are ill-defined, seem kind of weak, and are nowhere near as fearsome as the Lycan. The storytelling, setting, and characters are all thin. These are stock characters in stock situations. The action is, as the ongoing trend, impressionistic rather than schematic. Displaying cool flips and decapitations is more important to the filmmakers than letting you follow the action at hand.You will certainly see worse movies this year. This one has the advantage of being blessedly short.</fullReview>

Bill Nighy was good with his role of Viktor. he is a very convincing actor and loses himself in his character. Rhona Mitra and Michael Sheen are good too. i guess the only down side is you already know whats going to happen in the end. but hey, thats the same with all prequels,but its always interesting how it happens.all in all a decent prequel in a decent franchise with some solid acting from a few of the actors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will admit... I did not have a lot of hope for this movie. I knew that it had the potential to be good, but I also know how "prequels" tend to be. I have to say that I was honestly impressed. It was 100 times more than I could have hoped for. I had seen Rhona Mitra (Sonja)in Nip/Tuck and I loved her in it. She did a better job in this movie. Michael Sheen (Lucian) is a very forceful actor. He takes roles seriously and he made me believe that everything that was happening to him actually happened. They tied the first movie in with this one very well. If you remember, in the first one we heard the tale of Sonja and how she fell in love with Lucian, a Lycon, and that this was against the coven. She was put to death while Lucian was chained and forced to watch. We did not know, however, the whole story. (which I will not tell you) The fighting scenes between the Lycons and the DeathDealers were very realistic. Very bloody. I liked the realism though. It did get to be a little overkill with the blood spraying on the walls though - they show that a few times. They should have just done it once and left it alone after that. Kevin Grevioux's (Raze) voice was just breathtaking. He has such a deep and commanding voice. Not many people know this but if you read his Bio - he came up with the concept for Underworld. He is very talented. All in all, I think that if you are an Underworld fan that you are going to be greatly surprised at how well the movie was done and how well the ending ties in with the first Underworld movie. Go see it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is bad. The plot is straightforward and action is crap.About the plot, everything happens exactly how you would have written it from what you already know from Underworld 1 and 2. Lycans were slaves defending the vampires and they rebelled because of 'main male character' (a lycan) and his love for the 'main feminine character' (a vampire). So they decide to leave the vampire but 'the bad guy' (chief of the vampire and father of 'main feminine character') decides against it, mainly due to political constraints. He does not like to kill them but prefer not to let them flew which was completely possible at some point since he tricked them at the last moment. If they had flown, he could just say "we failed to keep them". But no, he is the 'bad guy'. So she dies and 'main male character' is very angry and call all the werewolf to crush the vampires, which they do.About action, well, nothing interesting to be said. All is a bit overdone and classical. I would have liked a lycan vs vampire fight, but no this could be interesting...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well I saw this the first day it came out (yipee!), so I was pretty excited. As far as action movies go, I found Underworld 3 to be a very good one. First off, lets take a look at the 3g's that guys like me go to see a movie like this- Guns, Girls and Gore. Out of 5, the 'Guns' rating would be a 3. OK, so huge crossbows aren't guns, but they are pretty cool. And the smaller hand-held crossbows are also pretty nifty things. 'Girls', I would give this a 4. Rhona Mitra looks sexy in plate armour, believe me. Not to mention, there's also a bucket load of vampire chicks dressed in, um, quite revealing clothes. So yeh, U3 does this well. 'Gore', its Underworld, its full of it so a full 5/5.Of course there are other aspects. The effects are reasonable for a movie like this, although it would have been nicer to see a bit more realistic parts. Although, the werewolf transformations are impressive, and close ups of the beasties are actually quite realistic. On the other hand, there isn't much humour (although i'm sure the woman next to me giggled when a lycan got speared in the head...). Granted, making you laugh is not the aim of the trilogy, but still.Finally, its worth noting that this movie is a lot more plot driven than the other 2. There is a lot more emphasis on the lycans rather than the vampires, and character is built up more as well. I give this movie an 8/10. I preferred Evolution more, but this is a must see for horror fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A prequel with some bite......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Too many times, when genre franchises try to go back and tell an origin story, it fails. Not this go around. The tidbits we got in Underworld and Underworld: Evolution, are brought to further light with Rise of the Lycan and the result is a damn fine movie.Bill Nighy brings Victor to life wonderfully again. Michael Sheen is given a lot more here with Lucian and he delivers. Newcomer to the franchise, Rhona Mitra as Sonja is wonderful, she takes a character seen in quick flashback from the first film and brings her to life with toughness and grace. Kevin Grevioux returns as Raze, as does Steven Mackintosh as Tannis. Both are given substantially more to do this time and both are welcome familiar faces and characters. The only missing character was Kraven, a minor disappointment, but not one that tarnishes the movie.There isn't much to say here other than we get the full back-story of the forbidden love between Lucian and Sonja, which ultimately leads to the Lycans turning on their masters. Sheen and Mitra have a fantastic chemistry and anyone knowing their story is torn enjoying their time together on screen, but ultimately knowing the fatal outcome. The film's rise from slavery resonates with the social environment today.My only complaint with the movie is that at times, the quick cutting action and darkness cover a lot of the action, or better yet, hides it. Not sure if this was done so as to mask the CGI Lycans, at any rate, it is a slight complaint.Fans of Underworld will not be disappointed here. I hope that the film does well enough that we see further stories told, possibly picking back up with Selena and Michael now that the origin story has been fully told. Wiseman has hinted at that and it would be nice to see.</fullReview>

From the trailer it looked reasonable, but from past experiences watching sequels and especially prequels being made with different directors it didn't offer much hope.I must admit that Underworld Rise Of The Lycans is not a bad movie, for anyone who has seen underworld, then i'll just say that its a more in-depth telling of the flashbacks in underworld so don't be expecting a difficult plot to follow, in fact if you've seen underworld you pretty much know the whole storyline.Acting wise i have no complaints, all the cast fit their roles and perform well, Rhona Mitra is a decent actress and a good pick for these roles, i think we can expect a few more action movies with her as lead heroine, overall i give Underworld Rise Of The Lycans 6.5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underworld: Rise of a really good prequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The prequel will trace the origins of the centuries-old blood feud between the aristocratic vampires and their onetime slaves, the Lycans or werewolves. In the Dark Ages, a young Lycan named Lucian (Michael Sheen) emerges as a powerful leader who rallies the werewolves to rise up against Viktor (Nighy), the cruel vampire king who has enslaved them. Lucian is joined by his secret lover, Viktor's daughter Sonja (Mitra), in his battle against the Death Dealer army and his struggle for Lycan freedom.I really liked the first two Underworld films because they were original screenplays and Vampires &amp; Werewolves are my most favourite mythological characters. A prequel was a much better idea to the series instead of a third part because the only problem with the series was that their wasn't any explanation that why the Vampires and Werewolves are against each other and this movie does explains that. Underworld: Rise of the Lycans has a much better story-line than the first two movies were made so dark &amp; sinister that really did suit the mood for the film. Rhona Mitra takes over Kate Beckinsale as the female lead although she wasn't better or worse but she did a pretty good job and this is her best film to date. Other than the story the movie has enough action to keep you entertained and had really good Werewolf transformations if you liked the first two Underworld films then you are going to love Rise of the Lycans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kate Beckinsale was quite clearly the best thing the Underworld franchise had going for it. Making an Underworld movie without her was either very bold or very stupid. Happily, with Rise of the Lycans, that decision proved to be more bold than stupid. Yes, Beckinsale is missed. No, this movie is not as much fun as the first installment in the series. But there are enough good things here to make this movie a worthy addition to the saga. It may fall short of the original but it is at least on par with, probably even a touch better than, Evolution. And Evolution had Beckinsale in it so that's saying something!Beckinsale is not here because this is a prequel, her character of Selene has yet to enter the story. This movie takes us back to the origin of the Lycans, the werewolves who retain the ability to transform back into human form. Lucian, who we know so well from movie number one, is the first Lycan. And that's good news because that means Michael Sheen is back. In the first film, told from a vampire's point of view, Lucian was the bad guy. Here we see things through Lycan eyes, Lucian is the hero. And Sheen gives a very powerful performance, he is indeed an inspiring hero. But if we are meant to sympathize with the Lycans in this movie, and we clearly are, who's the bad guy? Welcome back vampire elder Viktor, played as in the first film by Bill Nighy. Viktor, as any fan of the saga knows, is quite a nasty piece of work. And Nighy plays the part with gleeful relish. This is one of the hammiest performances you'll ever see, laughably over-the-top. But for this kind of film it actually kind of works. We're talking about vampires and werewolves here, let's not take things too seriously.Sheen and Nighy draw most of the attention. The other key role goes to Rhona Mitra. She plays Viktor's daughter, Sonja, who is of course in a forbidden romance with Lucian. We know how that story will play itself out but it's interesting seeing the journey to that story's end. Mitra gives a solid performance, though certainly not as memorable as Sheen or Nighy. She's obviously meant to be this movie's Beckinsale and while not as great as Kate she holds her own. Even if we already know much of the story heading in this film still manages to entertain and spring a surprise or two along the way. In some ways though the film does disappoint. The scale of the thing seems rather small, almost entirely contained within the vampire fortress. The action is, after what we've seen in the first two films, overly familiar and repetitive. And oh so dark. Yes, vampire stories have to unfold at night but honestly this film is shot in such a dimly lit way it's often impossible to tell what's going on. And there is the sense that the movie ends just when it should be getting good. We see the rise of the Lycans, the start of the war we've heard so much about. And then it's over. There's so much more we already know about the story that we could have seen on screen. The movie could have gone further. We could have seen some more of that war. We could have seen that famous confrontation between Lucian and Kraven. And of course we could have seen Selene. This movie leaves a lot on the table. Though if the worst thing you can say about a movie is that it leaves you wanting more that's not so bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An awesome prequel to the superior Underworld movies!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Underworld: Rise of the Lycans (2009) is the prequel and an action , horror film and easily my third favorite movie of the Underworld series. There is way more story featured in this film than the other two combined. I really enjoyed the first Underworld movie, but the story was gone so fast by the outcome of the film. This is a great film, it really makes you think, and feel for both the Vampires and the Lycans. Michael Sheen shines as Lucian and his chemistry with Rhona Mitra (Sonja) is amazing. The director and the actors did a wonderful job turning what some could say was a weak plot into a wonderful, action packed yet tragic movie. It's got actual vampires in it along with actual werewolves/lycans! It rocks! The story works well and it's great to see some old cast from the original Underworld make their appearances. This movie is absolutely brilliant and awesome!What I love about this movie? I love that there is more story in the background and what started the whole fought between the vampires (Death Dealers) and werewolves (Lycans) , how Lucian was a slave and how defend the vampires even for a lycan and Viktor (Bill Nighy) betrayed him. He even sacrifice his own daughter because she fall in love with Lucian. I love the mythology and the origins about Lucian (Michael Sheen) are revealed. Rhona Mitra as Sonja, Viktor's daughter did an outstanding performance as Lucians love interest. Underworld: Rise Of The Lycans (2009) is the first movie in the Underworld series and the prequel of course to the Underworld franchise. In this movie, this movie basically follows the setup that eventually becomes the first two movies, but we get a little inside in to that all a swell. So basically the plot evolves around Viktor of course played by Billy Nighy in this movie who is the leader of the vampires they have taken slaves of course and the salve art of Lycans, kind a lead by Lucian (Michael Sheen) okay the guy from the first movie. So Lucian (Michael Sheen) has been the vampires basically trusted hand for awhile, he looked down for them, he protected them, but they still treat him like crap! To the point he and Sonja daughter of Viktor kind a breaks a little bit of rules Lucian, has him punished in a doorman jail, Lucian than decides to go throw a rebellion against Viktor of course! Also keep a hiding in the fact that Lucian and Sonja kind a head a thing going on from Viktor and until of course one them vampire henchman finds out it and try's to blackmail them before Viktor finds out about it.This movie is pretty good! It is pretty, pretty good, I actually kind a enjoy it a little bit more than Awakening because was the worst one in the franchise, so yea... I actually kind a enjoy It, I like the acting in this movie granted. Kate Beckinsale is in here as the narrator in the end of the movie of course already if you noticed it is been out since 2009. The girl that plays Sonja she does okay, the problem is she doesn't have that impact, that Selene has you know I didn't really feel an impact from her, she is just there to get the aspect the story down and basically dies that's about it! That's about it for her. Lucian however the guy who was in the first movie, but didn't had a very a lot to do in that movie, is actually the main focus here, he actually does a great job! It is good to see him again too, after all this years! Basically was like 7.years since the first film, so it was actually pretty good to see him again in this film. And again that big, bald black head dude is back again from the first movie, he is actually pretty good too! Now the effects it is 2009 now, some of the effects are still particular, but a little you can tell a CGI, some of the Lycans are CGI in this movie, which kind a sucks. But I can see why they have to be CGI, special for the ending of the movie I can understand, that part you couldn't have that many guys running around in prosthetic's so eventfully some of them have to be CGI! I am okay with that, it didn't do anything to hurt the story or anything like that it was just, it was need it, I have to say that part. Butt all of that it is not bad entry in to the Underworld franchise, it could have been a little better tough, so I am still sticking to my guns of the first two are the superior movies in the series so far, but this one is a close third so I am gonna give Ryse of lycans 10 because I love those 3.films and they are pretty good! I love the first two superior films this one is close as the third favorite film. I think director Patrick Tatopoulos did a great job close as Len Wiseman, but Len Wiseman still did a better job directing the first two movies. Underworld: Rise of the Lycans is a 2009 American action horror film directed by Patrick Tatopoulos. It is the third (chronologically, the first) installment and the prequel to the Underworld film series.8/10 Grade: A Studio: Screen Gems, Lakeshore Entertainment Starring: Michael Sheen, Bill Nighy, Rhona Mitra, Kevin Grevioux, Steven Mackintosh, Kate Beckinsale Director: Patrick Tatopoulos Producers: Len Wiseman, Tom Rosenberg, Gary Lucchesi, Skip Williamson Screenplay: Danny McBride, Dirk Blackman, Howard McCain Story: Len Wiseman, Robert Orr, Danny McBride Rated: R Running Time: 1 Hr. 32 Mins.

		<fullReview>This movie is not only the first of the Underworld series I have watched; it was pretty much the first I had heard of it. It was just me and a friend, two guys, drinking beers and chilling. In that scenario, the movie was pretty great.But as a movie, this is pretty poor. The sets and landscapes were good and the acting was actually believable. I kept looking at Lucien and thinking 'that can't be Michael Sheen...holy crap that's Michael Sheen!' But the characters of this movie existed to make the story move. They should be there simply as is, and the story forms from their development and I didn't get that sense from this movie. And I re-watched it and realised that we only cheered at the fight scenes because we were drunk. They aren't very good. It kinda reflects a tight budget as the special effects were used until swift motion was needed, at which point there were cuts...camera cuts. Anyway it felt like watching late 80s and early 90s sci-fi combatIn the end it comes down to whether or not you're in the right environment to watch the movie. If you're having a night to unwind with a few mates or something I'd recommend the movie. If you're a kid you'll enjoy it regardless (although the gore can get a bit graphic but if you can stomach it then fine) If you don't fit into those categories you're gambling</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beginning in the middle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are rumours that a fourth Underworld is going to happen. If so, than the third part, which is also a prequel, would be in the middle of the franchise. With prequels that succeed the original movies, you always ask yourself in what order should you watch the movies, so that it makes sense ...In this case, I guess it doesn't matter that much. The third Underworld movie isn't up to par with the other two. They had their obvious flaws too, but this one lacks a few things and it feels like a cash in. It seems like it's not going full throttle, which is a shame, because the actors sure could've used better material to work with.The story is OK, but it's nothing special. A nice movie, but Rhona Mitra couldn't fill the shoes of Beckinsale (yes she plays another character, I mean the void, that Kate B. left) ...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having recently watched all 3 Underworld films, this one is by far the best in my opinion. In HD it is simply awesome, the sound effects are awesome too.I usually shy away from Vampire/Werewolf films due to them usually being rubbish, however this one is done fantastically. This movie throws wave after wave of different emotion at you, which I have found incredibly rare in recent movies. The plot is also solid, with many twists that do keep you wondering just what is coming next. The casting is good, although it still makes me laugh that evil henchmen still have cockney accents in most Sci-fi/fantasy films.I recommend this movie to anyone. I only wish there was another Underworld coming soon as they really seem to be getting better with age.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie was not that bad on a scale of vampire/werewolf movies, but I think it was a rip in the fact that the DVD has what looks an awful lot like Kate Beckinsale on the cover, and as she is listed in the credits you would expect her to actually be in the movie for more than 18 seconds.I would have at least expected Kate to have a speaking part. Rhona Mitra is hot, but she isn't Kate, and Kate is one of the reasons I watched this movie. I just kept waiting for her to show up, while the whole time trying to figure out how they were going to somehow work her into the storyline. Well it seems they never did. A quick cameo without dialog is all we got, and the only reason they even bothered with that (because it adds nothing to the story) was to keep Kate Beckinsdale's name in the credits. It just seems deceptive. It is certainly not as good as the previous two movies of the series, but when is a third sequel ever as good? Underworld without Kate is about the same as a Predator without Arnold.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read the novelisation of this movie, straight after 'Evolution' and loved it. This was something else. It was dark, dangerous and sexy.Lucian the Lycan is born to the Vampires and kept as a slave, he falls for Sonja, daughter of lord Victor. But when Victor finds out, Lucian must fight for what he loves most.The film overall is shot beautifully and the action scenes are brilliantly done, with the werewolves special effects, it gets better the detail that goes into bringing these magnificent creatures alive.Michael Sheen who seems to be the number one actor right now shines as Lucian and Rhona is simply stunning as Sonja, while Bill Nighly is perfect as the menacing Viktor.Definitely the icing to a great trilogy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An extreme Shakespearean play with vampires and werewolves</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had no intention of seeing this movie what so ever. After I saw Underworld Evolution and was disappointed I felt this film didn't even deserve a minute of my time. But when I found out that it was prequel and it basically follows around the story of Lucian's past I decided to give it a shot and give it the benefit of the doubt. I was happy with what I got.The story follows around Lucian(Michael Sheen), the first lycan (a werewolf with the ability to change back into human form)he was born into slavery and was meant to serve Viktor (Bill Nighy) and the other aristocratic vampires. Viktor used Lucian's infectious blood to create the lycan clan so that they may guard them during the daylight hours while they sleep. To keep the lycans under control Viktor came up with the moon shackle, a collar placed around their necks with silver spikes along the inside to prevent them from transforming at will. Unbeknownst to Viktor, Lucian has been secretly having an affair with his daughter Sonja(Rhona Mitra); if they are discovered consequences would be fatal. One night Lucian tells Sonja that he plans to run away and asks her if she would come with him. Sonja warns him that if he were to run away he will be flayed possibly until death. Although Sonja doesn't want Lucian to leave out of fear for his life she sympathizes with him for wanting freedom and makes her decision to help him and the other lycans escape; promising Lucian she would join him later. Unfortunately things don't go exactly as planned.If you saw the first Underworld then you know how the story ends; but this movie definitely plays with your emotions throughout. you'll find yourself praying against what fate has in store for Sonja and Lucian's relationship. You know what will happen but you wont want it to. You're hoping that Lucian will get his freedom and your hoping that he and Sonja will escape together. You may even shed a tear or two towards the end.I must say I appreciated and sympathized with Sonja and Lucian waaaaaay more than I did for Selene and Michael in the other Underworld films. The relationship Sonja and Lucian had made Selene and Michael's relationship look like a booty call which is technically what it was. There's also talk about the bizarre sex scene; I didn't think it was as bad as some people may say, I honestly thought it was weirdly romantic it definitely beats the one in Evolution I tell you that much. I mean c'mon you cant expect vampires and werewolves to have sex like normal human beings can you? The Good: Bill Nighy, Michael Sheen, and Rhona Mitra all give superb and breathtaking performances.Everyone had good chemistry.I didn't even care that Kate Beckinsale wasn't in this.The Bad: My only complaint is that its short, I wanted so much more and I think it could've went on at least 30 or 40 more minutes. but considering what came out of an hour and thirty minutes it was still good to watch.Overall I recommend this movie completely if you like the idea of vampires and werewolves going against each other, if your a hopeless romantic, or if your just a fan of the Underworld franchise. Its definitely worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than I expected!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was a big fan of the first movie, and a bit less enthused by the second. So I wasn't quite sure what to expect of this prequel; I knew I probably shouldn't expect much. But what I got was really good. Instead of making up all sorts of new ideas, they really stuck to the story as it has been originally relayed in the first movie. Rise of the Lycans really does read like the true and consistent prequel to the first movie, thereby giving the first movie more substance and background, in so doing even improving it.I'm not actually a big fan of vampires and werewolves, but this franchise is my absolute favorite take on them. Maybe it's because we are shown how they have their own societies, made up of internal intrigues, rather than how they interact with hapless human beings who get caught in the middle (which is how it is almost always presented in other vampire and werewolf stories). There is no fetish about biting and blood-drinking here; we practically never see them be interested in humans. Instead the emphasis is on the main characters and their interaction and history. With such good actors to carry the roles, this is really something special, and something enjoyable, too.One of the ways in which this prequel really works is in the way Rhona Mitra and Kate Beckinsale resemble each other. It makes it immensely believable that Viktor became protective about Selene because she reminded him of his daughter Sonja.In general I think these movies establish a very cool universe that it would be very interesting to add more substance to in further movies or in other media. I will actually go so far at to say that this third installment was everything that the second movie wasn't, and so I will raise my rating of the original movie from an 8 to a 9, thanks to Rise of the Lycans, which complements the first movie by expanding its universe with all its integrity intact. Well done!9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No surprises</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Underworld 3: Rise of the Lycans" carries the inherent curse and blessing of a prequel. Take the best example: when watching Episodes I to III of Star Wars, we all know that Anakin Skywalker will be taken over by the dark side to become Darth Vader. No suspense or surprises there. On the other hand, with a good original story, the prequel is already half-made.The "Underworld" series starts with a good, intact plot:http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0320691/usercomments-311We have in fact already had a glimpse from "Underworld" (2003) some scenes in "Rise of the Lycans". What the prequel does is build on this simple premise, wisely refraining from trying anything fancy or convoluted. It labours to give the audience what they expect: a world of Gothic charm and fascination, check; well crafted action sequences, check; exciting special effect and big brawl scenes, check; Shakespearean-flavour love tragedy, check. Everything is done by the book. Without trying to be overly ambitious, this movie delivers a modest degree of satisfaction.In addition, it has something special going for it, with Michael Sheen taking up his earlier role of Lucian. But today, it is fun just looking behind the beard, gruff face for the elegant, subtle David Frost. If you look hard, you not only see it, but will be delightfully surprised by how well the gentle subtlety works behind the persona of the savage, howling Lycan leader. Bill Nighy continues to be a pleasure to watch whatever role he portrays ? the vampire chief Viktor, with all its intensity and power, is no exception. Ronda Mitra fulfills her job in playing Sonja but is of course no substitute for Kate Beckinsale who appears in a 5-second "flash forward" in the end. I am hoping that after this brief diversion into a prequel, the movie makers will continue with another sequel of Selene, the most beautiful vampire ever to grace the underworld.</fullReview>

If you remember in the first part of Underworld, we all have been impress by the force and power of Victor (the leader of the Vampire Clan), after so many years: Victor still shines like a dark knight in his role. I do trust we will see more of Bill Nighy in the future. Also if we miss Selene from the early 2 parts, don't worry: the story of Sonjia will surely captivate you all. We all know a few from the other 2 movies, but we don't actually know the plot and the actually events that took place. If I was skeptical about this 3th part, I have no doubt now ...

		<fullReview>First of all, I am a huge fan of vampire/lycanthrope lore. Underworld has stolen my heart from the first film. Plenty of action and suspense while tying in a love story without being cheesy. And Kate Beckinsale very well gave the sexy image that vampires are known for. The best thing about this series is that it took a different direction than most vampire/werewolf films. Rather than making them look like monsters preying on humans and terrorizing cities, you get taken inside the life of a species trying to survive and protect their own kind.Underworld 2 was even better than the first. It was packed with more action and much more suspenseful, in my opinion. But the third film definitely takes the cake! There seemed to be not as much action and gore as the second, but you are taken back in time to see exactly how and why it all started and will still be on the edge of your seat.If I would have anything negative to say about this film it would be the graphics. In some scenes it is quite obviously animated. The shifting of the lycans in the first two movies seemed to be much more realistic. But it did not deplete the film in any way! It was still amazing and I hope there will be more to come!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is inevitable that films in a series should have areas of similarity which are sometimes major, not least because you don't want to alienate your established audience by serving them up a second or third course which is completely out of keeping with the starter.And so the third instalment of the Underworld series carries no major surprises in terms of visual style and overall sensibilities, effects, violence etc. If you liked 1 and 2, you'll like this. The story is decent - it fills gaps in the ever expanding Underworld mythos and, in so doing, introduces us to Viktor's daughter Sonja, played by Rhona Mitra.Miss Mitra - perceived (by me) as a cut-price Lara Croft wannabe / would be, she is something of a revelation here. As well as being a compelling physical presence, the girl can act, too. I hope she gets offered roles beyond low-rent action heroines / token totty. She can do more.We knew Michael Sheen was good - this is a "pay the bills" gig, as it is for Bill Nighy. But both are absolutely fine.There were times when I yearned for colours other than blue and grey. Even the forest was grey. Surely there must be other colours somewhere (other than blood)?</fullReview>

I can't tell what's going on, it MUST be awesome action!!"So take some of that crappy action, write some weak plot that follows the base of the other story, but fails to provide anything interesting to commit to, make the film so dark and gritty that you need a bath afterward, take away any romantic, sexy, coolness factor from the vampires, make all the lead characters idiots (is Viktor really that dumb???? is Lucian really that poor a strategist? Why are the vampires using swords?????? Okay...the first two, contrary to many posts here, were very successful films. I personally enjoyed them for the cool factor of the action sequences, the werewolves/vampires and the way they were presented, the sexuality of Kate's character and her! The well integrated music, sounds, action and sheer fun of the movies. This version of it has NONE of that...in MY opinion. I might not be so angry if these new directors would get OFF their collective butts and stop with these useless action sequences. If you take those out, it's just a regular boring movie that you can't see anything, don't really care about the characters and has poor dialog...but has Rhona Mitra and Michael Sheen in. There. I said it.Now I have to go watch 1 and 2 to see if I can erase the memory of this from my mind. I'll also have to watch Doomsday (YES! I know...not so good either, but at least there is some daylight) just to get Rhona back on my good side.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Prequel lacks sufficient bite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've only seen one film in the 'Underworld' saga; that being the original. Nothing about it compelled me to want to see its sequels (or prequels, in this case). But I'm on this kick where I watch entire franchises in as close proximity to one another as my work schedule and my patience will allow. So after seeing Rhona Mitra in 'Doomsday' and enjoying her performance (if not quite the movie), I checked out her filmography, saw an Underworld flick and... well, here I am.Figured I'd do these chronologically, hoping that might help it all to make more sense as I go (yeah, right). What's here may be a prequel, but the set up of the characters and premise are so thin that it almost presupposes that you already know most of this stuff. Bad move. Anyway, this is all pretty dull stuff. It's sort of a Romeo and Juliet story, and that all works well enough, thanks mostly to a really strong performance by Michael Sheen. However, the "Rise" of said Lycans lacks the epic scope and scale to really sell it, and the action scenes are dull and poorly shot.I'm not sure advancing this tale to the age of automatic weapons is going to make it any better, but I've committed to this, so next stop, 21st century.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This whole series of UNDERWORLD films has been poor from the outset and RISE OF THE LYCANS, a prequel/origins story revealing the beginning of the age-old conflict between vampires and werewolves, doesn't change a thing. It's a cheap-looking and dull action movie packed with mindless CGI fight and an extremely dull colour palette.The best thing about the movie is Michael Sheen, who's really too good an actor to be appearing in these movies. Here, he isn't required to do much other than to look hunky, and any guy could have taken the part. The worst actor is Bill Nighy, who always seems to act like he's in a comedy, whatever genre he appears in.Kate Beckinsale doesn't appear in this one, and her replacement is the similar-looking Rhona Mitra. Mitra was acceptable in DOOMSDAY, but the limits of her acting skills are all too apparent here. The rest of the cast is forgettable.Technical qualities are poor, and the dull blue/grey colour scheme is intensely wearying. The direction is disappointing and the script worse. It seems as though the writers were going for some ROMEO &amp; JULIET-style tragic love story but the message is lost amid the endless CGI which is boring after about five minutes in. RISE OF THE LYCANS is the worst UNDERWORLD yet!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The weakest in this franchise so far...Maybe the next sequel will be better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is probably the weakest installment in this franchise so far, maybe it's because of the lack of budget. For a premise and the direction it was going where it takes place long before the start of the first "Underworld" movie. It really did need a bigger budget, because when it was finished it just wasn't satisfying and felt a lot was missing from the movie. Plus a lot of the parts of this story is already told in the flashback sequences in the first "Underworld" so just about everything was predictable from beginning to the end. And some crucial stuff aren't even explained how the vampire chick and the Lycan end up falling for each other. The cast was excellent though, Bill Nighy is once again excellent playing the head vampire victor. Rhona Mitra was a perfect choice to take the place of Kate Beckinsale as the female warrior protagonist vampire. The problem with this movie, is that it goes in a very generic direction where you already know what is going to happen next. It was slightly interesting knowing more about the werewolves perspective, since the previous installments was mostly focused on vampires. But overall this movie lacked in many areas, it just didn't seem or feel fully developed and even lazy at times. Hopefully the next sequel will be better although this isn't a amazing franchise or anything.5.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only for Underworld fans who don't mind the lack of Kate Beckinsale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the first Underworld film, there was a 30 second flashback that explained the origins of the vampire vs. werewolf feud. This prequel is a 92 minute long retelling of the story in that 30 second flashback. Unfortunately, the additional 91 and a half minutes does not contain a single new or interesting thing. It's just a ploddingly predictable, morally confused story with mediocre special effects and filmmakers who take this increasingly goofy franchise far too seriously.In some undefined little sinecure of medieval Europe, a coven of vampires led by Viktor (Bill Nighy) rules the countryside. They demand tribute and slaves from the human nobility under their thumb and are plagued by werewolves rampaging through the land, slaying human and vampire alike. There's also a second kind of werewolf called Lycans that are enslaved by the vampires for?well, none of the reasons given really make sense. Unlike regular werewolves that are only vicious animals, Lycans have human intelligence and can change from man to beast and back again. Lucian (Michael Sheen) was the first Lycan, born as some sort of a mutant. The vampires have used Lucian to create more Lycans that they can enslave for?again, reasons that don't particularly make sense.Anyway, Lucian and Viktor's daughter Sonja (Rhona Mitra) are secretly in love, Lucian leads his fellow Lycans in rebellion and if you remember the 30 second flashback from the first Underworld movie, you pretty much already know everything that happens in this film. I don't know how three listed writers and who knows how many others could have combined to create a script so devoid of even the slightest bit of originality or imagination, but they did it. I mean, Underworld: Rise of the Lycans makes the Star Wars prequels seem fresh and unpredictable.Beyond the deadening lack of surprise or inventiveness in the story, I'd have to say this movie is reasonably well performed and executed. It shares the same visual look as the first two Underworlds and while stunningly obvious, the script follows a basic logic. The performances are all acceptable, though Bill Nighy appears to think he's doing Shakespeare and Rhona Mitra is distractingly fish-lipped. There's plenty of action and many little nods toward the first two films. Basically, if you are a huge fan of those first two movies, you'll find this one passably entertaining.But if you just liked Underworld and maybe skipped Underworld: Evolution, there's no reason on Earth for you to bother watching Underworld: Rise of the Lycans. It's not that terrible. It's just terminally unnecessary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this with my dad when I went to go get a RedBox rental from Shaw's over the summer vacation and I have to say this movie was all over the place. It started of insanely fast, went slow, came out just right in the middle then sped itself up again and went back to slow. The scene when Sonja gets killed by her father is way too fast, comparing to Michael's visions in the first movie. I wasn't too disappointed but Len Wiseman should have directed this because this was just...as Victor would say "an abomination." I'm not saying it was terrible I'm just saying it was incredibly annoying and it was difficult to keep up with. One minute Sonja and Lucien are staring at each other the next time they're having non-nudity sex, what's with that? hat never happens. It's like High School, except the woman doesn't get killed she gets almost-killed by her father.If you like vampires, go see this movie. If you like a solid storyline with solid transitions, then don't bother. If you liked Twilight but hated the first two Underworld movies, then get help immediately.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It seems like the first two underworld movies even had better graphics to it. Its sad when a Hollywood movie that has a big budget doesn't look as realistic as a ps3 game. It really made me lose interest in it within the first 10-15 minutes, that and the acting was at times borderline bad to where it was uncomfortable to watch. The plot seemed dull, had no depth, you saw this movie twice already and most of all like a romance novelist got a hold of the movie and made their own version of what was a good franchise. I wouldn't put it that far off that after seeing this one and whole "boy loses girl boy wins girl back there's tragedy and a need for revenge everything works out in the end" predictable plot that this had, that the possibility of Stephanie Meyer writing the next movie seems pretty realistic. Don't watch the first two movies and then expect to see anything new or remotely exciting about the prequel, other than Rhona Mitra of course. :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What do you do if the star of your highly successful vampires versus werewolves movies decides that she doesn't want to do the third movie? If you had common sense, you would either write the character out, tell a story in the same universe but with different characters. Or, if you're money hungry and lazy, you could retell the background established in the first two movies via flashbacks and sell it on your unsuspecting fan base who are eagerly awaiting a new instalment. Make no mistake, there is nothing new in Rise of the Lycans - the entire plot is lifted directly from the first two Underworld's, although primarily the first film. Viktor's manipulations, his daughter falling for a Lycan, her execution before her lovers eyes. It's everything we have seen and been told before. As well as retelling the story from the first film it's poorly paced, badly acted and generally duller than watching paint dry. Any movie franchise needs to stay fresh, to bring something new and interesting. Rise of the Lycans is stale, there's nothing fresh or innovative here. It's only saving grace are some nicely put together fights and the period setting: it's refreshing to see an Underworld movie without guns for a change. But those two small points cannot rescue a truly awful film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It wasn't horrible. It wasn't great. The vampires just, well, aren't that strong. Or scary. Even with swords and armor, they just didn't have any power. They seemed lost and weak. At least in the first underworld, there was a sense of them still stalking humans but under siege from the werewolves. In the second one, it seemed like a super vamp chasing vampires, but still, no suspense or dread. This one was an attempt to make the werewolves good guys. Hey, does anyone know that werewolves are monsters? Does anyone remember that? Still the movie does a half decent job of making the werewolves sympathetic. I don't understand some of the rules of werewolves, though. Some give birth to human babies, some can't change to human at all. Some humans that change to werewolf form will not change as long as they have a collar on their neck. The moon has nothing to do with their transformation. Why did I give this a five? I don't know...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where Part II left off, it was a brand new relationship, a brand new world and a well-needed goodbye to the over-long "ancients" storyline. So, where do they go from there? Well, back in time, of course and of sadness. 'Underworld: Rise of the Lycans' (2/5 Stars) wasn't the worst period piece movies I've seen, even involving beasts and vampires, but it sure as Hades wasn't good. Unoriginal and too-long (EVEN at only 92 minutes, a series low) for such a simple slave revolt/forbidden love story. And I haven't even gotten to the worst part: Kate Beckinsale didn't want to return as the awesome Selene and yet the ever-annoying Bill Nighy as Viktor did. Of course he did, he needed a paycheck and of course she didn't, because she's got smarts. Only, spitting most of his lines like he's reading a Goosebumps's vampire story to kids isn't fun to watch for three movies in a row. At very least, I can say it wasn't as bad as I remembered it (SEE: Below) and at least they've finally improved on, though not completely there yet, the werewolf CGI.Originally, I saw this 2 years ago in 2 days and this is what I had to say then (Doesn't seem much has changed, except the ? star increase in rating. I must be lightening up?):Lycanheart(January 23, 2010) Just to watch something new and always being a fan of werewolves, er, I mean (bleah, hate the label) "lycans," I decided to give 'Underworld: Rise of the Lycans' a chance, even though not being a follower of the first two in the series. And this part three didn't change much. If anything, it worsened the chance of seeing a part IV or greater. I have heard this prequel added very little to the already revealed background story of the wolf-men and their abused treatment from the so-called vampires. They were right. Much like the more recent 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine,' extremely little insight was given to what we already knew: lycans were treated like slaves by the vampires that all-but manufactured them. Mercifully, it was only about 1? hours long, so it didn't take too long to get through the period piece age-old forbidden love story between a slaved lycan and a vampriess. Once again (and this was another reason I wasn't too keen on the previous installments) the CGI werewolves were so laughable and badly shot, I had to pause to stop laughing. Strange, I am a huge werewolf fan, but can barely name more than one or so werewolf movies worth watching. 'The Howling' (only part 1) was a classic. 'Wolf' with Jack Nicholson wasn't my idea of a "werewolf" story (i.e. man turning into hairy wolf/man who could stand) but it was still oodles better than this piece of crud. In 'Underworld 3' we get humorously over-the-top 'Braveheart'-type acting, dialogue that made me shudder and action straight out of a Sci-Fi Channel movie. Not recommended, even for die-hard 'Underworld' fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Other than it reassembled the characters from the first film and gave them more backstory. Essentially, Lucian the Lycan (werewolf) fell in love with Sonia the Vampire, a Romeo and Juliet scenario you know is going to end badly if you've seen the first movie. So with absolutely no suspense, we blunder forward with two hours of unremitting CGI and actors with little or no screen presence. All shot in that monotone color that the first movie had because nothing was shot in daylight.Worth your time.. probably not. In fact, the quality has gone down, even the CGI looks like it was done on the cheap, you don't buy for a minute that these are real werewolves.</fullReview>

While the visual effects are nice and well done, I just wish they could hold that damn camera straight so we can actually see what's going on.I guess the plot is a lycanthrope ("cleverly" shortened to "Lycan" to make it sound "cool") falls for a vampire chick and they go at it and then the vampire dad gets mad and he ties up the "Lycan" and he gets mad...it's just so simple but, in a way, hard to follow. And I have to wonder: where does this all take place? When does it all take place? How does this prequel follow the plot of it's two eventual sequels? This in itself is a mystery. That and the atrocious acting by Bill Nighy. They should have taken more time to write a well thought out script instead of rushing into it, hopefully drawing in all the teeny-bopping, wannabe-goth crowd (which it pretty much did). Give this a couple months and no one will even remember that there are three films in the Underworld series.3 stars for it's creature makeup and set design.

		<fullReview>The UW franchise, in my humble opinion, is one of the best in the modern vampire/werewolf genre, right up there with the first two Blade movies. The edge that Underworld has, though, is that it isn't just a hollow action flick. There is a great deal of mythology in the tales that any sci-fi fan can appreciate, and the movies actually center around that mythology, unlike Blade, where it is more of a background thing. It seemed like a good idea to do a prequel, but I wish that idea had been executed with the skill of the first two films. It was a decent movie, but the editing during the fighting and the costumes in this film were severely lacking as opposed to it's predecessors. Also, much of the history of the plot was left untold. Kraven's presence was sorely missed, as he plays a huge part in the mythology. Hopefully they will pick up their game and do a much better sequel to this one, continuing the history of the Vampyres and the Lycans. But overall, the movie really wasn't that bad. Michael Sheen and Bill Nighy really make it a good, not great, film</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I gave this movie a 9 because it should have been longer - if one would ask me, 2 movies would barely be enough for this story. I would love the story to start at the very beginning, at the start...the first bite...i feel it went through that chapter slightly to fast, but enough to make the story complete. The movie is set in the era a few hundred years before previous movies (Underworld 1 &amp; 2), at the start of it all (almost). In previous movies we were told this story very briefly - how the lycans and vampires lived together (or better said: how the lycans worked for the vampires) and how a love story, that wasn't meant to be, was to change that. The atmosphere of the movie is top notch! Dark, bloody, evil - perfect. The acting as good as the roles would allow, the bad guy (guys) easily hateable, and good guys quickly grow on you. And that is hard, considering the good guys are "the stuff of nightmares"! I still haven't made my mind up, if I even like the idea of lycans running around free and, well you know - feed on people :P The love story: it is beautiful, just a bit cold, believable and it does break you're heart in the end (reminds me of interracial couples and what they had to go through in the past century, actually the whole story could be about "black &amp; white in America") Amazinglly one can truly feel the rage of one particular lycan, the romeo of the story...and let's be honest - if someone took that girl away from me, I'd be furious as well :) Ah yes, the new lady vampires - Rhona Mitra is - well - at least as sexy, as bad ass, as cool as the one before (or after, how ever you like it). It would be a tough decision between the two...tho Rhona is slightly more Vampire looking and I guess that's a good thing here. I really can not imagine these movies without the main female roles...they give "the Underworld series" the sexiness and the appeal they have. Michael Sheen - as the Lucyan, well I really didn't like this guy before and I still think they should have gone with someone else...he doesn't look dangerous, sexy or any of sort...having said that I must admit, he does his job very well! The lovable wolf than :P Bill Nighy - Viktor - the bad guy: damn he's good, I really love to hate his character and he is the perfect actor for the job, I really do think so. As bad as always (worse actually), looks intimidating and powerful. Excellent! I also liked "the big black dude" - Kevin Grevioux! He has the charm, the looks and a very powerful appearance in the picture...I think he would make a great spin off movie - following his life as a lycan! I think he could pull it of. Special effects are good, mind you this movie is depending on those and they do not fail. So story, acting, chemistry is all there...what's missing for it to reach 10/10? Well, for starters the love scene could be a bit more primal, rough, animal like, it should be heard miles away and I would't mind them turning into their "true self's" in the midst of the passion...that would make this so much better...as the scene is not bad "per se", we are talking about a werewolf and a vampire making out and I would imagine that wouldn't look so innocent and acceptable as it was. Next, in my opinion there isn't enough vampire like stuff in the movie...no bites, no feeding,...i missed that...as it was, the vampires in the movie could have easily been human. All in all - i really liked the movie and this series has became one of my favorites!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like Star Wars episodes 1,2,and 3, Underworld:Rise of the Lycans tells the story of the beginning of the war between Vampires and Lycans. And you guessed it no Selene and no Michael, but you do get some returning characters Viktor(Bill Nighy), Lucian(Michael Sheen), and Raze(Kevin Grevioux). And there is a new addition Viktors daughter Sonja(Rhona Mitra).Now unlike the Star Wars prequels, which always kept coming up with something interesting every time. Underworld: Rise of the Lycans does not, it just quits half way, although it started out good, with giving Lucian a background story, and I liked the Romeo and Julliet love story between Lucian and Sonja. Then the film has nothing more to say after that. Although Michael Sheen and Rhona Mitra have wonderful chemistry, and are great, Bill Nighy this time as Viktor is not, he really overdoes it in his performance this time, and he also looks dead in the camera almost every time, that is creepy and annoying at the same time.And some action scenes where alright, but nothing spectacular, that will grab your interest. I like the first two Underworld films, but the prequel not so much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Werewolves and Lycans Show No Signs of Getting Along?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You may remember that Kate Beckinsale was featured even more prominently on the poster for Underworld 2 than she was for the original movie. Now, you might notice that the poster for the third installment in the series features Bill Nighy in full, cadaverous glory. So the reason Bill Nighy's character is not only featured so prominently on the movie's poster but is also alive again (you may remember that he was spectacularly dispatched in the first film) is because, as promised by the studios, this is "the prequel you've been waiting for." This is, of course, studio talk for "this movie will answer all your Underworld questions" and "no, Kate Beckinsale isn't in it." The rest of the cast, however, human and mechanical alike, are in their best form, so it's surprisingly easy not to miss her. I've watched both previous Underworld films within the last two days, and the close proximity of the two movies reminds me how amazingly similar they are in story and appearance, so I anticipated more of the same with part 3 and I was hardly disappointed. Fans of the series are sure to get a kick out of this obligatory extra movie, although it was hardly justified given the first two. Maybe I'm a callous, modern American movie-goer without the necessary attention span, but I just wasn't really feeling the need for another two hours about the war between the werewolves and lycans.At any rate, when it all started, the vampires were in control. They ruled the lands and the werewolves were their slaves, they were used to protect and build the vampire kingdom. The werewolves are unable to ever take human form because of the collars they are forced to wear around their necks, and Viktor holds the key. But since slave societies have an understandable tendency to eventually organize and revolt against their oppressors, it's safe to assume that Viktor's authority is soon to be challenged. Lucian, the Lycan leader that we met in the original film (the one that Viktor and everyone else didn't believe could possibly still be alive), although a slave himself, has been amassing a rebel Lycan army and, with the support of his true love Sonia (Viktor's vampire daughter), he declares a war against the vampires that will last for centuries.The movie has exactly the same look as the first two movies, although Beckinsale and her husband Les Wiseman, the director of the first two movies, have taken off, leaving directing duties to Patrick Tatopoulos, who had never directed a feature film before but who has an astonishing list of credits in the special effects and art departments.And his work shows, too. He knows how to create great horror creatures, and the movie takes place in an undisclosed but effective enough corner of the medieval world, where their uppity Shakespearean language doesn't look quite so out of place as in the previous two movies, when they were surrounded by cell phones and handguns and high technology. Unfortunately, the werewolves and vampires are still played by human actors, and the movie is unable to get past that ancient horror hurdle created by the fact that humans pulling their lips back to reveal fangs is simply not scary. It never has been and it never will be. And that colored contact lens thing, man. Don't even get me started on that. I can't shake the feeling that that was a goofy cliché back in the late 90's. Marilyn Manson stretched that as far as it would go but it's over now! Move on! In fact, hold on a second ? "ATTENTION MOVIE STUDIOS ? COLORED CONTACT LENSES IN ANY MOVIE, IN ANY GENRE, WILL NEVER EVER EVER LOOK LIKE ANYTHING OTHER THAN COLORED CONTACT LENSES. PLEASE MAKE A NOTE OF IT."OK, sorry, I just had to get that out. But on the other hand, at least they've stopped doing that thing where a vampire will hold a victim at arm's length, stretch their mouth open as wide as possible, and slowly move their distended jaws down to the exposed neck so the camera can get a sufficient shot of the fangs so that anyone who might have gotten up to get popcorn will make it back before the fangs are off screen. I can put up with a lot at the movies, but the next time I see THAT little trick I'm walking out of the theater. There is a curious debate raised by the fact that for a good portion of the film, Lucian carelessly blows away his own kind, the lycans, by rationalizing that they are simply mindless beasts, despite the fact that their behavior clearly displays intelligence. There is something to be said about that rationalization, but I don't care to go into it here because it will no doubt make my review prohibitively long and then no one will really care to read it anyway. Hopefully I'm no there already.Suffice it to say that Underworld 3 is a fan's film. There are films that are brilliant critical successes, there are films that are popular successes, and there are films that fail spectacularly in both arenas but remain genuinely loved by die-hard fans. It's not hard to see where Underworld 3 belongs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gaping holes in the whole story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There wasn't much thought put into the story line on many fronts. This is a good action movie but that's about it.- The movie states that the lycans were kept to protect the vampires during the day. Yet they are kept in cages and have collars on their necks. So they can't turn into their wolf form or do anything any other slave can't do. How does this protect the vampires during the day? Who are they protecting the vampires from? The uncontrollable lycans? The slaves in human form are nothing more than peasants.- My understanding is that vampires are immortals and don't age. Yet Sonya ages from child to adult. Do they just stop aging at a certain age? I understand that Viktor is old because he was turned (as explained in the second movie). But vampire babies age? Strange.- I didn't realize that vampires needed torches to see at night. Yet we see them carrying torches throughout the movie.- Silver was the only thing that was supposedly able to harm lycan. Yet wooden steaks fired from the huge crossbows kill the lycan too.These are just some of the things that show just a lack of thought put into the story telling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Actually... as boring and generic as it appears to be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Underworld: Rise of the Lycans was not something I had high on my radar, but there was one image that peaked my interest: Bill Nighy, one of the most curious and expressive and funny and spot-on dramatic character actors from Britain, sits on a throne with ice-blue contact lenses surrounded by darkness and looking as creepy as a vampire king can be. It's a terrific poster... and now having seen the movie, I wish it was just that. After two previous Underworld movies chronicling the battles and occasional love interests between Lycans (werewolves) and vampires (no other name used), the story goes backward to trace the rise of the Lycans (yes, the title says it all, don't it?) and how they escaped from vampire enslavement. Some may say it's as good, if not better, than the previous ones. I saw the first, barely remember it, skipped the second one, and now for the third it will likely fold back to the first one's recollection. This is boring as hell.How to make such a blunt statement? I was on board with the idea, and even wanted to stick with the storyline involving ::gasp:: a doomed relationship between a Lycan (Sheen) whose life was spared by the vampire king Viktor (Nighy) with the king's daughter Sonja (Mitra, Beckinsale's quasi-replacement). But it doesn't help matters that the script has dialog that is spoken with a kind of one-dimensional hammed-up quality that not even Nighy, an actor of skill even under pounds of CGI and makeup in Pirates of the Caribbean, can get out of, nor Sheen with his widening eyes and Christ-like demeanor in ::again gasp:: leading his fellow lycans and full-on werewolves to rise up against their tormentors and blue-blooded vampire lords.The director is a first-timer, which explains a good deal: Tatopoulis is a special effects man first and storyteller second, and even on the first count this isn't always very strong for the werewolves, with an exception here or there, look like crap with oil-slicked bodies and gnarling that goes by fast in the midst of quick cuts in action sequences. He does nothing to bring to the table anything in way of real originality as he's using the same flawed visual scheme in the previous films (white/blue tint of the color, lighting meant to not be dark but when light still looks washed-out) and just pumps up the volume of the gore to appease hardcore fans looking for something a little "extra" in their werewolf kills. In the meantime Nighy and Sheen are left in the actor wilderness, only one or two bits (i.e. Mitra and Sheen's sex-scene on the edge of the cliff) bring some unintentional chuckles, and by the time of writing these words mere hours after seeing the film I can't remember very much about it.Perhaps I wasn't totally the fan to see this, which is less-than-2D characters going through the motions in a prototypical love-n-rebellion saga. But I wanted to be, and wished it didn't turn out so... lame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only made because you can't sell a DVD trilogy until you have 3 movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I look forward to these movies sort of movies for some reason even though I am always 99% sure that I will be disappointed when I see them. You know, the mid budget movies with delusions of grandeur. It's also why I love sport and generally support the underdog, because when you have an overwhelming favourite that wins 90% of the time, nothing beats being there or at least watching your underdog team get up.So I watch these movies for that 10%, the miniscule chance that something set up to fail will tick all the boxes and turn into something legitimately great. But for every "The Matrix" there are 137 "Universal Soldiers".Underworld 3 is obviously the 3rd in a pretty bland series, but a series that has always had undeniable potential. Come on, Vampires Vs Werewolves with Kate Beckinsale in skintight leather, surely someone could make a kick ass movie from that premise?It turns out no. Underworld was OK but it only proved that Scott Speedman has the personality and charisma of a potato.Underworld 2 suffered the same fate despite a cool new beastie, but this time showed that even a sex scene with a hot chick (Beckinsale) could be boring (something "The Watchmen" replicated this year).Underworld 3 is actually a prequel, I guess because Beckinsale won enough Hottest Chickie awards to not have to spray paint on the shiny suit anymore, in this instance we have the poor man's Beckinsale Rhona Mitra, who has been a bit player in a few movies and apparently was most famous for a time for being the public face of Lara Croft.The story takes us to 20 years before the events in the first movie, and basically concerns how the Lycans decided that they'd had a gutful of being slaves and would rather run around like free range werewolves.Basically, Lucien is a kid born from a werewolf, and for whatever reason he fell into the Vampire's hands and they decided not to knock him on the head or bag him and throw him in the river, but keep him around as a sort of bodyguard (once he grows up).I'll get this wrong, but wild werewolves attack humans, Vampires protect the humans and use the Lycans as slave muscle. They keep the Lycans from transforming at inopportune moments by special collars - I'm not sure if they were dual purpose and killed fleas.Things get a little soapie when adult Lucien starts getting it on with Sonja, the daughter of head vampire Viktor, played by Bill Nighy who is the link to the other 2 films. I'm not giving anything away by saying the vampires find out about the tryst and are none too pleased with the situation, and then the rest of the movie deals with how they react.Given that if you've seen the first film you know who lives and who probably doesn't so I'm not gonna waste my time and recap further. Here are my random thoughts about the film though, as watching this gave me plenty of time to muse over stuff other than watching the film.Bill cracks me up throughout the movie as Viktor, he spits every word he says, Agent Smith style (I realize that's two Matrix references in one review, and I'm not even a big fan. In fact I think I've seen the original twice, and not for about 6 years). I also thought I kept hearing him mumble "Think of the paycheck" under his breath in between every sentence. I guess my point is he reeeeeaaallllly phoned this one in.This movie is the ultimate example of making a movie in order to say that you have made a movie, everything is technically proficient without being awesome. Oh, examples you say? (What an insolent and demanding pretend reader you are.)- The fights are technically cool but are obviously laced with CGI and wire-work, and you can almost hear the actors saying "Step: and pivot: and swing: and step: and roll: and slash", they are so mechanical they make most 60's karate movie fights look unplanned and spontaneous.- The actors are all appropriately good looking and for some reason look like they just stepped out of the shower, except those playing poor people who are appropriately scruffy, but without a speck of dirt or a scratch on them.- And lastly there are horses throughout the movie, and not a single horsie nugget on the roads!- Script wise they actually get someone at the end of the film to say "No, it's just the beginning." I can't remember a more clichéd and clumsy attempt at a seamless link to the next film.The new director of this one I think did a lot of homework by watching "300" about that many times, especially the early fights.Basically if you love the first two, you'll probably like this one. And if you really like the first two I shouldn't bag this movie, as it is highly likely that you might be the only suckers on this planet bored enough and with enough time to read crap like my website. (Also, a couple of my favourite movies are "Tremors" and "Coming to America", I don't think I am in a position to come off all highbrow.)This movie sucks though.Final Rating - 5.5 / 10. Only made as you can't sell a DVD trilogy if you only have 2 movies.If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dull And Pretentious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My mother forced me to watch this movie with her. She apparently will watch anything with a vampire counsel in it. I was bored throughout.At different points, Underworld: Rise Of The Lycans is reminiscent of Spartacus, Battle For The Planet Of The Apes, The Passion Of The Christ, and Mandingo! What it reminds me most of are those Italian sword and sandal pictures of the nineteen-sixties (not the good ones) that spend an inordinate amount of time showing Greek or Roman despots in robes talking and plotting incessantly while you wait impatiently for the muscle man hero and his lover, usually the despots daughter, to do something.This film was in desperate need of some color and suspense. The characters were pretty two-dimensional.The sets looked as if they were constructed entirely of pewter! I wonder how many Civil War Chess Sets were melted down to make this movie.All those wearing fishnet stockings on your arms and black lipstick, feel free to click NO.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a poor film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Please disregard all the previous favorable comments. I think they are completely misleading. In my view it is the weakest of the Underworld films, the cheapest, the shortest and with the worst direction. The action scenes are totally chopped up and edited in that infuriating manner that does not allow you to see what really is going on. I think the reason is laziness and a poor standard of the director. You see, when he edits those fighting scenes so much the viewers can see less and thus the artificiality and special effects are better hidden, he does not have to repeat the takes and prepare choreography with real actors for the days beforehand. The castle looks artificial and small, the story is predictable and simple, the duologue's laughable ("U were already free". "I cannot be free without you".) A disappointing prequel, not on a level of the two Underworld movies with Beckinsale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What RISE OF THE LYCANS is lacking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Can a prequel be good and creative when what happens in the end is already exposed in the original film? Maybe, but RISE OF THE LYCANS, prequel to UNDERWROLD, fails to deliver.The prequel just misses something---a good story.Depiction of the romance between the original Romeo &amp; Juliet of the Underworld universe is weak. The love between Sonja and Lucian should have been described a little bit more, revealing the detailed process of how they got to know and got along with each other ever since they were young, and how their love and care for each other grew over the years. Instead they are just seen to fall in love with each other overnight, which feels too rushed, without a good solid background story that can move people's hearts.In the end, what the audiences get is simply fighting, fighting, fighting, Lucian &amp; Sonja falling in love rapidly, the vampires torturing the lycans, the daughter getting executed, and there it is?fighting, fighting, fighting, the rise of the lycans! The End. Such a rushed story is simply unsatisfying, and the consequences disastrous&#xff0c;making Sonja such a stubborn and disobedient character! She insisted on going outside the walls over and over and "seeing the guests safely through the gates", and therefore she caused a series of troubles, for which she seemed unlovable (Lucian got involved and was about to be removed. Lucian escaped. Tragic love story happened, blah-blah-blah ). It all started because she enjoyed the freedom of moonlit rides in the forest and resented the dull political council? Well, then, burn in sunlight! "Big things have small beginnings" True.Maybe the film could have been a lot better? Why not make the film a bit longer instead of 92 minutes only? There's so much more to explore, so much more that can be told. If only another 20 minutes could be added to elaborate on the romance! To sum up, the film's details should be tweaked, and the whole story remains to be perfected. Sadly, they already made the film.</fullReview>

The second biggest question of the movie, of course, is whether Rhona Mitra can possibly replace Kate Beckinsale.

		<fullReview>Selene (Beckinsale) has nothing to do with this film and this really does go the prequel route to mixed results. This is all about a new character named Sonja who apparently existed before Selene. I wasn't into Sonja's character much. She was great to look at, but she wasn't all that to me. Michael Sheen adds a great dynamic to anything he's in, and here is no different. The end is full of action and suspense, but it's too little, too late by then. Like a lot of The Underworld films. It's murky and has too many moments where the pace begins to lag. This series seems to be praised among many, and I really don't get all the hype about it. I think it was risky to go a new route without Beckinsale, and in my opinion they failed with it. Final Thoughts: Didn't do much for me, but this series in general doesn't do much for me. 4.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Same old story line and obvious CGI</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nothing about the movie is new or interesting. It is a love story between CGI creatures and vampires. Dumb. CGI are Computer Generated Images that often are used to substitute for special effects, such as the great usage in Jurassic Park. The worst part of the movie is the very obvious CGI used extensively in the movie. The werewolves don't seem real. Instead, they look like high definition cartoons. There is plenty of boring dialog that had my finger ready to press fast forward several times. It may be worth watching once. I was able to rent it for $1 at a movie kiosk. The movie was so memorably forgettable that there was no danger of wasting any more money. Rent before buying is a good policy on most movies, especially new DVD releases. Then, you will not be disappointed when you pay full price for a new DVD, especially this overdone one, Underworld 3: Lycans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a really, reaaally terrible movie...I love vampire stories, I actually like the first two movies of Underworld. But this one is just in every sense disposable... I'm not even talking about acting, Sheen makes a great effort, and you would have to be crazy to say Bill Night's acting is nothing but competent. THe visual effects are fine enough, and the clothes/style in general is pretty cool. So, what's the bad thing about it? You might ask...Well, somehow, everything, the movie just doesn't work. The plot is painfully bad, and full of holes. The characters are superficial, and... just stupid to be honest.You can't really cheer for a vampire warrior, who is supposed to be awesome in every sense, and simple throws away every single secret in her heart to her father, whom she knows to be ignorant, small minded and just purely evil in every sense. The girl actually says she's pregnant! When he has a sword pointed to her stomach! And that the werewolf is the father! The creature he slaves and is trying to eliminate from earth! I mean... c'mon! I was actually glad when she died, stupid creature she was...And the thing goes on and on, all other characters besides the werewolf, the vampire daughter, and the vampire father are simply ignored... I can't even see how people could think good of this thing, but in general I don't recommend, at all... stick to the first two movies, and maybe the one coming out this year... and that would be good enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At some 92 minutes in length Underworld: Rise of the Lycans does not delve into great depth to continue the myth of the battle of the Lycans against the ruling classes that are the vampires. With this being a prequel to the Underworld franchise the characters are already familiar to us, and need no introduction, but bearing this in mind, we have what is technically a prologue to introduce the first two major films in this, to date, trilogy.Without a single sub-plot in sight, this is where Underworld: Rise of the Lycans fails to deliver, while great in the CGI aspect, this work here is simply too weak, regrettably too plain and sadly too uninventive in any major direction of plot, theme or development.The tone here is dark, bloody and violent, this is the world that we see as this love story untangles and the victims' roles are played out with aggression and pain. Once more, Michael Sheen (Lucian) plays the oppressed slave with vigour and spite, while his ladylove Rhona Mitra (Sonja) the defiant daughter of the ruling tooth fairy Bill Nighy (Viktor) hides her secret with brave determination.The main reason that this film works well visually rather than intellectually is that it is the fine eye of Patrick Tatopoulos, he is more than adequate to prove himself a fine artist; Special effects makeup designer, creature designer, makeup designer, production designer, visual consultant and illustrator etc are his forte. Underworld: Rise of the Lycans being his first film as moviemaker is not a bad start, ironically, maybe as a film that needs fewer introductions it may have been a simpler project to take on. What is astonishing is the fact that such a simple narrative has taken six writers' to deploy this script and plot into a banal piece of work.The major concern here is that this feels too much like a short Introduction that we see in books; short, basic and at times just pointless. It may have been appropriate if there had been a character driven third Underworld; instead, we are given a short glance of what is to come: visually intriguing but otherwise too short and disappointing concerning its literature.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underworld: Rise of the Lycans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had seen the first film and the sequel, and both film were pretty terrible, but I wasn't sure whether I had seen the third film already or not, it is a prequel to the predecessors, but I was surprised it was a little higher rating than the other two, both two out of five stars, this was three out of five. Basically this film shows the origins of the story to how the war between vampires and werewolves began, tracing back to centuries ago when vampire leader Viktor (Bill Nighy) spared the life of a werewolf born in a cell, who grows up in the clan as Lucian (Michael Sheen), but was a special kind of werewolf, because he was part of clan of half werewolf half human creatures called Lycans. It is when Lucian betrays his adoptive father by sleeping with his daughter Sonja (Ali G Indahouse's Rhona Mitra) and she announces her pregnancy with his child that the fight began, as well as the cruel vampire king using the Lycans as slaves. Lucian rallies together all the Lycan slaves to rebel and get revenge against their enemy, and big battles are fought throughout the lands, and of course this war continues all through the centuries into the modern world, and we are reminded of what part Selene (Kate Beckinsale) has to play in the tale (from the first film). I will be honest and say that I didn't pay the fullest attention to everything going on, that just shows how little I was probably interested in the first place. Also starring Steven Mackintosh as Tannis, Kevin Grevioux as Raze and Craig Parker as Sabas. The cast of good actors is fine, the special effects can't be complained about, and there are some relatively good action sequences, I can't really say I fully agree with the critics about the slightly higher rating, it is certainly better than the two previous films, but along with them it isn't one I'd necessarily watch again, an alright horror. Okay!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Vampires vs. Werewolves. What could be better than that? It appears everything else. This movie fails on so many levels it's hard to figure out what to start with. This prequel is set in the Middle Ages where you see star cross lovers start a rebellion. Werewolves are slaves to the vampires and their leader Lucian is having an affair with the head vampire's daughter Sonja. The head vampire finds out and Lucian rebels. That's about it. The special effects, which are important in movies like this, are terrible and obviously computer generated. The visual effects make it seem like this movie should have been a straight to DVD release instead of it hitting theaters. The only good part of this movie is Martin Sheen who plays Lucian. You can tell that his acting abilities are far superior then this type of movie. Playing David Frost in "Frost/Nixon" to playing Lucian in "Underworld" seems like a big stretch since one was nominated for Oscars and the other was one of the worst movies released in 2009. Regardless of the movie he still is an excellent actor but he should start making better career decisions and not sign on to do whatever is offered to him. This film also stars Rhona Mitra as Sonja, the daughter of the head vampire, who reminds you more of the Octomom then the film's last star Kate Beckinsale. She is definitely no Kate Beckinsale and seems to try to be just like her but obviously does a poor job in doing so. This movie makes the first two seem like masterpieces in comparison and that is a lot to say since they weren't gems either. The director of the first two, director Len Wiseman, must be horrified of what new director Patrick Tatopoulos did to his franchise. Underworld: Rise of the Lycans fails to deliver because it could have been so much more if given to the right person. The feature length time of this film is 92 minutes but it seemed twice that and it dragged forever. When you are waiting for a movie to end and it's taking an eternity to do so that is a bad sign of the quality of film you are watching. I remember now why I waited to rent this film instead of seeing it in theaters. 1 out of 5 starsCool factor: Martian Sheen being Badass as LucianLame Factor: The special effects are horrendous</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Quit while your ahead" is a phrase they never learn. Typical Hollywood sequel scenario: if the first film was only shocking, the second wasn't, expect the third to be the worst thing to hit the screen this year. Even worse are the prequels, events of which were already explained in detail. If you haven't seen to first two films you will not like this one. It's like starting to watch Lord of the rings or Star Wars with the last trilogy movie. So "stand alone" this film is not.Remember in the first movie about Lucians revenge? Remember the second about the long lost savage brother? Well if you saw those two 5 min moments and paste them together you would get? a 5 min prequel. But the creators ether thought these 5 min were vital historical events or just wanted to give a job to some actors, cast and crew and maybe make some money in the process. "I have a loot of money, I make movies for a living and I'm bored. What will I do? I know! I'll make a movie." So anyway you get this 5 min prequel and you stretch it for 90 min ? that's this movie. And you know what will happen to the main "immortal" characters, so there is little suspense. By the way, all the drama of the movie is in those 5 min. The only thing that made my eyebrow rise was mom killing in the begging of the movie. Sick. The rest was Braveheart remix. If you want a comedy, see Braveheart first then this movie.Now I'm going to rant a bit ? the movie put me in the mood. Who invented the concept of "vampire vs. werewolf" in the first place? It's older than I am and got old just as fast. And why do vampires look like Goth girls in heat, while werewolves look like psycho bears? Hiding bad films behind cleavage fails. Isn't it about time we got some sane slimmer werewolves with an upright posture? How can their unchangeable werewolves even breed if they rip everybody into shreds? And why with all their powers the vampires didn't rule the world? Blaa, blaa, blaa? What a waste.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...and not in a cool vampire way. Have just watched this awful film. unfortunately I'm not immortal so will not get this 2 hours back. This film sucks, but not blood, vampires seem to do nothing vampiry and the tease of seeing some beckensale tit is all but fleeting, the way she plays red rocket with the main character is just sad.Dear readers i hope you haven't paid money to see this film, for god sake download it if you must, but IMMEDIATELY delete it as its just a waste of RAM. eughkeughk eughk.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even worse than the first two movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All the "UnderWorld" films are terrible. "Underworld: Rise of the Lycans" was even worse than the first two movies.There is no single good thing about those dreadful movies, all about them suck. This movie?Is like a clone of "Van Helsing" (Also a bad movie) combined with "The Matrix" (An overrated movie") There wasn't any good thing about this movie. It was terrible from beginning to end. The story is bad. The characters are lame. The special effects were quite poor.The music was bad."Underworld:Rise of the Lycans" is an awful movie, without any single redeeming value.0/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There are no Vampires anymore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not a horror film by any means, it is a Dungeons and Dragons saga where the ruling family happen to be vampires instead of elves and the slaves might just as well be trolls instead of werewolves. The real problem is that there is nothing epic here, besides the CGI sets and Werewolves. No suspense, no terror and poor dialog. There is no room for vampires anymore, we are either treated to teenage posers or J R R Tolkien re-threads. So if your looking to be frightened (by anything except the price of admission) I suggest that you miss this very mediocre movie which even makes that 90210 Vampire flick "Twilight" more interesting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well Worth Missing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every 3 years (2003, 2006, 2009) we get another one of these. The good news is that they're getting progressively shorter (2:01, 1:46, 1:32). Yes, it's another vampires vs. werewolves flik, which I continue to lycan* to rats vs. cockroaches, with the audience invited to give a rip. No, and no thanks. Done almost entirely in blue-black ink, with a cast** badly in need of soap and shampoo, and sets that let us know why their descendants prefer life in sewers, this film is pitched squarely at people who paid good money to see the 1st 2 but cheats them out of Kate Beckinsale. Could it have been worse? Yeah, because it did have some interesting plot twists and an appeal to abolitionism, which earns it a couple of grudging points.???? *little pun there **including Michael Sheen, also currently appearing in Frost/Nixon, in a role as diametrically opposed as imaginable to his turn here as the progenitor of all lycanthropes; the guy can act, I'll give him that!</fullReview>
