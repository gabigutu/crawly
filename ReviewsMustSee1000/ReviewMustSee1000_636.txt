		<shortDescription>One of the best (and most underrated) comedies of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I review this film, I want to mention that I've seen it about ten times and have yet to stop laughing at any of the jokes. This is one of the best written and acted comedies that I've ever seen. The plot is airtight, and the jokes are perfectly timed and delivered. This is due in large part to the spectacular cast of the film. Jamie Lee Curtis, Johh Cleese, Michael Palin, and my personal favorite Kevin Kline as Otto the moronic ex-CIA agent who's too stupid to realize that he's stupid. The film centers around the four aforementioned actors who are involved in a bank robbery, and the conniving and backstabbing by each that takes place afterwards. A large portion of the comedic material in this film comes from the mixture, or more precisely clash, of British and American cultures. Kevin Kline's portrayal of Otto the red-blooded American with entirely too much ego and confidence is contrasted perfectly by John Cleese's reserved and in Otto's words "sexually repressed" English gentleman who is too scared to go out and live his life. Jamie Lee Curtis is also great as the title character who is determined to back-stab and cross anyone and everyone in order to get what she wants. Finally, there's Michael Palin as Ken the hit-man/animal lover/severe stutterer who must kill a key witness in order to protect his boss. If there are any funnier scenes than the ones where Ken must kill this witness, I haven't seen them. Palin is absolutely brilliant, easily one of the best comedic performances ever. The film is close to 2 hours long, but the plot is so clever and well structured that it's over before you know it. To me, that is one of the trademarks of a great film. You don't want this movie to end, and you're disappointed when it does. Do yourself a favor and watch A Fish Called Wanda and you will wonder why you haven't seen (or in many cases even heard of) this film before.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Funniest Movie Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the only film I ever paid to see two days in a row. I missed too much of it the first time because of my own hysterical snorting laughter.This is a work of comic genius. And, like any good film, the screenplay is at the heart of the belly laughs. Every character is given a detailed personality quirk or two, and then it is shamefully exploited for laugh after laugh. Note for example, John Cleese's speech to Jamie Lee Curtis about how awful it is to be British - the eternal fear of embarrassment. Moments later, he is caught buck naked in a marital tryst in some else's flat by the people to used to live in his own home. Also, the funny-offensive envelope is pushed to the limit when K-K-K-Ken (Michael Palin), the passionate animal lover inadvertently kills three innocent dogs in his attempt to murder an old woman who would otherwise be a prosecution witness. Now that's funny!Cleese's character, Archie Leach (Carey Grant's real name) is a likable buffoon of a lawyer, happy in his banal existence until he meets the sexy American, Wanda (Jamie Lee). I cannot even being to describe the plot beyond that point without doing it a grave disservice. It twists and dangles about in a world of double-cross and goldfish-eating for no other reason than to set up a joke.You cannot speak of this film without mention of Kevin Kline as Otto, a role that won him a richly-deserved Oscar. Otto is the ex-CIA "weapons man" who makes it his business to read philosophy but would be more at home with Curious George. An obsessive, self-indulgent, painfully stupid, violent, deceitful, gullible egomaniac, the character of Otto is amongst the best comedic performances ever delivered.The film's funniest scene takes place at Leach's (Cleese) house. In a scene that rivals anything that has ever hit the screen for laughs, the film and its scripts looks deep enough into itself to even give Cleese's dry-as-toast wife a laugh or two. Then, later on, this scene proves to be the set up for even more jokes. A Fish Called Wanda is pure comedy and every scene either provides a laugh or sets one up - it graciously does not waste our time trying to be moral or turning into a formula car-chase flick.My comments are choppy but so is this movie. If you see it and don't laugh, check your pulse. We have only been given a handful of good comedies in the last decade. A Fish Called Wanda is a treasure. **** out of ****.NOTE: TBS and some other TV networks show this film with the "offensive language" edited out. It kills the movie - if you can't hack the language, pass this one over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Kevin Kline Show!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brief and simple: this movie is terrific entertainment! With its uniquely eccentric characters and delightfully absurd storyline, 'A Fish Called Wanda" unquestionably is one of the funniest films ever made. The exhilarating screenplay works on so many level (a diamond heist gone wrong, Brits vs. Americans, romantic comedy...) and the top-notch cast obviously had an excellent time doing this film-job. There's not a dull moment throughout the entire movie and every sequence contains at least two or three hilarious moments. The humor is very over-the-top at times but, what the hell, it remains a joy to behold. The cast is nearly perfect with John Cleese, Michael Palin and Jamie Lee Curtis at their absolute best. Still, there's one actor who deserves extra praise for his role here and that's Kevin Kline. His hyperactive, deranged and extravagant character Otto is one of the most brilliant roles in comedy cinema ever! His moves, grimaces and monologues will make you fall off your seat laughing. Kline won an Oscar for his role and, everybody who has seen "A Fish Called Wanda" will agree on the fact that this was a well-deserved price.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the funniest films I have ever seen. The film is so well put together that time flew on by and I was sitting there wanting more. This movie is perfectly cast and well directed. There is no real style to the direction, but when you have a script like this all you need to do is point the camera and let it rip. I would like to point out that if you haven't seen this movie yet, check it out for Kevin Kline's performance alone. It is one of the best comedic performances you will ever witness. Great movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The Fish Called Wanda' and 'Some Like It Hot' are the two best comedies that I have ever seen. They're both very unique films and represent one complete story and manage at same to be devastatingly funny films. They don't need sequels because they are both 'perfect' in their own right. I have seen these films so many times but they always surprise me again and again when I find out how good they are.'The Fish Called Wanda' is not only well made but also happens to be funny. I call this movie 'the best', which may sound ironical, because Cleese and Palin have even been more funny as Pythons. Also ironical is that Jamie Lee Curtis says only one joke (Aristotle was not...) in the whole film. Kevin Kline is hysterically funny without one-liners and slap-sticks. It is the overall situation that makes the film complete. This is to say, that the film is not at all stuck up with gags but has absolutely right timing for every event. This feature makes the film even better than anything what Monty Python and the Marx Brothers have done. Or at least reaches the same level with them. This film proves that a movie can kill you in laughter using only everyday realism.A Masterpiece from John Cleese, who proves here that he can be funny even without Pythonity. He actually did the same with 'Fawlty Towers', but as a single film is this the very best. It just works.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely brilliant comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To make a comedy that can be lauded with the comment 'absolutely hilarious' isn't an easy thing to do. It's not so difficult, however, when you are one of the funniest men on god's green earth; and the extremely talented John Cleese has certainly managed to write a fine piece of comedy here. Teaming up with Monty Python buddy Michael Palin and Ealing studios director Charles Crichton, these talented comedians have managed to create a film that is most certainly one of the funniest; laugh per minute and lasting hilarity when it's over, movies ever made. The plot is taken straight from the classic Ealing comedy era (no wonder it works so well) and it follows four crooks that have stolen a bunch of jewels and now decide to double cross one another to take the loot solely for themselves. The plot thickens when the female of the bunch decides that the best way to get the loot would be to get close to a grassed-up co-conspirator's barrister; John Cleese.Aside from an inch-perfect screenplay, A Fish Called Wanda also benefits from a fine cast of actors to deliver it. John Cleese steals every scene he's in, as you might expect, and he more than justifies his reputation as one of, maybe even the, finest British comedy actor ever. He is joined by a talented pair of Americans; Kevin Kline and Jamie Lee Curtis, along with, as mentioned, his fellow Python Michael Palin. Kline is certainly one of the most underrated actors working today, and his comic timing in this movie is right on the money. Makes you wonder how much better he could have been used over the years. "Scream Queen" Jamie Lee Curtis also does well in the title role; and Michael Palin obviously knows his way round a comedy script. The jokes in the film come thick and fast, and I can't think of a single one that didn't work. It's the big gags that are the real stand out of the movie, though, and one in particular that sees Kevin Kline trying to explain to Cleese's wife what he's doing in their home is absolutely priceless. I nearly fell of my chair laughing. This film is a must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When four people team up for armed robbery then all try to keep the whole lot for themselves, hilarity follows. The humor in this film is clever and constant, never letting up for a minute. Watch especially for Kevin Kline's performance of Otto, it's one you'll remember for years to come. His attitude and his character suit him so well. His contrast with John Cleese's Archie Leach is phenomenal. A must see for all. Brilliant film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>something's fishy (in a good way)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Portraying a heist gone awry, "A Fish Called Wanda" goes all out in every way possible. Maybe the whole thing is little more than an excuse for a bunch of silly situations, but they have some great ones here. Whether it's John Cleese's dance, Kevin Kline's rips at England, Michael Palin's stuttering, or Jamie Lee Curtis's deadpan performance, they know how to do everything here. I can't describe how funny the movie is; you just have to see it. And you may very well die laughing - or if nothing else, you'll want to take a trip to England. Kevin Kline definitely deserved his Oscar. And of course, the cast teamed up again for the equally funny (maybe even better) "Fierce Creatures". This is a comedy classic in every way.Oh, and in case Kevin Kline is reading this: Happy birthday! You're my favorite actor!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent caper comedy with a perfect cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best, if not THE best, caper comedies of the modern era. The writing is very witty and at the same time sometimes turgid. The cast is absolutely perfect; Cleese makes a great subdued lawyer who wants to be a bad boy, Curtis is wonderful and just keeps you guessing (as perhaps her own character is guessing, as to what it is SHE wants), and Kline is perfectly annoying as the Nietzsche-quoting American. This movie has strong shades of "The Big Sleep" and other Howard Hawks comedies, even going so far as to name Cleese's character "Leach" in honor of Cary Grant. This film should appeal to those with no classic movie knowledge, but for those who have seen "To Catch a Thief" and other caper classics, this is even more of a treat. Romantic, funny, and slick. Also big ups to Michael Palin for another memorable supporting performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Film! Very Funny!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Fish Called Wanda is my favourite movie of all time and always will be. John Cleese has written this masterpiece very cleverly, his best best writing piece since Fawlty Towers. Kevin Kline, who won an Oscar for his role in the film, is excellent as the looppy, arm pit sniffing Otto, and is my favourite in the film. Michael Palin is also brilliant as the stuttering Ken. John Cleese, in a role rather different to Basil Fawlty and his Monty Python characters, plays the lawyer Archie Leach fantastically. But the movie is all around Jamie Lee Curtis' Wanda, who is an American thief, after diamonds that she, Otto, Ken and George (Tom Georgeson) stole. In order to get the diamonds, Wanda has a fling with just about everybody. The movie will leave you in suspense wondering who will get the diamonds. Along the way, there are plenty of funny lines and gags, especially from Kline. A top movie. Watch A Fish Called Wanda, don't skip it. A++++</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Fish Called Wanda (1988) is for comedy what Citizen Kane is for drama, Godfather Part 1 and 2 for gangster epics, and 2001: Space Odyssey for science fiction - it is one of the best in its genre. This is a work of the comic genius. It is always funny and never goes out of breath. The film is shining and sparkling like the diamonds of the highest quality - just like these that made four thieves who have pulled the heist of their lives to stop at nothing, including lies, deceit, backstabbing, and betrayal, in order to possess them. The film was made 22 years ago but time has nothing over A Fish Called Wanda. It has not gotten outdated or stalled and it never will. It is a marvel that can be enjoyed over and over. AFCW has become a cult favorite for my family. Many quotes and jokes from the comedy are the part of our everyday conversations, and we use them often even forgetting where they came from: "Disappointed!", "Don't call me stupid", "You have a beautiful speaking voice - when it works", "You British think you are so superior", "What was the part in the middle?", "Avoid the green ones. They're not ripe yet." "When you say "friendly", what are we talking about here? Cordial? Courteous? Supportive? What?" There are many more.A Fish Called Wanda is a real "treasure", and it is not just my opinion. The film which was a great success with the critics and the box offices when it was released has been included in all possible lists of the funniest movies and the best comedies. I looked them all up. :) My younger son, who lists AFCW as one of his favorite comedies, wrote the review about it and posted on this very site. He says in the end of his review: "The film is close to 2 hours long, but the plot is so clever and well-structured that it's over before you know it. To me, that is one of the trademarks of a great film. You don't want this movie to end, and you're disappointed when it does." I can add that as soon as it is over I want to watch it from the beginning and experience the magic of great movie making again. Very talented artists participated in making A Fish Called Wanda, and everything in the film turned out simply perfect. What makes the film truly funny all actors, including in the small cameos, created memorable characters because they had wonderfully constructed and written script to work with. John Cleese deserves the first mention for his excellent triple work as the co-writer of the Oscar nominated script/co-director and the star in the role of Archie Leach, the well-mannered English gentleman whose marriage seems to be in crisis, the defender of George, the leader of the diamonds thieves who keeps the "key" to the coveted loot to himself. Cleese's partner Python - Michael Palin is excellent as shy, stuttering hit-man Ken who is secretly in love with Wanda, tenderly loves animals but is ready to help an inconvenient witness to "meet with an accident", even if it is a very old lady with a weak heart. Loud, pushy and sexually liberated Americans are represented in the film by Wanda (always charming and illuminating the screen Jamie Lee Curtis) and her lover Otto, the former CIA operative, the expert in all kinds of weapons (Kevin Kline in the Oscar winning performance) whom she introduces as her brother. Wanda is as seductive and sexy as she is clever, unscrupulous, conniving and backstabbing. What she wants she sure will get. She is much cleverer than all men around her combined together but seems that in the end she might find the right man. And finally, Otto, "the ape who reads philosophy but does not understand it...the man so stupid that calling him stupid is insult to stupid people" who does not realize how vulgar and intellectually challenged he is. In the movie where there is no bad or boring performance at all, Kline is outstanding. A talented film and stage actor who has performed in many Shakespeare's plays, he would never have the role as brilliant and funny as Otto. You can write the volumes about A Fish Called Wanda but they will not explain its charm. One of the reasons that makes the film so funny is playing the differences or in this case, the conflicts and clashes between the different cultures, mentalities, ways of living, talking (even if the same language), behaving, presenting oneself. But it is just one of the reasons, there are many more. I only add that there is documented the known death of a viewer from laughing while watching A Fish Called Wanda. It happened in Denmark in 1989. The audiologist named Ole Bentz laughed so hard while watching the film that his heart rate was pounding between 250 and 500 beats per minute which led to the fatal heart attack. It is certainly a tragedy but come to think of it, a person died while being happy on the top of enjoyment. I envy such death. And finally, a famous Russian writer and poet of 19th century, Alexander Pushkin wrote in his play 'Mozart and Salieri', "If the sad and dark thoughts come to your mind, Just open a bottle of Champagne or Read again the "Marriage of Figaro." (Translation is mine)I just would add - or watch again "A Fish Called Wanda."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had forgotten just how good this film is. I turned on the TV tonight to BBC America - more in hope than expectation - and there it was, fortuitously just beginning. What followed was a wonderfully entertaining and nostalgic look at a movie I loved back then ? when I still lived in the UK ? and I love just as much now that I'm an exile in California. It's a quintessentially British film, but watching it the thought occurred to me yet again, that a good movie is a good movie, no matter what the culture that spawned it or how old it is, and A Fish called Wanda is now eighteen years old.I'd just got back from the cinema and watching All The King's Men, (see separate review) so my poor overwrought brain needed a rest without being rendered completely redundant. A Fish Called Wanda is a classic example of what I am beginning to call a Friday Night Movie, entertaining and amusing without being brain dead; something you can watch for some escapism after a tedious week at work, but without actually having your intelligence insulted.A Fish Called Wanda features the delicious Jaime Lee Curtis at her peak, (she then had the body I have always wanted to have and she probably still does ? I don't!), John Cleese doing what he does best, playing a repressed Englishman who cuts loose, Michael Palin as a stuttering, fishkeeping diamond robber and Kevin Cline as a slimeball. It was directed by Charles Crichton, who directed such classics of British cinema as The Lavender Hill Mob and The Titfield Thunderbolt, (whose very name evokes a by-gone age of innocence. Ahhhh!!! The good old days???) Charles Crichton was such a stalwart of British cinema that his IMDb listing seems to require extra bandwidth to do it justice.It is a simple story of crime gone wrong. Four characters team up to steal diamonds Otto (Cline), Wanda (Curtis), Ken (Palin) and George (Tom Georgeson). After the gang steal the diamonds, Otto and Wanda "shop" George to the police thinking they can make off with the loot, but distrustful George and Ken have already moved the loot somewhere safer, so Wanda must seduce George's lawyer Archie (Cleese) to ascertain where the diamonds are being stashed. This leads to some classic scenes, such as one in the London Docklands loft apartment, borrowed for an afternoon of seduction while the owner is supposedly away, where Archie is surprised naked by the family who have rented the property. I defy anyone not to crack up completely as he reaches for the family photo to cover his groin??.. Michael Palin is wonderful ? no, they are all wonderful, a great cast, why pick anyone out for special attention? The movie is well written, not a word is superfluous, well edited, very funny and well acted. Classy and a classic of the Cockney Crime Caper genre. Love it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A thundering disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a longtime fan of Fawlty Towers and Monty Python, I had high hopes for A Fish Called Wanda, but when I finally got the chance to watch it, I thought it was a great opportunity wasted. In fact, I'd say this film marked the point in Cleese's career when he stopped being indispensable and started being merely irritating, like the slightly senile uncle you loved as a kid but are now rather embarrassed to know. Kevin Kline is almost unbearably irritating, and his character makes no sense (is he really a CIA killer, and if so, would he really be such a dumbo?); Jamie Lee Curtis simply isn't as sexy or seductive as the film-makers want us to think she is, Michael Palin is wasted in a throwaway one-joke role and Cleese never gets much of a chance to do anything beyond looking bashful and doing his stock-in-trade 'testy posh bloke' schtick. Even worse, whereas Monty Python had once been bracing in its use of shock, the 'shock tactics' used here seem tame and even quaint. A very poor show all told, and a baffling runaway success, but then again, I'm firmly in the minority here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"A Fish Called Wanda", 1988 Directed by Charles Crichton Story by Charles Crichton and John Cleese Written by John Cleese* * * 1/2 Very GoodMost comedy films are forgettable and very mediocre. This one's an exception, because of lively paced direction, good writing and Kevin Klein's acting performance. the story concerns a trio of English criminals, the jewel heist and trying to later locate the stolen jewels, hidden after the theft and take care of witnesses to the crime.I saw this film when it was first released theatrically in 1988 and remembered it for being very funny. Kevin Klein won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, a rare win for a comedy film. Klein plays the character with much enthusiasm, imagination, style, technique (including accents), energy and good timing. The characters and situations are well written (creative and insightful) for a comedy film. Klein's performance is classic. John Cleese wrote a large variety of jokes, delivered almost non-stop, for pretty much everything in the story.I haven't seen this film for 22 years, the longest time until I saw a favorite film a second time. The title has always stayed in my mind, because it left an impression on me. Most comedies are forgettable. The film has some interesting, diverse characters, funny dialog and has an inspired comic energy that is engaging all the way through.In a nutshell: three strong reasons to like the film: direction, screenplay and Kevin Klein's acting performance. As a comedy, this one's a big favorite of mine, a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply Hilarious!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 2000, the readers of Total Film magazine voted 'A Fish Called Wanda' the 37th greatest comedy film of all time. In 2004 the same magazine named it the 41st greatest British film of all time. Does it deserve to be in that legendary list? The answer is, 'YES'! 'A Fish Called Wanda' is a delicious comedy, that has the most important thing a Film needs, A Perfect Screenplay, Written by Charles Crichton &amp; John Cleese. Some comedies are memorable due to their screenplay, direction, performances, editing... but this 1988 gem has everything working on it's advantage.This Comedy is about a jewel heist and its aftermath. It's a wafer-thin plot, with greed as it's Wallpaper. It opens well, but becomes a non-stop laugh riot as soon as the complications begin. The sequences between Cleese and Curtis, intruded by Kevin Kline, are simply hilarious! Even Michael Palin's plot, "The Dog Massacre" lives you in splits. And also the culmination, it's simply superb! Charles Crichton's direction is memorable, thanks to the screenplay, which he and Cleese have written themselves. Alan Hume's Cinematography is good. John Jympson's editing is crisp and spot-on.In the acting department, Cleese is outstanding! He plays his part too wonderfully. Kevin Kline is first-rate. Jamie Lee Curtis looks ravishing, and delivers a flawless performance. Michael Palin is hilarious! Tom Georgeson is plain average.On the whole, If you love COMEDY Films, then this is a MUST for you! Two Big, Hilarious, Thumbs Up!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the movies I wasn't allowed to watch as a kid. I've always been sceptical of this movie, thinking that those that gave it such high praise were just reflecting from nostalgia. I just watched it, and I can safely say that it is a classic comedy. Watching this movie makes you wonder why you put up with the lame excuses for comedies that are routinely shoved into our faces.I'm starting to think that movies that do not set out to prove a point or project some societal dilemma into the minds of the viewer are the best type of movies. Because they are pure entertainment and are free in their expression.There are very few movies that I have found funnier than this one, and most of those few are just funny because they are plain stupid. This is a perfect example of how to make a comedy.It is amazing how the director not only allows us to identify with each character (and there are many!) but "tricks" us into empathising with and cheering on the lead characters, who are all morally bankrupt. As such, it is escapism at its finest.I'll have to watch this again, but it may just take first place over my currently favourite comedy, "Trading Places."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After robbing millions worth of diamonds, the robbers try to double-cross each other in this hilarious comedy. The cast has terrific chemistry. Curtis, looking very sexy, seduces the lawyer of the imprisoned gang member who has hidden the loot. Cleese, who co-wrote the clever script, plays the lawyer, Archie Leach (Cary Grant's real name). Palin is perfect as a stuttering animal lover who keeps a fish called Wanda. Kline steals the film in his Oscar-winning role of a moronic, ugly American who insults the Brits and makes fun of Palin's stuttering. Although somewhat long for a comedy, veteran director Chrichton expertly manages the multiple plot lines, never letting it drag.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those comedies that literally have you bent over in laughter. What has become of comedies? I cannot believe people find Will Ferrell and Jim Carrey funny. I just do not get these guys, their "humor" and the ninnies who go see their films--and I have an excellent sense of humor.I will not re-hash the plot, but like to instead delve into the interesting nuances, especially Kevin Kline's performance. Was there ever a funnier performance in all of film than Kline's moronic assassin who reads Nietzche but is a Buddhist? I love at the beginning of the film, when he declares to his accomplices "England is a fine country!" and then quickly degenerates as the film progresses as a Brit-loathing Yank ("...the filth of the planet!")I've always thought that, for a serious actor like Kline, it's harder to play a comedic role than a serious one. His facial expressions are reasons enough to give him the Oscar, which he deservedly won. It was nice to see the Academy awarding a rare comedic role.There are so many funny scenes in this film, but one of the best for me was when Otto caught Archie robbing his own house, and then finally apologized to him (while Archie was unconscious, of course). Another great scene occurred when Otto was caught by Archie's wife Wendy in their house, and then tries to explain that he's in the CIA. Absolutely hilarious! Especially when Wendy, the perfectionist, uptight Brit can remember Otto's false name, Mr. Man-fred-jin-sin-jin.Michael Palin was a scream as the dog-loving thief with the worst stutter you ever heard! The scenes with Palin and Kline and between Kline and Cleese were the best in the film for me.But I suppose that without the script, none of this magic would have occurred. So I must praise the comic genius of John Cleese, whose classic "Fawlty Towers" is one of my favorites of all time.This is a great comedy to cheer you up when you're feeling blue, about the relationship between Yanks and our British cousins across the pond.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The perfect mix of British and American comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie knows to find the perfect balance between British and American comedy.Both the British and American actors are working excellent together and are a great mix. Both act in their own styles with their own sense of humor. It makes the movie excellent to watch for both the fans of the British humor and the more 'forced' American comedy.The story is really great, especially for a comedy which often just relies on its jokes and comical situations. Sure, "A Fish Called Wanda" also has got its weak moments, such as the whole side-plot with Ken Pile trying to kill the old lady. Yes, it's funny in a comical way but it doesn't really blend in with the rest of the movie.Another thing that distinct this movie from other comedies is the wonderful cast. All of us of course already know John Cleese's comical talent but it really is Kevin Kline that steals the show. The best acting performance I have ever seen in a comedy! He really, really deserved his Oscar for this movie.Hilarious comedy, watchable and recommendable for both the fans of British and American comedies.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is it really that funny?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's my understanding that A Fish Called Wanda is often regarded as one of the funniest films of all time. However, after watching it I'm perplexed as to why it's quite so highly regarded as to me it was barely funny at best.There isn't much wrong with the basic idea behind the film and the idea of the protagonists double-crossing each other in an attempt to get the stolen loot certainly holds a lot of promise, but sadly this was just a really big missed opportunity.For a start, the characters aren't very well-written and sadly the gags are very one- note and repetitive. Michael Palin's character Ken Pile has a stutter and that's about it - it's mildly amusing at first, but when that's the only funny thing about his character it wears thin very quickly. I'm also surprised that Kevin Kline won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar. Really? Perhaps he should have won the award for Best Overacting Actor. God was he irritating in this film - he shouted all the time, randomly spoke in a stupid Italian accent for no apparent reason, and he was just generally annoying. Later in the film we see Pile trying to take out a witness to the robbery, but every time he tries to kill her he ends up killing her dogs - it wasn't that funny the first time, but to have this as the only running gag shows a real lack of imagination and I must admit that this is very lazy and disappointing (and as one of the writers Cleese must burden some of the responsibility for some of its failings).The only moderately interesting aspect of the story was the relationship between Wanda and Leach. Leach is a believable character - a middle-class man stuck in a loveless marriage who merely wants a bit of excitement in his life. Leach is quite a likable guy &amp; Cleese's dead pan expressions and excellent comic timing do help to keep the film mildly tolerable. It's a shame that the material here is thin and largely unfunny. However, Cleese's and Curtis' acting are the best things about this film and their scenes together are easily the best in the film.However, the final nail in the coffin was the ending which I found to be utterly ridiculous and totally unbelievable. A Fish Called Wanda is a film that seems to be loved by the masses, but it's appeal is something of a mystery to me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A comedy classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can I say about A Fish Called Wanda that hasn't been said already. Not a lot seemingly, everything has been said so well about how good this film is. A Fish Called Wanda epitomises the term comedy classic in every way. It is brilliantly written, uproariously funny and goes along at a pace as fast as the crack of a whip. The film looks great too, with the cinematography skillful and striking. The story is wonderfully constructed with seldom a dull moment, while the acting is superb. John Cleese is sensational in one of his best roles, while Kevin Kline is just as skilled at delivering the comedy and Jamie Lee Curtis is just a treasure. Overall, if you want a fast-paced, hilarious and original film look no further than this jewel. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely funny heist farce</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of only two films I've ever been incapacitated by laughter watching. The basic premise is the predictable double-crossing that ensues after a diamond heist into which the odd-guy, Cleese's barrister, is dragged by the schemiest of them, Jamie Lee Curtis's Wanda.Really the movie serves as a series of tight sketches in which the individuals can extemporise and includes a steamroller sequence that Mike Myers borrowed for the second of his Austin Powers films. I was shocked at what a risqué film it is - there's a great deal of sex, or at least the promise of it. In retrospect this strikes me as a high watermark - and watershed - of the diminishing legacy of the British 70s sex comedy. It'd never work without its carefully prepared script (Cleese's own) and purposeful direction though. Try not to drink while viewing.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>tired farce, more busy than funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ex-Monty Python ringleader John Cleese co-wrote the screenplay for this brisk, knockabout trans-Atlantic caper, but for all its dizzy action the script never unleashes the full force of his iconoclastic wit. There's a streak of pure Python cruelty to the humor (the biggest laughs come at the expense of three very unfortunate dogs), but most of the comedy revolves around old, familiar bedroom farce conventions, with Cleese himself playing a respected, upstanding barrister doing his frantic best to avoid being compromised by femme-fatale con artist/jewel thief Jamie Lee Curtis. The film pokes broad fun at English and American attitudes, but from a too narrow perspective. The scream-and-shout school of comedy never was the best method for observing people make fools of themselves, and jealous boyfriend Kevin Kline's exaggerated crass American act is, in particular, more irritating than funny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent! One of John Cleese's BEST</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Excellent! Simply Excellent! John Cleese is the Master of comedy. This is the best British Comedy since "Life Of Brian" (also starring John Cleese). John wrote this screenplay perfectly, honestly, no one could have wrote it better. With a great cast, script, story, good music, good jokes, great humor and a tromendousley funny romantic story, this is one film you won't want to miss. Personally, my favourite character would have to be none other that Otto (Kevin Kline), the half-witted, half-crazed, non-merciful psycopath. This film put Kevin Kline right on the map and one him an Oscar. This film is a true landmark in British comedy. Stop watching whatever you are watching now and go rent out this movie, you won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a big Monty Python fan, and I generally like the actors in this movie. But it left me flat. There's a few good gags, sure, and Kline is intense enough to make his character watchable, but I had a hard time finding things to like. I really wanted to like this movie because a lot of people that I know think it's a scream. I just can't see what all the fuss is about.The humor might have been better done if there wasn't so much directorial emphasis on it. Usually, the best thing about John Cleese is that his humor sneaks up on you without warning. Here, the jokes are telegraphed and the silliness seems planned. What a letdown.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comedic writing, acting and directing elevated to British Knighthood level...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(And if the title sounds pompous, keep in mind the film was nominated in these three categories, and won for Acting).First, there's a look of tense shock followed by disbelief, just like after bad news, then it's like an invisible brush drawing an ecstatic smile while the eyes fly till the seventh sky. Then the eyes get closer one another and form with the mouth a weird grimace, like turned on by some aphrodisiac fragrances, then the eyes are closed and the lips disappear under a bushy moustache, in order to capture the elation of the moment and make it as long as possible. Finally, a goofy animated-like grin is like telling us "you know what? I'm happy"' In case you didn't get it, this is Kevin Kline having his orgasm after the frenetic love scene with Wanda, a moment that lasts only 10 seconds but on the field of comedy, is like an eternity? one that lets time to meditate on the greatness of "A Fish Called Wanda". Kevin Kline would win an Oscar for his performance as Otto West, the egomaniac lover who uses his reading of philosophical books as alibis against the 'stupid' word, but his actions constantly beg for such an epithet. Kline's performance is the highlight of the movie, which is saying a lot, when you consider the cast.The film opens with a jewel heist followed by an interesting game of double crossing and triple crossing. George, the mastermind and seemingly Wanda's lover, moves the jewels, a good precaution, because he didn't know Otto just gave him to the Police. When Otto finds out there's no loot in the agreed location, he's "disappointed", ignoring that Wanda was just about to knock him out. George risks the prison as he's also the only one to be identified by an old lady who saw him after the heist; he gives Ken the key of the safe containing the loot, and asks him to kill the eyewitness. Wanda sees Ken hiding the key, so all she needs is to know where the jewels are, and this is information only Archie, George's lawyer, can get.If that sounds complicated, it's not even ten minutes of the film; everything is set-up so that the rest of the movie works as a constant comical pay-off. This is why I believe any aspiring comedic screenwriter should watch "A Fish Called Wanda". Each element of its complex mechanism works perfectly and contributes to one of the all-time best comedies. Of course, it helps a little to have two members of the Monty Python troop among the cast, especially when, one of them, also participated to the screenplay, but this is not a Monty Python movie, it's a traditional comedy that knows perfectly where it goes and what it needed, in order to work; starting with the characters.Characterization is integral to the film's success, as each protagonist is very specific and once everyone's exposed, there's no doubt that their interactions will be full of comical delights. Wanda is a sexy, manipulative thief who'd go to no-limits in order to get the jewels, and charming someone is her answer to everything. She does have two weaknesses though, she can't resist to a man speaking Italian, or any foreign language for that matter, and the second is Otto's jealousy that will constantly undermine her attempts to seduce Archie. Otto, behind this palindrome, is one of the greatest comical creations of the 80's, a man so wrapped up in his own ego that he dismissed anything contradicting his views and plans, and don't ask him what he thinks of English people.Archie Leach is the lawyer, far from John Cleese's usual leader-type and uptight characters, his timidity and passiveness doesn't conceal all his charm, he lives like a rabbit behind cages with Wendy (Maria Atkein) a bossy bourgeois wife and a spoiled teenager played by Cleese's daughter. His job seems like the only form of entertainment he can afford and Wanda making her entrance will have the effect of a sunshine lighting in his life. Finally, there's Ken, the stuttering animal-lover who takes care of his fish in an aquarium, the most beautiful one being named Wanda. Michael Palin makes his Ken a lovable guy, and the only loyal associate. But loyalty doesn't make him redeemable when you think of his main occupation during the film.The script, the interactions between the characters, and the humor always work hand-in-hand in "A Fish Called Wanda": if a scene doesn't make you laugh, it makes you smile and works as a set-up to a hilarious moment. And over the course that will lead our four goofballs to the climactic race to the loot, each one is basically busy doing something. Wanda is busy seducing Archie. Otto is busy keeping an eye on them because he's a sickly jealous human being. Archie is busy playing cat-and-mouse with his wife. And Ken is busy trying to eliminate the old lady, yet ends up killing her Yorkshires, one by one. Never has an animal's death has been so funny in film, especially as a running-gag, but as cruel as it is, in a sense of poetic justice, Ken also pays the price to his actions, in one scene that magnificently captures the iconic fish and chips duality and gives a so-British flavor to the film.Still, when it comes the most hilarious and most defining moment of the film (and any 80's comedy), I'm partial to the sight of a shocked naked Cleese naked using a smiling woman's picture to cover his crotch. Another short moment, even shorter than the orgasm, but that is enough to let you meditate on the greatness of "A Fish Called Wanda", a film that somewhat allows American and British Humor to play in the same league, and the result is so funny I think it should be knighted.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Making a truly great comedy is one of the hardest things to do in all film history.Really, how many truly "great" comedies have been made in the last 100 years?Well, "A Fish Called Wanda" qualifies as a comedy legend.Kevin Kline won an Oscar for "Best Supporting Actor" in 1989 for his role in "Wanda"...something that is virtually unheard of...and for a "foreign" film no less.This movie is filled with more hysterically funny lines and sight gags than I could possibly count.If you've read other reviews, they've provided some spoilers.If YOU haven't seen this movie yet, buy / rent it on DVD or Blu-Ray, or watch it on the 'net.DO NOT watch the edited version, because you need to hear ALL of the funny dialogue that makes this movie the classic it is.If you don't have a highly sophisticated funny bone, don't like foul language, making fun of someone with a speech impediment, or "animal cruelty" (done strictly for gut-busting laughs), or have young children you want to share this with, then avoid watching it, because you will NOT enjoy this masterpiece of a comedy. Regardless of my less-than-stellar review, just don't call me stupid!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Would Plato Say about This!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Cleese, Jamie Lee Curtis and Kevin Kline star in A Fish Called Wanda, a film about a robbery and how the conspirators betray each other. This film has more of entertainment value to it than laugh-out-loud laughs though. That's because it contains certain jokes and/or gags that go to such extreme, that they have a shocking effect on you and you find yourself laughing more out of surprise, rather than the joke being inherently funny in itself. I won't go into all of them, but I wouldn't say being caught naked is really that funny. Kevin Kline was great though. If you can't stand foul language at all, then skip this, because Otto is a "true vulgarian." And that "Manfranjensenten" is a highlight! While I say it's not very funny, I must say it's what I call a guilty pleasure, giving in to everyone's basic urge to do what is not expected, to be uncouth, and to do what is socially unacceptable and what you can't get away with in real life. And, maybe, this is just a satire on society's norm. To make you think, like Plato. It certainly leaves a definite impression. You'll walk away, loving every minute of it or thinking you'll never see it again. But if you do, you'll have to apologize!</fullReview>

Michael Palin and John Cleese add the nice dry British flair to them and Maria Atken (Wendy) is perfect as the snobbish wife i didn't like George's character, but he (Tom Georgeson) really played it perfectly too, nothing against the actor! just his character in the movieAltogether, the perfect comedy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fish Called Wanda</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hardly a Monty Python vehicle, but its remnants, Cleese and Palin has brought forth perhaps their best work so far (including the python period), a contemporary satire homing in the UK/USA self-mocking kernel, with their US counterparts, Curtis and Kline. Entertaining to its very core, the crime-light, pratfall-heavy comedy ingenuously spikes British humor in its comparatively foolhardy story of a manipulative woman's happy-ever-after scheme of misappropriating all the loots from a bank robbery in her own pocket and ditching her two lovers (the sinister-looking boss she framed and the dorky, jealous, violent American criminal she could not bear anymore) with the right man (a British lawyer) she has inadvertently encountered.There are some minor cruelty in the film since dogs are consecutively and (three-times-in-a- row) inadvertently killed and fish are eaten alive (including the titular Wanda), which may faintly offend animal right activists, but apart from that, other crucial gags and set pieces are all put into the right place, nudity, awkward cuckoldry, jokes, wisecrackers, teasing of philosophy, a touch of gayness and a little bit of action, you name it!Kline's winning of BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR is such an atypical victory, by virtue of now the snubs of distinguished comedic performances have been enacted in the official mind-set of the academy and most audience's minds (last year McCarthy's nomination for BRIDESMAIDS 2011, 7/10 is flipping wondrous), and Kline is winsome as a composite of egoist, goofiness, wide- eyedness and a ludicrous perilousness. Another delicious supporting contender, Palin, stuck in his self-conscious stammer as the boss' loyal sidekick, is still capable of merciless assassination, loses all his beloved fish as a retribution of killing three innocent puppies, but equipped with a feel good revenge in the end.Curtis has extensively excavated her comedy soul, being lithely tricky, but uncompromisingly attractive. Cleese, as the authentic linchpin of the film (he is also the co-writer, co-producer and an uncredited co-director), a well-off lawyer who is smitten with Curtis from his first glance, and being salutary from the ragbag mishaps, determinedly leaves his wealthier wife and ends up with the woman he is infatuated plus the dough, an all-too-hasty coda may or may not be exonerated.A FISH CALLED WANDA is director Charles Crichton's swan-song, I rate it a venerable 8 out 10 although the film itself may fall short of my usual criterion of the "great work" category, nevertheless, we all should cherish a bit more of decent comedies which is a needle in a haystack in the present market.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clever, laugh-out-loud, unconventional British comedy...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit: comedy movies are not my favourite; too many of them go through unnecessary routes to get cheap laughs, often at the expense of others. When I want comedy, I usually turn to stand-up. This is why I waited almost 20 years to see A FISH CALLED WANDA. I am not familiar with much of John Cleese's work, but after this masterpiece, I am in the process of procuring copies of the better MONTY PYTHON movies, and perhaps FAWLTY TOWERS, such was the class of comedy I experienced.A FISH CALLED WANDA proves that you don't have to sacrifice cleverness to attain good comedy, as this movie is as clever and well-constructed and thoughtful as anything I've seen in this genre. The plot takes a number of convoluted twists and turns, but none of them seem incredible or fantastic. The story itself is a captivating one involving a diamond heist and the ensuing activities of the four criminals involved.Each character brings something to the table. John Cleese is astoundingly hilarious as the barrister living a confined life. Jamie Lee Curtis enjoys one of her best ever performances as the female thief with many love-interests (and an affection for accents), and unknown desires. Michael Palin's 'mission' scenes are the ones that made me laugh aloud the most, and for prolonged periods of time. But the real star is Kevin Kline, who plays the Nietzche-reading, self-professed intellectual, in the comedic performance of a lifetime, as he steals almost every scene in which he appears. His character's contrast with Cleese's is uproariously amusing, and his 'chips' scene with Palin is simply comedic genius. His Best Supporting Actor victory was well warranted as this performance was simply unforgettable.John Cleese knows no limits, as I am well aware that he rarely (if ever) holds back when it comes to the brunt of his jokes. Whether it be the British, the Americans, intellectuals, homosexuals, the elderly, or even the stutterers, Cleese doesn't hold back. The difference here is that he does it in a clever and tactful manner, not looking merely for cheap laughs, but urging the viewer to actually THINK a bit. This, to me, is why British comedy is miles ahead of American comedy; you need a certain degree of class to pull off some kinds of jokes.Admittedly, comedy is, by its very nature, subjective. Some people don't 'get' George Carlin. Some people don't 'get' Jerry Seinfeld. Some people don't 'get' AIRPLANE. Some people actually like Bam and the JACKASS cast. All I am saying is that A FISH CALLED WANDA made me laugh aloud on a number of occasions, and for prolonged and uncontrollable periods too. And it has been a while since a comedy movie has made me do that. It was a thoroughly enjoyable Motion Picture, and even when I wasn't laughing, I had a smile on my face.For these reasons, A FISH CALLED WANDA gets 8/10 and a 4 star rating (out of 4) because I recommend this film unreservedly to anyone who has ever laughed a day in their lives. Should enter my Top 250 at around #232. Don't miss this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I have one thing to thank America for it is for part funding "A Fish Called Wanda". It is the best comedy of all time. From Micheal Pallins stuttering -Ken, to Jamie Lees - Wanda performance it is simply outstanding. Based on a heist of a top London Bank the film then tells the story of the cover up and back stabbing that follows. Many believe Kevin Kline deserved the Oscar he received for his role of Otto the "Dont call me stupid" X-Cia agent and he did but John Cleese more so. His character Archie Leech is the funniest person ever on film, from the original heist to the shock when he beds Jamie Lee he does it all in the best of British Humour.If you have never seen this film I advise you to as you will be in fits of laughter and if you are not...get help! Nothing like you've ever seen before and the best British Film of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whatever you do, don't call it stupid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"A Fish Called Wanda" is not your typical comedy which is its greatest strength and its greatest weakness. It is a crime comedy that curious merges British humor (the Monty Python sensibility led by writer and actor John Cleese) and American humor (the over-the-top performance from Kevin Kline). Often times this works for some great laughs and other times it'll leave you a bit confused, but overall it's a fun movie with an unbelievable set of characters and a plot that only pushes these actors to do their best.The film plummets you right into the action as 4 strange individuals all collaborate to rob a bank of 20 Million in diamonds. When 2 of them, Wanda and Otto (Curtis and Kline) turn in one of the others, the double crossing, seduction and lying continues in the interest of the characters getting their hands on the diamonds and walking away.These characters are just terrific. Kevin Kline is every bit Oscar-worthy in his role as Otto, the eccentric, clueless, risk-taking,self-assertive criminal (but not stupid...) who thinks he knows best all the time. He stands out as one of the best character roles in a comedy of all time in this film and that's not overstating it. Jamie Lee Curtis, while you wouldn't think to be your first choice for a seductive, manipulating and completely self-absorbed criminal but she commands the attention her role requires so easily. Monty Python greats John Cleese and Michael Palin also add that distinct Monty Python brand humor to the film that makes it so unique. Cleese plays a lawyer that gets wrapped up in the double-crossing and Palin plays a stuttering, fish-loving, sympathizable sidekick. If you can't tell by now, let me reiterate that this comedy is all about the characters.The plot here is enough to keep the antics going and that's what good sketch comedy (which you'd expect from a John Cleese) does. It takes a bit for you to adjust to the humor, but once you get beyond the fact that they're not just being weird to be weird, there's a bit more too it, this film goes from being just okay to really enjoyable. While I think it could have done better in terms of a satisfying plot, it wasn't enough to keep the film from identifying itself primarily as an absurd, off-the-wall and over-the-top crime comedy. Don't expect flashy, slick slight of hand crime comedy here, just some really silly but unique laughs.</fullReview>

Their comic timing are pitch perfect withing almost every scene. Jamie Lee Curtis' performance is really, really good. And when I say that, I really mean it this time. I can honestly say, and mean, that this is one of her best performance in a movie.Again, see this movie because it's funny. However, I really do find the plot really funny and solid. The twists and turns are also made for comedic laughs and surprises. Overall, give this a blind buy if you haven't already seen it. It's worth it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Veteran director Charlie Crichton teamed here with funny man John Cleese to create one of the funniest movies of recent times. "Wanda" is hilarious as it blends American and English humour fabulously, and the cast deliver one riotous scene after another.One must forgive, and can even afford to forget, the rather contrived plot (which involves a jewelery heist and the subsequent scramble to leave the country) as it carries little weight. Cleese and Curtis are good but are overshadowed by two brilliantly funny performances from Kevin Kline (as 'Otto', the psychopathic self-proclaimed intellectual who is a real moron) and Michael Palin (as the stuttering 'Ken'). A must see comedy!Tuesday, September 15, 1992 - Video</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Absolutely brilliant! This was THE most entertaining movie I have seen. From the moment it starts until the instant it ends, you are rivoted to your seat. There are twists and turns and something hilarious happening every moment. This story never lagged or spiraled off somewhere into the unknown. It stayed on track full speed ahead with twists and turns at every bend. Every actor played the part so briliantly that you actually believe these are real people, from the psychotically deranged Otto to the stiff upper crest wife and equally snobbish daughter. My favorite character was Otto. This man thinks himself educatedabout human nature but completely mis understands the concepts. He really does have "no clue"! just as Wanda pointed out, apes CAN read, they just don't understand it. That's Otto! Kevin Kline deserved every recognition/award he ever received.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lewis and Clark ventured to the unknown west parts of early America. Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay climbed Mount Everest. Me, I write my own opinions on movies that everyone else seemed to love.It's not that I didn't like "A Fish Called Wanda." I didn't laugh once when I saw it, but that can be ignored if the plot is good. And I kinda liked the plot, although it was a bit disturbing - I am not easily offended by cruelty in movies, but the treatment that Ken gets throughout the movie is just disgusting, and his revenge on Otto is not substantial enough. Also, some points in the movie are just plain corny, like Ken's aforementioned revenge.(SPOILER ALERT! SPOILER ALERT! I mean, come on. Running over Otto with a steamroller? That is really corny. And why are his feet stuck in place anyway? He was just moving his feet a few seconds earlier. This would satisfy me, however, if it weren't for a final shot of Otto, covered in cement, looking in the airplane window. What did Ken do, really, besides getting Otto a little dirty? SPOILERS OVER! SPOILERS OVER!)Not a complete waste of time, but there are definitely better movies. If you want to see a movie about ruthless people duking it out over big money, the superior movie is..."Ruthless People." If you wanna see Jamie Lee Curtis sleeping around, the superior movie is "Trading Places." If you wanna see John Cleese and Michael Palin goofing around, the superior movies are "Monty Python and the Holy Grail", "Monty Python's Life of Brian", or countless other displays of Python silliness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wanda brings her secret lover, Otto to England to help her and her lover George and stuttering animal lover Ken steal $20 million in diamonds. Wanda and Otto then turn in George to the police so they can have the loot for themselves, but George has already moved the diamonds and only he knows where they are. All four of the criminals start double-crossing each other to try to get to the diamonds before anyone else. Wanda tries to find them by "getting close" to George's barrister, Archie Leach, because if George pleads guilty he will tell Archie where the diamonds are to cut his sentence......The thing about TV celebrities turning their hand at comedy, is always a very risqué one. For every Wanda, we have a Wilt, True Identity, Boys In Blue, Alien Autopsy, Morons From Outer Space, Guest House Paradiso...you get the picture.The Pythons have made films like this before, but with all the garbage released in-between, one couldn't help but worry a little.The film is hilarious, from the old age comedy of the class war, to simple stuff like name calling and mocking, the film rarely takes a step wrong.Cleese is perfect as Leach, the man who has it all, except guts and happiness. This man is the epitome of middle class males, all mouth but no trousers, and Cleese gets it down to a tee. Kudos to Palin, who plays the typical working class villain with an unfortunate tick.But the film is stolen by Kline, a career best performance and really worthy of the Oscar, when ever Otto is on screen, the rest may as well sit back, they haven't a chance with Kline.It's well written, charming, funny with a little devilish streak running down its back for good measure.A perfect example of why British humour was and always be the best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Definitive Comedy Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jamie Lee Curtis, well known scream queen, suddenly proves she can act. Not only does she prove she can act, but she can act along side the likes of monsters Kevin Kline and John Cleese. And not only can all of them act, plus everyone else in this movie too, but they all have to act as different people whenever another character enters the frame... sometimes, especially in the case of Kevin Kline, changing pace effortlessly in a single take.Whereas that's not quite overwhelming, the context is: this movie also manages to be really funny and have a pretty wacky plot. It's a slapstick, screwball comedy of errors with things to say about American-British relationships, heist thrillers, and English manners. It manages to work, but also to keep it simple despite it's fast pace: everyone either wants sex or wants money, and where those things occur accidents are just prone to happen.It's not usual for something so 80s, so mainstream, and so full of familiar faces and pop culture references to be considered a "classic", especially when it's just a really good comedy, but this shows that even relatively straight-forward entertainments can transcend its appeal to become art.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Charles Crichton may have 78 years old, when he made this movie, it didn't prevent him from making a lively, successful and above all funny. The making is dynamic and inventive. But the main strength of the movie is the screenplay. It's certainly a bit vulgar but it's very strong, inspired and full of little details which kick the bull's eye. Let's add that it contains also unexpected reversals of situation. This, in order to start again the attention and to put forward the characters' cupidity and egoism towards the loot. The best example are the moments when Otto and Wanda are denouncing Georges to the police to take advantage of the loot; but they don't know where the loot is. The other moment is during the trial when Cleese's calling involuntarily Wanda "darling". He's betraying his wife and provoking Georges' anger... Above all, it's impossible to neglect the humour of the movie. It's black, caustic and a bit devastating. The greatest moments are: the liquidation of the old lady's dogs. Besides, these dogs are really pieces of junk when they're barking. Otto who becomes an executioner near the end of the movie when he's devouring Ken's fishes so as to make him tell the truth about the diamonds. At last, the actors are irresistible, especially Kevin Kline (he won an oscar for his performance in 1989), fervent admirer of Nietzche's philosophy, Michael Palin, an old and stammerer boy who loves animals.At the end, not any injuries time and a comedy held up by outstanding actors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What comedy always needs to be.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Fish Called Wanda is a hilarious tale of deceit, lies, and sex. It tells the story of four people who attempt to pull off a massive diamond heist. Things are going well until the foursome's leader, George, gets arrested and refuses to reveal the location of the stolen diamonds. The group tries to convince George's lawyer to retrieve the information from George and tell them but this only sets off a nutty chain of events as everyone attempts to double cross the other. This is pure comedy done right. The film is hilarious, while also telling a story that is more fleshed out than the average heist film. It is situational comedy meets crime film and it all is pulled off excellently.The only way to correctly start off a review of this film would be to mention just how great the main four characters are and how amazing the actors portraying them are. John Cleese, Kevin Kline, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Michale Palin could not have been cast in their roles more perfectly. All four of them are so incredibly fitting and they do such fantastic jobs in their roles. Plus, these characters are so much fun. John Cleese plays the lawyer defending the mastermind behind the diamond heist. Jamie Lee Curtis is the lover of said mastermind who is actually going behind her lover's back to steal the diamonds from him and flee the country with her other love Otto. In order to do this she has to get information from Cleese, making Otto jealous. One hysterical thing leads to another and the whole film is fueled by lies and misunderstandings that build on one another throughout the whole film, making for such an outrageously funny movie.This kind of talent in comedic writing is just too rare. Too often do comedies miss out on a good story in order to jam pack the film with jokes. A Fish Called Wanda manages to balance the two and actually tell a story that is fueled by jokes. Unlike other comedies, the jokes tell the story in A Fish Called Wanda, creating an even blend between comedy and story that all meld seamlessly into each other. It is just what this genre is all about. It goes to show that you can tell a story through a comedic medium that is just as good if not better than a story written through a serious medium.The other great thing about this film is that it never forgets it is a comedy. It never forgets to make us laugh and it always refrains from getting sentimental or sappy. It is all about making us laugh keeping us interested through hilarious situations that stretch out through the entire film. The jokes in this film don't just show up and then leave immediately. They stick around and they just get funnier and funnier, always keeping your attention and always leaving you in anticipation of what these characters will get themselves into next. Watching a movie like this is just insanely fun when there is never a dull moment. It really is just what every comedy needs to be.A Fish Called Wanda is a classic slice of comedic filmmaking. It is a film that defines what comedy can be and it exemplifies the level of quality comedy can reach. Even when the film gets a little too silly or something a little too outrageous occurs, you still enjoy the film and there seems to be nothing in here that can drag down my opinion that this is a great film. Comedy isn't my favorite genre of all time, but movies like A Fish Called Wanda make me remember the good the genre brings us and why I continue to watch these films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What was the middle thing?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an incredibly hilarious, screwball, caper romp. With only two of the Pythons and a director who, I understand, had not done comedy before, you might be worried that it leaves something to be desired, but I can assure you, it is a sharply written masterpiece. A lot of the humor is pitch black, there is cleverness and silliness, vaudeville and sit-com-like sequences, this insists on not being politically correct, and almost no joke or gag falls flat or feels forced. There is a ton of energy in it, and the pace is spot-on. It does not run out of steam at any point, and it doesn't end abruptly. The plot is engaging and very nicely put together; detailed without being convoluted. Editing and cinematography are great, they don't call too much attention to themselves. It all adds up to making this a classic of its genre. This may be the first time Kline behaves like an ass in a role, which has since become his schtick. Jamie Lee Curtis is at her most seductive and sexy in this. The characters are well-written, fleshed out and credible(if not necessarily mentally stable). I was laughing throughout the entirety of this, and would agree that it is definitely one of the funniest films ever. There is plentiful strong language, a bit of sex that isn't graphic in its depiction, a little over the top violence, and it can be rather tasteless(for anyone bothered by that). The Special Edition DVD contains two additional tracks(an interesting commentary by John and a good and amusing factoid one), a handful of well-done, informative featurettes, numerous deleted and alternate scenes with Cleese introducing every single one of them, and some photo galleries. I recommend this to anyone that can imagine enjoying this. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A consistently funny and tightly scripted affair that benefits from a strong cast mostly in good form</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Four criminals come together to pull off a daring jewel robbery. Wanda poses as the girl of ringleader George to get his trust while her lover, Otto, pretends to be her brother. After the job Wanda and Otto betray George by calling the police on him ? but they find themselves out in the cold when it transpires that George had hidden the jewels to keep himself safe. With George holding the jewels over them, Wanda and Otto have to try and find them so they can getaway. Wanda decides to do this by getting close to George's barrister on the chance that George tells him where they are. Meanwhile Otto becomes more and more unhinged while animal-loving gang member Ken has to "take care of" the witness that has put George in the dock.The plot of this film is rather convoluted but it more than does enough to act as a frame for the nicely comic tone running through the whole affair. It is all a bit silly but that is the point I suppose and the film brings off an old-fashioned film albeit with lots of modern sexual material in the mix. Personally I didn't find it side-splittingly hilarious but it does have more than enough comic moments to make for easy and amusing watching. The script is tight and moves well to produce very, very few slow moments that don't work ? mostly it flows really well. Crichton directs well even if it does feel more suited to television than to a cinema.The cast is obviously the biggest draw and also the reason that the material works as well as it does. Cleese delivers a nicely amusing English stereotype to good effect while Curtis is effectively sexy even though her actual performance is a bit weak and obvious ? together they just about manage to carry off the chemistry required to present themselves as a very unlikely couple. Palin stars in his own little side film and is funny even though the stutter is rather obvious comic device at times. Kline dominates the film though with a wonderfully idiotic and brash American cliché. He works well with a great character that he does tend to steal his scenes and is very enjoyable.Overall then an enjoyable British comedy. It won't have you rolling in the aisles but it is consistently funny and tightly scripted affair that benefits from a strong cast mostly in good form.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the funniest work of Kline's career; a big bang of ultra hilarity and over-the-top jokes of visual and wit variety</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Fish Called Wanda comes from director Charles Crichton, though much of what makes the film a success is that he just doesn't get in the way of what these actors can do and, more importantly, the material. It's John Cleese as writer and him and Michael Palin as co-stars, so immediately (and especially for me as I saw it as part of a retrospective involving the group) Monty Python comes to mind. It is and it isn't like Python, as this time it does tell really a full-on story without it being too sketchy- 'too' being a loose word here, most particular exceptions being Palin's scenes after the old lady- and it's all really about the wacky surprises and behavior of these characters. It's also the Oscar winning performance of Kevin Kline's career, and possibly still one of the very best that he's ever pulled off. It's shameless at being stupid, which his Otto as a running gag replies "don't call me stupid", and also at trying to seem intelligent in his dastardly gangster ways, while supplanting himself with Nietzsche and jealousy around his tease/seeming-to-others sibling Wanda played by Jamie Lee Curtis. It's fearless comedy at it's best, and it's quite possible out of all the good things going for A Fish Called Wanda he's overall the funniest, almost without trying (just seeing his face as he pops up during the rendezvous Curtis and Cleese have is worth the price to check it out).But aside from him the picture works as being a rip-roaring comedy, so to speak, as the comedy ranges from more exaggerated forms of comedy around for ages (i.e. there's someone in the house that shouldn't be, hides, wackiness), to being more explicit (Cleese's Arch strips down for his beau, only to have the people who once had real estate dealings with him see him right then and there), to being almost sadistic (dead dogs the biggest). But there's also room for stuttering, here in the form of Palin's Ken, who is 2nd only to Kline in the big laughs department, as he ultimately ends up missing the dogs he wipes out more than the old lady does herself. His may be a kind of running gag that could wear out its welcome, and in maybe one or two scenes the laughs aren't totally mined, but he also provides some of the funniest scenes, like with Kline, I may have ever seen, like when Arch comes in to ask Ken where the jewels are, and the stutter goes on and on and on (or, for that matter, when he gets 'cured').It also helps that Curtis and Cleese's characters, while often seeming like the 'straight' characters in the film, are also extremely gifted at doing their forms of comedy, and Cleese ends up pulling some unexpected comedic bits the likes of which match up to those of his Python days. His character at first seems fairly bland, an attorney defending a jewel thief (I forget the actor's name), who gets taken in romantically by a 'law student', Wanda, whom he doesn't want to get involved with as she is, of course, a witness for the defense in the case. But in the midst of playing him up to get info, it becomes for both actors something to keep up with Kline's own comedy stylings, his facial expressions and manner of speaking (not just the Italian, of course a highlight). He puts up a well-measured performance alongside all the others, and altogether the main four actors pull off something of an amazing feat; it has the pure irreverence of Python, the go-for-broke silliness done with a slightly more dirty and almost obscene beat, while even having a conventional side to it too with the heist plot. And it makes for a great time if you happen to get to see it in a packed audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Way too cruel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hit comedy about some thieves--Ken Pile (Michael Palin), Wanda Gershwitz (Jamie Lee Curtis), Otto West (Kevin Kline)--and a barrister (John Cleese) who falls in trouble with them. The plot is way too convoluted to summarize but it involves stolen diamonds, multiple double-crosses, sex, violence etc etc all in a supposedly funny manner.Now this movie does have some good things about it--Cleese (playing the straight man for once) is good; Curtis is just fantastic (and incredibly sexy); Kline is even better in a role that got him the Best Supporting Actor Oscar) and Palin is also good. It moves quickly, looks great and I was never really bored.But, it wasn't funny. I didn't laugh once. I didn't like it in 1988 (some critics weren't too thrilled with it either) and I still don't like it now. For one thing almost all the main characters are vicious and cruel (especially Otto). This movies idea of humor is violence. One character is beaten up multiple times and humiliated--all like it's funny. Another stutters nonstop (that's played for laughs) and is being constantly verbally humiliated and gets maimed in accidents and almost suffocated to death. Another is run over by a steam roller. Animals are killed, live fish are eaten....To some people this might be hysterical but I found it way too cruel to be funny. Also, I'm no prude, but did we really have to have constant non-stop swearing throughout the movie? That also isn't funny--just annoying.I'm giving this a 5 for the actors--and that's about it. Still, it was a smash hit so it depends on what you find funny. If you love the Three Stooges this is for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the brilliant comedic mind of John Cleese comes this hilarious heist caper comedy about jewel thieves entangled in webs of lies, duplicity and jealousy. Boasting an excellent cast including Cleese himself as a lawyer charged with defending the heist's mastermind, Jamie Lee Curtis as the titular Wanda (displaying a fabulous mix of sexuality and controlled comedic wit), Michael Palin as the stuttering and put-upon Ken, the most impressionable gang member and rounding out the talent is the Academy Award winning performance of Kevin Kline as the brainless, hilariously egotistical and extremely jealous Otto. The cast plays beautifully off each other as they insult, compliment and weasel their ways into our funny bones.The script is side-splitting and full of memorable exchanges and one-liners (most of the memorable quips coming from Kline himself, but also from Curtis, Cleese and Palin). The humor is crisp and sharp, hitting a few missteps in the middle but quickly regains its footing. Slapstick comedy heightens the hilarity and will have you laughing so hard.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Fish Called Wanda is one of the funniest movies ever, ranking up there with the best of the Pink Panther movies. The striptease and dance act by John Cleese has to be one of the best gags ever filmed. Along with the fast pace and humour, the movie has a clever script which makes for two hours of sheer enjoyment. I really liked the humour of John Cleese and the acrobatic moves and language virtuoso of Kevin Kline in a British-American culture clash. You won't forget Kline holding Cleese upside down from the window over a street as he extracts an overblown apology from the lawyer Cleese. Of course the acting of Jamie Lee Curtis who tries to seduce Cleese (and succeeds) while trying to keep Kline from tearing Cleese apart is a ongoing farce. Then there is one of Cleese's Monty Python partners Michael Palin as the stutter stricken roommate of Jamie Lee Curtis. With him, the ongoing battle with the old lady and her little, yapping dogs is woven into the wider story of a diamond heist under the erratic and egotistical Kline. Palin becomes another British punchbag for Kline who is only too pleased to mock his embarrassing stutter which results in laughable and lengthy pauses in mid-sentence. These are milked for Kline to deliver more zingers at the poor Palin character. Director Charles Crichton, longtime director on the British comedy scene, pulled off a great piece of work in this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Farce Done Right</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Comedy is notoriously hard to review. At the risk of sounding obtuse, the primary goal of a comedic film usually is to (drum-roll) make you laugh. Yet with humor being an overwhelmingly subjective experience, most reviewers (myself included) often don't bother to tell you whether the film has touched their funny bone. Most reviews thus are spent looking at secondary measurable goals the film has to offer such as its novelty, story elements or ability to latch onto the cultural zeitgeist. If you ever wanted a reason for why critics loved the first Hangover (2009) and hated the sequels despite them being the exact same movie, look no further.A Fish Called Wanda succeeds on all counts. It's a stunningly original mix of classic British comedy tropes, scurrilous American vulgarity and farcical characterizations. It provides solid gallows humor, intelligent witticisms, crackling dialogue, excellent cast and energetic pacing. It's also incredibly funny. Not just haha- funny; it's gut-bustingly, rolling in the aisles, sitting alone in front of the TV screen and having the neighbors call the police because there's a maniac on the loose, hilarious.The film begins with a foursome of jewel thieves meeting at an unassuming London flat. Wanda (Curtis) and Otto (Kline) pose as an American brother and sister team while Georges (Tom) and the regularly stuttering Ken (Palin) are natives who are suspicious of their partners (especially Otto). The jewelry heist is largely a success with only one eye-witness placing Georges at the scene. Otto and Wanda promptly double cross their comrades and calls in a tip to further incriminate Georges. They try to make off with the loot but find the volt where the diamonds were held empty. Seeing no alternative, Wanda continues to court Georges while getting close to his barrister Archie (Cleese), believing that the first person he'll tell is his legal defense team.The film then tangles itself into an intricate web of deceit, confusions, happenstances and comedic set-pieces that channel the best of the Ealing Studio comedies only with conspicuously modern sensibilities. That's not mere coincidence either, director Charles Crichton directed The Lavender Hill Mob (1951) arguably the studio's most revered accomplishment. Where most modern comedies ensnare themselves in a snarl of contrivance and a fast processional of deus ex machina moments, A Fish Called Wanda pilots through the such pratfalls with glorious confidence. All the who's who, what's where's and what-not's all disseminate from the characters whose broadness is tempered with specific peculiarities.The characters themselves, while broadly drawn are so well composited and made whole by the actors that you'd swear the ghost of Joseph Kesselring was looking down and smiling on the production.John Cleese's Archie oozes upper crust pomposity and naive gullibility. He's a rube but he's a lovable rube who at times feels like a deadringer to Graham Chapman's various straight-man roles on Monty Python's Flying Circus (1969-1974). Fellow Python alum Michael Palin plays a different kind of rube; of the Elmer Fudd variety. His honesty and ineptitude are no match for the intricacies of the plot, let alone Otto's daffiness. There's a reoccurring joke where Otto, in an attempt to keep Ken off his tracks, fakes a homosexual attraction. Sure it's a little dated but within the film's context the joke lands largely due to Palin's deer-in-the-headlights panic. I suppose the added benefit of melding British and American sensibilities ensures that the film is not just funny but funny on multiple wavelengths.Out of all the pitch-perfect characters that populate this film, Kevin Kline's Otto was perfectly designed to steal the show. Seeing himself as one smart cookie, the irony of Otto is not only his puffed up egoism but his complete inability to see Wanda's betrayal. He's like Nick Bottom from 'A Midsummer Night's Dream' with a dollop of Daffy Duck added in for good measure.Then there's the rapturous Jamie Lee Curtis who uses her feminine wiles to delirious heights against the men. Her resourcefulness and gamesmanship has a Katharine Hepburn-like quality which is only betrayed by her character's orgasmic reaction to the Italian language. Part of the fun of her character however is her ability to bounce off Kevin Kline's childish impetuousness. In one masterful scene of comedic debrief, Wanda pops Otto's quasi-intellectual bubble by saying "Let me correct you on a couple of things. Aristotle was not Belgian. The central message of Buddhism is not 'Every man for himself.' The London Underground is not a political movement. Those are all mistakes, Otto. I looked them up."I could go on and on about A Fish Called Wanda's effortless charm and under-appreciated timelessness. Layered with a plethora of jokes, freakishly good acting and unique sensibilities on top of a clever caper, I simply cannot recommend this film enough. I emphatically implore all to see A Fish Called Wanda to see farce done right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is this? "Hump a Limey" week?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Starting out with only a rudimentary idea of the story, and Chrichton's request that he wanted "... to see someone steamrolled", the final result was a film that somehow struck a humorous chord all over the world. The film just somehow "worked", and it's been a cherished classic ever sense. What makes the film truly funny all actors, including in the small cameos, created memorable characters because they had wonderfully constructed and written script to work with. John Cleese deserves the first mention for his excellent triple work as the co-writer of the Oscar nominated script/co-director and the star in the role of Archie Leach, the well-mannered English gentleman whose marriage seems to be in crisis, the defender of George, the leader of the diamonds thieves who keeps the "key" to the coveted loot to himself. Cleese's partner Python - Michael Palin is excellent as shy, stuttering hit-man Ken who is secretly in love with Wanda, tenderly loves animals but is ready to help an inconvenient witness to "meet with an accident, even if it is a very old lady with a weak heart. Loud, pushy and sexually liberated Americans are represented in the film by Wanda (always charming and illuminating the screen Jamie Lee Curtis) and her lover Otto, the former CIA operative, the expert in all kinds of weapons (Kevin Kline in the Oscar winning performance) whom she introduces ad her brother. Wanda is as seductive and sexy as she is clever, unscrupulous, conniving and backstabbing. What she wants she sure will get. She is much cleverer than all men around her combined together but seems that in the end she might find the right man. And finally, Otto, "the ape who reads philosophy but does not understand it... the man so stupid that calling him stupid is insult to stupid people" who does not realize how vulgar and intellectually challenged he is. In the movie where there is no bad or boring performance at all, Kline is outstanding. A talented film and stage actor who has performed in many Shakespeare's plays, he would never have the role as brilliant and funny as Otto.Surprisingly, "A Fish Called Wanda" has stood up well over time. It is still one of the films that I continue to return to for dependable belly laughs. The change of genre in the story is what is definitely surprising as it started as a heist movie and later turns out to be more that what it appears to be as it becomes more complex afterwards as we get to see the goofiness of the characters afterwards. It is definitely a vintage classic comedy.Overall rating: 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Hilarious Comedy that Heralded in a Sea Change</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A 'Fish called Wanda' is of course an undisputed classic in my humble opinion but going back and watching it recently, I have discovered that it may be a milestone. The director Charles Crichton is also duly famous for another all-time classic caper-comedy 'The Lavender Hill Mob' and he brings his finely tuned ear for honing an ensemble cast and extended screwball antics to this unique melding project of 50's old school and 70's upstart genius that is 'Monty Python'.What I see unique in this film is the shifting away from conventional comic sensibilities towards our more modern 'anything goes as long as it gets a laugh' comedies of the 90's onwards. I see some of the roots of 'Dumber and Dumber' in Kevin Kline's performance of living in his own unique 'clueless' insular bubble and 'Something about Mary' in the way that our straight man John Cleese is allowed to take a more active part in the ensuing mayhem even knowing that he is driving himself deeper into something he should just avoid but can't help himself as the craziness of the situation at least gives him something new to break the modern monotony's of our ever increasingly paced lives that seem to be going faster and faster yet nowhere at all.Maybe I am reading too much into this film but I really can't remember anything quite like it before it arrived at the cinema and caused the comedic sensation that it justly deserves. Once in awhile everything just clicks perfectly and this is one of those cases, I cannot think of removing or adding a single scene without disrupting the hilarity that this film unfolds scene by scene.This is one to definitely be buried with and take to the afterlife if such things could be possible. Comic Gold!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not going to compare this movie with any other movie. Because the movie is a unique ride and you must watch to see how 80s comedies laid. Even today use these stuffs as materials. Cast looks so great and particularly Jamie Lee Curtis showing what 80s like. So great! Another beautiful thing is the music of 80s. Totally loved it. If you are good fan of 80s music then I'm sure this is one good venture to feel it. III don't want to spoil you with the plot or hint of it, but I can assure you this is a movie that you can enjoy anytime in the day. No big scientific stuffs OR complicated plot which can't understand. The movie is flowing without get you bored. Must watch British comedy with few thrilling moments. Sure you wont regret to spend more than one and half hours of your time for a 80s classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Fish Called Wanda (1988): Dir: Charles Crichton / Cast: John Cleese, Jamie Lee Curtis, Kevin Kline, Michael Palin, Maria Aitken: Clever caper comedy with a title that not only references a pet, but also the woman who conned everyone and got away. Plot regards stolen jewels and the betrayal of the leader. Wanda is played by Jamie Lee Curtis who set up the betrayal along with her lover, a weapons expert named Otto, played to brilliant comic extremes by Kevin Kline. John Cleese is hilarious as barrister Archie Leach. His marriage is reduced to spite, and his teenage daughter wails for attention. Now Wanda has entrapped him for information resulting in situations resulting in him being hung upside down out a window, beat up while robbing his own house, and being caught naked by a family of four on a surprise visit. Curtis is sexy playing her options but has a weakness for erotic spoken languages. Kline provides a physical sarcasm with his jealous outbursts over Wanda until he is using a firearm to issue an apology. Michael Palin plays the animal loving Ken whose task of killing an elderly witness results is his most hilariously painful backfires. With a grand supporting cast and director Charles Crichton making his best caper since Lavender Hill Mob. Ending is wayward with humour often in questionable taste, this becomes a brilliant clash of cultures descending in a net that only Wanda can outmaneuver. Score: 8 / 10</fullReview>

However this one is very pleasant : those 4 artists are really good, each one in a personal area and there's really a good chemistry between them. Unlike today comedies in which fun means spoof, here, the fun is absurd, cerebral and it's totally different. It's clear that Jamie Lee is highly talented (and also terribly charming) but she is also underrated, forgotten and the success of this movie was totally deserved?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Fish Called Wanda is one of the funniest movies of all time, especially when it have Monty Python's actors (John Cleese and Michael Palin) and attractive Jamie Lee Curtis (very different role for him). But the best is Kevin Kline. And the funniest. See the movie and you know why.The story begins when a gangster George Thomason (Tom Georgeson) and he's stuttering partner K-K-K-K-Ken Pile (Michael Palin) plan together a jewel robbery. With two Americans Wanda Gershwitz (Jamie Lee Curtis) and Otto West (Kevin Kline) they going to do it, but (of course) some troubles comes too.One of the funniest moments are Ken's efforts to kill an old lady who saw the robbery. He kills accidentally lady's dogs one by one. "Finally" old lady dies of a heart attack. And of course the scene when Otto eats Ken's fishes. And when Archie Leach (John Cleese) get naked in an apartment. And the end scene in airport. And many many more.The screenplay is very very good. Better than good. It's a simple tale of little group of stupids ("Don't call me stupid!") and betrayals.Brilliant movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tour de farce from John Cleese &amp; company</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"A Fish Called Wanda" is a comedic caper movie that harks back to the classic Ealing comedies of the 1940's &amp; 50's. Not coincidentally, the movie marked Ealing vet Charles Crichton's return to directing following a more than 20 year absence from film. His past experience came in handy while John Cleese also helped to bring their co-written script to life on the silver screen.The story concerns a group of varied individuals who join forces to commit a multi-million dollar heist in London, then try to double-cross each other. To further complicate matters, a strait-laced barrister also ends up getting caught up in the mix.When it comes to the four leads, you couldn't ask for better performers. Each of them excelled in their respective roles. Jamie Lee Curtis plays the sexy, duplicitous Wanda. Kevin Kline won an Oscar for his portrayal of Otto, a deadly dimwit who considers himself an intellectual. John Cleese &amp; Michael Palin both won BAFTA awards for their performances, the former as stuffy barrister Archie Leach and the latter as stuttering lackey Ken. The script masterfully combines these disparate individuals in various permutations to great comedic effect.Visually, Charles Crichton's direction showed a keen eye for comedy and was rewarded with an Oscar nomination. Meanwhile, the John Du Prez score, while not especially noteworthy, has at least aged better than most from that era.In the end, it is the performances that make "A Fish Called Wanda" a standout comedy. The four leads make the most of quality writing and direction to spin comedy gold. While I'm not sure that everyone will appreciate the movie's distinctly British sense of humour and farcical situations, I can only say that I found the movie's mix of levity and darkness to be finely balanced on the whole.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny, funny, funny!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This 1988-flick comes to its viewers with a lot of exciting, well acted and hilarious play. It definitely is one of the greatest comedies ever made and certainly one of the best casted movies ever. What ever scene you switch to, you see a very well done acting, perfect writing and - as mentioned in the headline - fun, fun, fun!Director Charles Chrichton has done a tremendous (final) job with this. One of the greatest comedians ever, John Cleese, starring as Archie Leach, has not only done an usual super job by his acting but also by his writing - Cleese as we know him, as we love him. But there's no space for weak play to see throughout the film: Michael Palin as Ken Pile, a stutterer, for whom he used his real life experience since his father was a stutterer as well; Kevin Kline starring as Otto maybe in his best movie he ever played in and not to forget - Jamie-Lee Curtis starring one the most charming and most beautiful woman you can imagine, Wanda Gershwitz. Last but not least we see Tom Georgeson starring Georges Thomason (no joke!), wherein he shouldn't had much of a problem in playing this character in my humble opinion.As mentioned above, in this movie there's a thick line of pure fun drawn from the very beginning to the very end. Whatever I can describe here, you better watch - and laugh - it yourself. Anyways I would never spoil my readers by making them laugh before they watched the movie. Let me just mention, that one men in Denmark literally died (heart-attack) by laughing too much when watching this movie!The plot is explained easily: four robbers, Wanda, Otto, Ken and Georges,do what robbers usually do - they rob a bank. The prey, a few quite big diamonds, is stored in a garage but George decides to store them somewhere else after everybody has left the garage. In the same time,Wanda and Otto, who are together, betray George, who thinks, he is together with Wanda on the other hand, by calling the police to a place he should meet up with Wanda. George goes to jail and Wanda and Otto find out, that the prey is gone. So they try their best to get back the diamonds. And that's where Wanda reveals all her weapons as a woman by hitting on George's lawyer, Archie. In plus there's Ken, which will be seduced too by Wanda to give out some useful info to her. Wanda actually keeps a tight rein on all her men around. It might be OK to mention, that she kisses all men at a certain time in the movie. In the end we have a puree of intrigues, lies, seductions, desires and tactics based on... fun!The writing of John Cleese is outstanding. Every line stands for it's own and obviously it was extra written to complete exactly this scene of the film. Nothing seems insincere or anywhere plastic. Especially since the way of acting of all the actors is perfectly done. This combination is nothing more and nothing less then just super to watch. As a viewer you never feel left alone since the pictures you witness to see are always touching you in a certain way - whatever your age might be, from 8 to 88.It would be understated to just "highly recommend" this movie. It literally is a must-see - in a way that everybody who claims he even likes movies, has to see this flick! You won't regret any second of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It takes time for "Wanda" to get funny, but then it gets really, really funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Only the second half of this farce is funny, so is it worth enduring the leaden first half? Absolutely. There isn't a single laugh until John Cleese shows up to stay, which he doesn't really for quite a while. But once he becomes the center of the film, and once all the supporting characters' ticks have been primed for callbacks, the laughs arrive and they are persistent. A farce has to escalate, through unlikely coincidences and misunderstandings, to the point of sheer madness and then beyond. "Wanda" does that. By the grand finale every character is deeply enmeshed in his or her own particular neuroses and has taken them farther than seemed possible.The big one, the ripe target that Cleese must have had foremost in mind when he wrote the film, is Kevin Kline's perfect caricature?no, perfect encapsulation?of a Nietsczhe-reading, Ayn Rand-worshiping, ugly American Libertarian. His arc, which culminates in the most incredible set piece ever played out on an airport tarmac and is capped off by a wicked reference to Apartheid as the credits roll, is the most delightful takedown of that kind of person ever likely to be committed to film. He even has the douchey hat and soul patch that make up the unofficial uniform of America's most unjustifiably hubristic keyboard warriors.But Kline is not the only great element of the movie; merely the greatest. Michael Palin's dogged quest to assassinate an innocent old woman is probably one of the boldest things I've seen in a comedy, because what he murders instead is even more outside the bounds of cinematic fair play. It is the kind of thing that could lose the audience and make the movie an unpleasant experience regardless of any other consideration, and for some sensitive viewers that is probably the effect. But most will forgive it, because the utter excess of it all, and Palin's horrified reaction to his errors, turn the darkness into rich dark comedy. Palin's character has a stutter, which is another dicey area to tread, but the jokes involving his speech impediment are meant to be at the expense of others.Rounding out the cast, Jamie Lee Curtis plays a double-dealing jewel thief with a quirky fetish. Hers is probably the silliest and least funny of the movie's threads, and the awkwardness of seeing her lock lips with every character and several inanimate objects never fully wears, or pays, off. But she serves as a catalyst for Cleese's own antics, which include a Basil Fawlty-esque scenario in which, for reasons that are all quite logical, he is found dancing stark nude and speaking Russian at the top of his lungs by a proper middle-class family who looks on in horror.It takes a while for "Wanda" to come to that and to the other juicy bits, but they are worth the wait.</fullReview>

The movie stars Jamie Lee Curtis together with Kevin Kline,Michael Palin and its co- screenwriter and director,John Cleese.London-based gangster George Thomason and his right-hand man, Ken Pile, an animal lover with a bad stutter, plan a jewel heist. They bring in con artist Wanda Gershwitz and "weapons man" Otto West, a loud- mouthed Anglophobe who fancies himself an intellectual.Wanda and Otto are lovers, but they hide this from George and Ken, pretending to be brother and sister, so Wanda can work her charms on them. The robbery goes well, and the thieves get away with a large sum in diamonds. But the ambitious con artist uses her sexual wiles to obtain jewels.First, she romances Georgeson's dimwitted but deadly henchman. Then, to clear the path for her getaway with , Jamie woos Georgeson's starched- shirt attorney whom she genuinely falls in love with. No question about it that this film will definitely provide the viewer a great viewing experience.It has strong performances from its solid cast especially Kevin Kline,who won an Oscar in it.Also,the screenplay was smartly written and engaging.The change of genre in the story is what is definitely surprising as it started as a heist movie and later turns out to be more that what it appears to be as it becomes more complex afterwards as we get to see the goofiness of the characters afterwards.It is definitely a vintage classic comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful farce</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard for me to choose my favourite comedy starring John Cleese, as it's a toss-up between this wonderful farce and the lower-budgeted CLOCKWISE. Both are equally good, I think. A FISH CALLED WANDA is just a superb piece of comedy film-making, a film which always makes me wonder why the follow-up (FIERCE CREATURES) was so horrible and why Cleese never really made it in Hollywood.The madcap plot throws plenty of disparate elements into the mix, involving diamond heists, lawyers, and a loveless marriage, but it's the characters who really make this one shine. Cleese and Curtis hold it all together as the relatively straight protagonists, but it's in the support where things get really interesting. Kevin Kline's Oscar-winning turn as the psychotic Otto is absolutely hilarious, with never a dull moment, and really the lynchpin that makes the whole movie work.Then there's the stammering Michael Palin, almost as good, as the animal-loving and bumbling criminal who soon finds himself completely out of his depth. His torture sequence is the stuff of genius and the presence of both Palin and Cleeve give this whole movie a MONTY PYTHON feel (even though it has nothing to do with MONTY PYTHON other than the presence of the two stars). An inspired sense of lunacy and energy combine to make A FISH CALLED WANDA an all-out classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"It is brilliantly written, uproariously funny and goes along at a pace as fast as the crack of a whip."A lot has been said about A Fish Called Wanda, everything has been said rightly, in fact this movie deserves the accolades. The movie epitomizes the term comedy classic in every way. The film looks great too, with the cinematography skillful and striking. The story is wonderfully constructed with seldom a dull moment, while the acting is superb. Four criminals come together to pull off a daring jewel robbery. Wanda is in relationship with George; tries to get rid off him with Otto (another roberer), portrayed as Wanda's brother among the robbers. It is great fun to watch each character trying to con the other out of their share of the loot. Its hilarious to listen to K..K..Ken trrr.... too... trying to negotiate with Otto. Its funny to see Archie's relationship with Wanda develop while his relationship with his wife has almost stagnated. Whether it's John Cleese's dance, Kevin Kline's rips at England, Michael Palin's stuttering, or Jamie Lee Curtis's deadpan performance, they know how to do everything here. I can't describe how funny the movie is; you just have to see it. And you may very well die laughing - or if nothing else, you'll want to take a trip to England. Kevin Kline definitely deserved his Oscar. And of course, the cast teamed up again for another funny movie "Fierce Creatures" (not Achieved the kind of success as this movie did). So go get yourself one of the best doses of comedy of 80sMy Rating ? 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Cleese has to be my favourite Python. He is a good actor, almost a certainty when you talk British actors, and funny in all the best ways. You can be funny in a silly way or you can be a great comedian, as John Cleese is. He perfectly plays an old-fashioned English barrister, being his formal life a joke itself.Michael Palin is Cleese's partner-in-crime in the Pythons. He plays a funny role, as his character is the last thing you'd point as a delinquent. His struggle with his stud adds to the fun, but again, not in a cheap way.His nemesis is played by Kevin Kline. His s the case of those actors that have a different personality with a moustache (here) or without (Cry Freedom). He plays Otto, who hates being called stupid.Jamie Lee Curtis, at her best, plays the girl of the film. She is a bit of a teaser in pursuit if her own ambitions. Along Kline, Palin and Tom Georgeson (called in the film George Thomason)form the criminal gang.Without giving away any of the plot, and though probably most people has already seen it, I can say there's a robbery. To cover the crime, the gang try all sorts to divert the evidence and create several minutes of laughter.I must have seen this film over 10 times, and I enjoy every time. It was such a success the 4 main actors tried to recreate the chemistry in this masterpiece in 'Fearce Creatures', but this didn't work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"A fish called Wanda" is one of the best comedies of all time. I have this feeling...I remember I saw it for the first time 15 years ago, in an Italian theater -I was in Tuscany on holiday. I remember a hall full of people, everyone laughed so loud that sometimes dialogues were not comprehensible! In the following years I watched it again and again, on TV, on tape and finally on DVD.This is a low budget film, made in Britain with excellent actors. Dialogues are very well written -actually they're like a character in the movie. You also see that actors are enjoying themselves! It's like an old British comedy -the director was one the biggest Ealing studios comedies director-, with a touch of Monty Python's humour and full of jokes between English and Americans. A jewel!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great fun.. WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Cleese defined himself as the true maverick of British comedy and broke successfully away from his MONTY PYTHON days and his phenomenal success with the classic series FAWLTY TOWERS by combining his talents with those of late Ealing veteran Charles Crichton to make A FISH CALLED WANDA. After the failure of CLOCKWISE, which isn't as memorable as his other works, he bounced back with a terrific comedy-thriller in the style of those Ealing comedies whilst combining the vicious comic touch that defined some many episodes of PYTHON.Although it is very, very funny at times and the performances are excellent, one can't help wondering if Kevin Kline's Otto is a reworking of Basil Fawlty. There are one or two key moments in the film which sum it up, firstly in the scene where they discover no diamonds in the garage safe and secondly when Otto interrupts the love scene between Archie and Wanda in the riverside apartment.For all that though, the subplot of Ken trying to kill the lady who has identified one of the members of the gang who has three little terrier dogs is sidesplitting (especially the image of the dog killed on the zebra crossing)A great gem.</fullReview>

If you have not seen this, I strongly advocate renting it tonight!!!!Easily one of the funniest I have seen to date... Kevin Kline is masterly as the know-it-all-who-actually-knows-nothing-about-anything hit-man, Michael Palin is brilliant as the stuttering, mawkish, animal loving assassin, John Cleese is typically hilarious and Jamie Lee Curtis' Wanda is refreshing as the only "normal" character in the movie...It's brilliance can never be equaled, as was evident by the attempted 'sequel' (Fierce Creatures), which, though humorous in parts, never rises to even half the heights "A Fish Called Wanda" attained. This one remains an absolute must watch!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where's Mr. Fawlty?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm saddened to be unable to give this film a good review, written by John Cleese, who could be referred to as the thinking man's thoughtless man, and who was so funny and over the top in "Fawlty Towers". Lesson: never go mainstream (unless you want to make money, of course). One is left wondering: how much of Fawlty Towers was owed to Mrs. Cleese's penwomanship. This movie contains fewer chuckles than a joke my dad used to tell: on a very hot day, an old man was wearing a winter coat and sweating profusely. When asked why he doesn't take the coat off, he says: "It can't the coat, I've no problems with it in winter".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie when it was first released, but now that it's been issued as a two-DVD set (with Cleese's explanation of how he put the film together), I thought I'd buy it and watch the movie again. I was surprised how little I remembered, but it definitely seemed funnier the second time round. What stood out most was Kline's over-the-top but very funny and confused character, Palin's stuttering (which could so easily have been embarrassing) used as a tension creating device, and Curtis's sexy and manipulative character. All four main characters were well played. This isn't the funniest film ever made, but it's certainly a good example of how to make a successful comedy. 8/10 for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is there anything wrong with this movie? Not that I could see.This is a gut-busting, rib-cracking, rolling on the floor comedy. An outstanding cast plays every part in this story about the search for diamonds that were stashed after a robbery in London absolutely perfectly. There are four main characters. John Cleese is as close to a straight man as there is, playing the barrister Archie, but perhaps the funniest moment in the whole movie belongs to him as he strips naked while dancing in a friend's condo, only to have complete strangers walk in on him. Jamie Lee Curtis is no horror movie queen here. She is sizzling hot as the sexy and sultry Wanda. Kevin Kline steals the show in an over the top performance as the out of control Otto and Michael Palin is hilarious as the stuttering, animal-loving Ken.If ever you need a laugh, watch this. It is absolutely superb. A definite 10/10.</fullReview>

Kevin Kline made me laugh so hard, i almost hit the floor. He really deserved that Oscar! the film was delicious (and i mean it), funny, smart and charming. some people may complain that the film may be a bit vulgar in its taste but for me, you shouldn't mess with art because this film is a huge piece of art. there were some very funny scenes, especially the love-making scenes Otto and Wanda have. Otto West may be one of the funniest characters that we have seen on film. John Cleese, who played Archie Leach, wrote the film and he deserves kudos because he had a smart sense of humor of writing this film and i praise him for it. i love this film. once again, it is a very delicious movie and if you want to see a good comedy that will tickle your funny bone, this may be it for you. for me, no hesitation. you will be amazed!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are a lot of movies out there I would never watch more than once! I've seen this one more than 20 times.How could anything ever go wrong when you have such brilliant casting as is on this film. I never tire of the in's and outs of the comedic performances in this piece! John Cleese, Michael Palin, Jamie Lee Curtis and that other American person... oh yeah Kevin Kline. Superb!!!What a great story!I would kill to work with any of these actors/writers/directors. It makes you wonder why french fries had any other purpose!There is nothing more enjoyable than watching actors that gel when working together!!! You just know they are having fun despite long hours/political issues/producers paranoid delusions... they surpass the trite work experience and blossom into a powerful comedic steam rolling ensemble. :)In my opinion... John Cleese deserved and continues too (long past due) deserve multiple Academy awards for his numerous outstanding performances and contributions to the world and art of comedy... His dry wit and ability to nail the elusive fundamentals of comedic hooks have always been and I surmise always will be a trademark of his exhaustive talent and never ending skill at making all of us laugh.Michael Palin continues repeatedly to nail us!!! Big Surprise!!! He is the cats meow of comedy or in this case the dog stalker of drama!Jamie Lee! What a joy!! She makes the word sexy have to re-define it's own definition. She is one of the few actresses I can think of that can modify a character that doesn't have residual goo clinging from the last one that may of stero-typed her. Mind you sexy is sexy, but she always seems to bypass the chains of the last audiences memory. How does she manage it?And Kevin Kline in my opinion emerged from his cocoon on this one. Not to down play his past acting victories but it was the first film I ever saw him in where I really saw him. You know?It just goes to show what happens when brilliant minds get together... brilliant things happen. In this case... as an audience... we all win! Many thanks need to go to these hard working, unabashed and shy introspective group of performers!!!JC</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best "Post-PYTHON" comedies ever done...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great comedies are difficult to write, and nearly impossible to pull off. All the right elements have to come together, and when they do, it must be a scenario that will keep people laughing time and again. Most comedies can never stand up to that kind of a test upon repeated viewings.Happily, though, "A FISH CALLED WANDA" is one of those rare and brilliant exceptions. Post-Python affairs have been wildly hit and miss at best, with everything from TIME BANDITS to ERIK THE VIKING coming from Terry Gilliam (who does better at offbeat dramas) and the remaining former members of the immortal troupe.With "WANDA," Cleese and company managed to get everything right. The casting, script and droll direction by vet Charles Crichton all mesh perfectly, and at the heart of the film is an absolute jewel of a comedic performance by Kevin Kline. The Academy even got it right for once by handing him the Best Supporting Actor award that year. Now if only the picture had won...The best situation comedies come from the most deceptively simple plots, and this one keeps it basic...at first. American criminals Wanda (Curtis) and Otto (Kline) join forces with George (Georgeson) and Ken (Palin) to pull off a daring jewel heist. All goes well, until the double and triple crosses start flying, and an English barrister (Cleese) suddenly becomes an important factor in deciding who will end up with the loot and the booty (meaning Wanda's!)Jamie Lee Curtis' va-va-va-VOOM performance is tempered by her smart-as-a whip rendering of Wanda, proving that she's smarter than almost all of her male counterparts. There are brains beyond the breasts, and she's not above using either, or even both at the same time! This was one of the big roles that helped her break out of scream-queen hell, (and she hammered the point home again in TRUE LIES.)John Cleese did the smartest thing of all by writing a sharply drawn character for himself as the hapless barrister Archie Leech. Rather than simply fall back on a Pythonesque caricature of a well-bred English stick-in-the-mud, he shows us the heart and desires behind the facade, which makes him funnier and definitely more interesting. His compatriot Michael Palin has always been a whiz at conjuring up more from less, and though Ken gets about a fourth less screen time as his comrades, his stutter and his stamina make him memorably funny indeed.And then there's Kevin. Wacky, slapstick performances are extremely difficult to portray as natural, and as a result only very few comedians can pull it off, let alone actors. But Kline is that rare commodity: an actor capable of doing physical comedy, and not once do you catch his Otto trying to "be funny." As infuriating, egotistical, bigoted, petulant, childish and clueless as he is, he can't help but be hilarious in every frame. Tom Green, take notes. You don't actually have to go out and annoy people in real life to be funny.This is an essential addition to the comedy section of your home VHS or DVD library. In fact, just pretend that FIERCE CREATURES doesn't exist.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One thing good about A Fish Called Wanda that you can't say about most great comedies (Ex: Clerks, Half Baked) is that everyone would enjoy it. It is funny in a sort of light hearted way. Sure there's sexuality, but not to the extreme level of a film like Clerks. It is a good movie because the plot is cleverly devised to keep the characters motivated. The characters are the films real treat. Specifically Kevin Kline and Michael Palin. They play two of four criminals who, as a team, take on a big robbery scheme and then deal with the consequences when one of them is caught. The plot is hardly important. We watch to laugh and we laugh because of Kline and Palin. Both are great all the time, but when they get together, the scenes are truly amazing. Palin is a scared, studdering little man while Kline seems destined to frighten and torture him. I don't know the other actors (Palin, Cleese, etc.) too well, but I do know Kevin Kline and Jamie Lee Curtis and this is the best I've seen the both of them. Kline's comedy is at an all time high with this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved "A Fish Called Wanda" when it first came out, and have seen it a couple of times since then. It never fails to deliver. The script is witty and fast-moving, the jokes hardly ever fall flat. (Think of the scene in which Archie Leach quite literally gets caught with his pants down, or the scene in which Otto is practicing his apology to Archie... these are classic moments in modern comedy!) Kevin Kline's fantastic performance as the dim-witted, blustering Otto (for which he got a well-deserved Oscar) is almost matched by John Cleese as Archie, the repressed barrister gradually breaking out of his shell of British propriety. Excellent work, as well, by Michael Palin and Jamie Lee Curtis. True, some of the humor is overly sadistic (specifically, the abuse heaped on K-K-K-K-Ken). It's something that I would normally consider a fault; but in this case, the movie more than makes up for it with its inventiveness and its crazy, exhilarating vitality. "A Fish Called Wanda" may not have anything "important" to say, but if sheer hilarity and brilliant acting count for anything, it deserves 9 stars out of 10 (which is how I voted).</fullReview>

It is clear that screenwriter Cleese was beginning to lose his touch for sublime comedy, but he had enough left to cobble together a fast-paced and funny film about four bungling thieves and a lawyer who somehow gets involved. Does one ever think that maybe he wrote the entire film just to get some play with Jaime Lee Curtis? Anyway, she is very sexy in the film and an attractive female character: she knows just what she can use her sexuality for and does everything willfully. She is no plaything for men. When Cleese asks her to behave at the end of the film, you simply know that she will not. Palin is wonderful, and of course Klein is great, although not as funny as I remember him. I guess that his later performances have watered this one down a bit. He is talented, but somewhat repetitive. All in all, a good film, and an even better one when compared to the dreck that was coming out at the time (Funny Farm?)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now here is a movie one should have seen. It's simply great. It is obvious that you can leave it up to Cleese to write a comedy, in style of Fawlty Towers and a glimp of Monty Python. I think that Ken could not have been played by any other man than Palin. It's as if his stuttering and yet expertise in robberies are like second nature. All characters in th emovie have a sort of natural thing about them. the way they meet and their behaviour. I must admit that this was the first movie I saw with Jamie Lee after Halloween and I could not believe it, she had grown, and she played her part so well, the sexy girl with a brain, ofcourse only for selfimprovement. And Kline is at his best as the, don't call me stupid, brother (?). I love it how he tries to keep Wanda for himself while she is trying to get rid of everyone. Anyway this movie is one of the greatest comedies ever written, as I mentioned before comparible with Mont Python and Maybe, but that's totally my opinion, Wayne's World.

		<shortDescription>A late masterpiece from a master of English comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By a sad coincidence, the death of the veteran English director Charles Crichton was reported the day after I watched "A Fish Called Wanda" on TV, some ten years after first seeing it in a cinema. Here a peerless cast gives us over the top classic comedy that sweeps us along with its own nutty logic to a thoroughly satisfying conclusion. Crichton, the director of several brilliant comedies in the 1950s for Ealing Studios (including The Lavender Hill Mob), was, at the age of 78, able to use his sense of timing and of the ridiculous in the more liberated social climate of the 1980s to demonstrate the matchless ability of the British to send up Americans - and themselves.The plot is a routine crime caper - gang of jewel thieves fall out after successful heist and knock each other out trying to recover the loot. The interest is in the characters. Wanda (Jamie Lee Curtis) is as American as apple pie and as shameless as a cat on heat, particularly when spoken to in Italian. Her attempts to seduce Archie Leach (John Cleese) the barrister acting for Tom, the jailed leader of the gang, in order to find the location of the loot are set pieces in manipulation. Yet what happens? She falls in love with the guy. Archie (who happens to sport Cary Grant's real name) for his part has met the woman who, even if she is a crook, will liberate him from his charmless family and more importantly, from that curse of being English, the fear of embarrassment. He finds that Russian works with Wanda too. Wanda's "brother" Otto (Kevin Kline), the stupidest jewel thief uncaught, is almost unbelievably over the top. Yet his comic menace fits the situation somehow, giving a counterpoint to Michael Palin's Ken, the stuttering and squeamish hitman (and owner of a fish called Wanda). There is a slightly cruel tinge to some of the comedy here such as the fate of the old lady eyewitness (and her dogs). But she is portrayed as such a nasty old biddy that we laugh at her demise. A few things are anachronistic - the incredibly polite and security unconscious police, prison and airport staff are a throwback to the fifties as is Geoffrey Palmer's decidedly not with it judge. The ending is definitely not 50's, however."A Fish Called Wanda" did well critically and at the box office. After 10 years it is still funny, even if John Cleese (who did the script with Charles Crichton) is really just doing a slightly less manic Basil Fawlty, and even if Wanda and Otto are total cariciatures. It's the combination that works here to provide satisfying comedy, underpinned by Michael Palin's more understated approach. "Fierce Creatures" made with the same four stars in 1997 and also co-scripted by John Cleese, but with different direction, was a flop. Pity. The admirable Crichton knew how to make comedy work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A great screwball comedy of which Carole Lombard herself would be proud. John Cleese, Jamie Lee Curtis, Kevin Kline and Michael Palin - they are absolutely brilliant in their interactions with each other and their naturalness in doing so. Even little details, like Curtis with hair remover on her upper lip and her hair in curlers, make the viewer feel like they are watching from a window. The side-splitting scenes are frequent, Cleese dancing in the nude, Kline shouting "K-K-K-K-K-Ken is c-c-c-oming to k-k-kill me!" left me wanting more. I was disappointed in the sequel but will always treasure this first one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty Good, Maybe Not As Funny As It Wants to Be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In London, four very different people team up to commit armed robbery, then try to double-cross each other for the loot.What bothers me right off the bat is this idea that Jamie Lee Curtis is attractive and can lure people. This was not the first film where she was used in this way, and certainly not the last ("True Lies"). But it is confounding, because she really is just not the sort of person you expect to be the "sexy woman" in Hollywood films.That nitpick aside, this was a nice film from some of the Monty Python folks (John Cleese, Michael Palin). Interestingly, neither one of them stole the show -- that honor goes to Kevin Kline. Maybe I am mistaken, but I always got the impression Kline lingered just below the A-list and just above the B-list, and no one knew what to do with him. A shame. He is a real talent, with an incredible comedic skill.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can be said about this movie? It's so good that describing how excellent it is just can't really be put into words, but I'll give it my best shot.The best character by far is Otto, the lovable, ex-CIA agent "weapons man" who is actually dumber than dirt, yet likes to read books on philosophy (but would be better off with Dr. Seuss). Kevin Kline deserved that shiny Oscar for his portrayal of a character so painfully stupid that he has no idea how dumb he really is.Jamie Lee Curtis plays the role of the sexy American girl who seduces John Cleese in an effort to find out whether he knows where the diamonds are, but since John Cleese is stuck in a loveless marriage with an uptight, frigid bitch, he's REALLY hooked by Jamie Lee Curtis.And of course, who can forget the lovable Michael Palin as the kind-hearted animal lover with a bad stutter who has the job of "rubbing out" the little old lady but accidentally pops off her little puppies (he is heartbroken by this) but feels no guilt for taking out a little old lady (who actually isn't particularly nice, and has heart troubles anyway).What makes this movie so awesome is that there are real characters, not stereotypes, and the movie is wonderfully quotable, and has that Monty Python flavor but with a true plot that viewers can hook into, even if they don't like or haven't seen Monty Python before.wonderful movie, my favorite movie ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Laughing Just Thinking About the Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the funniest movies I've ever seen! I remember seeing this in the theater and having to go back and see it again because I missed so much of the dialogue while laughing hysterically at points. My stomach was in stitches and after a while it even started to hurt from laughing so much!A Fish Called Wanda never lets up! Whoever thought of this one made pure comic genius come to life on the screen. I've seen some funny movies in my time but this one here takes the prize! Each and every character was hilarious. I don't know who I liked better...John Cleese, Kevin Kline or Michael Palin but anytime either of them come on the screen be prepared to lose it. Be on the look out for Kevin Kline when he tries to come up with a name, for John Cleese's wife, as well as Michael Palin's "particular" trouble when being questioned by John Cleese towards the end! You'll know exactly what I am referring about when you see it--talking about losing your mind with laughter!There are truly so many moments of pure funniness that it doesn't even make sense to try and review this movie because I won't be able to do it justice...but here is a snippet of what to expect. A gang of thieves commit a robbery, then try to double cross one another for the loot. There is a key which opens the lock to the stolen treasure which only one of them knows the location of and its the finding of where the key is hidden by the others that starts all the fun! Forget the fact that you don't know me, just trust me on this one....A Fish Called Wanda makes for a hilarious time no matter who you be or where you come from. However, I will issue this one serious warning: Do not try to eat or drink anything while watching this movie because you are quite capable of choking to death from laughter!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a classic comedy with the perfect cast especially Monty Python players, John Cleese and Michael Palin. Cleese played Archie Leach, a British barrister, who is to defend George in the courts. Michael Palin played stuttering Ken in an unforgettable role about an animal loving hit man. Oscar winner Kevin Kline played Otto in a brilliant comedic performance. Jamie Lee Curtis plays Wanda Gurwitz, the woman who is conning the others. All for the sake of the jewels in this caper that are worth 20 million dollars in 1988, the film was done with John Cleese and Charles Crichton. Both men collaborated in bringing this project to life. Supporting cast included Maria Aitken as Wendy Leach; Patricia Hayes as the old lady Mrs. Coady; and Geoffrey Palmer as the judge in the courts. Anyway, the film was a small project but it grossed millions of dollars despite some negative reviews. While it's very British, the film has it's moments of humor. Every scene is detailed and choreographed to create an effect and get a laugh and follow the storyline. I didn't like the animal cruelty with the dogs or the cats but it was make believe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Smart Comedy That Will Keep You Entertained</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The heist comedy A Fish Called Wanda is directed by John Cleese and Charles Crichton and stars John Cleese, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Kevin Kline. The film takes place in modern day England.The film starts off with a four person armed bank heist. When the four of them escape the police they keep the money in a safe in a hide out. Wanda and Otto (Curtis and Kline) turn in one of their co-robbers to be able to take the money for themselves. But it turns out the money is not there. Wanda tries to gain the trust of her co-robber's attorney, Archie (Cleese), to find out where the money is. The whole film is about how Wanda and Otto try and get off with the money without being caught by the others.The screenplay was by John Cleese and it was pretty well written. There was a lot of witty dialogue and good jokes. What the script lacked really was character development, because most of the characters were one dimensional, such as Otto and pretty much Wanda even though that could be argued. There were some coincidences in the film such as towards the end involving Otto and some cement. Personally I don't find animal cruelty that funny, just cruel.The direction by Cleese and Crichton was solid. One shot in particular I liked was when Archie was hanging upside down outside the building by Otto and the camera flipped to show how he was hanging. The two of them got very good performances from the whole cast. There were really no glaring things that I was against because of the direction.The editing for this film was very smooth and flowed very well. Yet nothing made me think during the film wow, great editing choices.The acting was very good, definitely kept the strongest part of the film. Curtis was very charming as Wanda and delivered all her lines very well. It seemed that everyone gave their best acting when they were around Kevin Kline though. He deserved to get nominated but I guess it was a bad year since he won the award. He was great as the foul mouth, stupid American. John Cleese played the part of the uptight British gentleman very well also. The whole cast gave great performances.Overall I give this film a 7/10 due to the great acting. I would recommend this to anyone who likes smart comedies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost wanda-ful...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've just recently finished Michael Palin's second set of diaries taking in the 1980 - 1988 period, which includes some interesting behind the scenes stuff on the making of his Python mate John Cleese's most successful film "A Fish Called Wanda". I'm a big Python / Palin/ Cleese fan and knowing the film had a good reputation (as evidenced by its high average mark here) knew I was onto a good thing.With old-time Ealing director Charles Crichton also on board as co-writer and director it couldn't really fail and so we get a fun frothy sex-farce, where the world's most eccentric criminal band, - the thief, his stuttering mate, double-crossing American sex-bomb girlfriend and her philosophically stupid lover (with thanks to Peter Greenaway), inveigle staid-as-tweed barrister John Cleese his Archie Leach character tellingly named after the real name of the actor who so often played the innocent man swept up by events, the incomparable Cary Grant, in their attempts to get their hands on a diamond-stash.The plot goes into several different comic vignettes, mostly successful and highly amusing before we get to the happy ending as Cleese gets the girl and her the diamond, while stuttering Michael Palin loses his stammer and Kevin Kline his body under a steamroller.Cleese and Palin stand out, the latter in particular in a near-grotesque part, forever the butt of psychotically jealous Kline's scorn and as the plot thickens, a most unusual torture involving fish and chips but not as you'd think. Kline is acrobatic and well out-there pretty much all of the time - for my taste he occasionally overdoes it, while the statuesque Jamie Lee Curtis as usual gets to her underwear and gets to play the hard-boiled tough-talking brainy American female pulling all the strings. She's effective but Cleese calling her the most beautiful thing he's ever seen is pushing it a bit, plus her costumes throughout just tend to highlight how dated the "Laura Ashley" look has become. The rest of the cast is filled with staples from British stage and screen, Tom Georgeson (playing a wittily named character George Thomason), Patricia Hayes as a doomed OAP witness, Geoffrey Palmer, Maria Aitken and even Stephen Fry in a brief scene near the end.It's all good lively fun and there are several scenes you'll remember with a smile. Little bits are over-written and overplayed, Palin is right in his diary when he asserts that Kline's return outside the plane window is wrong, plus the awful 1980's soundtrack and fashions date it a little but this is still an entertaining romp peopled by familiar faces having fun with a crazy knockabout plot at which Cary himself wouldn't turned up his nose.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There are hits and misses here, but mostly hits</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was only a toddler when this smash hit comedy was released, so I didn't even know about it until much later. I watched it for the first time a couple years ago, knowing John Cleese and Michael Palin, of Monty Python fame, were in it. I hadn't seen Kevin Kline in anything else at the time, though he's also a big part of the comedy here. During my first viewing, it may not have been exactly what I was expecting, but from what I remember, I thought it was pretty good overall. Watching it for a second time two years later, obviously knowing what to expect this time, I think it was a lot like my first viewing, maybe a bit better.Wanda Gershwitz and the Anglophobic Otto West are an American couple who have come to England, posing as siblings, to join two English criminals, George Thomason and Ken Pile (an animal lover who owns several fish, one called Wanda) in a diamond heist. Wanda and Otto call the police and turn George in, so they can have the loot to themselves, but when they go to claim it, and Wanda is about to betray Otto as well, it isn't there! George has already moved the diamonds to another place, and only he knows where they are! To try and find out where they are, Wanda decides to seduce George's lawyer, Archie Leach. As much as Otto hates to be called stupid, he is not very bright, and his temper could make this mission harder to fulfill.Otto, played by Kevin Kline, is one nasty character, and one thing in the film I didn't care much for was certain comments from him about Ken Pile's (Michael Palin) stuttering. However, for the most part, Kline's character is good for laughs, providing such funny moments as his reaction to seeing that the loot is gone, and how much he shows he hates being called stupid. Most of the laughs probably come from him, but the two former Pythons in the cast (Palin as Ken Pile and Cleese as Archie Leach), are also highlights, unsurprisingly. The sub-plot with Ken trying to kill the only witness, an elderly woman named Mrs. Coady, is dark and tasteless (as with much of the rest of the film), but funny. Jamie Lee Curtis' performance as Wanda Gershwitz is shaky at times, but usually isn't a problem.Despite how much of a hit "A Fish Called Wanda" turned out to be, there are obviously many people who would strongly dislike it. It's certainly not for kids, and could offend some adults as well, with Kevin Kline's nasty character, Ken Pile's stuttering, animals being killed, etc. It's not for those who will only laugh at perfectly clean, inoffensive humour, you can be sure about that! However, if you're willing to laugh at some dark, tasteless, but well done humour, and you're a fan of Monty Python and/or Kevin Kline, this film could turn out to be a fun romp for you. I'm sure it did for many people who went to see it on the silver screen in 1988, and has for many who have seen it on the small screen in the past two decades since then.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eccentric characters make this movie a joy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I almost always base my decision on the quality of a movie on its plot ? possibly because I'm a professional writer/editor.Using my own criteria, "A Fish Called Wanda" shouldn't be rated a good movie. The number of plot holes is enormous and, frankly, I didn't even care who got the hidden jewels or even whether the thieves were caught and/or found guilty.However, I am giving this movie an 8. Why? In one word, "characters." I'm really hard-pressed to think of a movie with more eccentric characters. These characters made "Wanda" an enjoyable movie.I read at least a few reviews that said this movie wasn't funny. By conventional standards, it wasn't because the one-liners and comedy bits weren't particularly strong on their own. What made this movie funny was its characters, their quirky personalities, and their actions. The four primary characters were all extreme.Kevin Kline's character stood out because of his extreme stupidity, impulsiveness, pushiness, and rudeness. Michael Palin's character was extreme in his love for animals and stuttering problems. John Cleese's character was involved in an extremely repressed marriage. Jamie Lee Curtis' character was extremely seductive and had a strange passion for foreign languages.The writers did a great job of creating excellent character conflicts based on the characters' quirks. Kline ate Palin's fish. Cleese was easy prey for Curtis' come-ons. Kline's inability to grasp that girlfriend Curtis was play-acting to get the jewels led him to attack Cleese. Overlaying these individual tussles was a Brit vs. American conflict that provided lots of laughs.For those who don't know, Kline won an Oscar for his performance. In addition, I should point out that the dialogue was often very smart ? particularly when the very attractive Curtis explained how stupid Kline was.I know many people objected to the killing of animals. As I sit here looking at my cute Beagle, I can honestly say that these scenes were funny. They weren't funny because dogs and fish were killed. They were funny because of how the quirky and extreme characters reacted to the deaths.I watched "Wanda" one more time than I usually watch a movie to make sure the plot holes I perceived weren't my own fault. I shouldn't have bothered. "Wanda" deserves to have a point deducted because of its plot holes. If it was a drama, these holes would have led me to give this movie a thumbs-down, but it's a comedy so I rate it as a top-notch movie.ZWrite</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kline shines!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nearly 2 decades after its release, A FISH CALLED WANDA remains one of the most genuinely brilliant and hilarious comedies of all time. Taking into consideration changing senses of humor and evolving tolerance for profanity, WANDA rivals great chase/crime caper comedies like IT'S A MAD, MAD, MAD, MAD WORLD and THE GREAT RACE.Kevin Kline is more than just a respected actor of today, in my humble opinion. He is up there with legends like Jack Lemmon and Ethel Merman, who are the main villainous yet lovable characters in the above older movies. His performance as OTTO is so beautiful and so genius, and that he won an Oscar for a comedic role is proof that he is a living legend, and a standout, given that most Oscars are handed out for dramatic movies and roles. And everyone knows comedy is so much harder to do on screen than drama.The versatile Kline used multiple accents and combined American and British humor using John Cleese's terrific script. And although Kline clearly stole the show, Cleese, along with Jamie Lee Curtis and Michael Palin, do not do too bad themselves in their roles.It's a classic worthy of an A+.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off I didn't see this in the movie theater. I really missed out on the whole Big-Screen effect!! UUgh! This was a movie that I didn't feel any interest in, until my friend said, 'Have you ever seen this movie?'... And of course we got together at the estate that he was a caretaker for and sat watching this one Saturday afternoon in 1993. I hadn't laughed so hard in a long while! For there were four, proper English folks, that banded together as a single unit, to pull off a heist and then proceed to stab each other in the back. How uncivilized! John Cleese is awesome as the quiet spirited and sentimental Barrister for the accused. The boss, that set up the "bunch" for the express purpose of robbing and stealing. Then there's the lovely Wanda Gershwitz,( Jamie Lee Curtis ) Along with (Michael Palin) Ken Pile and if you have ever seen this you know just who 'stole the show' Otto! Kevin Kline gives a solid gold performance as a thief off the cuff! This is one of my top-hit favorite comedies, with the likes of off-color movies like 'Used Cars' and 'Brain Donors' "Can't Buy Me Love" etc.This is a highly recommendable comedy favorite that any fan of any of these actors will want to see this repeatedly.

		<fullReview>A fish called Wanda is a freak out film. You can watch this film for actors, dialogs, story and just 'Otto'. Five people from different walks of life are involved in a bank robbery. A lawyer gets involved as one of the robber is held under suspicion.Its a very intelligent comedy. Some parts are really very good but the film also has boring patches for example woman and her dog track. I find Curtis not so good looking and so her scenes where she seduces are not very convincing. Now the good part. John Cleese as lawyer is hilarious. His apology to Otto is phenomenal. That whole apology is so hilarious "any distress that my comments may have caused you, or your family" :&gt;. Palin's strutter is also very hilarious. The last scene where Cleese and Palin work out a hotel's name together is very good. Otto is fantastic. It's one of those films which you end up watching every time its aired on TV. good time pass.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant all the way round</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Fish Called Wanda is successful to me because of the combination of different types of humour involved, from the visual to the verbal all the way to that brilliant tag line - "A tale of murder, lust, greed, revenge and seafood".Much of the comedy is down to the characters themselves. I think Kevin Kline as Otto is particularly good at not only physically being funny through his actions, but also through his dialogue and especially through his facial expressions (one scene with Wanda that involves him speaking a considerable amount of Italian in a very musical voice springs to mind). Otto is described as a "psychopath" and there is a good indication of what he might be capable of, conveyed so well through his "Don't call me stupid" line. We see him meditate outside Archie's house but it doesn't seem to help him manage his rage.The opening of the film made me think how well the characters are introduced, particularly in the case of Archie's wife Wendy Leach and their horrendously annoying yet also naive (in a sense) daughter Portia. It's amazing how you know you're going to dislike them within the time it takes each to finish their first sentence in the film. If Portia was my daughter, or even my sister, she would drive me mad.There are some well-constructed characters in A Fish Called Wanda. Poor Ken is a person you feel such sympathy for, especially when Otto is picking on him about his stutter, and you wonder how exactly this animal-loving man could ever bring himself to commit a crime. He is also mentally tortured beyond measure as his attempts to kill an elderly witness go terribly wrong, and he feels so guilty that the results of this clash in such an unforgiving way with his love of the animal kingdom.Wanda is particularly difficult to define. She is such a complex person, putting on so many different acts with everyone that it makes you question how she really sees things. There is a spark between her and Archie right from the start - she charms him so much that she can easily acquire far more information than she should have.As well as well-constructed characters, there are some very well crafted scene montages in the film. Their is a wonderful parallel between the way Otto and Wanda spend the night and the way Archie and Wendy sleep together - in separate beds. Otto's expressions in this sequence are - once again - priceless. A very funny moment - in terms of the way it is shot - shows Archie eating a necklace.I've always liked the music in A Fish Called Wanda. It begins the film in a way that is fluid, languid, aquatic and romantic and can just as seamlessly change to become energetic and dramatic, building up the pace so well at crucial moments.</fullReview>

When his girlfriend and her lover-Otto double crossed George, who came up with the idea. But when George is being sent to prison and George changed the place, where he hide the loot. Since Winda and Otto can't find it. Where George hide the loot in a new location. Then Wanda is trying to seduced George's Lawyer:Archie Leach (John Clesse) to find out, if he knows about the jewels but Archie ended up falling in love with Wanda.Directed by Charles Crichton (The Lavender Hill Mob) made a clever, outrageous comedy that become instant Contemporary Classic. It is one of these rare comedies that never seems to run out of energy from this talented cast. Kevin Kline steals every scene in his flamboyant comic performance that won him an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. This film was a Box Office Hit in the Summer of 1988. This might might offend some people. This is one the funniest movie ever made. Clesse and Palin re-team together again from their glory comedy days from the Monty Python's group. Screenplay by the actor:Clesse from his own story and by the director, which they receive an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay. Director:Crichton receive an Academy Award nomination for Best Director. Clesse, Curtis, Kline, Palin, Maria Aitken (Who plays Clesse's wife in the film) and Cynthia Clesse (Clesse's real-life daughter) re-team together again in the wildly uneven but funny:Fierce Creatures (1997).

		<shortDescription>A great comedy for all...too bad I couldn't give it more than a 10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a big fan of the work of Michael Palin, I just couldn't resist picking up this movie at the video store last week. It is drop-dead hilarious! Palin, along with fellow Python John Cleese, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Kevin Kline form the core of what is indeed one of the greatest comedy movies I've ever seen! Each of the main characters possesses a truly unique personality and distinctive trait, from poor K--K--K--Ken's stuttering to Otto's (Kline) brutishness to Wanda's (Curtis) ability to seduce people like Archie (Cleese). The writing and directing makes the film flow along very smoothly. Indeed, this is one movie I am going to see again and again. I highly recommend this film for anyone who loves comedy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Cleese, Michael Palin, Kevin Kline, and Jaime Lee Curtis bring this classic to life. John Cleese, who also wrote the script, plays a proper British man who wants to break free. Michael Palin is the stuttering animal lover. Kevin Kline is the typical stupid American, who thinks he is a genius, and Jaime Lee Curtis is the woman they think they know, and love. These four give great performances and work exceptionally well together. Kevin Kline gets the flashiest part and the most fame, but each of the four deserve equal credit. There are classic scenes aplenty such as the Archie balcony dangle, Otto's apology("I am ss...I am very sss...I am so very very sssaahhh! F**k you!"), three dead dogs, with matching funerals, and the, several, Archie/Wanda seduction fiascoes. A very funny movie with enough wit and charm to fill a thousand water tank treasure chests.*Otto: "You're a very attractive man, Ken. You are smart, you've got wonderful bones, and you dress really interestingly."***Otto(driving on the wrong side of the road, barely misses a car): "A**hoooole!"**</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My first of many times to watch it was randomly and without having any idea about it. I still have no real idea what's it about, except poking fun at English stiffs, stutterers, pet lovers, heist men, lawyers , animals and American hit men. Add to it the never seen before perversity of being hopelessly aroused prior to the real act by any vocabulary of Italian or Russian, whatever non sense it may be. And it offers a brilliantly balanced cast from K...K..K.Ken to Wanda, Otto and Archie as the quartet in search of a loot and trying to cheat each other at the blink of an eye. Something you can only pull off after years of Monthy Pythons drill or coming off strong as Kevin Kline. Watch and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The funniest rom-com ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Four jewel thieves pull off the heist of a lifetime, and immediately begin screwing each other over for the loot. Full of twists and turns and some of truly wonderful performances combine to create one of the funniest farces to be put on screen. This movie won Kevin Kline the best supporting actor Oscar. It also enjoyed 6 other wins and 15 nominations, and deservedly so!This is the funniest rom-com ever made. Totally wonderful performances from a star-studded comedic cast showcase this huge hit from 1988. The sheer class of this production was perpetuated by the seeming comfort with one another exhibited by these actors. It appeared as though they really were fast friends, lovers, would-be lovers, and has-been lovers. While the production itself was suspenseful and witty, the relationships were relaxed and easy and played out just as if they were real.Kevin Kline was delightful as the psychotic, sex-crazed, boot-sniffing, insanely jealous lover. He was completely believable in this inventive role as Jamie Lee Curtis' diabolical lover, pretending to be her brother, pretending to be interested in Ken.John Cleese's character was soft and sweet, and totally endearing, while Jamie Lee Curtis (AKA: Wanda) demonstrated pure talent as the obvious, borderline Machiavellian seductress. There wasn't one moment of wasted film, one mis-timed scene, or one lapse in performance quality. Every comedy should aim for the standards set in this work.These types of movies either have it, or they don't. There are no effects behind which to hide poor performances. There is no glitz to disguise a lack of talent or comedic timing. There is simply the actor and the camera. Nothing to color the performances but the director and the score. These types of vehicles are where you discover the true talent of the ages.It rates a 9.2/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quintessential British Comedy: Cleese's individual arrival on the big screen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The biggest challenge when watching this movie is to overcome the temptation to hurl as many superlatives at it as is humanly possible. This is the quintessential British comedy, superior in my view to its apparent successor 'Four Weddings and a Funeral', and a beacon of excellence in a sea of turgid, uninspired offerings from film-makers of a similar era. I have always found John Cleese to be Britain's finest comedian of the past 50 years: and while I'm enticed to use this space as a simple eulogy to his genius, it is important to note that Wanda is far from a one man show. That said, if Cleese is to be remembered for anything other than his magnum opus Fawlty Towers, Wanda would be a fitting touchstone.Director Charles Crichton (a veteran of several 1950s Ealing comedies such as 'The Lavender Hill Mob') assembled a truly fantastic cast: Kevin Kline and Jamie Lee Curtis add trans-Atlantic flair to the proceedings, with Kline particularly brilliant as the psychotic Otto, a hit-man with a penchant for seafood.... Although it's fair to say that the best lines are distributed equally among the cast, Kline bags more than an ample share, and has proved to be one of the more quotable comedic characters of recent times ("I'm, uh, Harvey. Manfred... jen... sen... den"). Jamie Lee Curtis is not quite as convincing as the conniving Wanda, yet more than holds her own while her colleagues produce their finest work (indeed, Kline was awarded an Oscar for his performance). There is excellent support from British actors Maria Aitkin and Tom Georgeson, and of course the wonderful Michael Palin as stuttering Ken, the animal lover.The writing from Cleese is often unnervingly sharp: every single sentence seems to be laced with aesthetic value, and this is a fine achievement considering the film runs for nearly two hours. The farcical scenes (such as Cleese's attempt to hide his affair with Wanda from his wife) are achingly funny, exploiting both Cleese's inimitable brand of physical humour and the frequent juxtapositioning of the attitudes of British and American people towards romance, sex and relationships at large.I love the film. As an ardent 'Towers' fan, this humour is tailor-made for my tastes. While the plot is sometimes a little TOO convoluted for perhaps its own good (a little bit of indulgence from Cleese no doubt), this is still film-making of the highest calibre and remains my favourite comedy to date. Very Highly Recommended 9.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kevin Kline at his best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"A Fish Called Wanda" is a clever caper comedy about Wanda (Jamie Lee Curtis), her boyfriend Otto (Kevin Kline), Georges (Tom Georgeson) and Ken (Michael Palin) who devise a robbery in England. Once it's over we learn that Wanda and Otto are playing Georges and Ken, and soon Ken is in prison, but he's the only one who knows where the loot is, leaving Wanda and Otto desperately trying to figure out where it is. This involves Wanda seducing Georges' lawyer Archie (John Cleese), who they suspect knows where to find the loot (diamonds).What follows is a battle of wits which is off-beat, hilarious and even dramatic. Cleese - who is usually only comedic - is mostly dramatic here. His married, bored and reclusive Archie is something that usually doesn't show up in a caper comedy, and it works almost perfectly here. Cleese plays off Curtis well too, the odd couple have pretty good chemistry.What lifts this film to a new high, though, is Kline's performance as the philosophy spouting, sort-of-psychotic weapons dealer is a spot-on, comic, perfect performance, and Kline's best. Every facial expression, every line, every joke is delivered with a perfect comic timing that beats most straight-out comedians.The supporting performances from Georgeson and Palin are funny and well-played too, Crichton's direction is notable and Cleese's script is wonderful too.Kevin Kline's performance is worth the price of the DVD alone, I recommend, 7.5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Still brilliant after all these yearsHaving discovered the beauty of Monty Python as an early adolescent, I remember jumping to see A Fish Called Wanda, which was written by and stars two of the original cast members of the comedy troupe. I remember finding it hysterical at the ripe age of 14, and watching it at 30, I found it just as amusing, if not a little dated.Starring Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Palin, John Cleese and Kevin Kline (who won a well-deserved Oscar as best supporting actor for his role as `Otto') A Fish Called Wanda does not have a particularly outstanding storyline; heist films are a dime a dozen. What makes this film stand out from the rest is the intelligent and sharp script as well as the brilliant execution by the actors involved. Kevin Kline is particularly brilliant as the Nietzsche spewing doofus who is one part sadist, two parts moron.As previously stated, this film does look dated at times, (you can definitely tell it was filmed in the 80's without paying attention to cars or wardrobe) but this in no way detracts from the sheer excellence of the script and acting. If looking for a comedy that is not run of the mill or formulaic, this film should not be missed.--Shelly</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A superb comedy heist movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>POSSIBLE SPOILERSComedy is the single hardest film genre to create classics in. Truly great comedies are very scarce and today it is very rare to see one in the league of classics such as Kind Hearts and Coronets, Some like it hot, Dr Strangelove, Bringing up Baby, MASH, Monty Python and the Holy Grail, The Man with two brains or Airplane!In my opinion, the last truly great comedy made (with the possible exception of Groundhog Day) was A Fish called Wanda. Directed by Charles Crichton (responsible for The Lavender Hill Mob ? another classic), this is a superb comedy heist movie in the Ealing tradition, but with darker overtones.The plot is too intricately daft to spoil here, but suffice to say the heist goes wrong with double and triple crosses flying left right and centre before the end of reel one. From there things build maniacally to a series of increasingly laugh out loud set pieces. In comedy laughter settles all arguments. As Robert McKee says, one could argue the relative merits of Citizen Kane until blue in the face, but if someone says A Fish called Wanda isn't funny and you have to pity the other person.Needless the say, the screenplay (by John Cleese) is absolutely fantastic. The cast is also uniformly superb. Unlike his character in Clockwise where he essentially played a re-hash of Basil Fawlty, Cleese plays bravely against type as lawyer Archie Leech (apparently Cary Grant's real name). His is the most `normal' character in the film, as he finds himself seduced by beautiful jewel thief Wanda (the equally brilliant Jamie Lee Curtis). Michael Palin contributes a hysterical performance as animal loving, stuttering Ken. However, it is Kevin Kline who really steals the show as Otto, a crazed, psychotic, insanely jealous `Buddhist Rambo'.There really are too many stand-out laughs to list here. Think of Otto hanging Archie out of the window until he apologises. Ken's accidental killings of small dogs as he tries to assassinate the old woman who witnessed the getaway, Otto's inept impersonations of a CIA agent to Archie's snobbish wife, and Archie frantically robbing his own house only to be ambushed by Otto who mistakes him for a genuine burglar. And that's without even mentioning chips up the nose and the hysterical climax at Heathrow airport.If there's one thing that dates the film, it's the hilarious and at the time topical anti-apartheid touch during the epilogue: `Otto emigrated to South Africa and become Minister for Justice' but it doesn't matter. A Fish Called Wanda has wit and sophistication to spare, something the current glut of gross-out alleged comedies have nothing of.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was probably one of the only people around who had not seen this movie, so, after a spirited discussion about it at the office one day, I decided to see if it could live up to its reputation as one of the best comedies of all time. I am a great lover of comedies and one of the problems with the so called "comedies" of today is that they try to rely on the truly sick and shocking to elicit forced, uncomfortable laughter from the audience. This is not true of "A Fish Called Wanda". This movie's most hilarious moments came from brilliant performances by all (most notably Kevin Kline in a well deserved Oscar winning role) and from John Cleese's clever script. The chemistry between the characters was fabulous and lent its hand to a truly enjoyable finished product. The sequence of events fell together nicely, and while there were several implausible plot turns, they did not detract from your enjoyment of the movie. They rather enhanced the overall silliness and hilarity and ensured that you had a smile on your face when the final credits rolled. Put this one on your rental list for your next trip to the video store! A highly recommended comedy classic! </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite what those dim-wits say about "Citizen Kane" being the best film of all time, it remains a fact that you will never see a funnier film than "A Fish Called Wanda." Kevin Kline is at his best in a flawless performance as Otto, a semi-psychotic American jewel thief who helps with a London heist that lands George, the ringleader, in jail. Jamie Lee Curtis plays Wanda, George's lover, who has to worm his defense strategy out of his lawyer (John Cleese). Rife with screwball antics and dozens of pointed jests at those stuffy Brits. Pungent social commentary also makes this a rare comedy that is a film instead of just a movie. Also features Michael Palin as an animal lover who nevertheless manages to accidentally kill several small animals. Kline can make anything sound funny if he tries, so a brilliant script like this is pure gold in his hands ("Shut up! We did not lose Vietnam! It was a tie!"). Includes many marvelous sight gags which make use of falling safes, bed-warmers, and construction machinery. Marvelous stuff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but could have been better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERSIt's always a pleasure to watch a film which features two or more of the Monty Python team. Whilst sometimes the whole product is hilarious, sometimes it's the occasional moment which makes it all the worth while. In "A Fish Called Wanda", with a cast including John Cleese and Michael Palin, you'd expect a hilarious affair where your laughing from start till finish. Sadly for Cleese and company, there are one or two moments of laughter, but a lot of the film is overrated."A Fish Called Wanda" starts as so many decent films do, with a typical robbery. Escaping the law, Wanda (Jamie Lee Curtis), Otto (Kevin Kline), Ken (Michael Palin) and George (Tom Georgeson) all plot behind each other's backs and as a result George is arrested. Attempting to get the lucrative jewels for herself and Otto, Wanda begins to flirt with George's lawyer Archie Leach (John Cleese) since it's likely George will reveal the location to Leach. As the plot progresses, different people seem to be in pole position for the jewels at different times, until an event filled conclusion involving a Stephen Fry cameo, an airport, a barrel of oil and a steam roller.As with the majority of work written by members of the Monty Python crew (Cleese having joint credit for story along with director Charles Crichton), "A Fish Called Wanda" is at it's best during occasional sketches. The individual moments of humour involving Palin's attempts to kill an old lady are absolutely hilarious, and at the same time, so are one or two scenes of farce involving Cleese and Kline. Ultimately however, when the film is put together as a whole, it falls a bit flat.The key flaw with this film is that there are certain characters who grate on the nerves. Kline's cocky American is meant to be a jab at Yank Stupidity, but instead he mearly annoys the audience. At the same time, in contrast Cleese's wife Wendy (Maria Aitken) is an awful spoof of the prim and proper, Upper class, English housewife. Both characters are intentional stereotypes which are meant to make us laugh, but whether it's the actors or the parts themselves, they just don't work."A Fish Called Wanda" is not a bad film. With an amazing cast of superb actors, it should have been the funniest British film of the last thirty years. Sadly, this film collapses in that there are too few scenes of genuine humour. With a wide range of gags, it's a shame that so many fall flat. It's still a film worth viewing, not least for Palin's superb stuttering Ken, but for what it was, it could have been so much better.</fullReview>

All I kept thinking was these people are completely dorky and seriously what makes any of this remotely funny.I did enjoy Jamie Lee Curtis's performance though. She immersed herself into the character and portrays her role very convincingly. In fact all the actors do a great job and are very involved, it's just a shame that I did not enjoy the actual movie.

		<shortDescription>Funny In Parts, But Hardly A Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie was created as a hybrid of 1940-1950's Ealing comedy and later Monty Python-type silliness. The combination didn't quite work as intended.I went to see it in the theater because of all the praise the movie got, but when I saw it, it had some laughs but it was less funny than I had come to expect. The movie's main joke is about the culture clash between the loud, overaggressive Americans versus the over-mannered, comatose Britons, but the stereotypes are so exaggerated they are more irritating than funny.The movie is somewhat redeemed by the scenes with Cleese and Curtis, but the other leads resort to overacting, which in itself is not very funny. As a crime drama, it's not particularly clever either. I was glad to see it once, but I wouldn't bother again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Contains SPOILERs for the movie and DVD)This film ought to be funny, as every critic in the world thinks it is, it has been written by John Cleese, is directed by the talented comedy director Charles Chricton and stars Cleese alongside with Jamie Lee Curtis, Kevin Kline and Michael Palin, all of whom are great comedians. But it just isn´t. The fault is not in the actors, they all do a great job, but it´s Cleese´s script that makes this such a disappointment to me. Many scenes that other critics have praised high, such as Cleese stripping, while the family comes in are hardly funny if you have seen at least one episode of Mr. Bean before this movie. Also Kevin Kline is too good as sadistic maniac Otto. If this was a Monty Python movie, Otto would be such an outragiously exaggerated character, that it would be at least a little bit funny. But Kline acts so naturally that you just hate the guy throughout the movie. It seems to me that the whole movie is made for American audiences rather than British, as the jokes are dumber and Kline and Cleese both mock the British culture all the time. It would´ve been fun to make the both mock each other´s cultures, but Cleese´s only comeback is the comment on Americans losing the Vietnam war. Sadly, a great scene, in which Cleese complains about Rambo, American football etc. was cut and even in the Special Edition DVD it´s a hidden extra.Very little in Cleese´s script is the same comic brilliance, good timing and as funny as his material in Monty Python and Fawlty Towers (Like the Dead Parrot sketch, Ministry of Silly Walks and the Towers episode "Germans"). There are some of those moments, however. Michael Palin´s animal-loving stutterer Ken almost saves the movie for me. The only part that made me laugh is Ken trying to murder the witness, but each time accidentally kills one of her dogs. It´s like a Road Runner cartoon came to life, when the second dog is squashed like a pancake and very, very funny. It also gave me lots of pleasure, when Palin gets his revenge in the end and drives over Otto with a steam roller. It´s Palin alone who lifts this movie´s grade by two whole numbers.6/10The best part: The actual best part was for some idiotic reason deleted from the final movie and it was another part that reminded me of those good Python and Fawlty days. The scene can be seen on the DVD in one of the documents.Cleese tries to get the stuttering Ken to tell him, where has Otto gone with the diamonds. Ken stutters too much, so Cleese can´t make anything out of his speech. ken tries to write it, the pen´s run out of ink and the pencil needs sharpening. The electric type writer hasn´t any paper, it´s no use trying to write with toothpaste on the window and so on. Finally, Palin succeeds on writing the place´s name on the wall with his own blood, with the cut he got from trying to sharpen the pencil with a pen knife.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Was this movie actually supposed to be funny? Their wasn't one funny thing in the entire movie and i don't see how anyone could actually call it a masterpiece. Everybody was just really annoying and i could barely stay awake during this movie. Was the guy with stuttering problem actually supposed to be funny? Or, how about a guy with french fries up his nose and being forced to watch a guy eat his fish? is that supposed to be funny. The plot is a bunch of crap, it has to do with a robbery and everybody begins to turn on each other right after. Kevin Kline is a hit man who reads philosophy but doesn't understand it. Jamie Lee Curtis will sleep with anyone to get the money and John Cleese is the lawyer. Don't waste your time and just watch Monty Python instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wackiest Craziest Characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Four crazy characters team up to steal diamonds, and then try to doublecross each other. Georges Thomason (Tom Georgeson) is the elder. Wanda Gershwitz (Jamie Lee Curtis) is a vixen who play all the men like a fiddle. Otto (Kevin Kline) is blindly in love with Wanda and easily goes violently crazy. Ken Pile (Michael Palin) is the stuttering animal lover. When the double-crossing begins, Georges' attorney Archie Leach (John Cleese) is dragged into the chaos.The wacky craziness is punctuated by Michael Palin and Kevin Kline. They've created two of the craziest most memorable characters. Who can truly forget Kevin Kline shoving that fish back in his mouth? It helps that Jamie Lee Curtis is both beautiful and ballsy. It serves her well in this movie.</fullReview>

Director Charles Crichton assembled a very good cast, a few of them former members of the Monty Python troupe, but it's the Americans who steal the show: Jamie Lee Curtis, convincingly sexy; and Kevin Kline, who creates an utterly original comic dufus.I know it's just a comedy and not to be taken seriously, but I've always hated the scene when Kline eats Michael Palin's fish.

		<fullReview>Have you ever seen a film where you're laughing so hard that youactually start choking, get a head ache and feel like your stomach'sgoing to blow up? Well, this is my "head ache" film. The first time Isaw it, I couldn't stop laughing. I actually found it impossible tostop. Every single scene in the film got a laugh from Otto's stupidityto the infamous fish eating and doggie death scenes. This film isan homage to the old Ealing comedies from the 40's and it feelslike it could be a remake of an old Ealing comedy. The director iseven an Ealing veteran. The script is written by Monty Pythonmember John Cleese and it is a true masterpiece. The charactersare surprisingly well thought out, the dialogue is hilarious and it'sone of the best screenplays of the last 20 years, comedy or not.Charles Crichton has directed a great film with a hand from writerJohn Cleese. Jamie Lee Curtis oozes sexy as Wanda, Kevin Klineoozes cool as Otto and Michael Palin oozes PURE HILARITY asthe stuttering Ken. Although this film has some slow momentsand the two alternate endings are much better than the actualending, it's a pure classic that deserved the praise it's got over theyears.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fish Called Wanda: 8/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Cleese and Michael Palin may be most famous for their Monty Python troupe, Jamie Lee Curtis for Halloween, and Kevin Kline for?being in movies, but one of their most memorable movies is the first one they did together. Which one? A Fish Called WandaCurtis is Wanda, part of a diamond group along with Ken (Palin), George Thomason (Tom Georgeson), and her brother Otto (Kline). They pull off a multi-million pound heist in England, and hide the loot. It seems, though, that Wanda and Otto (who aren't actually brother and sister but lovers) want it all for themselves. So they turn George into the police to try to find out where he hid the loot. It seems the only person George would have told about where the loot is would be his barrister Archie Leach (Cleese). So, naturally, Wanda goes up to him and becomes `friends' with him, much to the dismay of Otto.A Fish Called Wanda is a twistful and delightful comedy that shows the new sex comedies that they don't need gross body functions to be funny. I'm not saying this movie is completely tasteful. Ken, who is an animal lover, accidentally kills dogs. But, it's not too explicit.Most of the humor comes from Kline, who always shows up whenever Archie and Wanda are together, and who pretends he's gay and tries to get Ken. Some of those subplots, such as the gay one and Kline hating people that call him stupid, seem to not matter. But it is funny. Cleese's script is full of surprises. And most of these laughs were genuine, unlike the fakey ones from other movies. Who can forget Kline's shout whenever he's in the car? It is a memorable movie.Kline puts up his best comedic performance, and deserved his Oscar for best supporting actor. He has excellent comedic timing, always putting the joke on at the right time. He had great chemistry with everyone; it seemed to blend in with the lifestyles of the others. Curtis was excellent in a comedic role. Of course, Cleese and Palin are no strangers to comedy. Cleese seemed like a typical British person-stuck up and courteous. He actually talks about that during the film. Palin was great with a stutter that actually is an important part of the film.It seems that A Fish Called Wanda thinks itself as `bad' and `let's offend everyone!' However, it's one of the more tasteful comedies I've seen recently. Its jokes are almost always funny and tasteful, with Kline's trigger-happy attitude that explodes every once in a while. This group, that came back for 1997's Fierce Creatures, were excellent and they look like they had fun together. Which is good for them. However, after the first forty minutes or so, the humor kind of wavers and it becomes a little uneven. There are still jokes, of course, but not as rapid-fire as the ones before. But considering the humor of the film in its entirety, it could be considered a moot point.A Fish Called Wanda is a very hilarious comedy that you'll remember for a while, and looks like it can stick up for repeated viewings, because there are so many jokes you'll forget a lot of them.My rating: 8/10Rated R for language and comic violence and sexuality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>**** out of 5</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's rude, it's crude, it's offensive and it's hilarious. If you haven't split your sides from laughing so hard by the end of this film you'd better check your pulse because you could very well be dead. Monty Python veteran John Cleese wrote and starred in this uproariously funny diamond heist picture about love, betrayal and fish. Jamie Lee Curtis plays Wanda, an American jewel thief who with her lover Otto (Kevin Kline) disguised as her brother, are planning to double cross their British partners. Everything that could go wrong does and the results are nothing short of splendid. Cleese's wit and charm are present throughout the entire film and he simply steals the show as Archie, the lawyer who falls in love with Wanda while she is playing him for information. Kline is also hilarious as the foul tempered bigot who can't stand British people and Michael Palin (another Python vet) is also hilarious as a clumsy sidekick with a stutter. You will die laughing as you watch Palin try to kill off a dog loving old lady but can't seem to kill anything but her dogs. Cleese is truly one of Britain's finest, he is a true treat to watch and doesn't need silly gags to be funny he just has a natural vibe about him. Narrow minded people will probably just write this off as offensive trash but I think it far exceeds anything that the comedy genre has to offer these days, so anyone with an open mind and a desire to be entertained take note, Wanda won't let you down.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"A Fish Called Wanda" is a fait accompli. THAT it's a great comedy is beyond serious dispute; all that remains is to wonder about is why.I think it's because of the strength of the four central characters. Posters at the front of theatres gave Archie, Ken, Otto and Wanda equal weight, and, as much as is reasonable to expect, the film does too. Each of the four has a different kind of energy to contribute. Merely set one of the four against any of the others, or any two of the others, and you're guaranteed a lively scene - and each of the four is a good foil for the world at large, too. Yet not once are they all brought together at any one time. We come closest to such a meeting during the finale, when they're all at Heathrow Airport, and we see: Archie and Ken, Wanda and Otto, Archie and Otto, Archie and Wanda, Ken and Otto, Archie and Ken and Otto (in what is for other reasons the film's most deliciously satisfying moment, Archie and Ken interact simultaneously with Otto without once interacting with each other), and, even more briefly, Archie and Wanda and Otto. If it were mere contrived plotting that was keeping the characters apart, the result would be tiresome ... but that's one of the other great things about the film: the plot is unfailingly logical, and no move is forced.It's one of those rare films where every single thing went right. Forget about the cunning construction; Cleese's script is FUNNY. The central performances represent high points in each of the four actors' careers. I wonder how Cleese and Crichton knew to cast Curtis, Kline and Palin. The choice is only obvious in retrospect - but now, the thought that Wanda (for instance) might have been played by some American actress other than Jamie Lee Curtis is enough to give me a thrill of horror.Even the musical score is a perfect fit. It's propulsive. You won't find yourself humming the tunes, but you will find your fingers tapping out the rhythms.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film will make you laugh. If you watch it and like it, then you'll watch it over and over again, each time discovering more and more subtle tid-bits. John Cleese oozes sophistication (as well as pretension) as the typical English barrister. As usual, his humor is dry and his comedic timing is perfect. He makes up 35% of this film's quality by himself.Kevin Kline's character Otto is essentially a buffoon who doesn't realize he's being manipulated by everyone else in the story. His refined egotism is in spite of his oblivion to this, and he makes up another 35% of the quality by himself. I haven't seen a better performance than this by Kevin Kline.The other players in this film, while very good, all take a backseat to John Cleese and Kevin Kline.

		<shortDescription>The man who preferred Clockwise to Wanda</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having enjoyed Cleese's work and been a fan of Jamie Lee Curtis for years, but somehow always missed this, I was looking forward to seeing it at last. What a disappointment. Main drawback was the pathetic Palin and oafish, aggressive, Kevin Kline characters, neither of whom seemed remotely funny. I enjoyed much more Cleese's previous film, CLOCKWISE, a charming and clever comedy which survives repeated viewings, but which he considered too parochial in its appeal.Cleese seems to be obsessed by how he is perceived by Americans, perhaps because he is himself something of a self-conscious stereotype of some Americans' notion of a 'British' male - in reality, a certain type of upper middle-class Englishman. WALDORF SALAD was one of the funniest and superbly written episodes of FAWLTY TOWERS, with the clash between Basil and the brash American highlighting brilliantly Basil's snobbery, chauvinism, idleness, pomposity and incompetence, as well as the general reluctance of the native middle-class to complain, in the face of poor service and lack of value for money. In contrast, the moronic, armpit-sniffing, Kline character signified nothing, being the kind of cretin found on both sides of the pond, whom nowadays would be online, swapping uninformed, pseudonymous, abuse with each other, over the likes of socialism or gun-control. As for Palin's role, I find his notorious political namesake is usually more entertaining. The business with Patricia Hayes and the dogs is often regarded as a highpoint, but would have been scorned had Benny Hill done it. Over all, I thought this a vastly overrated and generally unlikeable film.</fullReview>

The cast really look as if they are enjoying themselves and their enthusiasm for the material carries the movie with an energy seldom seen in comedies. Kevin Kline and Michael Palin play the stand out roles, one an ignorant American thug, the other a sensitive, stuttering Brit. This is a heist movie where everything possible goes wrong, and the entertainment comes in the form of seeing the characters struggle to make the most out of the situation. Nobody is really who they seem, with the exception of Cleese's bumbling barrister - and everyone is out to double cross everyone else, and walk away with the stolen swag. To top it off, it is very funny indeed.I love it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'A Fish Called Wanda' is an entertaining and witty comedy about a woman who uses men to commit a robbery and to get exactly what she wants - but starts to lose her heart in the process. Unknowingly, these men do not know that they are competing, and these characters all end up getting involved in the madness. The action takes place in London and stars some well-known (and lesser-known) and excellent American and British actors and actresses.The film is rolling-on-the-floor-and-laughing-out-loud funny. The characters deliver an outrageous but believable performance, and the scenarios they find themselves in are the same. (The dialog between Otto and Cleese in their culturist 'hatred' for each other is classic.) This film is highly enjoyable and should be seen by anyone who appreciates good humor. Watch this if you are particularly fond of Anglo-American films. You won't be flushing this fish down the loo!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The sophisticated English Georges (Tom Georgeson), the stuttering English and owner of an aquarium where the fishes have names Ken (Michael Palin), the ex-CIA killer and very dumb American Otto (Kevin Kline) and the sexy American Wanda (Jamie Lee Curtis) executes a perfect heist of a fortune in diamonds in London. After the robbery, a double-crossing game among them will cause the funniest situation the viewer can imagine. Archie Leach (John Cleese), the stereotype of an Englishman, is hilarious as a successful attorney and failure with his wife and daughter. Jamie Lee Curtis is not a beautiful woman, but she is certainly one of the most sexy star in the cinema. In this movie, she is perfect as a smart and amoral woman. Kevin Kline as the stupid Otto is very funny. The guy is so stupid that, for example, he does not get used to the British way of driving and causes accidents when he drives a car. This is one of the best comedies of the 80's and I myself have watched this movie at least five times (now on DVD). Recommended for those viewers who like comedy, black-humor and flicks with amoral end. My vote is eight.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I used to think I was alone in disliking A Fish Called Wanda but experience has shown that I'm not the only one. Still, the high regard in which it is held continues to mystify me. Any way you look at 'Wanda' it is a nasty, mean-spirited affair which depends for it's laughs on the type of sadism, which, if it appeared in a film which did not pretend to be a comedy, would be roundly denounced and rightly so. Consider: a character suffers from a debilitating speech defect, a circumstance which is deemed a cause of much hilarity. The same character is tormented by a sadist who threatens to kill a beloved pet and there is a running 'joke' about an old lady whose dogs are crushed by falling objects - all regarded as highly amusing. No, call me stuffy but any comedy which has to rely for it's laughs on the foregoing can count me out. And to cap it all, this miserable film doesn't even have the courage of it's own miserable convictions since it bottles out at the last minute and prevents the much put-upon Michael Palin character from taking his just revenge on his tormentor - the one piece of nastiness which would have been thoroughly justified.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ill nurtured trans-Atlantic relations abound, as the drawing out of too many jokes of a misjudged nature and other daft content take centre stage.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Fish Called Wanda is hit and miss, combining a number of interesting and somewhat amusing scenes in which performers get pretty much the best out of the material blended with some darker and nastier content that becomes particularly evident later on. The film is a sweet and intriguing enough caper movie for the best part, combing a number of elements and taking time to pay special attention to character but all too willing to bank off into a rather disappointing and rather grotesque revelling in both sadism and deceit. By the time this jumping about has really upset the balance of the film, it has branched off into a realm of escapism and systematically tried to bring these immoral characters down a few pegs that sees both their actions and attitudes punished; we allow the film to roll in the filth of its straddling a line between what's funny and what's rather sickly before accepting the fact that in order to offer stark demonisations of said actions, it needs to peel off onto a strand for its final third that sees all many of wacky, zany and nutty misadventures play out and then tie up. It's spasmodic, inconsistent and not particularly funny.The film is a combined effort from both Britain and The United States, bringing in a range of talent for roles both infront of and behind the camera from either nation. It sees them work together, against each other; but further still retain their differences when not in direct conflict with each other. The film, produced nearer the end of Thatcher's reign as prime minister of Britain, sees a communication in British and American relations break down or fall apart, with a key relationship between two characters of different genders and origins looking like the kind you dream of in its perfection, although in reality, sordid agendas and false promises lie beneath the surface. As Thather's reign came to an end, and a key ideology in her time in power in forming a stronger bond with the American people and government began to go with her, A Fish Called Wanda is rather an ultimate representation of a tie which appears to work quickly; ruthlessly and efficiently when on the same plain but one that progressively falls down and gets weaker when elements of mistrust sneak in.The main players are two American criminals named Otto (Kline) and Wanda (Curtis); co-writer John Cleese's lawyer named Archie Leach as well as stammering animal lover, but crook all the same, named Ken (Palin) who are both Englishmen. After three of these people minus the lawyer rob some diamonds during a daylight raid with George (Georgeson), he is arrested and sent to prison after the Americans give away his whereabouts with the plan being to swipe what they stole and high-tail it out of there; only the diamonds are stashed somewhere only George knows and their plan has backfired. Thus begins the hi-jinks and the farce, Wanda attempting to get into Archie's life so as to help get George out of prison as soon as possible with the eye to take it from there.The film's comedy sits uneasily with its jovial and upbeat attitude to events, with degrees of xenophobia towards the British; bouts of sadism in the odd torture sequence; gross mistrust as well as various patches revolving around animal cruelty the bulk of the content around which the laughs are meant to rotate. Each character has waltzed in from different films, while the odd added ingredient of Jamie Lee-Curtis coming across as playing three or four different roles within her role becomes more and more apparent. Otto and Wanda are certainly charismatic, the pair of them creeping along a line that separates them from either likable rouges or despicable creations whose antics we're meant to be amused by; Otto's hatred of the British and rampaging negative attitudes towards most items reigned in by co-crook and lover Wanda as this match to Otto's indulgences in academic texts and dangerous urges to check up on Wanda when she's supposed to be posing as a lover to somebody else. This, as Archie and his flailing relationship with wife Wendy (Aitken) plus daughter Porita in a large detached house is given due attention; the different parties' attitudes towards sex and sleeping with one another given particular attention as young and loose American criminals occupy one strand and the rich, more refined, more sensible Englsih occupy their space on another.So it's with a great relative interest when Wanda and Archie come together, her posing as a student in love with him and his work seriously clashing with the aforementioned professionalism embodied within Archie. Their scenes are relatively amusing, Lee-Curtis doing well as a performer within a performance playing the role of a brother to Otto when undercover; a student-then-seductress to Archie when she's with him and a moll of some sort when sharing the screen with Otto in regards to whom she has her own agenda. The film is uneven, running on the farcical nature of the situation to drive the film without any underlying substance while the reoccurring gag of an individual with a stammer grows as old as it does offensive relatively quickly. Cleese is in his element when channelling one of those many exchanges and scenarios that usually played out in 1970s TV show Fawlty Towers when a comic situation involving he and a few others peaks whilst attempting to prolong the affair he's having with Wanda, but genuinely funny moments such as these in which the performers are in their element are few and far between. If it's popular, it's because it doesn't ask much from an audience most probably all too willing to laugh at anything anyway thus creating a distressing and wavy tone to a film running a relatively amusing premise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't Call Me Stupid!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a man can recover from being run over by a steamroller, we know we aren't in the world's most serious movie. Still, the wit and byplay that goes on in this gem is wonderful. It has a great cast: John Cleese, MIchael Palin, Jamie Lee Curtis, and, especially, Kevin Kline (I though he was Calvin Klein when I first heard about him). He has been wonderful in just about everything, but his ticky, off the wall character in this film is worth the price of admission. The plot is like one of those sixties heist films, but this is a visual joy. As animal rights advocate Palin sets out to kill several dogs owned by an old lady who is the only witness to a jewel heist (to cause her to have a heart attack), we are treated to some of the greatest sight gags ever. Also, Kline's jealous rages and impromptu appearances in the most inappropriate places, are marvelous. It was really fun to see a true comedy which doesn't demand the lowest common denominator from us. Great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Cleese's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The great John Cleese starred in two post-Monty Python films in the mid 1980s: 'Clockwise' is arguably under-rated, but 'A Fish Called Wanda' was a huge commercial success. This is actually surprising, as the film is only fitfully amusing, with its obvious (and commercially-minded) Anglo-American theme. A bigger problem, perhaps, is that Cleese himself plays a relatively straight role, leaving it to Michael Palin (never the funniest of the Pythons, and here merely annoying) and the always annoying Kevin Kline to attempt to deliver the laughs: the film only really becomes funny in its second half, when Cleese is finally allowed to show us his talents. Another point of note is that the Python-esquire vision of Britain, maybe enhanced by the use of veteran Ealing studios director Charles Chrichton, is starting to look dated: the world shown is a parody of contemporary life, but no longer accurate enough to be considered satire. There are still some funny moments here, but for a true demonstration of Cleese's greatness, look elsewhere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What was the big deal?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Part of the beauty of John Cleese's masterful sitcom 'Fawlty Towers' was the complex, interweaving plot threads and slowly unfolding disasters. He obviously tried to replicate this in 'Wanda', but succeeded only in making the whole thing needlessly confusing and even rather boring. Jamie Lee Curtis can't do comedy - it's as simple as that. Kevin Kline, an ardent Python fan, offers one of the most abysmally overbaked and embarrassing performances I've ever seen, and Michael Palin is wasted in a one-note role as the bashful, animal-loving Ken, whose 'comedy' stutter is more irritating than amusing. Cleese himself turns in an oddly flat performance, especially compared to his hilariously manic turn in 'Clockwise' (the nearest we ever got to Basil Fawlty on film), his treasurable character parts in all the Python movies and his eccentric cameo as the mischievous billionaire in 'Rat Race'. The rest of the cast are largely wasted. Charles Crichton's direction is creaky and the film as a whole looks cheap, as if it was shot on leftover stock and bearing the same slightly seedy "shot on location in London, England" look as a lot of sixties 'swinging England' comedies. In short, it resembles a Michael Winner film, and that's not intended as a compliment. Cleese's screenplay blatantly attempts to play up stereotypes from both sides of the Atlantic, but it takes a good deal more skill and lightness of touch to hunt with the hounds and run with the fox simultaneously. Whatever certain over-excited critics tell you about this film heralding the revival of Ealingesque 'caper' comedies or the art of perfect timing is untrue. There were better and funnier films being made in England all through the eighties, but they didn't have one beady eye on the lucrative American market or a couple of unappealing Hollywood star turns in the cast.

		<shortDescription>The Eye-opener</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With Kevin Kline's Oscar win for this "comedy", his uncle, Gil Cates, would produce all the Academy award shows since, save one.Can you say payoff?The year before "Fish" Kline had appeared in "Cry Freedom" with Denzel Washington as Stephen Biko. Washington would receive a supporting nomination. The rest of the film, after Biko's death, would be panned as a Disney chase film. So Kline would next appear in a comedy like this and win the Oscar. He would be nominated against Alec Guiness (already won), Martin Landau for "Tucker: A Man and His Dreams" (Landau would later win for his superb portrayal of Bela Lugosi in "Ed Wood"), Dean Stockwell for "Married to the Mob" (Stockwell would later be immortalized in "Quantum Leap") and River Phoenix, nominated for "Running On Empty" (I guess if Phoenix had won, it would have made a good swan song). Cleese said he was considering Kline for "A Fish Called Wanda" since meeting him during "Silverado" about seven years earlier.Was this a good comedy performance from Kline? Hardly. Kline attempted to do the Maggie Smith in "California Suite" bit (I have had all the dramatic Shakespearean training and I win for a comedy? Michael Caine would do the same thing a year earlier when he won for "Hannah and her Sisters")Kline would follow "Fish" with "I Love You To Death" with Tracy Ullman, Joan Plowright, Bill Hurt and Keanu Reeves with no success."Fish" nor the Oscar hardly showed Kline was suitable for comedy.Nevertheless, it was this Oscar win that told me that the awards are nothing more than gold plated G.I. Joes; they represent nothing.Suddenly the mystique of Julie Andrews win for "Mary Poppins", Jimmy Stewart's win for "Philadelphia Story" (hardly his best performance, it was a payoff for "Mr. Smith" still strong today) and Jessica Lange for "Tootsie" (she would win because Meryl had "Sophie's Choice" and Lange was up for "Frances". Nevermind the fact that Lange would later win Best Actress anyway for "Blue Skies"), all the charm of the award shows was gone.Oscars could be bought and sold at the drop of a hat. They didn't guarantee a classic film, they didn't make a film good, they're not even good decoration on a film. Oscars barely a footnote.But is "Fish" a good comedy? I don't look for it. Monty Python is funnier to me, and I thought Cleese's wife was funnier when she was thoroughly unimpressed by Kline's attempt to cover why he was in the house, than anyone else in the whole film. "Well, thank you for protecting us."Nothing came from Jamie Lee Curtis and the fish having the same name, so that was a waste. Oddly enough, the same year that Kline gets run over by the steam roller in "Fish", Christopher Lloyd would get the same treatment in "Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"Lloyd got no Oscar nomination. Wonder why?In the end, I guess it doesn't matter, but I have never looked at Academy awards the same since. By far, the funniest moment has to be that Kline won his Oscar at the same ceremony where Rob Lowe danced with Snow White, the year of "Rain Man" and it would be Lucille Ball's last public appearance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Might Be the Greatest Comedy of All Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"A Fish Called Wanda" is an excellent comedy that rises above about 99.9% of other comedies and is a great part of the cinema. American crooks Kevin Kline (Oscar-winning) and a very sexy Jamie Lee Curtis have plans to double-cross British crooks Tom Georgeson and Michael Palin after they pull a caper together. However, everything goes awry and now the Americans need the help of British barrister John Cleese. "A Fish Called Wanda" is hilarious in every sense of the word. Kevin Kline stands out the most, but that is not saying that everyone else is not good as well. The subtle direction is effective and the screenplay is witty, insightful, and overall excellent. This was arguably the best film produced in 1988. 4.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overrated, But Still Funny. Kevin Kline Steals the Show...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Cleese leads an all-star cast in this funny, but overrated crime comedy.Crooks Wanda (Jamie Lee Curtis) and her lover Otto (Kevin Kline) have successfully stolen millions of dollars worth of diamonds from a bank in London, England, along with George and a stuttering animal-lover, Ken (Michael Palin). They hide the stash in a safe, then pretend that they will meet back in three days to fly somewhere away from England. But George goes back, hides the stash in an airport security deposit box, and puts the key to the safe in his pocket. However, he doesn't realize that Wanda and Otto are planning to turn him in to the police and take the loot for themselves. They do so, only one problem: When they go for the diamonds, they're not there. Now they must take a trip to George (who is in jail, of course) to discover where he has hid the jewels. George doesn't suspect Wanda, but suspects Otto of turning him in. He doesn't tell her where the jewels are. So Wanda meets with George's lawyer, John Cleese, the only man who George would talk to, and the only man who could possibly know where the diamonds are. Wands plays Cleese for information, but soon chaos ensues and the plot takes so many twists and turns it's hard to say what happens without ruining some gags."A Fish Called Wanda" is probably a bit too fondly remembered. I heard so much about this movie and was really expecting a lot. Yes, it's funny, and yes, it has very funny moments, but I really expected more than I got.Writer-star John Cleese does a good job playing a British lawyer, or bannister, or whatever they are called in England. Curtis does a good job playing a smart thief who uses her good looks and charm to lure men into her trap. Michael Palin is great as a stuttering Ken. But the best of the cast is Kevin Kline as Otto. He is a wild guy who is both impulsive and aggressive. A bad mix. One of my favorite scenes is where he comes in to apologize to John Cleese, and finds a robber in Cleese's home, assaults the robber, then realizes it is Cleese himself, and says, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry," then starts saying, "How was I supposed to know it was you? I mean, what kind of person robs their own home? Hey, yeah, what kind of person robs their own home, you idiot!" And he starts to kick him. It shows how much of a problem this guy has. Another one of my favorites is just about anytime he and Michael Palin are on screen. Otto's mimicking of Ken ("K-k-ken's c-c-c-coming to k-k-k-kill me!") ranks high as a gut-grabber. But just about any scene with the two men is hilarious.The script is nice, and doesn't go overboard at anytime. But I still think the film is a bit overrated.I laughed, I had fun, but it wasn't one of the most memorable comedies I've ever seen. I've seen much better, to tell you the truth.4/5 stars -John Ulmer</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the greatest comedy films ever made. BAFTA winning, and Golden Globe nominated John Cleese plays Archie Leach (Cary Grant's real name), a lawyer who has met and fallen in love with Wanda (BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Jamie Lee Curtis). Archie is defending the man that helped Wanda and Otto (Oscar winning, and BAFTA nominated Kevin Kline) with the robbery. Also stuttering Ken (BAFTA winning Michael Palin) is trying to kill the woman who was a witness after the robbery. John Cleese has done a very good job of both playing his character and writing (and directing) the film. Kevin Kline does an amazing job as the dangerous and hilarious Otto, he deserves his Oscar. Michael Palin has done a very good job of stuttering and having chips shoved up his nose, he deserves his BAFTA. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Director for Charles Crichton and Best Writing, Original Screenplay, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Supporting Actress for Maria Aitken as Wendy, Best Direction, Best Editing, Best Original Screenplay and Best Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical. John Cleese was number 14 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, Jamie Lee Curtis was number 52 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, the film was number 23 on The 50 Greatest Comedy Films, and it was number 21 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs.

I could watch my science teacher dissect a heart and lungs right in front of me and I'm fine with general gore, I mean I watched that educational video on electrocution without a problem but seeing a human being empty a fish tank bit by bit in front of it's owner as a form of torture and eating each fish alive just made me feel physically sick. Maybe I 'm just pathetic but the thing is I was fine with that scene in 'Resevoir Dogs' where they cut off the policeman's ear and cover him in petrol, i love that film but maybe that was because that wasn't trying to be a comedy.I'm sorry I just can't see anything remotely funny about a man easting another mans fish as a form of torture or a woman becoming aroused by foreign language or a man who stutters or anything else that features in this movie.I don't want to think about it anymore, ever.

		<shortDescription>One of the funniest movies ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What is there to say about one of the funniest movies ever made? John Cleese and Charles Crichton have combined forces to create a riotously funny crime comedy about a group of criminals who are filled with bad luck and bad ideas. It takes a little long to establish the characters upon the opening, but I loved how quickly it got to the point with the robbery taking place within the first ten minutes. The laughs didn't really get started for me until twenty or thirty minutes in, but once they did they did not let up. The plot concerns four unique people who team up in England to rob some diamonds and then spend the rest of the film trying to stab each other in the back, get the loot and get away.Jamie Lee Curtis leads the foursome as the minx Wanda Gershwitz, along with Tom Georgeson's Georges Thomason. Coming in on them are the stuttering lackey Ken Pile, played by Michael Palin, and the Nietzsche-reading buffoon Otto, played by Kevin Kline. Thomason gets pinched early on, one of the first of many double-crosses, and so the film concerns itself mostly with Otto and Wanda trying to find the diamonds while making sure that Thomason stays behind bars and doesn't give them up. To do this, Wanda gets herself close to Archie Leach (John Cleese), a lawyer who has been tasked with clearing Thomason's name.A Fish Called Wanda flies around wildly, yet somehow Cleese and Crichton are able to give it this rhythm that flows so well. It never gets too far ahead of itself but it doesn't drag for a single moment either. This is the rare pure comedy that is wickedly funny while also being incredibly intelligent in it's writing and directing. A lot of comedies act as if the audience has a short attention span and so they try to cram as many jokes as possible in the first hour and then leave the audience yawning through the final act. Here though they know that the audience wants to laugh more as times goes on and they spend their time building jokes that will pay off even stronger in the later scenes.There are so many recurring bits, like Otto's blind rage over being called stupid or Ken's inability to murder an old lady, that only get more and more hilarious as they go on. Somehow these jokes never feel like they're hitting the audience over the head or being used too much, but instead just get better and better. The cast is certainly worth noting, as all four of the main characters provide great ingredients for the laughs. Cleese is the perfect straight man for the wild antics of the rest, Curtis is whip smart and an alluring sex kitten, Palin is so damn likable that you just want to make all of his bad luck go away and Kevin Kline steals the show completely.Kline takes on Otto with a skill that is almost unmatched in comedic cinema. This is a guy who is always the stupidest person in the room but always thinks that he is the smartest by far. He puts himself on a pedestal and it could have been a role that was done with disastrous results, but Kline takes his craft so seriously that Otto never feels like he's in on the joke that the audience is. This is an actor who has made a career out of mixing comedy and drama, and here is the highlight of his work in the former field. It takes a little bit to get going, but once it does this is easily one of the most delightfully hilarious films I've ever seen and Kline got me laughing harder than I have with a film in a long while. In Denmark a man died while seeing this film in theaters because he literally laughed himself to death. It's easy to see why.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was the best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are tons of funny scenes in this. I will say, though, that I groaned a little bit more than I laughed the second time I saw this, which was about an hour ago. Why? It has to do with the love story between Jamie Lee Curtis and John Cleese.When you have gotten over the extreme odd pairing of these two, you get kind of bored seeing the courtship scenes between them, and you just wanna flash forward to Kevin Kline's next line. Odd, that he was so good here and has since been in one disappointing role after another. I particularly disliked his performance in Fierce Creatures and Wild, Wild West. This is the only time this kind of over the top performance has worked.The most funny scene with Kline is when he has to explain what he is doing in a certain barrister's house to the wife, a woman he has never met before. The scene is mostly funny because Kline has a perfect straight woman to play with. Her reaction is beautiful. Too bad, she was not used more in Fierce Creatures.Another great moment is of course when Wanda explains to Otto why he is so stupid. Here, Kline gets the reaction shots and it fits perfectly, that he still doesn't get it.However, despite some slow scenes, this is definitely one of the best comedies ever made. That makes it all the more sad that not one of these talented people have really done anything quite as good since then. Curtis had a good part in True Lies and John Cleese was rather funny in Splitting Heirs and that's about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic comedy, even for a pcisinophobic film viewer - 86%</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Given the success of his writing and his comic performances, it isn't a great surprise to find John Cleese having the most luck in his post-Python career. Whether it's with the legendary sitcom "Fawlty Towers" or whether he's kitting out James Bond as Q, Cleese seems to have the Midas touch although every rule is meant to be broken - "Fierce Creatures" proved that. This, arguably, is Cleese's finest hour, writing and starring in this classic British comedy that has been criminally underrated in the last few years."A Fish Called Wanda" opens with a daring diamond heist in London. The planner, a career criminal called George (Tom Georgeson), is back-stabbed by his fellow thieves Wanda (Jamie Lee Curtis) and Otto (Kevin Kline) who are looking to secure the loot themselves. But George has hidden the diamonds and only the fourth member of the gang, stuttering animal-rights activist Ken (Michael Palin), knows where they are. But Wanda has an idea - by getting friendly with George's lawyer, stuck-up Archie Leach (Cleese), Wanda believes she can figure out where the diamonds are. But is Wanda, or anyone else, to be trusted in this timeless tale of cross, double-cross and fish-tanks? To be honest, this film is a rare beast and not because of its sparkling dialogue and witty one-liners. It's one of the few films I can think of where every leading part is played to perfection. Curtis sizzles like never before as the vampish Wanda, Cleese is his wonderfully British best, Palin is fantastically funny as the hit-man with a heart but the best of the bunch is Kline. In the best performance of his career, he wrestles the film away from Cleese in a wonderfully controlled, comically brilliant portrayal as the insane former secret service agent with a passion for violence as well as for Wanda. Without such quality leads, this film might have been a flop but each of them shine and it really shows. And given the wonderfully scripted story, filled with some truly inspired dialogue, it's difficult to find fault with this film.It is rarely laugh-out-loud funny but "A Fish Called Wanda" is one of the finest examples of British comedy in the last twenty years. It's a real gem of a film, filled with classic slapstick and typically British misunderstandings. It's refreshing to watch a comedy without it trying to gross the viewer out or rely on crude language or humour in order to get the laughs. And, to be honest, that is reason enough to celebrate a film of indisputable class like "A Fish Called Wanda". And just remember, stay away from "Fierce Creatures"...</fullReview>

I found these scenes sad and cruel rather than funny. I wont go into too much detail but I felt very sorry for Palins character in one or two of them and I wasn't laughing at all during them.

		<shortDescription>A movie to be admired for the cast, definitely not the plot.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's funny how a certain movie that one person may find fantastic will not illicit the same response in another person. Such is the case with this movie. I know of several people who rank this as one of the best comedies ever made. I don't feel that way, although I do think Wanda had some funny MOMENTS , there is no way I would call the movie as a whole, a perfect comedy. Not even close.Wanda contains a few absolutely hysterical -flawlessly hysterical moments but not a lot quite honestly, and the movie is one to be admired but more for the cast then the plot. I think Kevin Kline's performance was, in the comedic sense as good as it gets. In fact the movie was cast near perfectly. However, this is the type of movie that starts off funny, progressively gets funnier then starts whittling down in sheer funniness and goes into left field into stupidity.I think that maybe because the movie's funniest scenes take place near the beginning and middle so by the end nothing else can measure up. Can anybody watching this REALLY think that:SPOILERS AHEAD THROUGH POST!!The scenes where Kevin Kline eats the fish and the scene where he and Archie tussle in the airport can't hold up against the sex scene with Jaime Lee(Wanda) and the Italion Cheeze talk(which really was hysterical, I gotta say!)? The humor was so good in the beginning and middle, by the end it seemed played out and tired-and I'm sorry but eating fish and nosebleeds wasn't that funny to me, it was kind of disgusting. Just my opinion.Although Wanda was OK as a movie(at times) I really don't think it's a classic comedy. The pureness of the comedy wasn't there, it was redundant by the end of the movie. Way to much cruel humor toward the end too, which frankly, was so unpleasant, it takes the movie down at least a few points on the scale for me with that alone. But I will give Kevin Kline a perfect 10 in terms of his acting. It's one of those movies I don't think was really good but I will remember for certain funny MOMENTS. And like I said, it was a perfectly cast movie if not a really good one and the acting was really good by all. Still, would never make it as my top comedy and as a whole I wouldn't rate this higher then a 4 and that's at most.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First I have to say, I don't think I'm a huge fan of slapstick comedy to begin with. This movie really shoves it down your throat, though.One positive about the movie, I was pretty impressed with how in shape John Cleese is. I had no idea he ever had a six-pack. A pat on the back for you sir.The movie is about four people teaming up to commit armed robbery, only to plan on double-crossing each other afterwards. All the actors in the film do a great job portraying their individual characters; I will give them that. Especially Jamie Lee Curtis, her interpretation was flawless. Kevin Kline, whom I normally love, however, had a character that made me want to stab a fork in my eye. His acting chops are undeniable, but I don't think it could've been possible for him to be more irritatingly annoying. Michael Palin's character comes in second place for being a bothersome aggravation. His stutter made me want to reach in the screen and slap him across the face. I was happy with how the movie ended, minus the stories of where the characters are now. I don't know what lamebrained numbskull came up with them, but the over attempt at humor failed me by a long shot. I can now cross this movie off my list of movies to see, but I will certainly not be watching it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was o.k.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was kind of strange, but I enjoyed it. Jamie Lee Curtis and John Cleese did a really good job playing the characters they played. I think this film had a really good theme, and that they rob banks really good. The crime scenes reminded me of Heist (2001). If I was to pick a comedy movie, and I had 5 choices, they would be: 1. Rat Race (2001) 2. Nutty Professor (1995) 3. A Fish Called Wanda (1988) 4. Young Frankenstein (1974) 5. Bambi Meets Godzilla (1969) If you like comedy movies, this film is the one for you!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny, I tell you. So laugh.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are at least two soi-disant film comedies that are less funny than this one: Blazing Saddles and Team America. I couldn't sit all the way through either of those two, but I managed to last the distance with this one. This was due to the crude stupefaction factor, since I was curious to see what would happen next. I did not laugh, once. There seems to me nothing funny at all in a badly timed narrative about retarded criminals and idiots with speech impediments, squashed little dogs and murdered little old ladies. Nor the repulsive consumption of live goldfish, and foul-mouthed trading of cretinous insults. I struggle to think of a single witty line. The only part which was at all real was played by the actress playing John Cleese's wife: she made a number of excellent points. She could have deserved an extra star, but she wasn't funny. This script, and the performances of the rest of the highly unattractive characters, including masculine Ms Curtis, belong to the Jerry Lewis, Mel Brooks, Abbott and Costello school of comedy: go cross-eyed, splay-footed and gabble: Look, I'm being funny! What a pity it didn't end with everybody shooting themselves for incompetent failure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lacks a necessary spark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my view this film doesn't live up to its reputation. Although released in 1988, the formula behind the film is much older, and it bears a lot in common with 1960s and '70s comedies like "Dad's Army". It isn't the best comedy of this type and looks rather dated now, although there aren't too many topical references to the 1980s. The humour is mainly derived from the grossly exaggerated personalities of the characters, and for me this wears thin rather quickly. To me, John Cleese's English barrister is like portraying the typical American as a gun-toting, doughnut-eating 300lb redneck in a Hawaiian shirt and baseball cap; it's funny for a few minutes but it isn't enough to sustain a whole movie. Having said this, the insane Otto (Kevin Kline) is a delight and adds some much-needed life to the film. But the film falls between two stools; it doesn't sport the unconstrained silliness of slapstick movies like "Police Academy", and neither does it feature deeper characters and a moving story like "The Full Monty". It just lacks the spark necessary to make a great comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remote Brits</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this recently, and I saw it when it was new. At the time, I suppose it was funny. Now I do not, and I think perhaps it is because the center of gravity for humor has changed.Each of the Pythonista's had a particular strength. Together, they were terrific, or at least they would be a few times in their show. Of the men, I think Palin was the one with the talent for the absurd, and Gilliam the talent for presentation. Cleese simply made funny people and had them exist long enough for us to laugh. What they did was not all that important.What he does here is precisely the same, enlisting Kline and Curtis because they really can make faces and say discrete lines.Many of the jokes are about British remoteness and the sexiness that Jamie Lee finds in any language but English. Its funny in a way, but what is wrong with this, is just that remoteness. Cleese's setup works for skits, not long form. For him to sustain a movie, he has to introduce some humanness, some narrative. He does it from a distance; it is there, but we can hardly see it and it doesn't seem connected.You can overlook this sort of thing if the jokes are truly funny. Except for the killed dogs, and especially the body humor of the old lady on the third death, these simply aren't.The story is about Wanda, her opportunism and guile. She is the fish, and there is a unique sort of folding here between woman and fish that I just do not fathom. They both have a key and swim?I will go and look again at "Time Bandits." I think there is a world there.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very disappointing trivial film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't see this film until 2006, that is 18 years after it was made. Had heard so many positive things but in the end found it trite, disappointing, and frankly a tad on the vulgar side. Just a bunch of greedy people trying to screw each other using whatever skills they had to do it. Didn't find killing fish, little dogs or making fun of people that stutter particularly funny. If the acting was good, the story was not. All in all it was pretty boring and I kept waiting for the film to get interesting. It didn't. By now all of this is not very important because the film is so dated. I guess I just didn't see what everyone thought was so wonderful about this film Rob Prince/Denver</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Trans-Atlantic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was going to take issue with the IMDB classing this as an American movie but perhaps I shouldn`t . It is financed by American money , distributed by MGM and has both eyes on an American market ,two of the main protagonists are played by Americans while the two main British characters are played by John Cleese and Michael Palin who are well known in the States because of MONTY PYTHON!!!! MILD SPOILERS !!!!Perhaps this is why I didn`t enjoy A FISH CALLED WANDA as much as I should have since comedy plays second fiddle to appealing to a middle American audience . Anglophobic criminal Otto is a one trick pony who hates limeys and calls them " A$$holes " a lot . I`m surprised Kevin Kline won an Oscar for this since he`s far from terrific in such an under developed role . John Cleese plays a sort of surrogate Basil Fawlty which is great but he`s not awarded enough screen time . If the film revolved around Archie this would have been a far better film . The only bits that made me laugh was the sub plot of animal lover Ken trying to bump off the witness but accidentally killing her dogs one by one and the scene in the cell with George and Archie :George : Tell those pigs to f*** offArchie : F*** off pigsOh dear I`ve mentioned all the funny bits</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>i HATED this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had to comment on this movie. I saw it when it originally came out in the theaters and was doing booming box office. It was one of the only movies that I truly thought about walking out on before it was over. I love good comedies. This was not one of them. I don't know what it is about this movie that bothers me, exactly. It could be the cast, which I think is very strange and not especially appealing. I really think that it was just written as a plot that would allow a string of unconnected, "funny" scenes to be shown in one film. I didn't care one iota about a single character or the outcome of the film. I've seen it a couple of more times on TV, hoping to understand what everyone finds so funny but it still escapes me. Could it be I am too sophisticated? Probably not. Just one of those things...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delightful fun.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this movie and highly recommend it. It's filled with silly Python like moments, too many to name here, but trust me this is a good one. Kevin Kline all but steals the show from a company of lunatics. Apparently some animal rights groups were upset by a certain scene involving a fish, but whatever really happened, it was worth it. John Cleese and Jamie Lee Curtis are terrific too, an all around good time,</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Folks, I don't know what you all see in this film! I first read comments posted here, then rented the DVD in our local library and watched it, every minute going by with greater anger. I felt disgusted about the horrible vulgarity, gross language, over-the-top characterization of persons, unreal plot. Kevin Kline got an Oscar - for what, for Heaven's sake? He plays such a hateful nincompoop, I felt positively pestered by him. Maybe I took that flick too literally, but even in a raucous comedy without any taste, I ask for some logic. This one had none. John Cleese, for me, saved the film, he made me watch it through (painfully). I admire this actor, he IS one of a kind. He should have got the Oscar, not Kline!! Well, to sum it up, I handed the DVD back to the library and was happy to have it out of my system (sigh of relief).</fullReview>
