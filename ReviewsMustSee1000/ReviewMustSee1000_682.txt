		<shortDescription>The best film of 1997</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this film with one of my friends, in a cinema I had never been to before. It was one of those rare and delightful experiences where you are the only people in the theatre. No one around to distract you. No kids munching on crisps, or couples quietly muttering sweet nothings, or idiots trying to tell the characters what to do. It was great.The film was just brilliant. It really nearly broke my heart. Every performance is perfect. The direction by Ang Lee is deliberate and painful as he slices into you with the lives of those he makes you watch. It looks amazing, in a beautifully bleak way. It is also one the most compelling and painful movies that I have ever come across. The family life portrayed is messed up and all the relationships that are displayed are disfunctional on some level or other. But still I was forced to care for them - all of them. Such is the brilliance of the acting and the script writing.I own this film, but I can't watch it alot. Once a year is just enough. It's to traumatic and beautiful to watch more than that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Victims of Spoilhood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set in upscale, suburban New Canaan, Connecticut in 1973, The Ice Storm (based on a novel by Rick Moody) is a scathing social criticism of the values and ideals of upper-class American society during that time period. With the background for the movie being the Nixon Watergate scandal, the corruption is portrayed as extending all the way into the American Home through a short glimpse into the lives of two families: The Hoods and the Carvers.Both families have two children (Carvers: two sons, Hoods: one son, one daughter), and appear perfectly normal and supportive at first glance. However, through a series of common experiences, and through the way the families struggle to communicate both within and with one another, it becomes clear there are deeply rooted problems. Director Lee uses the children to exemplify the failures of the parents, and their mistakes reflect heavily and harshly on the adults in their lives. The adults also make their own mistakes, and these are depicted as far worse - for as adults, they should know better. Their struggles in dealing with their children are at times almost comical, and show their lack of proper parenting skills. As a criticism, this structure is flawless, comprehensive, and unrelenting throughout. Except for a few fleeting scenes, the irresponsibility of the adults dominates the screen.Of course, all these events are building up to a climax of epic proportions. The saying, "a stitch in time saves nine," comes to mind when discussing this movie. Had any of the adults taken the proper steps of good parenting anywhere along the way, the events that unfold would not have occurred. Like the failed parenting of the adults, however, it's too little, too late. Bad parenting, selfishness, lavishness, sexual promiscuity, greed, lack of communication, and foolishness lead these adults to make mistakes within their lives, the lives of their children, and the lives of their friends. And come the closing credits of this incredibly well directed, well acted film, they are the ones left to pick up the pieces.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Ang Lee's Finest Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The difference between adolescence and adulthood can be defined in terms of years or age, but when it comes right down to it, the only real difference is in the experiences the added years provide. As we mature, we are at some point confronted with the realization-- some sooner, some later-- that age and experience do not necessarily equate to satisfaction and personal identity in our lives, the two things we are all, though perhaps subconsciously, striving to attain. But it's an elusive butterfly we're chasing; and at a certain age, the lack of fulfillment in one's life may be dismissed out-of-hand by some as a midlife crisis in a feeble attempt to justify certain actions or attitudes. Attaching such a label to it, however, is merely simplifying a state of being that seems to be perpetually misunderstood, and we resort to using psychological ploys on ourselves in order to rationalize away behavior that is often unacceptable in the cold light of reason and morality. This, of course, is not a unique situation, but an inevitable step one takes upon reaching an age at which the awareness of mortality begins to set in, which is something we all have to deal with in our own way, in our own time. And it's an issue that lies allegorically at the heart of director Ang Lee's pensive, insightful drama, `The Ice Storm,' in which we discover that-- more often than not-- the adult we become is nothing more than an extension of the adolescent; we may shed the skin of youth, but the awkward confusion and uncertainty remains, albeit manifested in different ways, to which for awhile we may respond in opposition even to our own conscience, creating a double standard in our lives which only serves to exacerbate the confusion and unhappiness, leaving us alone to face the cold and frozen landscapes of our own soul. Working from an insightful and intelligent screenplay by James Schamus (who also wrote Lee's `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' and `Eat Drink Man Woman,' among others), Lee has crafted and delivered a lyrical and poetic-- though somewhat dark-- film that tells the story of two neighboring families living in Connecticut in the early ?70s: Ben and Elena Hood (Kevin Kline and Joan Allen) and their children, Paul (Tobey Maguire) and Wendy (Christina Ricci); and Jim and Janey Carver (Jamey Sheridan and Sigourney Weaver) and their children, Mikey (Elijah Wood) and Sandy (Adam Hann-Byrd). And it's a story to which many will be able to relate on a very personal, individual level, as it reflects an issue common to us all-- that of trying to make a tangible connection with someone or something in our life that we can hold on to and take comfort in. Ben and Elena have grown apart; she has distanced herself emotionally and sexually from Ben, and unfulfilled, she longs again for the freedom of her spent youth, while Ben seeks solace in an emotionally vapid but physically satisfying relationship with another woman. Jim, who spends much of his time on the road, has become completely disconnected from his entire family; his children are apathetic to his very presence, and Janey exists in a constant state of promiscuous numbness, yet cold and indifferent to her own husband.  The Hood and Carver children, meanwhile, are suffering the pains of adolescence and trying to figure out the world in which they live, exploring their feelings with and for one another and attempting to understand the whys and wherefores of it all. And to whom can they turn for guidance in an era that's giving them Nixon and Watergate, new age spiritualism and self-absorbed parents who teach one thing and do another?  The story unfolds through the eyes of sixteen-year-old Paul, whose meditations on the literal and figurative ice storm that descends upon the two families over a long Thanksgiving weekend forms the narrative of the film. And it's through Paul's observations that Lee so subtly and effectively presents his metaphor, in which he captures the beauty, as well as the ugliness, that inexplicably coexists within and which surrounds the turbulence and turmoil of the Hood's and Carver's world, which is ultimately visited by tragedy as their drama proceeds to it's inevitable climax. It's sensitive material that will undoubtedly touch a nerve with many in the audience, and Lee takes great care to present it accordingly, with a studied finesse that makes it an emotionally involving and thoroughly engrossing drama. Lee also knows how to get the best out of his actors, and there are a number of outstanding and memorable performances in this film, beginning with that of Kevin Kline. Kline does comedy well, but he does drama even better, as he proves here with his portrayal of Ben. The final scene of the film, in fact, belongs to Kline, as it is here that we discover the true nature of the man he is in his heart of hearts. It's a superb piece of acting, and one of the real strengths of the film. Joan Allen also turns in a strong performance through which she reveals the insufferable inner conflict that so affects Elena's life, and especially her relationship with Ben. And it's in Allen's character, more than any of the others, that we see how fine the line is between the adult and the adolescent. It is not unusual to find a bit of the mother in the daughter; but Allen shows us through Elena just how much of the daughter is actually in the mother, which underscores one of the basic tenets of the film. It's a performance that should've earned Allen an Oscar nomination at the very least. Also turning in performances that demand special attention are Maguire, Ricci, Wood and especially Jamey Sheridan, whose portrayal of Jim is one of his best-- it's believable, and totally honest. Penetrating and incisive, `The Ice Storm' is remarkably poignant and absorbing; without question, it's one of Lee's finest films. 10/10.        </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful, intelligent and yet utterly disturbing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am deeply touched. I can not believe it took me 7 years to get to see this movie. It goes straight into my top ten.The movie is based on Rick Moody's 1994 novel about the life of two suburban families in New Canaan, Connecticut during the time of the Watergate scandal: A time of sexual liberation and of disintegration of existing social norms and of the nuclear family. The characters may stand as symbols of the kind of people that are created out of a society with decreasing social norms. They are ordinary people who live in material welfare, bored, unhappy, confused, scared of conflicts, and constantly seeking something else than they already have.Instead of being examples to their children, the parents are constantly trying to run away from their own emotional confusion for instance by seeking casual sex and thereby hurting each other. In the meantime the children are left to their own upbringing, watching bad TV shows, emptying their parents' drinks, blowing up toys on the balcony, shoplifting, experimenting with sex and drugs. The communication between parents and children is terrible, or should I say non-existing. They all live in their separate worlds, all the time more disconnected, until a tragedy caused by a natural disaster finally calls them back to life and, hopefully, makes them look beyond themselves and see how valuable and fragile life is. May this provoke back the belief in what the family as a unit can do for each other if they stand together?The movie is both uncomfortable and at the same time enormously satisfying to watch ? perhaps because the theme is presented in such a human and recognizable manner. The dialogue is great and there are even very funny scenes at times. These people seem so real and so fragile, like you and me. It is as if we can see right through their souls and their pain.The cast is brilliant (except for that irritating Katie Holmes with her cheap Hollywood teenage series look). I have never seen a movie plenty of child actors acted out as professionally and convincing as this one. Christina Ricci is the best and Elijah Wood is also excellent (much more enjoyable than in LOTR), making me wish they were young again so they could have more roles in movies like this.The atmosphere caused by the weather gives a kind of somber mood stressed by the dimmed colors and the mystical music score.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best movie in penetrating average American lifestyle. Remarkable, melancholy.Five Stars, vote 9 out of 10.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was astonished to find out how many bad reviews in this site for "Ice Storm" here. I voted 9 out of 10 without hesitating. I've seen this movie twice, and the 2nd time was even more disturbing in a remarkable sense, which compelled me into a deep thinking mode. Phillip, (on the message board), you're so right! `Ice Storm' was indeed a gem that entitles equally what "American Beauty" has earned. Both movies were focusing on the American mid-class's love lives, their middle-aged marriage crisis, and teenagers beguiled by sex. `Ice storm" was filmed in a musically melancholic tune than `American Beauty'. It's about life, brutally honest, and objective. It's about the rotten love lives of average American couples, inwardly, those who would dare to break the rules, for exchanging a moment of stealing pleasure, such as Sigourney Weaver; Kevin Kline, who has surrendered to sexual seduction; Jane Ellen, Kevin Kline's wife, frustrated by the dysfunctional marriage, yet tuning away from sexual liberation. Sadly, the victims of typical contemporary Hollywoodia pace has found `Ice Storm' a `slow and dull' movie that makes them yawning. Why not simply obtain satisfactions over weeping for an affected Hollywood's love tale `Titanic'. Other noteworthy, is the music scores of `Ice Storm' is depressing, enchanting, very beautiful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The Ice Storm' is an incredibly bleak and dark film set in the 70s about two connected families during the holiday break of Thanksgiving. The first family consists of Ben (Kevin Kline) and Elena (Joan Allen), and their two kids -- 16-year-old Paul (Tobey Maguire) just home from boarding school, and 14-year-old Wendy (Christina Ricci) a wannabe anti-war/anti-Nixon elitist who is coming to terms with her own sexuality. The second family consists of Janey (Sigourney Weaver) whom Ben is having an affair with, her husband Jim (Jamey Sheridan), and their two boys -- the neurotic intro-vert Mikey (Elijah Wood) and his younger shy pyro-maniac brother Sandy (AdamN Hann Byrd). The film takes place during Thanksgiving day and the day after in the lives of these people -- including Ben and Elena's marriage being put to the test at a swinger's party with Janey and Jim, Paul's love conquest in New York City with a girl from boarding school named Libbets (Katie Holmes), and Wendy's sexual misadventures with Mikey and Sandy both.'The Ice Storm' is an incredibly powerful and relevant ensemble piece about the complexity of family and relationships both sexual and non-sexual. Ang Lee once again proves he is a director of great skill and exquisite understanding of human emotions, and James Schamus provides a harrowing and painfully realistic screenplay. Kevin Kline delivers yet another near-flawless dramatic performance, while Sigourney Weaver is great in her interesting yet limited role. The children of the ensemble cast (Maguire, Byrd, Wood, Ricci, Holmes, Krumholtz) are all excellent, especially Christina Ricci who owns her role. However, the real scene-stealer in my eyes is the marvelous Joan Allen who plays her role with such intensity and elegance that I'm shocked she didn't receive a Best Actress Oscar Nomination.In conclusion, 'The Ice Storm' is a powerful little movie that's interesting yet not exciting. It isn't groundbreaking by any standards, but it's incredibly well-made. 'The Ice Storm' was totally ignored at the '98 Oscar Ceremony, but that comes to no enormous surprise. It was competing in the same year 'L.A. Confidential', 'Boogie Nights', 'Amistad', 'The Sweet Hereafter', 'As Good as It Gets' and the dreadfully overrated 'Titanic' were. A small little character study like 'The Ice Storm' didn't stand a chance. If you can appreciate a movie like this, I highly recommend this oldie I just got around to seeing. Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A subtly sardonic look inside middle-class Americana.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Ice Storm" not only describes the weather in the Connecticut countryside but is also a metaphor for the pall which hangs over a pallid and dysfunctional middle-class suburban family of four in the 1970s. Sporting a stellar cast with Ang Lee at the helm, this well crafted, sensitive, artful production takes the audience into four lives outwardly living the "American Dream" while inwardly existing in a state of empty unfulfillment and quiet desperation. The tedious and laconic nature of the film may lose the less patient audience while those with a taste for psychodrama should enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not the kind of film to watch right before you want to go to sleep; one of the best films of 97</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The summary statement I write I mean as a compliment. In short, this film will keep you up thinking about the characters, the whole swarm of tragedy sewn into these characters, as it is a true look at American familial dysfunction. It's also the Chinese-directed cousin of American Beauty- in some ways just as compelling (if maybe a little more heavy on the metaphors)- and by the end of it, however down and drained the film made me feel, I knew I'd seen my favorite Ang Lee film thus far. He takes the subject matter- the script by James Schamus, and the nuanced performances- and makes it so that we feel for these people, however trapped into their upper-middle class walks of life. The ice theme does work for a good lot of the film, and even when it gets hammered down to the line, I was still moved by how these families intertwined, the bleakness but also the little bits of light coming through.In fact, the film shares a good deal with American Beauty- two families, both fairly screwed up, with infidelity, drugs, procrastination, young lust, and a certain pining for the old days going steadily down the tubes. One family are the Hooods (Kevin Kline, Joan Allen, Christina Ricci and Tobey MaGuire); the other are the Carvers (Sigourney Weaver, Elijah Wood, Henry Czerny, and Adam Hann-Byrd). Either side has their share of dilemmas, psychological cramps, and just total aimlessness. The performances from all are unique and quiet, desperate, and at least a few (in tune with the 'ice' theme), in particular Weaver, Wood and Allen, are numbed. Basically, there isn't as much story as there is attention to the fates and parallels of the characters.Among the lot though, Kline has some of his best work to date, with his controlling demeanor masking something very insecure; Hann-Byrd and Wood are totally complimentary, so to speak, in that they work well at being brothers of the same weird seed; Allen, not much more to say that hasn't been said by others; and even smaller roles filled by Katie Holmes and David Krumholtz are worth the time. There stories all lead up to the big chunk of the story (ala the 'day you die' stuff in American Beauty), and at times it's painful, cringe-inducing, darkly amusing, and at the end hitting notes that had me eyes go wide. And the ending, when it comes, is sentimental, but never unrealistic. This is the kind of tone that Lee would also use for Brokeback Mountain, but here it contains even more depth and intrigue into the dysfunction, ironically in only the span of a few days vs. the span of twenty years in Brokeback.You may, whether you like the film or not, will want to talk about it once it is over. It of course can be argued, and I would argue it, that the 'ice' motif is pushed to as far as it can go, and then some (then again it IS called the Ice Storm). But in contrast, another minor theme is handled superbly, involving the Fantastic Four comic book that Maguire's character gives some narration about. By looking through an abstract of a comic book, there's some extra meaning that can be put into the film, the power that can be taken away from superheroes as well as the enclosed New Canaan citizens. Along with some great 70's era period use- the Nixon/Watergate stuff adding another layer to the frustration (leading up to a truly disturbing moment involving a Nixon mask)- including music, creates a very impressive atmosphere. Maybe I'll check out the film again, when it's not past midnight, though even after hours the film packs a small wallop. 9.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie of raw emotional power. **** out of ****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE ICE STORM (1997) ****Starring: Kevin Kline, Joan Allen, Sigourney Weaver, Tobey Maguire, Christina Ricci, Elijah Wood, and Katie Holmes Director: Ang Lee 113 minutes Rated R (for strong sexual content, and for drug use &amp; language)By Blake French:  Ang Lee's "The Ice Storm" is such a provocative and unsettling experience that it made Gene Siskel's top movie of 1997. Since then, Siskel has recently passed away. But Being an avid film reviewer and buff, I thought that it would be appropriate for me to screen "The Ice Storm" for a second time, this time in full awareness of Siskel's thoughts on the film. After careful inspection, I think that I agree with my favorite movie critic's opinion, and feel obligated to post a review explaining why. Watching "The Ice Storm" is a unique occurrence. Movie's don't get this powerful every time one visits a local multiplex. The story is basically a series of sins and involvement's that dig the characters deeper and deeper into an emotional crater.  The time period is about thirty to forty years ago. Kevin Kline and Joan Allen are Ben and Elena Hood. They have a son whose 16, Paul, and a sexually confused 14 year old daughter named Wendy. This is not a happy family and the film never pretends otherwise.  Ben is having an adulterous affair with his neighbor's wife, Janey Carver. Her husband, Jim, is pretty much unsuspecting, but Ben's wife is dubious of her mysteriously acting spouse. The Carvers also have teenage children named Mikey and Sandy. Mickey is ready to explore a sexual underworld with Wendy, and she is prepared to experiment with whoever comes down her path first. Elena is caught stealing from a local party store one day and that triggers an effect that causes her to react openly to her husband about his involvement's with Janey Carver. When Ben and Elena visit a wife swapping party where the guests put their keys in a dish to see who an individual will sleep with, things become even more adulterous with the Carvers. The film is propelled by unique, one of a kind performances by all the actors in the cast. Sigourney Weaver, receiving a best supporting actress nomination for her performance, is superb, in a slutty, whorish kind of a way. Joan Allen is also perfection delivering a sense of egresses and desire without ever speaking that much. Tobey Maguire, Christina Ricci, Elijah Wood, and Adam Hann-Byrd all act well as the teens. Basically all the one screen appeal of "The Ice Storm" is top class.  But there is something more than just the on screen appeal with this movie. Something that allows the audience to experience a feeling of confusion along with the characters. We can become so involved in the story because all the story consists of is a pile of heavy sins. We feel the character's needs. Relate to the issues. Things happen that struck me so profoundly that I find myself listing the film on my list of top 100 movies of all time. In the last scene of "The Ice Storm" a key character brakes down and cries like a baby, with his family next to his side. We look back at all the wrongdoing he has done, at all the sins he has committed, and all the reasons he has to cry, and we fell his pain--and somewhere, deep down, we try to forgive him. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>disturbing, dark, and brutally honest film, three stars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ang Lee is a perfectionist, and it shows here in this excellent film about relationships between friends, lovers and families. The attention to detail is second to none, this film is wonderfully crafted, the landscape is filled in every scene with the beauty of nature or the ugliness of the humans that inhabit it. The dysfunctional family is not only observed, it is clinically dissected and placed under a microscope. So many divergent paths these characters take, so many of them the wrong paths, it is hard to look away, because morbid curiosity grips all of us at times. Sigourney Weaver and Joan Allen are both outstanding here and well supported by the rest of this talented cast. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Pointless Emotional Train Wreck</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Ice Storm" left me cold, really cold. At the end of the movie I was left with the feeling of being sucked dry. I spent 90 minutes enduring an endless series of pointless dysfunctional encounters that made me squirm in my chair with terminal embarrassment. The characters were dismal emotional wrecks with no moral inclination whatsoever. They had managed to ruin perfectly good lives and then inflict themselves onto me.If there was a point to this story it might have been - Adultery, wife swapping, and etc. will destroy you and all those around you. So what ? I never formed any emotional ties to any of these people anyway.How could you take so many talented actors and create a story no one should ever see? The writers obviously had talent, how else could they create situations that actually had me hiding my face waiting for the agony to subside. They had talented actors like Joan Allen and Kevin Kline, and yet wasted their time and ours. I found it hard to believe that this came from the same director/writer team that produced the charming "Eat Drink Man Women".On the plus side, the acting was good, the circa 1970's homes and wardrobes were the best 70's piece ever, and the cinematography outstanding. If you are the kind of person that stops to enjoy the carnage of a good train wreck, then this movie might just be for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ang Lee followed up his exquisite SENSE AND SENSIBILITY with an even more impressive film, THE ICE STORM, also a comedy about social behavior and the resulting chasms but one ultimately driven by misery and stunted by tragedy.SENSE AND SENSIBILITY was infused with a wisdom that came from cynicism; Jane Austen's story is essentially about a balancing act between happiness and responsibility and the strange way the two things intertwine. THE ICE STORM is a much more literal evocation of that theme. It follows a pair of Boomer couples living with their children in the '70s, that infamous shadow of their own social awakening.In the aftermath of the sexual revolution, we find the occupants of the film bored out of their minds with one another and life itself (recalling an assertion by MAD magazine about revolutions taking all the fun out of sex). Kevin Kline in particular appears to be turning into something we infer he must have hated at one time. Joan Allen, playing his wife (and brilliant as usual), is clawing at the universe trying desperately for some kind of escape. Sigourney Weaver, his mistress, is THE GRADUATE's Mrs. Robinson and therefore its Benjamin Braddock by extension -- bored, wise, and lost all at the same time. Their kids are being neglected and haunted by the distance that has developed between them and their families; they are forced into a kind of growth for which their parents never bothered to prepare them, and worse yet, they know it.The couples' idea of liberation has led to their decadence, but it's important to note that THE ICE STORM is not a preachy, moralistic movie. Its insistence is not that sexual awareness and honesty are bad but simply that the real life that inevitably comes knocking cannot be ignored. The world is ripped away because no one has been paying attention, and superficial ideas of need have replaced genuine purpose. At the end, Kevin Kline cries tears not necessarily of desperation or loss -- though these ingredients undoubtedly contribute -- but of joy, because he has realized, and it isn't too late.Brilliant performances all around from a now-all-star cast. Of special note is Christina Ricci; this may be her best work as she projects not just her usual cool candor but also a naiveté that warms the blood of her character. Tobey Maguire is also outstanding.While this has become one of my favorites of the last ten years, it is a difficult movie in some ways and it may take a while to appreciate, but don't miss it, and try and tell me you don't feel the cold air at the finale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful and touching, yet utterly disturbing and depressing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1994, author Rick Moody wrote a excellent, detailed and bittersweet novel about two dysfunctional middle class American families (no, its not American Beauty) living in suburbia caught up around the time of the infamous 'Watergate' scandal and the civil rights statement, as well as freak mid-winter ice storm. Two years later, Chinese/American director Ang Lee adapted the novel into a film, 'The Ice Storm'. However, the film remained quite marginal and hardly noticed, it was a major box office flop, yet critics seemed to love the film, I'm in the with critics, once again. It is nice to see now, that with Ang Lee's Oscar winning hit (what many even consider a masterpiece), Brokeback Mountain, everyone wants to check out his other films, this being no exception what so ever.Many of the people in Ang Lee's films are on the verge of somekind of breakdown, or are learning more about themselves and their sexuality, as is a case in this film. Almost everyone gets caught doing something associated with a taboo, or something they shouldn't be doing in this film. Set just before and on Thanksgiving (that most depressing and overwrought of Hallmark-driven holidays, perhaps especially in New England, where the whole hypocritical business originated), the film is cold. It's filled with images of visible breath puffs, frozen ground, and ice, delicately dark gray or crystal clear ? mementos of existential paybacks and endless cycles of pain. The moral design is a familiar one in movies and novels, in which carelessness, malice and guilt always come with extravagant emotional price tags.The ice is almost everywhere. At times, it has a metaphorical meaning which is overstated?these characters are frozen in harsh, fragile existences, and don't you forget it, they are stuck. But it's also great-looking and adds beauty to the film and the mess the characters are in; it clicks in the wind on tree branches and those chimes favored by people with porches, breaks open in those metal ice trays, makes driving treacherous, cracks when people walk over it and glitters in sunlight. Elena and Ben, like most everyone else in the film, might be understood to be living under ice, inside it, too close to its transparent surface. The two families are the highly dysfunctional and anti social Hoods and the Carvers, neighbors who need, compete with, and resent each other. They're all afraid to be found out as unhappy or under-resourced?to be forced to imagine alternatives. Their affluence is devastating.Elena Hood, is finding it hard to confront her husband, Ben Hood on his affair with Janey Carver, a cold and distant woman who doesn't like her real husband. The kids, (especially the promiscuous Wendy Hood) are all discovering more about their sex lives, and soon experimenting with it, however a majority of it is shown, because that's just the way it should be, it's style over substance, remember that one. Wendy Hood connects almost all of the kids together, as she has relationships with almost all of them.Everyone in The Ice Storm is either uptight, on the verge of breakdown, shrill and too aware of their various audiences. The film captures this sense of "verge-ness" perfectly. For all its aesthetic and thematic chilliness, it's about melting and depressing, too. And that's how you're left by the surprisingly dramatic but admirably underplayed finale, feeling just a bit melted. The performances are amazing, and it was Christina Ricci's first mature role, and I must say she handled it fantastically. Among the rest of the talented cast is Kevin Kline, Joan Allen, Sigourney Weaver, Toby McGuire and Elijah Wood. The direction is also fantastic, which easily makes Ang Lee one of the most talented active directors today.Overall, the Ice Storm is disturbingly bleak and depressing however all of that is totally relevant with its plot and all. It is an almost flawless film, making its way into the list of one of my favourite films, an unforgettable experience is what this film gave me.10/10 See It If You Liked: American Beauty, Blue Velvet and Brokeback Mountain -Luke Rowe-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb portrayal of a miserable time in America</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.I was in my late teens in the early 70s, and this film took me right back there, not just in the details of the music, clothes, cars, etc., but especially the popularity of the "swinging" lifestyle with lots of drinking, drugs, and casual sex. Books such as The Sensuous Woman, The Hite Report, and Open Marriage were best sellers then, wife swapping parties were in vogue, and sex in general was touted as the road to happiness. I wouldn't go so far as to say that casual sex destroyed families, although in some cases it did, but I think there were many unhappy families broken up by divorce and infidelity who, in earlier decades, would have remained together in secret misery ("quiet desperation") behind the smiling traditional family facade. The early and mid 70s were a miserable time in America for many reasons-- the energy crisis, economic recession, horrible winter weather (in the northeast, anyway), and loss of faith in the government in the wake of the Vietnam war, Watergate, and the Nixon administration. The basement sex play scene between Ricci and Wood is the ultimate metaphor for that time-- sexual experimentation between young teenagers is a normal part of life, something most kids do, and they might even have had fun, but Ricci throws a bizarre twist into it when she puts on the Nixon mask. Note Wood's confused and almost frightened expression as he approaches her. The act itself becomes purely mechanical, lacking any warmth or joy because of the physical barrier preventing eye contact. The mask is the perfect symbol of people hiding behind facades, of society's distrust of the oppressive and duplicitous Presidency (you might even say Nixon screwed us), and of the lack of warmth and human intimacy that went along with casual sex at a time when people were trying to find any means possible to feel better or even just feel good. The ice storm itself symbolizes not only the unhappy, cold, and dangerously slippery lives these people were frozen inside, but also in a larger sense it is a metaphor of a very unsure and uncomfortable era.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Depressing as Hell and worth every consideration</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I viewed this film I found it boring and pointless - actually falling asleep at one point. However, it left a sliver in my brain that just wouldn't go away.A week later I watched it again, and realized what a brilliant film this is. Not boring but subtle.Comparisons to American Beauty are quite valid, however the approach taken by Ang Lee is quite different and very effective. This is the 'American Dream' twisted and misguided. Beautifully showing what happens - what always happens - when we lose sight of the things that really matter in our lives for the sake of instant gratification and material desires.Depressing as hell and worth every consideration.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tedious exercise in dysfunction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First I should say, this movie could have been about my town and my family. I grew up in Connecticut and was 11 years old when the ice storm hit. My family was probably the typical dysfunctional unit of the 70's ? emotionally clueless, parents headed for divorce (though we didn't know that yet), so I should have been able to relate to this film.The problem with the movie is there's no humor, no humanity. It's just one dysfunctional, sad, deviant event after another. It's like someone from another planet was assigned a homework exercise to depict dysfunctional families on Earth. I couldn't relate to the characters and there was no one to like.I'll give it 4 stars for the nice cinematography, the all-star cast, the good period sets and clothes. Although Toby Maguire gives his usual staring-into-space, deer-in-headlights, stupid-half-smile, what-am-I-supposed-to-be-doing-again? performance, I thought the rest of the cast did their best with the material ? i.e. it wasn't the actors' fault!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What's to like? The Ice Storm is a ponderous bore, dealing with a bunch of (nearly all) unlikeable adults as they indulge in some rather unattractive infidelities and generally neglect their rather needy children. After a great amount of time and a large number of rather shallow antics, the movie artifically adds depth by randomly killing off an innocent character. Everyone becomes very somber, and the movie can now be lauded as a tragic reflection on the moral confusion of the early 1970's.To paraphrase a nasty remark about Hermann Hesse: "The Ice Storm is the ideal second-rate movie for those who wish to feel that they are grappling with first-rate issues."Bleeargh. Nice-looking direction, though. Perhaps Ang Lee has a bright future as a maker of nature documentaries or something.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ensemble Acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's easy to compare The Ice Storm to American Beauty and Happiness, both of which also dealt with disillusionment and the disintegration of the American Dream and the traditional family cell in the suburbs, and to a lesser extent The Sweet Hereafter which explored some similar themes in small town Canada. The Ice Storm is as cynical as those other films, but it's much more subtle in masking its sardonicism, and has aged much better than American Beauty, which had the appearance of a masterpiece at its release but looks flat and shallow now. The people in The Ice Storm feel more real and more human than the ones in American Beauty and Happiness; and the film walks that fine line between character-based slice-of-life storytelling and metaphorical satire, which works only because the viewer cares for the characters and their fates, while also absorbing the bigger issues under the surface.That would not work without a strong ensemble cast; the actors in The Ice Storm are not among my favorites, yet they all outdo themselves and produce sympathetic, powerful, convincing performances - Kevin Kline, Joan Allen and Sigourney Weaver are all at their very best, and the younger actors (Elijah Wood, Tobey Maguire, Christina Ricci, Adam Hann-Byrd and - amazingly - even Katie Holmes) all deliver too. In contrast with the (intentionally) despicable characters in Happiness and American Beauty, these actors form a group of very average people that the viewer relates to and cares about - but the dysfunction and sickness is right there beneath the surface, waiting for the right catastrophe to explode.There's an undefinable something that stops The Ice Storm short of becoming one of my favorites. The ending fits the mood of the rest of the film, but doesn't offer the catharsis that is needed, and it left me with a bitter taste. In the end, I found myself wishing that the film said more, and left more of a mark; the fact that it isn't often recognized as one of the best films of the 90's is simply because there's something not quite memorable about it. It's incredibly engaging throughout, though, and is definitely one of the strongest dramas of its time, beautifully shot, and a gem that's well worth discovering.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful and tragic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are a select few films that achieve on as many levels as The Ice Storm. The story shows the sexual revolution's effect on family life. Whether or not it's true, I cannot say, as I wasn't alive during the 1970's. What impresses me the most about this film is that Ang Lee directed it while he still was unable to speak English. As with most of his films, sexual themes (particularly sexual relationships deemed inappropriate). I've often seen this film compared to American Beauty, but I see the two as distinctly different.As for the cinematic aspects, film critics and casual audiences alike will be pleased with the strong and well cast actors. I've always felt that Elijah Wood and Toby McGuire bring tenderness to the roles they act. By tenderness, I mean that they portray a distinct human emotion in the way they act. Toby does this with his voice and Elijah does it with his facial expressions. Both of their abilities were very well applied here. Elijah Wood brought me back to Lord of Rings when he played outside during the ice storm. Toby was perfect as the nerdy academic character, as most know from Spider-man. Also, Christina Ricci and Sigourney Weaver were also memorable. Weaver plays the cynical antagonist she usually does, and she was particularly cruel in this film.The ice storm itself is also symbolic. I'm not entirely sure as to how, but I've always seen it as representing the inability to commute effectively within families. The ice storm reveals Ben's extramarital affair, Elena's current affair with Jim, as well as Wendy's affair with both Sandy and Mikey. The ice storm also leads to Mike's untimely death. Ironically ,the ice storm hinders Paul's sexual life, but he is the only character that isn't aloof in the film. This isn't to imply that the sex portrayed in the film is immoral, only to highlight its potentially destructive power. It takes an ice storm to manifest its destructive nature.As for comparisons to American Beauty, there are some, particularly the negative portrayal of the suburban American family. However, The Ice Storm differs from American Beauty in that it shows suburban life from a different time period. American Beauty portrays sex as liberating, while The Ice Storm portrays sex as hindering. Both films document a hidden truth behind suburbia, but there is little else similar between them.As for recommendations, I would encourage anyone to watch Ang Lee's first beautiful English-language film. It shows the importance of expressing one's sexuality within a limit but not without limit. The Ice Storm is a heartfelt effort and really shines in its ability to connect to its audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ang Lee's Finest Achievement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The summary of this review likely elicits a groan from every Crouching Tiger fan that comes across it. Maybe. It doesn't really matter much because I'm 100% correct. Nothing in Ang Lee's oeuvre is as studied, restrained, and beautiful as this film. A few years ago, I thought Ang Lee was among the greatest living directors--a belief based n viewings of this film, Hulk, Sense and Sensibility, and Crouching Tiger. Then I returned to most of those films. The Ice Storm and Crouching Tiger are the only two to hold up, and, frankly, Crouching Tiger was far less impressive on a second viewing. But the Ice Storm... I've probably seen it a dozen times or more and I'll likely see it a dozen times more. The characters are all too human and all too real. They behave badly, immorally on occasion, but they're not bad people. Kevin Kline's character is a fool, philanderer, and failure, but he cares about his wife and kids. The children try to do good, but fail. Joan Allen is cold and distant, and Sigourney Weaver is cold, distant, and cynical, but one cannot help thinking that that's the result of missed-opportunity. When I see the characters of the Ice Storm, I see individuals caught in a transitional moment. The adults, brought up in the imagined perfection of the post-WWII/early Cold War eras, strive to fit the molds they believe their parents occupied, but fail to do so. Housewifery is not fulfilling for the women and corporate America leaves the men wanting. The children experiment with sex and drugs but yearn for the simplicity of a time that doesn't exist, but which they perceive to exist through various media. The film studies characters dominated by malaise and ennui and does a brilliant job of doing so. The film is not the most uplifting, but it does offer hope at the end; the viewer perceives that things will improve. In addition to the story's and character, the film is stunning visually. The titular weather event is something to behold, and Lee takes his time exploring it. He takes his time, wallowing in the landscape of this film--time that American filmmakers typically do not take. There is something distinctly Asian about the cinematography of this film, and that's a welcome component, as it offsets this American story. The Ice Storm feels like a time capsule and slightly foreign. The details are period perfect and not a moment seems anachronistic. The music is eerie. The visuals are slightly Asian. This all adds up to one revelation: the past certainly is a foreign country, to quote LP Hartley (maybe).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK. I'll admit it. I went to see this movie because I saw the ad in the LA Times that showed Sigourney Weaver holding a whip. I was curious, and a little bit excited.I must recommend that you see this movie alone, or with someone who doesn't talk during movies. This is a movie that needs to be experienced as a whole, from beginning to end. And I'm NOT a movie snob, I'm just a regular guy that likes to watch a movie and let it influence my emotions without commentary from my neighbor. : - ) If you're like me, then you'll leave the theater thinking that you missed something (completely satisfied, but wondering). You'll think there's something that happened under the current, in the shadows, without your knowledge.Did everything in the movie happen twice? Was every relationship a reflection of another relationship? What was the message of this movie? I don't know. I've got the movie on DVD, and I've watched it about 20 times, and I still can't tell what I missed......(but I'm sure there was something). And if I figure it out, I'll die a happy man.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unimaginable waste of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What is most distressing at the end of this movie is that two hours of your life that you will never get back have been stolen from you--and that they were spent with the most repellent characters this side of a Peter Greenaway movie. It is hard to say what is more unbelievable--that people in the 1970s supposedly acted like this, or that we are supposed to accept the moviemaker's notion that people acted like this.What, exactly, is the point to all this? That people who live in funny-shaped houses are themselves warped? That we should all be thankful that we did not live in Connecticut in the early 1970s? That it's not a good idea to play outside during an ice storm?There isn't a single character here for the audience to sympathize with; Joan Allen's character comes off best, although she's basically a victim; and Tobey Maguire's character, as her son, comes in second, because he doesn't do what any other male character in the movie (presumably) would have done--take advantage of the young woman who passes out in his arms. But it's hard to see why anyone would make a movie about the rest of this sleazy pack, who swing like a pendulum between the immoral and the clueless.It's too bad, really, because there are one or two moments where some real emotion claws through the patently-false exteriors that we are supposed to believe in (Kevin Kline picking up his daughter and carrying her home through a gathering snowstorm, for example). At least some of it *could* have rung true--the voice-over commentary by Maguire's character, for example, which makes an analogy between the comic book he's reading and his family; or the happy ending at the train station by our now-chastened, and (supposedly) now-enlightened family. But that would have required that the rest of the story be about real people, not cardboard characters. As projected on *this* bunch of imbeciles, the whole exercise is simply a waste of the viewer's time and a waste of a capable cast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Three drift out of consciousness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is meant to offer a soft contrast as flow, between external life with people (family members gathered for Thanksgiving) anxiously pulled in disparate orbits, and the inner life of unfathomable urges and emotion that gives rise to the first?appearances versus true self, rooted in relationships and attempting connection. Set in 1970's America with Nixon lying on TV, the broader commentary is that the world is organized on deceit, misplaced faith. There is contextual talk of people as intertwined molecules, of inner life as inverted space where the invisible becomes visible. So here's the cinematic gambit, how to make visible a part of that inner life? It's what every filmmaker worth anything has puzzled about in his work, in-sight into human soul, no small challenge for Lee, though the film may otherwise seem typical.There are three connected story lines to that effect, each one culminating in a ritual of seduction as betrayal. Each storyline, climaxes with a loved one drifting out of consciousness in some way (drunk husband, Libbets, the son). This only emphasizes what we've been seeing for the whole film, people drifting apart heedless of one another. It all plays in the latter stages against the backdrop of a coming ice storm, it can't be helped, there's some inevitable unhappiness ahead of us.The overall point? In each case, as loved ones momentarily or not go out of life, those left behind are suddenly surrounded with that negative space of absence, and in that space pour their inner self and effect human connection.It may all seem a little cloying in the finale. But the best part is getting there, the protracted sequence with cross-cutting between the three stories of betrayed seduction. So how to make visible what in life eludes us, the fabric of feelings as cinematic fabric? This was very likely Lee's interest in the project, as well as more broadly the idea of dislocation.I was happy to see a cinematic solution that was nowhere in multithreaded films like Crash or Cloud Atlas. The idea seems to be, show each new scene from a point on, as extension, as in-sight or meditation on previous ones, as though a single soul is dreaming.So this is nice. The film is the empty space, as we think dull, day-to- day life to be. The characters as molecules drifting in the air, often apart. The loss of consciousness not simply as loss, but as meaningful awakening to that empty space where we, as molecules, do not aimlessly drift, but by virtue of being there, hold each other into place giving shape to life. Lee as usual has compromised, enough to deliver a movie with some broad appeal. The overall wrap is a bit too fabricated for my taste. But see how gentle are the contrasts between hard sorrow and soft inner life, where the very similar Melancholia eats at you, this soothes. It's all here natural to Lee, who as a Chinese knows this stuff in meditation and tai chi.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a masterpiece. It is an ambitious work the scope of which is breathtaking. A web of adults and children in which the dysfunctions of the adults are reflected in the tender probings of their kids. Larger contexts include suburbia, the Nixon-Vietnam political era, and the natural world of the ice storm. The movie unfolds with a beautiful tempo, like a sunrise or an unexpected flower. It is nearly impossible to predict which story line will be handled when, but the intoxicating rush of understated revelatory moments paralyzes any interest in suspense. The acting is superb. Kevin Kline's minimalist nervous breakdown and the melting of Joan Allen's spiritual deep-freeze are enormously pleasurable to watch. The young actors in the movie are almost eerily spectacular. Their acting, especially that of the two brothers and of Ricci, has a luminosity that is as transcendent as any performances I've ever viewed. Lee's direction is sensuous, understated, and loving. An entire world is being portrayed. A small door opened into a universe. While watching it, I was struck by its similarity to American Beauty. Both movies explore the myth of the American Family in decay in a suburban context, and both show the reflections of the parental narcissism in their children's' despair. But there is something about Ice Storm that makes it much more powerful than American Beauty. Perhaps it's the depth of the acting, although the acting in Beauty was hardly second-rate. Maybe its the distance of the era -- an added touch of nostalgia for the 70's, that adds an extra layer to the movie that is absent to the contemporary-minded American Beauty. I think what it is is a matter of the social context. American Beauty, although wonderful, is relatively cliché. We are familiar with its suburban ennui, with an older man's crush on a cheerleader, even with the wise child and his troubled father next door. There's something about the dysfunction in American Beauty that isn't earned the way it is in Ice Storm. Of course, this comes back to Rick Moody, the author of the novel the movie is based on. There is something of the novelist's eye to the Ice Storm. Some Shakespearian sense of intergenerational awe and of the cycles of the natural and social worlds. American Beauty lacks that. It's more of a comic book, more of a script brought to life by a stage-savvy director and some clever acting. Ice Storm is deeper. Much deeper. It's this gravity, I think, that holds the actors in its pull and allows them to transcend themselves. In my opinion truly one of the greatest American movies of the late 20th century.</fullReview>

Bored suburban families in 1973, I do not see any redeeming qualities in any of the characters that make me want to sympathize with any of them. Mom's Joan Allen and Sigourney Weaver and their husbands played by Kevin Kline and Jamie Sheridan wander aimlessly around, having affairs, trying to connect with their kids and survive. Joan Allen playing a straight laced, uptight character - what a stretch. Signourney is distant, aloof, Kevin Kline clueless and emasculated as always.There is nothing ground breaking here. Everyone is shown with all of the wrinkles, flaws and foibles of everyday people. No heroes in this movie. Great movie if you want to see life as it is, but why not just look out the window? It's all there, everyday, and this flick does nothing to shed light on our lives. Hey, did you know that unsupervised teens will experiment with sex and drugs?</fullReview>

Seriously, I felt like slitting my wrists. Reviews calling this movie riveting are correct. It's like watching a train wreck. You know you should look away, change the channel or pop out the DVD/tape, but you don't. You keep waiting for it to get better. You can't believe people can be so miserable. And for no good reason other than they live in the suburbs and they're bored out of their minds.Believe me, I got all the allegory, metaphor, symbolism, etc. And yet, I couldn't care. It wasn't the type of tale that makes you say "Oh my! Let me exam my life and make changes". It just made me want to drink a pitcher of liquor, take a shower, and watch cartoons to forget all the sad, sad people. But, to no avail. The images are imbedded.Oh!

		<shortDescription>Key party? More like death party!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ice Storm, set in 1973 during the era of the sexual revolution, is much more disturbing and eye-opening than its simple cover and title make it appear. Not only does it star some amazing actors/actresses, but despite the dated and nostalgic setting it has a timeless message: when parents forget their kids are there, well, kids still see, hear - and pick up on - everything adults do. Everyone was a kid at some point, and many of us can recall times when our parents acted more like teenagers than caregivers. The difference is, in The Ice Storm, the carelessness of the fictional parents leads to the horrible death of a little boy.Discos, key parties, drugs, booze, free love, it's all the thing in 1973 as the latest trend. The problem is, that kind of thing spreads to a middle-class community and starts messing up families and friendships. The true sufferers though are the kids. Wendy (Christina Ricci) is only fourteen but enjoys copying her parents' lifestyle, leading to her getting sort of a bad reputation. Libbits is just a kid but left home alone by her parents in a house filled with drugs. Sandy is obsessed with violence, Mikey is hardly noticed and Francis is always getting high.One night during a key party in the neighborhood, every one of the characters learns something shocking about the way the swinger lifestyle is; the sexual revolution isn't all it's cracked up to be. Just when it looks like things might change, one of the younger neighborhood children has gone outside into a deadly ice storm... and it was because, to the parents, he hardly existed until it mattered most of all.The Ice Storm really hits you at the very ending, when one of the parents breaks down crying at the wheel of his car in front of his family. He realizes that their own negligence caused the death of a child, all over a key party, a stupid game for adults who don't want to grow up. Wendy suddenly realizes how childish her behavior has been, and the parents realize that the whole time they were getting after their children for perverse behavior it was all being learned from the parents themselves. Kids pick things up. The Ice Storm is just a lesson for us all, a worst-case-scenario of sorts, set in a time not so long ago.The soundtrack was beautiful, the acting was excellent and the plot was very original (it was adapted into an episode of the show Cold Case titled "The Key"). And while the sexual revolution was several decades ago, today is the tech revolution. Adults are using phones more and more without communicating in anything but texts. Maybe The Ice Storm's message is more universal than meets the eye, because it's true, kids do pick up on their parents' behavior, and it's not always a good thing.</fullReview>

This one has two such clans, and every member of each family is assigned an issue (kleptomaniac, sex addict, social misfit, absentee parent, depression, etc.). It makes for a very contrived drama. The impressive cast manages to overcome some of the shortcomings of the script, but it all seems so heavy-handed. As a couple whose marriage has fizzled, Kline and Allen come off the best.

		<fullReview>A frosty, tear-stained eulogy for suburban America-as-innocence. Yes, it's been done before but not in quite the same fashion and this is as good as any predecessor. The film tells the story of a ferocious overnight cold snap and its consequences, although Ang Lee uses this as the crux of a longer essay in a corrupted, Watergate befuddled 70s middle America.Sigourney Weaver is the somewhat unhinged housewife Janey Carver, misdirecting her self-loathing when she catches her kids in a rite of pre-adolescence. Lacking purpose she looks for escapism with other friends in drugs and a bitter wife-swapping party. Jamey Sheridan plays her husband Jim as a lost jock, old-school America unable to keep up with this social disintegration. The greatest tragedy is always reserved for the righteous in films about the irrational and the characters and performances created by Kevin Kline and Joan Allen as Ben and Elena Hood cannot withstand the climate (in all its forms) that engulfs them on the evening of the film's title. Tobey Maguire and Christina Ricci are also excellent. A strongly affecting melodrama 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ben (Kline) is having an affair with Janey (Sigourney Weaver) unknown to his wife Elena (Allen) and daughter Wendy (Ricci) who is also fooling around with the local teens With an all star cast, and a strong dramatic plot, The Ice Storm is a true realistic drama, filled with solid and flinching entertainment.Big names Kline (A Fish called Wanda), Weaver (Alien) and Allen (Nixon) lead the way with stunning performances as the parents of teenagers who are played by modern day Hollywood A list stars McGuire (Spiderman) Ricci (Addams Family) and Wood (Lord of the Rings) to make the mouth watering prospect that was Ang Lee's The Ice Storm.Allen gives the best performance as the worrying mother and creates the necessary drama in her character's life to conform to the genre and this silent and edgy portrayal as Elena is exquisite and a joy to watch.Ricci delivers the best young performance of the film, being very quirky in her own way, and vastly different and just interesting to watch as viewers are brought into her unknowing and experimental world as Wendy.There have been many disappointments when big names have teamed up together, but that was certainly not the case for this 1997 drama as each performance is sensational and all actors bring their own side and own character to the dramatic plot. The different personalities and issues give the plot strong depth and a healthy variety to keep the entertainment at its highest.Filled with realistic ideologies including love, loyalty and loathing, the narrative portrays realism in an almost perfect manor in the form of two families with plenty of secrets.Teenagers are growing up and wanting to experiment, parents are struggling with their partners but all are looking for that refreshing sense of excitement, that escapism of life. Ang Lee's direction helps achieve this realism, with a very close shot approach to cover character emotions and occasional 5 second scenes being silent and believable in everyday life, and significant to capture that everyday life feel.Critics have said this is a very good adaptation of Rick Moody's novel, and no doubt that the book will be impressive if this film is anything to go by but with excellent performances and the sheer realism of the plot, The Ice Storm is excellent in producing quality entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...The song playing in the background at the beginning of the movie, where Paul Hood and his roommate are passing the bong at the boarding school? It's "Dirty Love" by Frank Zappa. What a subtle hint as to the flavor of this movie! At the same time, it makes perfect sense in context, what with Ben Hood and Janie Carver in bed together, Mikey Carver and Wendy Hood making out and later being caught with Mikey's pants down in the basement, Wendy and Sandy Carver in bed together, the key party, Paul Hood with Libbet's head in his lap at her house, and that pathetic scene where Jim Carver screws Elena Hood in his car. The whole movie almost reeks of "dirty love." This having been said, it's a very good movie, in my opinion. But prepare to be shocked, and not just at the ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Angst, despair, family discord and pointless sex played out against the dross of the empty decade. At times it has the can't turn away compelling voyeuristic nature of one of those MTV real life shows. The story is moody and slow at times but the performances ring true as do the situations and dialog. Elijah Wood is very good as the voidoid adolescent whose odd and tragically meaningless demise seems to hold the key to what's at the center of this story. The first time through I didn't think much of this movie but subsequent viewing yields a more coherent and heartfelt slice of life circa 1975. If you are looking for an uplifting film stay away, far away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The way we REALLY were</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was Paul Hood's age during Thanksgiving of 1973. If you were a teenager during 1973 you must see this movie. Ang Lee brings that era back in spades. The wardrobe is just amazing. 1973 was a really weird year anyway, people were depressed the sixties were over, nobody knew what would be next.. It was a really strange time. There was the first gas shortage in US history, and the price doubled. When you could find it. Terrific soundtrack, and a thought provoking look back at the US of that time. An all star cast, I won't repeat a lot of what's already been said, but the movie is like a virtual time machine.I think we were a better society then, a more tolerant one. Even Nixon seems benign compared to our current government.The serendipity of Tobey Maguire reading Marvel Comics is surreal now, with that whole Spiderman career of sorts which followed. The Party he thought he was going to be alone with Katie Holmes was evocative as well.. If you weren't partying, you weren't connecting. Human connection and family is the core of this movie. The recurring attempts at a real human connection was thematic. Joan Allen's quirky shoplifting and bicycle riding, her encounters with the long haired Reverend Philip Edwards was insightful. This is a movie with layer upon layer of pathos.I do think a special mention is reserved for Allison Janney. Great as the hostess, Dot Halford, The Halfords annual party; this time with the twist of being a key party. Her role, though small, was memorable. Especially the Zebra dress. Very 1973. The upper-middle class average woodsy exurban living kind of mirrored my own. It's almost spooky exactly how spot on everything was. I think Kevin Kline, Sigourney Weaver, Joan Allen, and Jamey Sheridan were horribly overlooked during the Academy awards decision making process.The most hilarious scene in an otherwise dark movie was Wendy's (Cristine Ricci, who the camera just loves by the way,) trombone recital at home. It consisted of playing two notes (badly), over and over. There were a couple of others, like when Sigourney Weaver's character Janey Carver parked her station wagon, heard a loud pop, and looked at her tire, as if it had blown out. Turns out her number two son, Sandy, (deftly handled by Adam Hann-Byrd) was playing with fireworks and generally creating mayhem.. The offer of the whip to play with was priceless. (The keys she later fishes out of the bowl were attached to a rather long leather woven tether, it works well the way she handles those keys in a way similar to the way she handled the whip.) Then when she goes inside to inquire of Mikey (One of Elijah Wood's best performances to date), if HE were aware of the fireworks outside. Mikey, sitting with Wendy while they both watched television, was oblivious. Sigourney Weaver, hearing THAT just shakes her head and rolls her eyes in a combination of disbelief and exhasperation and goes back upstairs. Sigourney Weaver was excellent and Oscar worthy in my opinion for her credibility in this movie. I knew this character type from then.Ang Lee's use of ice as a recurring theme, was well established, early and often.. Ice Trays, the old fashioned kind you had to actually crack open really set the tone for that. Even the turkey that Kevin Kline and Joan Allen wrestle with is frozen. The fact that the final 18 minutes or so of the movie is without dialogue isn't really noticed, at least not by me. Very moving anyway, that whole dénouement.I think I was one of the 4000 people that actually saw this movie in theatrical release. It's a movie best watched alone or with one other person. It was an early matinée and I had the entire theater nearly to myself. That was great too. I've since then owned in sequence, the VHS version, the original DVD, and I now own the CRITERION DVD and I watch it every Thanksgiving now. The richness of this film is astonishing. The Criterion treatment is well done indeed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is about two families in a suburban neighbourhood. The reckless actions of every member of the families causes devastating damages to every one.The cast is quite amazing. Acting skills are great, especially the repressed Joan Allen who is so restrained in the situation she finds herself in. The plethora of child actors are amazing. Christina Ricci, Tobey McGuire, Elijah Wood and Katie Holmes are in this film! Could it be just a coincidence, or there is some sort of magic in this film, that most of these stars are now top A list stars? Though the plot is tightly woven and highly emotional (that key party is beyond my imagination!), I still find it too factual to sustain my interest. It's a bit boring in the middle, but towards the end, when everything that has been built up suddenly comes down, a rather dramatic effect is created.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From this excellent movie. Ang Lee perfectly and convincingly captures the look and feel of two dysfunctional families in 1970s rural America. The acting is so good that in some scenes you cringe when ignorant characters make fools of themselves.The film is split right down the middle. First of all we have the story lines of the two affairing families and second of all there's the story of their children's' relationships with each other.Although Tobey Maguire does the voice-over on this film he is not really in it much but his scenes add some light-relief to a movie that is otherwise dark in tone.The only (tiny, little) gripe I have is that you never find out why Sandy Carver is a little strange. Or maybe you do and I'm just not concentrating enough.See this movie the next time you get a chance and it'll change your opinion of all those souless blockbusters out there that give you only visual effects rather than a real story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>1997: Kevin Kline's annus mirabilis</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"In &amp; Out" was the movie that made Kevin Kline my favorite actor, but he starred in two other really good movies in 1997: "Fierce Creatures" and "The Ice Storm". The latter shows the phony, empty lives led by several people in 1973 Connecticut. The plot involves suburban husband Ben Hood (Kline) having an affair with icy Janey Carver (Sigourney Weaver), and how this proliferates into irrevocable consequences.One thing that we notice is the difference between the parents and teenagers. It's certainly unhealthy what everyone is doing. But the parents are basically a bunch of despicable creeps. Therefore, when Wendy Hood (Christina Ricci) gets in bed with Mikey Carver (Elijah Wood), we may consider that inappropriate, but it's actually healthier than anything that the adults are doing. But even if the teenagers do anything unhealthy, we can't blame them; they have no good role models. The wife-swapping party just goes to show how alienated everyone is.All in all, this movie - plus his two other movies in 1997 - affirmed Kevin Kline as one of the greatest actors of our era. He almost seems at his best when playing a worthless, pathetic character like Ben Hood. Equally great are Weaver, Ricci, Wood, Joan Allen, Tobey Maguire, Adam Hann-Byrd, Jamey Sheridan, Henry Czerny, and even a pre-fame Katie Holmes. If the movie has any problem, it's that it takes a very cynical approach to everything, much the same way that "American Beauty" (although "AB" was better). And it showed what a great director Ang Lee is, as "Brokeback Mountain" would later do even more. Definitely worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Little Chill</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.Family dramas are a special problem in film. That's because the core of what we know and have come to expect was developed in the theater (and now on TeeVee). Family interactions are something invented by society -- usually film merely reinforces the major, theatrical form merely adding in the perspective of the day. Right now that is narcissistic pseudoirony (`Meet the Parents,' `You Can Depend On Me') which is rather boring.Lee is a serious student of cinema, and when he does something it is with the intent of advancing his ability to convey through images. That's why he chose the simple family drama, so that he could explore breaking the theatrical conventions. The theatrical way, for instance would have lots of talk, lots of emotional texture and some shouting. Think of `Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf?' Think of any number of dying lover movies.The problem is not simply one of being cinematic because one has to overcome such deepseated expectations of who carries what ball and when. This experiment could not have been possible without Kline, just as `Sense' couldn't have been attempted without Thompson.So we have as much of an imagebased little drama as possible. Watch this once with no sound to see how carefully it is constructed. Everything is so quiet and still. All the theatrical dynamics we know that are there are kept under the surface. The brilliance of the approach is that rather than fight those dynamics, he references them. So we know what the bicycle/shoplifting deal is all about without having it marched out as would normally be the case.To my mind, Ms Ricci today is an uninteresting artist. But here, she is used effectively as the visual anchor for everything. In fact, one can almost tease out the narrative with her voice over `It was the winter of...' This would be the case in normal dramas, like `Virgin Suicides,' but thankfully is indirectly referenced here with her masked as a liar. Very clever.His technique is to establish our world not in the family but in a recent past, one which is entirely defined by visual metaphors. This man knows what he is doing. My objection is that Lee tries for too little. What he does is done well, but I would rather he took bigger risks and transported me further and tinkered with my mind and soul and possibly damaged some actors and property. This is too great a talent to be gentle with.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outgoing unhappiness.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Interesting approach on the lives of some American families in early 70s.In fact, you could say that is a study on how it affects the socio- political situation of a country to its citizens.As we all know, and as has been written, the disappointing American political situation in the late 60s and early 70s led to weariness and distrust. This is brilliantly reflected in the movie. Lee's approach is intimate and personal and plunges into the depths of the psyche and human behavior. Moreover, not only adults are depicted in the story but also their children. Displays the sexual awakening of young people in an open and realistic way. However, parent's feedback before this awakening, gives rise to questions. It is easy to realize the amount of prejudice and confusion of adults: so apparently responsible externally, and erratically behaving internally.Storm visuals are amazing along with the music. Particularly striking is the little attention adults give to the storm, even as phenomenon of nature .They are so immersed in their own personal problems that can not see beyond. As in other films (Picnic at Hanging Rock, 1975) there is a force of nature, which is silent witness of everything that happens, and ultimately, ends up bringing the situation to a climax.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is not a pretty picture, but this film really captures something essential about life in the prosperous Connecticut suburbs in the 1970s. The details are spot on (with the exception of a couple of ludicrous sweaters), and I felt transported to that time and place. Here we have a couple of families that appear to have it all, yet below the surface there are big cracks starting to open. Each member of the Hood family gets to be a part of the narrative. There is infidelity, sexual exploration, a fair amount of drinking, and what looks like budding insanity. Things come to a tragic climax over Thanksgiving weekend and a nasty ice storm. The film is enlivened by many wonderful shots and subtle, sardonic humor. Who could forget the "key party" (not a common occurrence, althou the movie acts like it was - lol!) or the Nixon mask scene?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ang Lee's Best Film Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Years before he hit big with "Brokeback Mountain," Taiwanese-American director Ang Lee released what I consider to be an even better film, 1997's "The Ice Storm." Kevin Kline and Joan Allen play Ben and Elena Hood, a seemingly happily-married suburban couple in 1973 Connecticut. Tobey Maguire and the still teenage Christina Ricci play their children, Paul and Wendy. But alas, all is not as vanilla as it seems, for Ben is having an affair with a neighbor, Janey Carver, played by Sigourney Weaver, in her best (and most vulnerable) performance ever. Ironically, daughter Wendy is sexually experimenting with Janey's son Sandy.The Hoods and the Carvers both attend the same "key party," a form of swinging in which the women draw the men's car keys from a bowl, then sleep with the owner of the keys. Here, Janey's husband, Jim (Jamey Sheridan) realizes his wife is having an affair with their neighbor. He and Elena spend the night together too, then return to find their teenage children in bed with one another. So two families, one affair, and three liaisons. Yes, Kevin Kline stars, but this is not some fraternity-level comedy. This is a serious, heartbreaking dramatic representation of the ashes burned from the sexual revolution of the 1970s ? all played against the backdrop of a New England ice storm brewing outside.Those of us too young to participate have a tendency to think of the sexual revolution as some kind of wild, ongoing swingers' party, in which partners were traded and swapped like baseball cards, and those unfortunate enough to be married would certainly play along without feeling any repercussions to the traditional family structure. This is obviously an inaccurate description, and Ang Lee brilliantly illuminates the anguish experienced by many families. I suppose the most distressful relationship of all is that of the sexually-catechizing teenagers. Studies have shown children mimic their parents, and if their parents are sleeping together, well then? The performances are all first-rate, especially Sigourney Weaver, who was nominated for a Supporting Actress Golden Globe award. And it's revealing to watch Christina Ricci at 17 years old, in her first "adult" role. Her Wendy character carries herself with the poise of her mother, yet with the guilelessness of a child. James Schamus' screenplay (a winner at the Cannes Film Festival that year) features some of the most candid and open dialogue I've ever witnessed. Lee smartly refrains from overdirecting ? letting his star cast elucidate the material effectively. Kline and Weaver let us into the hearts and souls of their philandering characters, allowing us not so much to judge them, but to feel their pain, as it were. We not only bear witness to their struggles, but we develop a connection to their very souls.Unfortunately, "The Ice Storm" was simply lost in the shuffle of all the great motion pictures of 1997 ? the box office champ and critical success "Titanic," Curtis Hanson's "L.A. Confidential," Paul Thomas Anderson's first classic "Boogie Nights," Matt Damon's and Ben Affleck's breakout film "Good Will Hunting," and Dustin Hoffman in "Wag The Dog." Plus Robert Duvall and Peter Fonda turned in the best performances of their long, successful careers with "The Apostle" and "Ulee's Gold," respectively. There simply wasn't room for "The Ice Storm" in the conversation, although it certainly deserves its place on the mantle of the many virtuoso films of 1997. This was one of the finest films of one of the best years ever for motion pictures.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Underrated Family Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The late '60s/early '70s were a hard era for everyone. Gone were the years of trusting the government, of listening to cultural norms; too cynical were the times. After decades of oppressive societal expectations, housewives no longer had to imitate Lucy Ricardo, the kiddos didn't have to reek of Cherry Cokes and wholesomeness, and the husbands suddenly didn't have to only bring home the bacon; they had to think about their feelings, too. Some thrived, some stumbled ? putting out one's most kept secret emotions onto a table for everyone to see isn't an easy thing to do, after all. So you had your Bob and Carol and Ted and Alices, swinging away and having fun (for the most part), but you also had your bourgeoisie trying on the clothes of the open-minded and not knowing what the hell to do with them."The Ice Storm" is a flurry of sexual, drugged out, pathos infused liberties, perfectly capturing the simultaneously free and miserable echoes of its time period. None of the characters are happy, so much so that it seems fairly plausible that they miss the suffocation of the time in which they could mimic "Leave It to Beaver" and be contently empty. Ang Lee, pre-"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" and post-"Sense and Sensibility", directs "The Ice Storm" not as a head-shaking cynic but as a voyeur helpless when approached by the lost decisions of Rick Moody's characters.Taking place over the Thanksgiving weekend of 1973, "The Ice Storm" puts in motion a parade of maladjusted actions, specifically focusing on the Hood family and their neighbors, the Carvers. Mrs. Hood (Joan Allen) has picked up a shoplifting habit and is hardly speaking to her husband; Mr. Hood, in the meantime, is having a soulless affair with Mrs. Carver (Sigourney Weaver). And as Mr. Carver (Jamey Sheridan) busies himself with out-of-town business ventures, the kids of the families mostly hang around his home. Wendy Hood (Christina Ricci), a sexually curious 14-year-old, is in the process of attempting to seduce both Carver sons (Elijah Wood, Adam Hann-Byrd), either through make out sessions or show-me-yours-I'll-show-you-mine romps. The older Hood child, Paul (Tobey Maguire), is away at prep school, experimenting with drugs and attempting to win the heart of the damaged Libbets Casey (Katie Holmes). All of these characters are like trains ready to derail, and as an upcoming ice storm looms in the clouds, ready to destroy the premises, their emotions begin to mount until they reach an existential breaking point. "The Ice Storm" is not the kind of film you analyze, the kind you have all figured out before the closing tells you otherwise. This is a movie you want to observe, to listen to, to discuss later but savor in the moment. The plot is complicated, sure to tangle ? but it effortlessly connects the dots like a well-guided Altman epic, brilliant in its conception and brilliant in how well each side-plot complements the other. It's a movie of heightened discontent, one in which the characters attempt to escape by utilizing their newfound freedoms (sex, alcohol, drugs) but realize that, deep inside, a larger void is waiting to be filled and material things can hardly do the job. The film causes an ache in our heart, partly because it's difficult to see people suffer so intensely and partly because we are just as much in the dark regarding how to end their misery as they are. They feel helpless, we feel helpless ? it's a vicious cycle that stays unforgettable.The performances are phenomenal, the actors embodying their roles instead of keeping a safe distance away from them. "The Ice Storm" is a movie built on emotion and life-is- comedy situations, not worn out melodramatic devices ? Lee, certainly one of the most versatile directors of the last two decades, keeps melancholy pumping and solution at a safe distance; in Tinsel Town, it's easy to invent a resolution for the sake of a happy ending. But things aren't so simple in "The Ice Storm" ? agony is much more common than glittered fuckery.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I experienced what you see in this film, as a child. There were a lot of bored adults back then. If men, most commuted to a major city from their nice suburban homes. Or, if they were women, they were "housewives." They lived in areas that had very little in the way of social activities for adults. Where I lived, even the large mall that was newly constructed (in the early 70s) was closed on Sundays! They were not young adults but they didn't view themselves as "old" (in other words, they weren't going to Woodstock). Those portrayed in this film seem to be a bit more "upper middle class" than the adults I was exposed to back then. I don't know if there were any "key parties" in my neighborhood, but I learned later that there was quite a bit of "wife swapping." Anyway, these people (the adults in the 30s/early 40s especially) saw all the fun the young adults were having (which they didn't have), but they were stuck with all kinds of responsibilities. Yes, they were better off than most "middle class" Americans are today, but they were "Baby Boomers" and had inflated views of what to expect. They weren't all so "uptight" but I remember that most were, as if they were hiding dark family secrets. They didn't like to show emotion or "weakness," and they were generally suspicious of anything "unusual." The Watergate backdrop is brought up but not explored properly, though perhaps it was in the novel, so this is clearly a flaw. I have my doubts about this being useful, but the director didn't even try, IMO.This film captures at least some of that, and yes, it's not particularly attractive (just like a trip to the slaughterhouse may lead to an avoidance of meat for a few days). Even as a child, I found myself often bored, despite having a nice back yard and plenty of toys. There seemed to be a lot of internal conflict between the old, stodgy ways and the new, tie-dyed ones. Perhaps a better film that illustrated this psycho-social situation (and did it much earlier) is "Serpico," which also had more focus and drama. I'm not sure that this film really contributes anything more, and as others have said, it's rather depressing on some level. Why not do a documentary instead, interviewing people who were of these ages in the early 1970s? Actually, that was already done as well, by the PBS series on the Loud family ! Spiritual bankruptcy, or whatever you want to call it, is nothing new, though perhaps it can be said that there was a specific manifestation of it in the American suburbs at this time. There was a "Twilight Zone" episode about a real bad guy who got killed and thought he had gone to Heaven. He was greeted in the afterlife by a supernatural being (a middle-aged guy in a suit) who told him that he could have anything he desired. What happened? He soon got bored, because he always got what he wanted, exactly how he wanted it. That's when it was revealed that he was actually in Hell. "The Ice Storm" captures this kind of realization, but for me the main problem is that there is also an attempt to be a kind of "anti-film," and that's where it fails for many people, I'd speculate.Ironically, it's an excellent film for the "new way" of viewing many of us have adapted in recent years, which is to watch a movie while doing things online. Often, when I do this, I come to one of two conclusions: either that I should watch it again, with greater attention, or that I'm glad I didn't pay too much attention to it and don't plan on watching it again. With this film, I think to myself, "the ice storm is a metaphor that illustrates the emotional coldness and loss of a sense of moral restraint (that is, going on in an ice storm because there is a party), among other things perhaps." I'm not that upset by the lack of sympathy/empathy I feel towards these characters because I didn't pay enough attention in the first place! So, perhaps this is at least one "solution" to the problem we see the characters dealing with in the film, but of course most people these days would love to have such "problems" (or at least that's what they probably tell themselves).I think this would have worked much better as a mini-series, so that each episode could have been devoted to one of the several plot points raised. Instead, everything seems incomplete or rushed. And at least some of the characters could have been presented in way that evoked some empathy from the viewer, regardless of their apparently overall dour view of life. Instead, we get a glimpse into too much of the ordinary and unappealing, and I found myself thinking, "what can I possibly get from watching more of this?" before the halfway mark. In a mini-series format, each episode could have a proper arc.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE ICE STORM is a deft observation of a period in the early 1970's when the social awakening of the 60's actually began to infiltrate and subvert the decorous sexual sensibility of mainstream America. As the grim fiasco of Watergate unfolds, we watch Dad self medicate with booze, Mom jump-start a makeover by way of the newly emerging self-help industry, and the kids run riot. When it appears that the steadfast dependability of the past has been reduced to a quaint fabrication, The Ice Storm Of The Century blows through this upscale Connecticut neighborhood, and things really change forever. Kevin Kline takes the bemused character of Ben Hood and makes him absolutely believable. And, Joan Allen's stoic personification of his wife, Elena, matches his stellar performance note for note. Rick Moody wrote the fine novel upon which the film is based, and Ang Lee is one of the few who could have so successfully brought it to the screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Imagining Peter Parker as a virgin is not hard, but I never suspected I would see Tobey Maguire taking bong hits.But, that is just the beginning of the Ang Lee film that will surprise you.Let's see: Paul's (Tobey Maguire) parents are Ben (Kevin Kline) and Elena (Joan Allen), and Ben is sleeping with Janey (Sigourney Weaver), who is married to Jim (Jamey Sheridan). Paul's sister Wendy (Christina Ricci) is fooling around with Janey &amp; Jim's sons Mikey (Elijah Wood) and Sandy (Adam Hann-Byrd). Paul has a thing for Libbets (Katie Holmes), but his roommate, Francis (David Krumholtz) always manages to get the goods before he does. Dot (Allison Janney) organizes wife-swapping parties.Just some typical fun in the burbs. Fine performances by a cast of favorites dealing with family dysfunction and loss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life's a mess in Ang Lee's America</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie on TV almost a year ago after reading some very positive reviews, and the fact that Ang Lee's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is one of my favorite films also played an important role in my decision, which I didn't regret.The Ice Storm tells about a middle class American family in the '70s reuniting for Thanksgiving. They all have their issues: the parents' (Kevin Kline and Joan Allen) marriage is slowly unraveling, as the bored father embarks on a relationship with his neighbor (Sigourney Weaver); the son (Tobey Maguire) just wants to get out of there and spend his time with a girl (Katie Holmes) he's been in love with for some time; and the daughter (Christina Ricci) starts doing bizarre sexual experiments with a friend of hers.Lee's genius lies in the fact that he shows the characters'actions without judging them: his film is funny, tragic and disturbing at the same time, much like another middle class masterpiece, American Beauty. We laugh at those people but we also care for them, and that's possible thanks to the superb actors: Kline, Allen and Weaver are all terrific as the confused, unsatisfied adults, but it's Ricci and Maguire who really shine with their extreme but honest performances (best bit: Maguire's monologue about the Fantastic Four, five years before he became a Marvel superhero too).I compared this excellent movie to American Beauty. There's actually one difference between the two films: I've seen Beauty a lot of times, while The Ice Storm left me with a weird kind of feeling which makes me uncertain whether I'll watch it again any time soon. But don't let my statement be discouraging: like Lee's other films, it's totally worth a look.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one amusing, intelligent and well-acted film, which seems a bit light-hearted at first but actually has you thinking about important aspects of life from adolescence to adulthood. Just look at the cast and you know you're in for a treat. Furthermore, Ang Lee is an excellent director, who can almost handle any genre and knows what to do with his actors/actresses.The story centres around the lives of two American upper-class families in the seventies. The movie deals with topics like the dawning of sexuality, experimental drug-use, parental adultery and general education. Christina Ricci's character provides some interesting social/political comments every now and then. The seventies are adequately re-created not only by appropriate costume/set-design and hair &amp; make-up but also by building time-references in the background-story-line, like the Nixon Watergate-scandal and the 73's ice storm from the title. The movie never preaches a message on the above-mentioned subjects but tells the story objectively. The interaction between the cast is excellent and you really care about the characters (especially the younger ones), which is very important in this type of film. Don't expect a nicely wrapped-up story with a clearly defined ending, because ICE STORM only shows us a part of the lives of all characters and the movie ends abruptly with the death of one of them.Ang Lee's ICE STORM comes highly recommended and I personally place it somewhere between Robert Altman's SHORT CUTS and Sam Mendes' American BEAUTY.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a slice of life kind of thing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those films you happen to come across whilst channel hopping late at night, notice the star studded cast and think, "Yeah I'll watch this."Whilst the actors in the film drew me in to begin with, I was kept from changing channel by the film's character and plot lines. It was a slow film, I'll admit that, but I tend to like that sort of thing. This film was what I'd describe as a "slice of life" film. Slow moving- as is life, and in which, although there is a climax to the film, one feels as if nothing has really been resolved. The life of the characters will go on after the film. We haven't seen a story necessarily, but a part of those people's lives.I particularly liked the way in which the adult's affairs, in a way, discovering sex anew, correlated with their children's first tentative and strange sexual experiences. As the narrator of the film says, and I paraphrase, "life can pass you by." This film reflects that P.O.V rather well. This film could indeed pass you by. I gave a shrug at the end of the film, wondered why Bowie was playing over the credits and changed channel. It was not a film that affected me particularly, but I'm still glad I saw it.dom</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film begins as slowly as it can; until the first hour, nothing much really happens and you have no idea of what to expect about this picture. I believe Ang Lee didn't have a story in mind and just utilized some ideas from Moody's novel. In many scenes we can notice that the filmmakers don't know what to do, so they just have the characters talking to each other. The cast is profession, we can see they really get into their characters, but that's not enough to make this movie any good. The only thing that enjoyed me is the braveness they have at showing how kids start their sexual life. You know, I'm only 19, so I can vaguely remember how these things worked in my mind when I was a kid. You're always worried what would happen if your parents found out, and in the end, they're doing their best to not see it. And let's not be hypocrite and believe that kids don't have sexual tension between themselves...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deft and accomplished ensemble drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After already being mesmerised by Sense and Sensibility, Brokeback Mountain and especially Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, I looked forward to watching The Ice Storm. And I wasn't disappointed. The Ice Storm is a wonderful film, and as an ensemble drama it is deft and accomplished. The cinematography and production values are top notch, and the ice storm itself is beautifully realised. The story is well paced and interesting though as the film progresses it does get increasingly complicated, the script is brilliantly written often being quite thought-provoking and Ang Lee's direction is superb. The acting is also terrific, Kevin Kline is excellent, while both Joan Allen and Sigourney Weaver(in a different role to anything else she's played) are outstanding. All in all, The Ice Storm is a fine film, I'd go as further to say it was one of the better movies of the year. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Multiple themes and compelling story. Very under appreciated by the general public.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think like many people I just happened upon this movie one night when I couldn't sleep and there was nothing else on. From that point on I was hooked. It's such a combination of themes:coming of age movie, cautionary morality tale, nostalgic romp through the 1970's, sexually compellingthat it's hard to pin down. As a parent it's hard to watch the death of Elijah Wood's character and the pain felt by his father (knowing that he's at least partially responsible for his death). It's also hard to watch the movie and not want to yell at the screen for the bad parenting you see (e.g., don't trust and verify where your kids are before you get laid by your neighbor).The idea of a "key party" is now so quaint (and maybe I'm so old) that I'm not sure what the modern equivalent of it is. I was a child in the 70's and my parents to this day don't reveal all of their exploits (I've heard of a naked pool party once but they tell me they left).One of the questions I have is, how did they duplicate the ice storm? Did they just wait for winter and spray everything with water and let it freeze? If anyone knows some of this trivia, I'd love to hear it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many reviewers have noted the similarities between The Ice Storm and American Beauty, and indeed there are many. It's not a coincidence, however. Most people fail to notice that The Ice Storm predates AB. While the latter is sappy, its predecessor is unyielding, the way real life works.I have seen most of Ang Lee's movies, and I would say the Ice Storm is distinctly Ang: conveying thoughts and emotions more with scenes and visuals than with words. This style is probably a direct extension of Lee's personality, as I've heard him described more than once as "a man of few words." The downside of this approach is that his movies do not appeal to people with a short attention span.If you haven't seen The Ice Storm, I will only say this: the last scene at the train station alone makes it one of my favorites.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When watching "The Ice Storm" you get the feel that life is somewhat of a dread and a dark nature, as you see the characters in the movie struggle with things and everyday real life. Still the picture teaches the need to explore and it shows how everything and everybody's life is connected in one way or the other. The film is well acted too with an all star cast as the on screen chemistry is top notch.Set in 1973 Connecticut "The Ice Storm" looks at the life of one family that being the Hood family and how they deal with nature and human nature combined with emotion and dysfunction. The main themes involve abuse and casual sex as Ben Hood(Kevin Kline)is a self centered husband who's in an affair with a middle age mistress named Janey(the elegant and sexy Sigourney Weaver)and due to this Ben's relationship with his wife Elena(Joan Allen)is growing colder as Elena does a husband swap at a friends party. Plus to complicate this all both children of the Hood's have growing pains with drugs and sex as Paul(Tobey Maguire)is a comic book reading nerd who's exploring the vices of sex and drugs for the first time as the same holds true for the daughter Wendy(Christina Ricci). Thru it all change and acceptance and discovery and coming to terms with life is reached by all in this movie true, this film is dark in nature still it's a drama that teaches patience and dealing with life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great first half, flat second half</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thanksgiving, 1973. We meet two dysfunctional families living in New Canaan, Connecticut. The Hoods are Ben and Elena and their children Paul (16) and Wendy (14). The Carvers are Jim and Janey and their teenage sons Mikey and Sandy. Ben is having an affair with Janey. Paul spends most of his time at boarding school but is coming home for Thanksgiving. Wendy and Mikey are in a relationship, of sorts. Sandy is infatuated with Wendy. One night all their relationship and family issues reach a tipping point.Started very well. First half was great - quirkily funny with some great oddball family drama. Characters had depth and were engaging. Everything seemed set up for fantastic second half, complete with more quirky comedy and some intriguing family drama.But, alas, it was not to be.Second half is pretty dull, even silly, and ends in random anticlimactic fashion. After a largely comedy-driven first half, director Ang Lee gets all serious in the second half, turning the movie into a full-on drama. Laughs become few and far between. Moreover, the drama is dull, pointless and not at all profound. Very disappointing, especially considering how well it was set up.Can't complain about the cast though. Heaps of big names, some of which weren't that big at the time: Kevin Kline, Joan Allen, Sigourney Weaver, Tobey Maquire, Christina Ricci (16/17 at the time) and Elijah Wood. We even have Allison Janney and Katie Holmes in minor roles. This was Katie Holmes' first role, in either film or TV.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's not easy to keep from just wandering out of life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Would Ang Lee's The Ice Storm be as effective in a bright summer's day? I think not. The opening has a ghostly, near empty train diligently chugging its way through the icy winter landscape, as a sort of futile attempt to bat back the elements that buffet these suburban families. It shines its headlights out in vain. Other vehicles, including the numerous cars parked on the street too fall to this chilling weather. Would the characters feels as frozen and trapped if it was not below and zero, thus forcing them to stay indoors to keep warm and confront the utter banality of their middle class lives. The answer is no. Ang Lee has composed a quiet, frozen little picture of this town, and how it has rendered its inhabitants frustrated and static. We do not ever learn of the setting's name; it could be anywhere in 70s America. The production design and costuming has a particularly dulling effect. It feels as if even in the cold weather they are trying to maintain stylish through fashion and decor...these bright colours might pop in the sunlight but there is none of that around, and thus staring endlessly at the same wardrobe and kitchen set they begin to realise the complete facile nature of their lives. Some have long resigned to it - see the long line of gray trenchcoats congregating at the train station for another day of 9-5. So what do they do but resort to a wide range of wild vices, the usual escape from the clean, uncluttered and nuclear image of the American dream. Sex in the abundant theme here. A key swap party is one of those things that sound spicy and exciting in theory but cannot suddenly be thrust into a community as miserable and anxious as this one and bring about a change or epiphany. Their wide eyes and fake smiles persist agonisingly up until the actual choosing of the keys, where their wild personas begin to crack and we can almost hear their brains churning and thinking "So this is really happening then...". The film's best moment is that one couple that 'accidentally' chooses themselves, and feigns a small fuss and quickly scurries away before anyone can object - none of these adults can readily and openly admit that they are not nearly as emotionally stable enough for this kind of game, so this couple sees its chance and runs with it. Another brilliant moment is shortly before that, where a plumper woman fishes out a set of keys and waits a little longer for someone to confess or to bite. It manages to hit that tender note of being both a little funny and a little sad at the same time. What was wild and adventurous in their minds has warped into something stifling and uncomfortable and it takes a moment for them to realise it. No doubt that no couple's affair that night lived up to what they had been promised. Opposing them of course we have the kids who are ironically, the more mature ones about their sexuality. This theme is a little on the nose. We can see that the adults are pretending to be risqué but really rigidly uncompromising without having Ricci parade her body around to any boy who cares to look/feel. Lee somewhat tries to get away with this by masking it with the sexual curiosity of young children, but his objective is pretty clear. He pushes these scenes together for this purpose; Janey chastises the kids for being so sexually explicit and open, warning "our bodies betray us" and yet later she is in bed with someone that satisfies her on a purely physical level (and perhaps not even that by the film's end). Ben does the same when he discovers them in the basement, deflecting his own infidelities by telling off her daughter for being so sexually frank. Meanwhile Tobey Maguire is the third counterpoint - the dopey, naive freshman who has a girl's mouth deposited right onto his crotch, but knows better than to take advantage. How long before he too is frustrated and bound by the confines of the small town? I cannot avoid a mention of Revolutionary Road. Yates wrote about a different time period, but the feelings are all the same. And yet that story of the Wheelers feels more developed, more natural. Their ambition to flee the quaint little suburban setting is the actual thing that destroys them, and it is tragic in the way they have blinded themselves and yearned for things far, far away whilst ignoring the material right in front of them. In The Ice Storm the characters are also pretending. But their demise doesn't come from within, from their own mistakes and self-delusions. It comes from the titular phenomenon itself, as Mikey is struck down by the electrical wires. This is the cheapest way to invoke tragedy, to pick the most innocent character of them all and to kill him off arbitrarily. In the end they are sobbing, but because it has occurred as a freak accident removed from their actions it feels needlessly cruel rather than truly tragic. The punishment is not earned.</fullReview>

I kinda wonder if maturity is the key to fully enjoying this movie. Either that or becoming emotionally dysfunctional, and here's hoping that doesn't happen.But aside from that, I think any of us can appreciate the authentic period detail, moody vibe and exceptional ensemble cast.

		<shortDescription>A Truly and Completely Amazing Movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I honestly think 1997 was the best year for movies. Look at all the calibre hits that came out that year. Even the non-great films (The Edge, Spawn) were still cool to see.Out of everything that came out that year, The Ice Storm is the most overlooked. I had only heard of it after seeing Gene Siskel's annual Top 10 lists. He ranked this the best movie of 1997. Although I disagree that it is the best, it is certainly in my top 10.The Ice Storm stars Kevin Kline, Joan Allen, Sigourney Weaver, Henry Czerny, Tobey Maguire, Christina Ricci, Elijah Wood, Katie Holmes and David Krumholtz. Aside from Titanic, this has the best cast of 1997. The movie is about two neighbouring families: the Hoods (Kline, Allen, Maguire, Ricci) and the Carvers (Weaver, Sheridan, Wood, Byrd). Each member have their own subplots that are ruining their lives, and eventually intertwine. Kline is sleeping with Weaver and struggling with drinking; Allen suspects infidelity; Wood wants to get serious with Ricci but she wants to do some exploration; Maguire gets high with his prep friends and wants Holmes. The coldest storm ever is about to hit and effect everyone. This is a coming of age story for everyone in it. I could really relate to every subplot. Everybody is selfish and not caring about the other, that is pretty much what the movie is about. When the storm hits, some images stay with you as they symbolize different things in the story. Sometimes, ice is a nice thing to see and we also see it in its darkness. Each time the ice changes its mood, it foreshadows the mood coming up. The ice could also be used to represent how the main characters are: cold. None of the characters are really nice or likable. But they are still very compelling and interesting. How Ang Lee could do that is beyond me. They live in the woods in suburban New York. That could show how isolated they are with reality and the rest of the world. It all builds up to a shocking and heartfelt conclusion that stays with you for a long time. The denouement is a real tearjerker. Afterwards, you are left thinking about the movie as a whole and what it all says. Everything that the movie says is phenomenal.Still Ang Lee's best movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie essentially focuses on a dysfunctional family living in Connecticut. The father "Benjamin Hood" (Kevin Kline) is having an affair with a woman named "Janey Carver" (Sigourney Weaver) who lives with her husband and children not far away. Benjamin's wife "Elena Hood" (Joan Allen) suspects that something is going on but hasn't gotten to the point where she can actually accept that fact. Meanwhile the teenage son "Paul Hood" (Tobey Maguire) attends a boarding school in New York while his slightly younger sister "Wendy Hood" (Christina Ricci) is extremely curious about sex and wants to experiment with the two teenage boys of the Carver Family. Anyway, things becomes more complicated as the story unfolds but rather than giving anything away I will just say that while the movie certainly had some depth there were a couple of things I didn't care for. First, the portrayal of sex with a character who is supposed to be only 14 years old wasn't something that I particularly liked. Additionally, quite a bit of the movie moved at an extremely slow pace and the film could have used a bit more intensity here and there. Even so, despite these weaknesses I liked the early 70's flavor and for the most part the film managed to keep my attention. Accordingly, I rate this movie as about average?not great?but not bad either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1973, suburban Connecticut: middle class families experimenting with casual sex, drink, etc., find their lives out of control. In the weekend after thanksgiving 1973 the Hoods are skidding out of control. Benjamin Hood reels from drink to drink, trying not to think about his trouble at the office. His wife, Elena, is reading self help books and losing patience with her husband's lies. Their son, Paul, home for the holidays, escapes to the city to pursue an alluring rich girl from his prep school. And young, budding nymphomaniac, Wendy Hood roams the neighborhood, innocently exploring liquor cabinets and lingerie drawers of her friends' parents, looking for something new. Then an ice storm hits, the worst in a century. Things get bad. Roger Ebert wrote "There is a sense of gathering tragedy, symbolized in one scene where a child balances on an icy diving board over an empty pool. When disaster does strike, it releases helpless tears for one of the characters; we reflect on how very many things he has to cry about. Despite its mordant undertones, the film is often satirical and frequently very funny, and quietly observant in its performances, as when the Weaver character takes all she can of Kline's musings about his dislike of golf, and finally tells her lover: "You're boring me. I have a husband. I don't feel the need for another."" Overall, the Ice Storm is disturbingly bleak and depressing however all of that is totally relevant with its plot and all. It is an almost flawless film.</fullReview>

But what this movie lacks is a real plot and a clearer direction, indeed the scenario resembles a patchwork of disconnected, rather uneven scenes and story lines that are not that productive. There is also too many characters which induces a inevitable dilution of the story, not to mention that the common denominator, the sexual liberation in the 70's, is not the most interesting. Ultimately, the only thing that really stands out in this movie, whose cinematography is excellent by the way, is its genuine sensibility.</fullReview>

The acting is good, I enjoyed a lot of it except the parts that dealt with the stupid adult behavior. They definitely did a good job with the 70s feel and I think that's what I find most annoying. They took the stereotypes from the 70s and made adult characters out of these stereotypes. Most people didn't act like that, there were some but not most.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is set during Thanksgiving 1973 and centers on two upper middle class Connecticut families who are trying to run their course in the Nixon era and free themselves from their blah feelings through drinking, adultery and sexual experiments. Both the parents and the children have dull lifestyles, they are financially secured, and there is a serious lack of joy and enthusiasm in activities and communication, incl. sexual relations, jobs/studies.The cast is strong: Kevin Kline, Joan Allen, Sigourney Weaver, and that-time minors Tobey Maguire, Christina Ricci and Elijah Wood, who all give catchy and splendid performances. The title has both direct and indirect meaning and the director Ang Lee has fulfilled another great task, the only problem seemed to be with the release year - 1997 - when, among others, Titanic was released and the movie in question obtained less praise and publicity it should have had. But it is never to late to watch a valuable movie (again), especially if the plot dealt with the past events anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Sensible Movie That Explains Oedipus Complex In An Easy Way.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ice Storm is a metaphor of country life. I do not read the original novel by Rick Moody; but I think the film is an appropriate adaptation of that novel. Every plot is very carefully drawn in the film. A master work by director Ang Lee that I will never forget. The movie is like a fact file of hundreds of truths of our daily life. Every character in the film is a part of us. The storm begins with Paul Hood (Tobey Maguire) reading Fantastic Four comic book in a late night empty frozen train. The movie is mostly about the relation between two neighboring families lives in a suburb town. The characters are very life-like that I suddenly feel everything is just happening in front of me. Ben Hood (Kevin Kline) is the father of two child Paul Hood (Tobey Maguire) and Wendy Hood (Christina Ricci). The irony is that both of the child are in their adolescent and their parents are unable to guide them at this stage. The same thing we can see in the Carver family. Janey Carver (Sigourney Weaver) and Jim Carver (Jamey Sheridan) have two boys Sandy Carver (Adam Hann-Byrd) and Mikey Carver (Elijah Wood). That very night all the guardians went for an ironical Key Party that make them funny and irresistible to control their basic instincts. And the children are children, they follow the way that showed by the society and misguided by their parents. Young Wendy (Christina Ricci) is a grown up girl of 14 and she is in her adolescent but her parents hardly care to guide her in proper way. Paul (Tobey Maguire) 18 years old boy successfully controls his lust inspired by reading Fantastic Four comic is very sentimental. Albeit Ben (Kevin Kline) his father tries to tell him about the duties of a gentleman but he fails to make him understand appropriately. Ben has a bitter relation with his wife Elena (Joan Allen) that comes as an opportunity to grow an extramarital relation with his next door neighbor Janey Carver (Sigourney Weaver). The ice storm changed everything in a single night. Janey leaves the party with a young man to fulfill lust and desire. In the lustful late night game played by all the mature men and women of the society where Ben acts like a fool and humiliated. Same night Jim Carver, Janey's husband and Elena Hood Ben's wife become out of control of their basic instinct. The film concluded in a poetic justice with a sacrifice of 14 years old Mikey Carver died in an accident in the ice storm night due to his careless parents. Next day Ben found the dead body. And Elena found her 14 years old daughter Wendy and young Caver boy Sandy (Adam Hann- Byrd) sleeping naked in Caver's house. Caver family lost their one son and Hood family realize that how much careless they are? In a particular scene of this movie carries a good lesson. One day Elena sees her daughter riding bicycle that reminds her own teenage years and next day she rides the bicycle and entered into a shopping mall and stole some products to enjoy her young age behavior but caught by the shop kipper and humiliated. The irony shows the young girl Wendy gets the same behavior like her mother. The movie is very practical and worth to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch It for the Strong Performances!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the 1994 novel of the same name by Rick Moody, 'The Ice Storm', directed by Ang Lee, is a disturbing, yet watchable film, mainly because of the strong performances it offers. It's a human-drama, which caters to a select audience.'The Ice Storm' is Set during Thanksgiving 1973, where two dysfunctional New Canaan, Connecticut families are trying to deal with tumultuous political and social changes of the early 1970s, and their escapism through alcohol, adultery, and sexual experimentation.Like it's premise, this human story is a complicated ride. James Schamus's adapted Screenplay offers some interesting moments, that hold your attention. However, I thought the Sub-Plots needed some work. Though, They don't come across as premature, but at the same time, don't look completely convincing. Some glitches, I feel, could've been worked on.Ang Lee's understanding to this subject, is efficient. And his direction at many sequences, leaves a stamp. Cinematography by Frederick Elmes, is perfect. Editing, deserves a mention.Performance-Wise: Each and Every Actor Scores! Kevin Kline is impressive, as always. Joan Allen is flawless, and stands out in each sequence. Sigourney Weaver delivers a bravura performance. What a talented actress! Jamey Sheridan is superb. Christina Ricci, Tobey Maguire, Elijah Wood &amp; Adam Hann-Byrd are effective, as well. Katie Holmes gets limited scope.On the whole, Watch It, mainly, for it's Strong Performances!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Ice Storm" Directed by Ang Lee, exhibits the evolution of materialism, and the effects it has on those who are possessed by it.Values based on how much one owns or how successful one is are displayed in this film to its exacting ends. The time frame is over the 1973 Thanksgiving Day and the Fri. after.Basically involved are the two upper middle class Connecticut families , the Hoods and the Carvers. Ben Hood(Kevin Kline) is having an affair with Janey Carver(Sigourney Weaver), who is cold and calculating. Elena Hood(Joan Allen) is the distraught housewife, who is having troubles dealing with her life and her husbands infidelity.As the story unfolds, the whole community is involved with key parties(wife swapping) and most of the other traps that come with materialism.The children play an integral part of the film as their adolescent intrigues get them involved with sexuality and experimentation with drugs. Elijah Wood, Tobey McGuire, Katie Holmes, and Christina Ricci blend together to fulfill the nascent generational gap.The literal ice storm is the representation of the out of control world of these out of touch adults.There are many real moments, that are shared with the viewer, and recapture the lost innocence of youth, very well done. This film is required viewing as it captures the spiral of descent of adults who are not in touch with reality and create their own moral universe. 8 stars out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very interesting (and accurate) view on American lifestyles.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ice Storm paints a portrait of the average, Joe-blow American lifestyle. When you first hear he plot of the film you may think it's pretentious and untrue; a myth, but when you see it you catch yourself saying "I guess that's happened to me before."The Ice Storm focuses on sex as the film's core. There's an affair. There's a wife who knows there is an affair going on with her husband. There's teenagers curious about it. There's many conversations revolving around sex between: adults to adults, teens to teens, adults to teens. In the 2009 film that's set in the late '60s, "Nine". Kate Hudson has a line saying that sexual revolution is coming to the surface. This film takes place a little after that and shows that it's true. The huge sexual revolution came upon everyday people who swore by God and the bible all their lives. They were confused. They decreased with social skills because of it. And they became so addicted to it. Thinking about it. Talking about it. Living by it. It's a very strong-messaged film. Besides the wonderful script, the acting is the strongest point. Joan Allen, Sigourney Weaver, Kevin Kline, and Christine Ricci in particular turn in excellent work here. It's one of the best ensembles of the '90s. The way, each actor can control a scene controlled by another actor is really interesting. While, it may drag at time with some of the less interesting characters (i.e. Tobey MaGuire, Elijah Wood), but still solid work from Ang Lee. James Schmaus fashions a script that really gets you thinking and discussing life. Lee handles the script in such a delicate way without manic scenes or over-the-top melodrama. This could've been a really dull film, but I don't know what it is that Lee does, but turns it around to make it non-boring, if that makes sense. You get to see Christine Ricci's best performance, as well as snubbed Oscar-worthy performances from Allen and Weaver; 8.5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An outside view of the American family...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know, not everyone has experienced the propagandizing of the "American family" and its supposed values. Ang Lee is a foreigner, an outsider, a dumbfounded voyeur, scientifically recording the absurdities that he observes rather than parroting the Nixonesque "truth" that is delivered by the mainstream. This is what someone who isn't drinking the koolaid sees.This film strips away all the mythology that we have grown up with. This is not a pleasant process. We have become used to the plots and characters of television and Hollywood. Every time, there is a disturbing scene, one should ask, why is that disturbing? What unspoken expectation or rule has been violated? But in the end, after all the fake outer packaging has been removed, we finally do arrive at the real family core values. The simple ones that we all share, whatever our upbringing. The final simple scene is moving, poignant and cuts to the heart of the meaning of family.Absolutely brilliant...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this movie tries to show lives imperfections in everything, sexuality, marriage, relationships. How a family isn't a single entity but how the choices of each other effect everyone around you. In the end, we're all just trying to make it through this crazy world and often times we become so detached, drained, emotionally exhausted, that we give in to the temptations and forget about how our actions will effect those dear to us. It's not until something truly life shattering like the loss of a friend or child that we can examine and realize our actions to (hopefully) make a positive change for the future.To me this is demonstrated by through most of the movie the characters seem to be taking somewhat selfish paths and its not until a breakthrough moment that the characters break out of the routine and make a change. Such as when Elijahs character dies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Be Forewarned: The Pacing is Sloooooooow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ice Storm is a startling look at 1973 America and how lost so many people (parents, children, neighbors, etc.) became during this transitional time. The free-love of the 60s spill over into the 30 and 40-somethings of a sleepy Connecticut community and runs smack into the dysfunctional family of Ben and Elena Hood (Kevin Kline and Joan Allen).Ben is having an affair with his neighbors wife, Janey Carver (Sigourney Weaver, ALIENS), and the boredom they both feel during their "love making" is palpable. They want something different to happen, but what that "something" is remains unobtainable. And the two's lackadaisical attitudes toward sex, family, and the times seep into their everyday lives; even into their spouses' and children.Ben's wife Elena gets caught shoplifting from the local pharmacy. Janey's husband Jim goes away on long business trips and returns with funks of depression because of what he witnesses going on in his family.The children of Ben and Janey are also settling into this bizarre behavior. Some of them explore sexuality in often strange ways, or run out into storms and play on ice-covered roads. Others blow things up with M80 firecrackers, or smoke pot and drink to numb themselves out.But all of these people's lives will change in an unalterable way during one evening; an ice storm has hit and the cold outside bashes against the cold each character feels inside. Some will live, some will die, and others will never be the same.The attention to detail on the 70s in director Ang Lee's movie is astounding. The sweater-vest outfits, paneled station wagons, and boxy homes were excellently filmed.You can also feel the dark undercurrent running through the characters' lives: the grayish landscape cinematography against the quiet homes that harbor secrets.The cast was absolutely perfect, too. Kevin Kline (one of my favorite actors), Sigourney Weaver, Joan Allen, Elijah Wood, Tobey Maguire, Katie Holmes, Christina Ricci, and Jamey Sheridan all pull in stunning performances.Having gushed over how well done the movie was, I do have to comment on its pacing. If you thought SIDEWAYS was snail-like, this movie may make you feel as though grass could grow faster.Director Ang Lee has had some serious success in Hollywood as of late (BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, 2005), but this earlier work is an excellent way to see how he's grown in the intervening years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a suburban cliché' is born......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i'm sure there were movies about "the dark under belly of the suburbs" before The Ice Storm, but since it there seems to be an endless parade of movies about how the most functional and drab of all places is actually a repressed landscape of cultural crassness and sexual promiscuity. Add in adolescent sexuality and someone having premature ejaculation and you seem to have every suburban domesticated drama of the past 20 years.That said however this is a wonderful movie, for rising above MOST of the genre cliché's. That and Christina Ricci pulls of an awesome performance as the curious nymphet of the picture, this a few years before she became the staple of cynical femininity. But it makes me wonder A) whether the suburbs i grew up in were really more than just lawn care and cable TV? and B) where the hell was Christina Ricci when i was eleven? The first question confuses me, the second makes pour myself a third drink to remove the disgust i feel at having been somehow cheated.Ang Lee does a wonderful job of directing and a number of up and comers such as Tobey Macguire and the always dependable Elijah Wood have strong performances. Sigorney weaver shines in a world far far removed from her Aliens roll. The plot rolls along nicely with a few touches and nuances that would have slipped past a lesser film.9 out of 10</fullReview>

And it must have been considerable, with Lee perfectly recreating both the look and the feel of the '70s, in everything from the clothes to the slightly grainy film used. All in all, it's a stunning creation, perceptive and heartbreaking, made all the more fascinating when you realise this tragically accurate slice of Americana was made by a foreigner. Perhaps too restrained and slow for some- but all should be able to admire the stunning artistry on display.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A daring film that explores the negative sides of humanity. SPOILERS!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Matt Maisano IDS 210 9/27/04Ang Lee's The Ice storm is a daring film with fresh, realistic characters. It is a story that we usually won't see at the multiplexes, and there are reasons for that. The Ice storm explores different views of family life than is traditionally shown on the silver screen, and it is a better film because of it. I will discuss the film first with a brief summary of the film's plot, then go into an examination of its content, in other words what I think meaning of the story is.The film takes place in New Canaan, a wealthy town in Fairfield County. The story for the most part follows two families, each with two children about high school age. The kids do drugs, have sex at a young age, and are overall confused and unguided by their parents. The parents engage in spousal trades and secret affairs. Tension builds until the closing of the film when Mikey gets electrocuted to death outside in the storm. Now lets back up and talk about morality and symbolism in The Ice stormAs I stated in the introduction, The Ice Storm is a film that presents its audience with perspectives of family life and adolescence that we rarely see in film. There is no sugarcoating in this movie. Take for example the dialogue in the film. Almost all of the characters speak in short, often cynical or 'cold' sentences. The filmmaker uses this sense of 'coldness' in his characters, and applies it to the environment of the film. If the kids are talking to their parents they say only what is necessary to response. Even in the thanksgiving scene, when Paul's family is all together at the dinner table, there was still an enormous sense of distance between everyone. The temperature of the film can be felt by the conversations and interactions of the characters within the story.Tobey Maguire's character Paul hood makes a quote in the film that I think strongly connects to this idea of sort of a raw, cold world in the film. He says something like 'Everyone exists in a negative zone that we dip in and out of. Some people get tempted by it and stay in the negative zone.' This line is sort of a summary of the film in itself. In almost all the interactions there is a sense of this lurking negativity that comes and goes from the scene. It is almost a character itself. To make a more specific example, Paul's father Ben is who I think the quote is supposed to symbolize most. He has dug himself a hole of negativity way before we even see him on screen. He's cheating on his wife and is detached from his family because of his lack of parenting. So we could make the connection that he is in the negative zone, well into it. When he tries to bond with his kids, and tries to connect with his wife, he is dipping into the 'positive zone' but never really staying there. As the film goes on we see his affair, and more importantly his marriage, become ruined. His temptations gave in to the lurking negativity and became consumed by it. In conclusion, The Ice Storm is an excellent film about families that are separated and alienated from each other. It's about confused adolescence, and at the same time the struggles of adulthood and marriage. The main aspects that I find most interesting about the film are the coldness of its characters and that relation to their environment, and the negativity that walks among them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>COLD (possible spoilers!!!)!!!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie The Ice Storm focuses on the lives of adults and their children while they all encounter a vicious ice storm back in 1973. The movie is a lot to take in if you're easily uncomfortable with content such as adultery, sexual experimentation between young teenagers, drug use, parents and their children with a great lack of communication, and childish crimes such as stealing. With an ice storm and hardcore content for the characters to evolve off of, the movie was a lot to take in for me personally.We are introduced to characters that will take us on a blind tour of their different lives, but not so different when it comes down to the very clear revelation that they all share one thing in common: they all have issues. Some characters we can relate to (that alone is scary), some we can learn to like, and some we absolutely despise. However, underneath the characters that attempt to hold our attention lurks a very clear sign: people are not who they appear to be on the outside, rather it's the inner side that secretly desires to come out and be seen. The movie brilliantly delivers characters who must choose between going with what they truly desire inside or ignoring the push of temptation towards whatever it is they personally seek. Like the characters in the movie, we all have desires and want things. The movie is also there as a clear reminder that if we're not careful with what we choose to do with our forbidden lust, there are consequences that can do more damage than an ice storm itself. All in all, I did like the movie, but I found it to be depressing. I do recommend it for anyone who enjoys a good drama. It is one of those movies you should see, but whether you like it or not will depend on you. To watch this movie once a month is enough for me, but the sexy Christina Ricci brings out a hidden desire deep within myself to see it more than once.-T.M</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Family Tragedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is one of the best family movies I ever seen. I am deeply touched about the content of this movie. I will say director Ang Lee put his all effort to make the every character real. This movie shows the lifestyle and distance between all members of a family, in 1970.it takes a lot to make a film about adultery, wife swapping, underage sex but the director 'Ang Lee' has managed very well in here. The casual comedic elements are very good and enjoyable and the dramatic elements made me feel for or with the characters.The movie is based on the life of two upper middle class families in New Canaan, Connecticut during the year 1970. Instead of being examples to their children, parents are trying to run away from their children. They are busy with their casual sex and thereby hurting each other. In the meantime the children are left to their own world, watching bad thing on TV, emptying their parents' drinks, blowing up toys on the balcony, shoplifting, experimenting with sex and drugs. They are busy in their own world. They are independent, nobody behind them in their old. The communication between parents and children is hush or they have no communication at all. All in their own way are self-absorbed and ultimately selfish. They, all the time more disconnected from each other , until a tragedy caused by a natural tragedy finally calls them back to real world and, hopefully, makes them look beyond themselves and see how valuable life is. It seems to me that they were dreaming and suddenly they woke up. May this provoke back the belief in what the family as a unit can do for each other if they stand together? And that's the real truth of life. The film does end a bit too quick but it also proves that life doesn't stop after a tragedy or disaster. The tile ice storm has a big connection with the theme of the story and it's made the movie perfect.Overall, The Ice Storm is a much impressive film. The some scene is movie is uncomfortable and at the same times it's showing the truth of real life too. The theme is presented in such a human and meaningful manner. The dialogue is great and there are even very funny scenes at times. This person in these movies seems like real and seems like us. Overall this film is supremely well written and its allows us to get to know the characters and the truth of real life. In my opinion 'The Ice Storm' is overall a good family film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This particular movie was very heartfelt to me, even though the characters didn't seem sane or normal they move you in a different way which causes you to sympathize for them and even care about them. You almost want to reach out and save them from themselves and from each other. The characters seemed so unreal but yet believable enough that you can interpret the characters and compare them with a member of your own family. The roles that they play are very sad but affecting in a strong way because it makes you wonder about human nature and our race itself. People are exceptional and intense but our actions aren't always explainable. The movie is well crafted, the symbolic meanings behind the cold, bleak and almost fearful weather and atmosphere and also the close comparison between the comic book characters to the real family are overwhelming when you actually give yourself a chance to take it all in and consume it in your mind.The movie made me think about family values in a new light. You realize that there are many dysfunctional and imperfect families, and after watching this movie there is a desire to reach out to your own family and respectfully show them your devotion and unconditional love. The movie was amazing in a way that it makes you realize how powerful communication and affection is within a family because without it, a strong solid family unit can be sadly and painfully torn apart.</fullReview>

Ben's affair becomes non-existent because he cant seem to just get down and to the point without rambling on like he was married. The acting is superb each person shows the range of emotions from lust to disgust with such intensity. I personally think the scene with Mikey on the diving board is heart grabbing, i sat there with my nails in my mouth waiting for him to fall off and break his neck, but Ang Lee did his death with such emotion, seeing the pain on everyone brought tears to my eyes.

		<fullReview>The Ice Storm directed by the amazing Ang Lee, portrayed characters battling addictions from alcohol and sex to hide their true pain of what was tearing their families apart so quickly. This movie is definitely one that only needs to be seen once in a while. It leaves you wondering, "how can people really act that way to others they love?" Sadly life brings situations like that all the time. When you see it on screen though it fills you with sadness and leaves you heavyhearted. The night the Ice Storm took place left the movie in a shocking sadden standstill. None of the addictions and betrayal added up to the death of a young boy, a death that could of been stopped if the adults acted like ones. Basically, the movie leaves me frustrated but it was done well letting you really see in to all the characters thoughts and emotions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It takes a lot to make a film about adultery, wife swapping, underage sex, set during the height of the Watergate scandal anything less than completely engaging but Ang Lee has managed it here. The acting is astonishing. Kevin Kline, as usual, shows himself to be one of the most versatile and underused actors in the world, Sigouney Weaver adds another vampy M.I.L.F. to her repetoire, Christina Ricci makes you wonder what she will do when she gets to old to play Lolita's, and Elijah Wood makes up for being so irritating in the Lord of the Rings films. The problem lies with the direction. The film is so full of symbolic burts of nature (frosts, winds, trees billowing in threatening breezes) and stilted, narcotised, emotions (everyone in the film is chugging on downers throughout) that you begin to feel you are in an encounter group for depressed urban bhuddists. The main theme of the film, sexual repression and curiosity leading to ultimately tragic consequences, is made clear but it is not a film that you can actually enjoy. Although I think the later film is highly overrated this is a forerunner to rather than better than American Beauty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fine film - but a few weird</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Film overall really good - cannot believe how one review calls it a bomb - unless they were British - where 'bomb' means great.But some of the dialog was amazingly wooden - at least as to how it was said.And some was physically unbelievable - for some reason the director decided to devote 2 minutes to standing on the end of an icy diving board - including showing it to be slippery - then it is bounced on and slipped on - yet the jumper remains on the board! Sure - quite trivial - but why do minutes on such a scene and have it be so phony? Like doing a 2 minute blow-up of a wart.And the conductor on the train announces 'New Canaan, ConneCticut. I lived for 21 years on the CT border - even worked there - spent summers there - and NEVER till now - no matter how slovenly someone's speech - ever heard the second 'C' pronounced in 'Connecticut' - and even emphasized.And never did figure out how one set of keys was left with only one male to go with it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Direction wow...This is great direction.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ok I will start by admitting that the only other Ang Lee movie I have seen is Crouching tiger. Well I have seen that film enough times I can almost speak Broken mandarin(kinda like Chow yun-fat) I had yet to any of his other films. I got the Ice storm not because of the strong cast but because of Lee. I knew CTHD was amazing and knew that Lee was known for his powerful films. While I enjoy Kung fu, horror and the like I also enjoy fine cinema and that is what this is. A dark an d brooding drama that is intended for a relaxed audience, who doesn't need explosions.(OK so there are a few small ones!)Ang Lee shows here that he is a maser director. Leading brilliant actors in a whole ensemble of pitch perfect performances that are so fine tuned to each other you know that there was massive direction. It is all over the screen. That is not to say that the film transparent, just the opposite. In novel adaptations dialogue often gets slipped in that overdoes trying explain the thoughts of characters. Mystic River had some awful moments where the actors can't help but look foolish saying certain things people would never say. In Ice storm this never happens. In the hands of a dumber actor a role like Sigourney Weaver's may have caused the actor to demand more dialogue. Here like pros the cast do what actors should be able to do convey what they are thinking. You know who Weaver's character is and you know what she is about. Really is there a person in the film who you don't?The film is tragic without being melodramatic. The timing is amazing and makes for suspense in a way that drama has potential to do, but often doesn't bother to try. Was Ang Lee dominated that year?if not it is a shame.If all that was not enough there is still a story. Ice Storm also makes a point. Well the experimentation of the kids will sexuality lead to dysfunction the adults are making the same mistakes. Great film. My wife and I are still debating the finer points of what we saw the next morning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most moving films I have ever seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is nothing about this touching, intelligent film that doesn't deserve top marks, from the director Ang Lee to the actors, including stunning and very sensitive performances by the young actors Nina Ricci and the very talented Elijah Wood. Normally not given to watching any film more than once, I have seen this film twice now and was moved to tears both times. Playing in 1970's America it shows the effect of relationship breakdowns not only on the adults but also on the children, who, without guidance experiment with sex, in the same way the adults do. After the harrowing climax of the film, the lesson to be learned is that emotional and physical intimacy rather than the desire for fulfilling sexual fantasies, is what keeps marriages together and provides an environment that allows children to grow up with a sense of belonging and emotional security.Oh, and there are some laughs too!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You heard of the old adage, "fooling around has it's price". That's what the movie is all about, Nixon, the Watergate Scandal, a lot were around during the time. "The Ice Storm" had a way of its title. Curiousity leads to destruction of the American family. The daughter played by Cristina Ricci emulates her character of a curious, but precocious teen seems to fit her real-life self already. When she shows "hers" to the brother, his insecurity set in, until the party happens when he got more curious and less insecure of himself. Though the "Hoods" lost the son to electrocution, a lesson was learned. Never play with fire in any storm! This was indeed a strange movie, it was also pretty good for those who like dark comedy. 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well done drama!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all you may have noticed the amazing cast. Tons of well-known good actors. This movie is extremely even-tempered. It's very calm for a while before it starts to unfold its complexity. The casual comedic elements are very good and made me laugh, the dramatic elements made me feel for or with the characters.The characters in this movie are totally screwed up. Every single one of them is either weird, psychotic, mad, or psychopathic. They all live in a screwed up environment and a society of screwed people where no one really knows what to do with his life somewhere at a place called nowhere. That's probably one of the interesting aspects of this movie.But there's something else that's really unique. If you have observed well then you might have noticed that everybody has lost everybody else. Allen lost Kline, Kline lost Allen, Weaver lost Czerny, Czerny lost Weaver, Czerny's family lost son, Wood lost Ricci, Ricci lost Wood, Holmes' boyfriend lost Holmes, Maguire lost Holmes and his family as well (a while ago), and so on. In the end it is only Kline's family that's visually complete.Some of the urban scenes (eg. the railway tunnel) were really damn creepy and even these ultra-short scenes were more suspenseful than most cheap horror movies out there. Ang Lee did an amazing job on directing this movie, however there are things that simply didn't fit or make sense. If you watch the movie carefully you'll notice them yourself.However there's something that annoyed me throughout the whole movie. The story takes place in 1973, right? But there's really just a minority of things that makes it look like 1973. Most of the people and furniture, etc. looks like it took place 10 years later, like in 1983 or 84 or something. Many things were just too "modern aged".Okay, some of my ratings are: acting 8.5/10 (great!), story 8.5/10 (great as well!), directing 7.5/10, cast 7/10 (Weaver was annoying me), cinematography 5/10 (below average, but probably intended), environments 8/10 (cold, dark, fits the screwed characters well).My overall rating: 8/10 - A MUST SEE!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie, some questionable casting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ang Lee's THE ICE STORM was certainly one of the better movies of the last half of the 1990's. Great acting, and good story. The replication of Watergate era bored upscale suburbans and their attempts to "spice up" the drab, daily proceedings was dead on. Kudos to the make-up people, as S. Weaver's hairstyle screamed "early 70's Hanoi Jane" right back at me.However, I did have a major problem with the casting of Christina Ricci and "Frodo" as the children of Jane Allen's and Sigourney's characters respectively. Both of the leading women are about six feet tall, and both Ricci and E. Wood are downright "hobbit-like" compared to them (i.e.-about a foot shorter)! I just never bought the fact they were the kids of the leads, despite both of them being accomplished child actors who have taken on meatier roles in their mid-teens.But in summary, a worthwhile movie, probably best-watched when you're housebound during a snowstorm.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Except for Tobey Macguire (who really didn't fit the part), there's so much talent in this movie. I especially liked Sigourney Weaver whose calculated bitchiness really added an icy poignant touch. This movie disturbs on so many levels: It's deeply cynical and existential. One question: Why was Joan Allen's character shoplifting?...just to show the sick connection with her daughter? It really didn't work. Also, no one is going to believe that Kevin Kline and Joan Allen could have produced those two children...not biologically possible. Otherwise, you have beautiful cinematography and an affecting story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Observational look at 70's suburban life. Solid and true to life, but not re-watchable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ice Storm is a dissection of suburban life with a `winter storm' climax, hence the title. It has a very large cast and for that reason it can't simply focus on one character. If one sub-plot reaches a climax they quickly switch over to another story, so it's observational but not participatory. Despite the fact that there are a number of different characters, they all manage to nicely develop. Kevin Kline shows his acting range here and does well as the sleazy, cheating husband. Given that he was in a lot of comedies that same year (Fierce Creatures, In and Out, Wild, Wild West) this is a pleasant surprise. In one of Joan Allen's breakthrough roles she also shows her acting depth and gives a very humane performance. Sigourney Weaver is delightful is a super b*tch. The youger actors are every bit as good in their roles aswell. A pre-Spiderman Tobey Maguire does well as the hormone driven son. Christina Ricci is also good as a 14-year-old seductress, as is a pre-Frodo Elijah Wood. The least known of the younger cast, Adam Hann Byrd is very impressive here. He already proved is acting ability in Little Man Tate as Jodie Foster's son and he is very convincing here. Too bad his career sort of vanished. The only person who didn't impress me though was Jamey Sheridan as Sigourney Weaver's husband. He only makes his first full appearance at about 20 minutes from the end and even then, he doesn't make much of an impact.The Ice Storm is very true to life in its vision of adult and adolescent life. The film does end a bit too suddenly but it proves the point that life doesn't stop after a tragedy. But still, they could have gone into a bit more detail there. Overall, The Ice Storm is a hugely impressive and muchly underrated film. It has some flaws but with a cast like this, what's on screen is never boring. 7.6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Ice Storm reminded me a lot of American Beauty, which of course is a good thing because American Beauty is my favorite movie. The Ice Storm is about two families that can't seem to get going on with their lives and all of them have a story of them own. Ben Hood(Kevin Kline) keeps cheating on his wife Elena(Joan Allen) with their neighbor and friend Janey Carver(Sigourney Weaver). Ben and Elena have a 14 year old daughter wendy(Christina Ricci) who is caught up in her own world and spents most of her time, trying to get that first sexual experience with her boyfriend mikey(Elijah Wood). Mikey is also the son of Janey Carver. Mikey's younger brother Sandy(Adam Hann-Byrd) has a obssesion with Wendy and worships her. This story is being told by Wendy's older brother Paul(Tobey Maguire) while he's on a train visiting his family for thanksgiving. This is a beautiful movie, i think all the actors did a great job and the story was just amazing. I would give The Ice Storm 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ice cold clarity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very cold infernal family drama. At first, I was captured by how authentic the winter icy cold got - by both sight and sound - and then this cold did, like winter cold does, creep under my skin, until I was freezing to the bones.I was not so convinced by the plot, nor did I object to it, but in this film the plot is only an excuse to remain in this bitter cold. It distracts us, so that we remain still, almost as if sleeping - and that gets you, in the winter.The actors are very skilled at making very convincing characters, but they, too, are just distractions. The ice is the main character, and no matter what people do or don't do to each other, it is the ice that makes the final move and ends the game.The old Greeks based the universe on the four elements - fire, earth, air and water - and indeed, these fundamental entities surround and penetrate our existence, to the extent that one can wonder how much they control it. In this movie, all that happens seems to be an unavoidable consequence of the weather - and it makes sense.Maybe we should conclude about the weather, like with so many other things, that it's all in our heads.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better Than American Beauty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there's one movie that captures the lackluster gray spirit of 1973 suburbia, this is the one. THE ICE STORM is a gem. One of the top 50 films of the last 25 years. Ang Lee adapts to the subject matter like a seasoned director, capable of any form or genre. The script (one of the top 10 novel adaptations in the last ten years) really does circles around all that melodrama/garbage that Hollywood leaves in our theatres every viewing year. Not to mention Rick Moody's characters are carved in stone. More genuine than Alan Ball's stereotypical upper class robots in AMERICAN BEAUTY. See THE ICE STORM. Please. It will do you good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting diversion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I actually found this movie kinda funny. It had very little to do with the actual story, which I saw as quite dark. Somewhere around the winter of 1998, there was a nasty ice storm in my area that closed schools and knocked out power to half the city. Shortly thereafter, I went to my local video store to cheer myself up, and what did I see on the shelf but a copy of Ice Storm, the Movie. After having a little chuckle at my own expense, I rented said movie. I must say that the first time I saw it, I didn't quite understand it. I was so busy trying to establish the different characters in my mind that I totally missed the story. I watched it again and I actually enjoyed it. I thought, though never having lived through it myself, the movie had captured the seventies in a very real way. I also thought the actual storm was well done. The story was a little hard to follow, but like I said, second time's the charm.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a touching movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a sensitive and touching film. Only an oriental director like Ang Lee can render this film so thoroughly. The movies proceeds slowly and the final scene is the climax of the whole movie. You will feel you are really getting into it and breathe with their struggles and sorrows.It tells the story of two families during the beginning of 70s, the ending of exploration time beginning at 50s and the American traditional values are coming back. There are two main themes, the struggling of the adults with their out-marital fairs, the swing life style and the growing-up and exploration of their teens. Adults are teenagers in their own way and they are also struggling with their human nature. The lust is combating with their value system. Life is so close to the dark side of life, drugs, deaths and hatred. One step away you are into the dark hole of life. All are lost, and only an ice storm can wake them up by killing one teenage boy. In some sense, this movie reminds me of the movie Fargo. People are striving by lust and lust can also kill them.There is no a fancy plot or hi-tech tricks. The movie tastes like a glass of wine. It goes into your heart. Maybe a little bitter but definitely a warm to your soul at last. The crying of a man and a father at the last scene of the movie can be lingering at your heart forever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dismemberment of the American dream</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Long before pretentious "American Beauty", this Ang Lee film excellently delivered us the dismemberment of American dream. Illegitimate affairs, drugs, depression, emotional alienation, all comprise the dark layout of American society, not only of the 90s but of the 70s, as well. Beneath the illustrious surface of the wealthy suburban civilians lurks nothing but dysfunctional, alienated families. Lee portrays all characters in a Chekov-like way, deepening in their emotions and thoughts. All actors offer us sensational performances: Kevin Kline, obsessed with his secret affair, Sigourney Weaver, icy and confused, Joan Allen, with no comprehenshion of the situation and the problematic adolescents, Maguire, Wood and Ricci. This movie is an undoubted masterpiece which was unjustly ignored by the Oscars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This ain't a feel good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Contain SPOILERS!!!The lack of warmth and care these characters offer to each other is so graphically depicted that it's actually uncomfortable to view. Large parts of "The Ice Storm" feel like watching your hosts have a 'silent treatment' argument during your visit.Two fairly well-off families, Hoods and Carvers live in close proximity to each other in early '70s suburban New Haven, CT. Their living expenses are taken care of, as both husbands hold good-paying jobs, so they devote a lot of their time and energy to more unusual pursuits. They're family friends, attending snooty parties together and hanging in the same circle. Yet, that doesn't stop Ben Hood (Kevin Kline) from engaging in a sexual affair with Janey Carver (Sigourney Weaver). His wife Elena (Joan Allen) with whom he occasionally attends couples therapy suspects something is going on and has every proof short of catching them in the act, but seems already too much out of love to even bother properly confronting him. For their part, Ben and Janey are also just going through the motions - their love making is devoid of any emotion or excitement that they actually end up driving each other back to their original mates. After one of their encounters as they're laying in bed he starts telling her about his golf game and problems at work. "Ben, you're boring me" - she stops him - "I have a husband, I don't particularly feel a need for another". In cold exchanges like this one, and there's plenty of them between all characters, they demonstrate the full extent of their detachment from everything and everybody. All seem to be in constant search for something, but have no clue what, where and how.Hood offspring, 16-yr old stoner Paul (Tobey Maguire), who compared to what the other three kids are into looks the be the best adjusted one, is away at private high-school and his strange 14-yr old sister Wendy (Christina Ricci) along with Carver sons, a spaced-out flake of a kid Mikey (Elijah Wood) and silent militant Sandy (Adam Hann-Byrd) are all equally weird and screwed-up, younger versions of their parents.All parts are richly observed and really give the actors something to bite into - and they respond with fabulous performances. Kudos to director Ang Lee and writer James Schamus for successfully bringing the style, the issues and the atmosphere of this period. This is a powerful character study.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw this movie in one of those network cable channels and I have to say it was suprisingly good. I thought that this movie wasn't gonna be really good but I was wrong. Kevin Kline's performance as an unfaithful husband and father was compelling. The movie's plot is set in Conneticut in the 1970's and kevin kline plays a father of two who cheats on his wife with the mother of Kline's daugter's boyfriend who is played by Elija Wood. The story gets complicated when Christina Ricci who is Kline's daughter in the movie falls into lust with her boyfriend's little brother. Kline's son who is played by Tobey Mcguire is coming home from college for Thanksgiving and in the meanwhile is in love with a college druggie played by Katie Holmes. Kline's wife, who is played by Joan Allen, knows about her husband's affair. When she and and Kline go to a party, them both know they have to face a game in which they have to randomly pick-out a set of key and whoever those keys belong to, they will have to spend the night with the owner of the keys. In that, Allen's character has an affair with the husband of the woman Kline is cheating with who is played by Sigourney Wiever. And above all that there's an ice storm happening while the complications arise. I have to say it's a very complicated movie but I understood it all and I give it an 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie. It balances pathos and humor as well as "American Beauty" did but adds the cultural references: Nixon, Vietnam, Steve Winwood and Traffic on the turntable, gaudy outfits, Devil Dogs, "modern" homes, Pringles potato chip canisters, etc. Although it examines two dysfunctional families, the movie is really about the gap between children and their elders in the early 70s, as apathetic a time as any I guess. It takes a tragedy at the end to bridge this gap once the ice stops falling. What is most surprising is that Ang Lee directed this very American story. Also surprising is Sigourney Weaver as the iciest of the characters. She has never been one of my favorite actors but her dialogue is some of the film's most memorable. Kevin Kline also turns in another fantastic performance, a forerunner to Kevin Spacey's Lester Burnham in American Beauty. In fact, the more I think about the actors in the film, the more I realize that everyone does a great job, right down to Jamey Sheridan (last seen as "Flagg" in the TV movie of "The Stand"), Katie Holmes (another TV vet), and Allison Janney. And the soundtrack is perfect. How can anyone who was a youngster in the '70s NOT remember the "tubular" instrumental that plays during the dinner party scene at the beginning?</fullReview>

The atmosphere was thick with shock and surprise, no one moved, no one made a sound, everyone was so caught up in the film that all their attention was fixed upon that screen. I have never experienced any thing like it. If you like the more independent style films then you absolutely must see this one. You will not regret it.

		<fullReview>The last person mentioned that the 'ice storm' might be emblematic of something, but wasn't sure what...I think it is an appropriate image for the sexual revolution (and the political turmoil of the late 1960s in general): while it is occurring it seems dramatic and violent, but what it ultimately produces is just ice. The movie seems to be about just that: while the sexual revolution promised freedom, it may have produced dysfunctionality instead. Ice is coldness -- the opposite of intimacy. I have heard someone else characterize the theme this way: freedom is great until participation becomes mandatory. Then it is just compulsion again (think of the 'car key party' scene). So as far as I am concerned, the movie is about the compulsions that freedom can produce.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A new perspective on the family genre but the characters needed more personality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who would have thought that Ang Lee known most for the somewhat overrated but stellar film Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon would provide an engrossing new take on the American family genre? Though The Ice Storm was a bit too cold for my taste and some of the characters seemed as though their personalities were frozen on ice for 100 years, this piece was a moving look at the family genre that has yet to be fully explored.  Inevitably I think, The Ice Storm will be compared with American Beauty, Terms of Endearment, and Ordinary People and we will all ponder how it stacks up against the competition. I would put it somewhere in the middle. American Beauty revealed to the viewer characters that had a lot of fire and charisma and their personalities were often strange but engaging. The flip side of the coin remains that Annette Bening often over-acted the role and Kevin Spacey was at the top of his game, though his odd speeches and mannerisms didn't fit with the typical American father making American Beauty virtually impossible to fully appreciate.  There has never been another film quite like the family genre miracle Ordinary People. Though it was released in 1980 years before The Ice Storm, Terms of Endearment, and American Beauty it has not aged a bit. I was recently trying to remember an Oscar-worthy performance with a female that could put to shame Meryl Streep's Sophie's Choice and Vivien Leigh's Gone with the Wind and only Mary Tyler Moore as the coldest mother on Earth who plays favorites came to mind. The role was difficult because Moore's character had to be subtle but opinionated at the same time. She effortlessly conveyed with her eyes and heart what her mouth couldn't tell Timothy Hutton. And Donald Sutherland reminds me so much of my own father and the typical American father (a tax attorney who cares but knows when to let his child go his own way) it was uncanny. Ordinary People is a better film than American Beauty and The Ice Storm because the characters remind us of real mothers and fathers. The Ice Storm was filled with characters that were a bit too subdued. Did Joan Allen take Prozac to prepare for the role? Christina Ricci got it right and appeared to be emulating Thora Birch in American Beauty but Tobey McGuire seemed to be in the wrong movie. Timothy Hutton was meant for his Ice Storm role. Kevin Kline was dependable, but the script refused to allow us to fully comprehend who the characters were. They seemed fairly disengaged from each other and most importantly from us. That said, The Ice Storm is a memorable film that was unfortunately less seen and applauded than it's sub-par counterpart American Beauty. The ice storm was quite real, the thrill elements exciting, and most specifically the feeling that it was all leading up to something big engaging. If there was no Ordinary People to compare it to, The Ice Storm would remain the best in the family genre and a 10/10. Oh well.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark, Depressing, and Beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*The Ice Storm*The ice storm is a different kind of movie... it's hard to describe. It is by far one of the most depressing movies I have ever seen.It all takes place Thanksgiving 1973. It follows the story of a family (a rather odd mixture) Kevin Kline as the father, Joan Allen as the mother, Tobey McGuire as the son, and Christina Ricci as the daughter. You can tell by the cast that it is not the regular American family. The movies shows what all of the family was doing that Thanksgiving. With adult afairs, children experimenting with drugs and sex, and just a bunch of disfunctional family drama this movie should be no role model for the typical American family.But this movie is beautifully made. Wonderful acting by Kevin Kline and the rest of the wonderful cast. If you liked American Beauty than I suggest you rent this. *8/10*</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intense and Voyeuristic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow. After watching this I felt like I had just eavesdropped into someone's private conversation. I felt embarrased to be there by the end, but not because the movie was bad. Quite the opposite. Under Ang Lee's direction and an incredible cast (Kevin Kline can do no wrong, I think), the viewer is drawn in deeper and deeper into the lives of these two families. One wants to turn one's face away from the screen, it's so intimate. The cinematography was disturbingly beautiful, from the brown-and-orange interiors to the chillingly lovely shots of ice hanging from trees and buildings. The climax of the movie *is* the ice storm, where emotions are finally whipped up, and a myriad of incredible, beautiful, ugly, senseless events force the two families to look at themselves, and each other, more closely. Christina Ricci is fantastic in this (I've liked her since Now and Then, she holds her own right up there with Kevin Kline. This is only the second film I've seen with Tobey Maguire, but I plan on seeing more. Sigourney Weaver and Elijah Wood are vastly underused, which is my only complaint in this. Even in the credits you don't realize they're there because the cast list is in alphabetical order. Both are perfect for their roles, I think. I bought this film on sale at a video store, and I'm glad I did, because I'll go back to it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A STUNNING MASTERPIECE BOTH VISUALLY AND INTELLECTUALLY</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After being very skeptical about this film, believing that Tobey Maguire nor Elijah Wood could act, that Kevin Kline is only good in comedies, and that Ang Lee couldn't accurately portray American family life as well as some of the competition, I was simply stunned at this film. After the final scene, I sat on my couch in tears saying "wow" out loud to myself. Basically the Ice Storm is a griping tale of two American families and how they are somewhat destroyed, all in the beautiful setting of a winter storm. Ang Lee never lets the viewer forget that serene winter atmosphere, as he beautifully films ice-covered, leafless trees, trains struggling to move through the frozen power lines with icicles hanging from it's rusted metal wheels, and the frosted and slippery streets and forest trails. This setting will become a significant factor in the film; a factor that proves the setting could be no other way. Firstly, the acting was suburb by the entire cast (Joan Allen, Tobey Maguire, Kevin Kline, Sigourney Weaver, Elijah Wood, and Christina Ricci). The cinematography was flawless, and along with the beautiful camera shots, the movie was visually breathtaking. The plot was quite good, but the real key factor in making this film great is how the actors presented emotions on-screen. In summation, this was an incredible film, one of my favorites, and is a real reason why the unique Ang Lee is one of the best modern directors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What lies underneath the surface?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ice Storm is a film about appearances. About facades and what is behind them. Do you really know your friend next door? He could be a serial killer, you know. And do you really know yourself? What happens when you´re pushed over the edge? It is also a film about innocence, and about losing it. The children in the movie, and somehow also their parents, all live in some strange state of innocence. They don´t connect their outer and their inner lives. Actions take place without any real reason. People correspond with each other but somehow the connection is broken. And this is, of course also what happens when The Ice Storm itself breaks loose. Normality gets invaded by force majeure. Everything breaks down. The inner fears take physical shape. And, of course, someone has to die. To pay for our sins, to speak in biblical terms. And when the film ends, no-one can go back to the life they had before. Innocence is lost forever. As for the actors, Kevin Kline is at his best. Also worth mentioning is the unusual music score, revealing the director´s asian roots. Ang Lee is one of the few contemporary directors that always surprise me, and I don´t mean that in a negative way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than American Beauty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although it never received the recognition it deserved, this film was a triumph for Ang Lee. I thought it was better than Lee's `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon', which was novel for someone who had never seen a Hong Kong film before, but certainly not totally original for those who have. `The Ice Storm' is also better than the film with the exact same theme that came two years later, `American Beauty'. I can understand why `Beauty' was more popular though, because it was ?hip', less dark, and more immediately satiating. While it was a good film in its own right, I still found the `The Ice Storm' to be much more graceful, and lacking the predictability of `Beauty'. It was quiet, intense and extremely intelligent-- perhaps too much so for today's audience, but a treat to those who still appreciate subtlety in filmmaking. `The Ice Storm' is by no means the first of its kind to touch upon the disenchantment of American ideals, as `The Graduate' did it thirty years earlier. It is, however, a gem of a film, and one that I hope will not soon be forgotten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A penetrating chill</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Typically, when a movie takes place in a fairly recent time period, the filmmakers do one of two things--A: Romanticize the period, or B: Turn it into a jokey cartoon caricature of what it was. The latter is especially true when the period in question is the 1960s or '70s. This era is consistently portrayed as some sort of avocado-green polyester nightmare (as opposed to the boringly-neutral-beige combed-cotton nightmare of present society). The Ice Storm, however, takes neither approach. While I won't say that the time is incidental, we are not pummeled with it; in fact, we can even forget it after a while. The film is about (surprise!) people.The place is New Canaan, Connecticut; the time, winter 1973. The people are a group of alienated, sexually repressed/frustrated/bored characters. All want different things, but all are united by their desperate longing for personal satisfaction. They mix, discussing Watergate, Deep Throat, and Styrofoam packing peanuts, letting their own issues simmer without a word. In private, they all struggle to break out of their numbing suburban routine. But numbing though it may be, they really don't know anything else. So where do they go?Ang Lee has created the type of film that is, sadly, an anomaly in Hollywood: A picture that makes you think. The characters are merely observed, without judgment, revealing their personalities, fears, aches, longings. Lee never goes out of his way to make them sympathetic; whether you care about any of them or not all depends on your own personality, fears, aches, longings. The interactions of these incompatible people, together yet isolated, are never less than fascinating.The film is marvelously put together. The photography is beautiful, combining with great sets and costumes for the perfect atmosphere. We see a lot of ice--in trays, on branches, etc--and though the metaphor may not be subtle, it works perfectly. Though the soundtrack includes some great pop tunes, they are merely background music, heard only when characters put them on. The acting, which is the true backbone of the movie, is fantastic (though I don't care for Katie Holmes). Stand-outs include Christina Ricci as a teenager experimenting with sex (it happens--get over it), and polar-opposite wives Joan Allen and Sigourney Weaver (who has never looked more beautiful). This is a dark, barren winter landscape worthy of exploration. Expect to be chilled...but leave your coat in the closet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly wonderful film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having just seen 'The Ice Storm' for the first time on VHS, I felt compelled to write my opinion of it. Firstly, my faith in Ang Lee has been restored, after the over-rated, convoluted mish-mash of 'CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON' (2000), a ghastly and dull experience for me.But enough about that film. This is one of the greatest experiences I've had in the cinema since 'AMERICAN BEAUTY' (1999), (forgive this flash-forwarding as if it's flashbacking; I never saw 'ICE...' at the cinema.) Kevin Kline delivers a subtle and nuanced performance, the likes of which he has never given before. Sigourney Weaver puts her icy disposition to good use in her scenes with Kline, and I couldn't help but think back to their marvellous chemistry in the movie 'DAVE' (1995)The children deliver wonderful performances; the always reliable Christina Ricci is heart rending as a young girl confused about sexuality; the often problematic Tobey Maguire wonderful as her brother, confused and unsure of his feelings, particularly towards fellow classmate Libbets Casey (Katie Holmes). Holmes' performance is also outstanding; I was never a fan of the TV show 'DAWSON'S CREEK,' and was never impressed with her 'performance' in that show, but with this and two other films, ("Go" (1999) and "WONDER BOYS" (2000)) she proves she is a subtle and charismatic actress, fast emerging as one of my favourites.Elijah Wood and Adam Hann-Byrd are outstanding as Weaver's sons; their scenes together play as natural; they are real brothers with real rivalries and Hann-Byrd ('LITTLE MAN TATE' (1991)) again proves what a wonderous talent he is.But the film is held together by Kline, who wanders through the wonderfully hideous 70's stylings, bringing the story to its heart-breaking conclusion, which I defy anyone to stay dry eyed through. This film gets a definite 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a sad film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>this is. Not really because of the ending, but because everybody in it are like lost souls, trying somehow, anyhow to find meaning in their lives, but not able to do so, and destroying things in their efforts. Best thing about the film is the cinematography. As well as the stunningly realised ice storm, the dark subdued tones which permeate much of the film impress, as does the brittle oriental soundtrack which reflects the tinkling of ice. It's not nearly as watchable a film as American Beauty though. The characters are pathetic rather than sympathetic, the beauty and humour are lacking. Like Altman's Short Cuts, this is another film about the dark side of life that's technically very good (in a different way) but quite joyless. I wouldn't put it in the same league as American Beauty at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe it's because I don't understand the era this film was supposedly depicting... Maybe it's because I was expecting too much going into this film after hearing so many things about it - The performances were less than stellar, mediocre at most... if its point was to express some warped version of suburbia, then it succeeded in at least that. One would think a group of people involved in such situations would be a bit more moved. Or, perhaps I am wrong and the movie focused on portraying how such life alterating situations can truly shut people's hearts off. It was disappointing &amp; depressing, but Ang Lee is quite the director, making a film like this &amp; 'Crouching Tiger' - most directors can't hop from genre to genre so successfully, but he does a good job.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, a warning: The Ice Storm is not a happy film. It has some nice comedic moments, but overall it's dour and depressing. In short, it's normally the kind of film I'd hate, yet I don't.The most striking aspect of the movie is the fantastic acting. All the cast give great performances, especially the rather lovely Christina Ricci as a sexually curious 14-year-old. On top of this, the script is solid and occasionally, as I said, thought-provoking, and the look and feel of the film is (as far as I can tell) very accurate to the period in which it is set. The plot moves along quickly enough and the climactic ice storm is visually stunning. However, the film does occasionally lapse into melodrama, but luckily those moments are few and far between. So... 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>very definantly worth seeing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When first viewing this movie, one must be warned- it is extreamly subtle, simple, and requires close consideration in order to be fully appreciated. i've heard people say it delivers very wooden performances- rather i thought a more adequate word would be they were controlled. People with isseues- such as most of the characters- have a way of becoming cold, pretentious, and nervous in behaviour, something all the actors delivered well. The issues may not be original, but remember that the point of the movie is rather to present the situations involved in a revealing light, not to present some new idea or statement about them. The movie was, i thought, a subtle revelation of the usually concealed difficulties which distracted -from -their-feelings consumerist americans hide , ignore, and sometimes know not even the existance of till its late(death of Mikey). There's no need for the drama to reach any cresendos to make its point- the situations speak for themselves. The very fact that there are no peaks, that everyone seems emotionally flat is a statement all by itself. These people are so detached from their emotional reality, so disturbed and in a state of denial, that they seem made of ice. The greater ice storm which strikes is in the inner worlds of the characters. A most fitting name. The movie doesn't, i think, aim so much on the individual issues of each family member only, but how each accumulates in context to their social and family environments. Its presenting a bigger problem than frisky puberty, space-outs, or cold marraiges- its presenting everyone's alienation from each other, and from themselves. Every character is an individual, a catalist, and also a part of the messed complex called a 'family' which just won't admitt how fucked it is, just as no one will admitt to themselves how fucked they are. totally clever, Wendy's pulling on the Nixon mask while getting ready to go with Mikey- she accuses him of being a rotten liar, a bluff, but at the same time, while pretends to look calm in front of Minkey and later Sandy, she is pulling off a Nixon -worthy bluff- looking so cool and in control, like an adult, when within her she's scared out of her mind and nobody can tell, and she dousn't help them to. Each character is far too complex to outline here- every detail is important, from Wendy's constant appetite to Sandy's toy soldiers. If you think you will get this movie, definantly go see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pre-American Beauty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ice Storm, reminded me of American Beauty. If you liked American Beauty, you will definitely like this movie; I guarantee it. Ice Storm is a story about two American families who have troubled marriages due to typical boredom that kicks in after long years of marriage or even before that in fast paced American culture which makes some of its members sexually (and financially) greedy. As a result, Ben Hood (Kevin Cleine) starts and affair with Janey (Sigourney Weaver). Their children are at the verge of entering puberty. Ben's only daughter, very promiscuous Wendy, makes out with both brothers of Carver family, sons of Janey and Mike Carver. So, where Ben is secretly having an affair with Janey, his daughter Wendy is secretly making out with Janey's sons who are the sons of the woman his father is having and affair with. Whether Wendy knows about his father's affair is not made clear; it is more like she doesn't seem to care for anything other than herself. It is very ironic for the parents to lecture them on sexual morality where they themselves are having an affair. It is also equally ironic that Ben finds out about his daughter's sexual activity around the same time while he is waiting to have sex with Janey in Janey's house (Carver's residence) when her daughter comes to the house to make out with Janey's older son. Then he speaks of this event to his wife with a lame excuse for his presence in Janey's house causing his wife Elena (Joan Allen) to suspect that he is having an affair. A very young Tobey Maguire, Paul Hood, brother of promiscuous Wendy Hood, is deeply in love with Libbet Casey, who seems sweet to Paul but in fact she is pretentious and immature. There are three main stories in the movie. 1) Affair of Ben and Janey and the following events after Ben's wife Elena (Joan Allen) finds out about the affair, 2) Wendy and her relationship to two brothers, 3) Paul's relationship to Libbet which has little room in the entire picture compared to first two stories. It is claimed that events take a turn after the ice storm but in fact they take a turn after Elena finds about the affair of her husband. Ice Storm was generally a very successful picture but I have one critique to make. The Ice Storm was not really ice storm at all. I expected to see more Ice and Snow because that is expression given in the movie. However, scenes related to Ice Storm were poorly made. For example in the scene where Elena and Jim Carver are walking towards the car, they slide slightly due to the supposedly icy ground but there is almost no ice on the ground. In fact, you can see that it is raining. Then they reach the car whose doors and windows are frozen. How can there be a rain and ice storm at the same time? If there is rain, then the temperature is not low enough to create ice. You only see frozen tree branches but that's the only ice you see in the movie. This is a very small detail and it doesn't ruin the story but somehow it bothered me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a little snapshot of suburbia in 1973</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing 'the Ice Storm' several times I have decided it's one of my all-time favorites. When a film captivates me the way this one does, I have to love it even if the subject matter is disturbing. The characters are unsympathetic and even unlikable, but you just can't stop watching them get further entangled and deeper into trouble. The parents and the teenagers walk around in a numbed haze of 70's suburban boredom until a harsh reality wakes everyone from their slumber. Kevin Kline, Joan Allen, and Sigourney Weaver are convincing as 50's generation parents desperately trying to adjust to the sexual revolution of the 70's. Kevin Kline plays a middle-aged executive who goes temporarily insane with the free-love standards of the times. He truly loves his wife and kids but becomes recklessly involved with a neighbor's frigid wife, played by Sigourney Weaver. Joan Allen plays his repressed 'Donna Reed-ish' wife, who makes Thanksgiving dinner look lovely even though her life has become very ugly. Christina Ricci plays their sexually-curious daughter, who is way too interested in her boyfriend's little brother. Their goofy, nerdy son is played by Tobey Maguire, who ironically resembles a young Kevin Kline. The 1973-era nostalgia is great to watch for. I especially enjoyed the Jim Croce song "I Got a Name" which is skipping on an old vinyl-LP. The final scene leaves the viewer grasping for a resolution where there was never meant to be one. So what if it doesn't have an earth-shattering point to make, so what if the characters are miserable, so what if it doesn't have a happy ending...that's how real life is!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Ice Storm is a wonderful, character driven picture that not only documents upper middle class reactions to the changing morals of the 1970's but also reflects these changes on the actions of their children. Ang Lee's film perfectly captures the New Cannan/Greenwich/Bedford moral and physical landscape. Boarding schools, bongs, bored housewives. The way that the 1970s pop references ( Deep Throat, EST, waterbeds ) are woven into the story that illuminate Lee's themes of social change, WASP repression and juvenile exploration. All the acting is wonderful (except Kevin Kline's routine descent into physical comedy that he seems to put everywhere). Sigourney Weaver gives a wonderful performance as a jaded, feral housewife who damages people and relationships as easily as her youngest son destroys toys. Christina Ricci is amazing as a sexually precocious young teen who acts like the bad girl yet only wants "to touch it". Elijah Wood is brilliant as a spacehead who is obsessed with molecules to the incomprehension of all. There are touching moments that bring tears ( the tragic end, Kline carrying Ricci over the wet ground ) that evoke a family in crisis with itself and the times but their emotional core is still solid. American Beauty got all the attention from Oscar but The Ice Storm is as far as it can be from that satire cum tragedy. Very complex script, wonderful acting make this movie worth repeated viewing. In my opinion a great movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I originally watched The Ice Storm back in 1998. Some friends who had seen it (then) commented on how "powerful" and "moving" it was. I felt out of the loop because The Ice Storm stirred up no such emotions in my soul.Nearly three years later, with a greater appreciation for art and film, I thought I'd give it a second chance. I'm sad to report, that in three years, and two viewings the movie has scarcely improved.What does the movie comment on that we, as a society, aren't already largely acquainted with. Adultery? Sexual experimentation during adolescence? Bah! Hardly new issues! The entire production is so controlled I wonder if all the actors were mandatorily prescribed Valium to help tone down their performances. They're is nary an outburst of emotion -- it's as if they're all experiencing emotional hypothermia! Ohh, is that the point? Perhaps. But it doesn't appeal to this viewer. The acting was adequate, but I'm starting to think that Joan Allen has been type cast. I mean, in which movie does she not play a timid, repressed house wife?If you've seen The Sweet Hereafter, you will notice a lot of parallels between the two movies. Great direction. Lovely shots and interesting narration.Not entirely a waste of time, but it left me neither shaken, nor stirred.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film is about you. Me too, though. Watch it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've watched this film today on our television and now consider it as one of those "major" films for my life. This "major" is not about somekinda films folder, it's about what i feel on this movie right now.Yes, film is something like American Beauty or Fight Club (better say - they are), but consider those two "rubber bullets", while this one is a real one, with hollow point. Even more: those films are movies with idea, this film is and idea explained with movie. What i think, is that "Ice Storm" should be treated as a final High Court verdict, which cannot be overruled.And the verdict is: we are - those people in movie, and this is our boring life, and nothing we can do.'Cause this film is not about "american value crisis" and boring life in wealthy society. It is about how stupid and unhappy Life is anywhere and any time - 1973, 1828 or 2001. And about nothing that you can do. Not bad- just as is. And this movie is one of two "right" movies on the topic i've ever seen - second is Fellini's "Dolce Vita". Just "Ice Storm" is about more or less common people, and "Dolce Vita" speaks on bohema.I cannot explain what "right" is - some things just cannot be explain. Maybe "right" in this case is "natural", "beautifully filmed and created", "the way it should be", "not boring, didactic or grotesque". You know it is like, when you try to find, say, you keys in some pile of rubbish. You search for hours, you find it and cry "yes" from joy. That's what this movies is about, and it is the right one.But if you enjoy your life, you'll think it's bad. You'll say: "People are dying from hunger, what's the use of this film", or "Well, maybe that's truth, but still i think my life is not bad".Right, there's no use for anyone in this film. Relax and enjoy your life, and think it is good and interesting, if you can. Or don't think. Or try the best of what you can to change the world. You can even be dumb and suicide. That won't change anything."Cause our life (okay, my life) has as few meaning as life of those people, young and old in "Ice Storm". I speak with parents "hello-how are you- bye-bye" way, spend nights at clubs or at guests or watching TV, browsing or doing some "more intellectual things" - like reading. But what is it for?You can assure yourself that you are happy, but you are not, that's what "Ice Storm" is about.Lermontov wrote some kind of this:"I look sadly on our generation// Its future is either empty or dark...//...As soon as we are born we are "rich"//By mistakes our parents did...//...We hate and we love accidentally//And sacrifice nothing to hatred or to love...//... And we will leave this world file://Without any sound or trace..."What he wrote is not only about his generation. Thanks, Mr. Ang Lee.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Ice Storm" was quite a remarkable movie for me. All the characters have such depth and the actors who portray them exceed in displaying all of their character's details.There's so much for one to scrutinize and analyze in this movie, from the beautiful symbolism of the storm to the complex characters themselves and of course, the story.My only complaint about the movie is that sometimes the pace can get a tad too slow but it does give the movie its powerful edge. The last ten minutes, if you really get into the movie, are deep and profound, and the funny thing is that barely a word is spoken throughout those ten minutes. For an excellent glimpse into suburban family behavior in the seventies, "The Ice Storm" is a great choice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I bought this movie (on DVD) because of the comparisons I had read with American Beauty. Although it covers similar territory - marriage, relationships, children, sex - it's different. AB is the better movie (better paced) but Ice Storm is a great movie. The acting is excellent - flawless performances from all the cast. I don't like Kevin Kline (or Kevin Spacey for that matter) but even he's good in this film. So what's it about? It's about the family - and how sex is no substitute for good family relationships. This film has the most authentic representation of the seventies I've ever seen. You'd swear that it was filmed in 1973. Like AB it's a film for all the family (well everyone aged 14 and over) - it's a very moral film with an important story to tell. If you like serious movies with something to say then you'll like The Ice Storm. But beware - AB is an uplifting film - this one is not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sensitive 70s Sensibilities</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like his previous film Sense and Sensibility, Ang Lee's latest intense character-based drama is a period piece. This one is rather more contemporary however, as it's set in 1970s upstate New York rather than 18th century rural England. Once again he demonstrates his remarkable versatility, not only in setting but in the fact that the film's dramatic qualities is often matched by a wonderful subtle humour.The Ice Storm essentially portrays how the liberal sensibilities of the parents in the film disrupted the up-bringing of their off-spring. The young teenagers seem almost forced in to their sexual awakenings. The extra-marital social practices of the parents makes them problematic role models. Despite the supposed sexual liberation the emotions in this film seem just as repressive as they did in Austen's England. The emotions of the serial adultress played by Sigourney Weaver seem as cold as the storm itself. Even Kline's emotions are only eventually thawed out through a mixture of drunken jealousy and grief.Comparisons are now bound to be made with 'American Beauty'. It certainly isn't as accessible as that already proclaimed classic, but its possibly a more rewarding film. The cast are all notable for the realism they bring in their portrayals of the dysfunctional 70s characters. While Lee's direction is real quality, with the imagery he brings to the screen being one of The Ice Storm's most commendable qualities.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Ice Storm is aan amazing character study and period piece. Compared to "American Beauty" (which it frequently is) this movie is ten times better. Unlike the larger than life characters of American Beauty, whom are hard to believe are real people, the characers of The Ice Storm are very real. The symbolism, imagery and themes are much more subtle than Beauty and therefore make a much bigger impact. That said, it is just and amazing movie that must be seen!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very cold film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know what to say about this movie. It sets out to be cold, and it is. I'm not particularly fond of the direction or the score, but the performances are solid and the overall subtlety makes it all feel real, perhaps a bit too real.Admittedly, when I watch a movie I generally expect something different. Something that I can't see in real life, or something that depicts real life in a way I find interesting (I thoroughly enjoyed The Sweet Hereafter). To me, this movie did not deliver. It's slow, the characters are in their majority uninteresting, and I can't care about any of them or their lives. And the so-called ice storm... it was just background. IMHO the film would've been just as cold without it.Additionally, I didn't find anything in it that could "make me think". It's about real people with boring, troubled lives. My own life is more interesting, and I'm better off thinking about the direction of my own life and the consequences of my own actions than about the dysfunctional lives of these fictional characters, none of which I could identify with. Surely the novel by Rick Moody must be better. I recommend this film to older people who had similar experiences during the 70's, and people in general who enjoy this kind of real-life drama. However, if you're like me and expect something fantastic, insightful, special or just plain fun in a film, go somewhere else. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really liked the tone of this movie. A dark movie that has bright moments of humor. **spoiler**(who doesn't laugh when Libbets passes out with her head...well, you know.) Much darker in tone than any of the two movies it is compared with (American Beauty and Happiness), this movie stands out, not as superior, but as uncooperative. The movie does not cooperate with anything, thus making it a strange movie. It has all characters needing sexual release. And, it offers no explanations for strange actions. The ending pretends to tie everything together, or at least end a story, but nothing really happens. Another movie which features a natural disaster (or unnatural in the case of Magnolia) this event really doesn't change much for anybody, and just serves to be an unusual backdrop. In Magnolia, it changes people, and in Short Cuts, it shows the actual people's feelings and reactions. The only thing that happened as a result of this ice storm could have happened in a much better way through other methods. The last 10 minutes explain a situation that develops in the last ten minutes of the movie. All in silence, it shows the amazing acting powers by having all of the emotions that they are having on the surface.So, in other words, this is a good movie, and everybody should see it. Just don't really go out of your way to see it. I think that the best movie along the same lines, although much darker, is "Happiness." A funny movie, that one makes you hate yourself for laughing, and you can relate more to it, or at least I could.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film unlike no other (unless you count American Beauty).</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Ice Storm" is a film unlike no other.I was really surprised when I saw this film (last night on the Independent Film Channel, IFC). I heard little about it before, and only heard it from the show Siskel &amp; Ebert. I never seen any advertisements, ever, on the film when it was released. It was then left with $18 Million dollars from the US. I even recall Roger Ebert on his weekly show that time saying "We should look forward to this at the Oscars."What happened? ... Let me spare you on some details on the movie before I get all angry.This film has an impressive cast... but maybe back in 1997 they weren't as big of stars. The main cast includes Kevin Kline("In &amp; Out") as Ben Hood, Joan Allen("Pleasantville") as Elena Hood, Tobey Maguire("Cider House Rules") as Paul Hood, Christina Ricci("Sleepy Hollow") as Wendy Hood, Elijah Wood("The Faculty") as Mikey Carver, Sigourney Weaver("Copycat") as Janey Carver, Katie Holmes(TV show "Dawson's Creek") as Libbets Casey, and Adam Hann-Byrd(---) as Sandy Carver.The film centers in on the early '70's where adults and teens(pre-teens for that matter also) are learning from experiences. "Sex" has Wendy Hood(Christina Ricci) and Mikey Carver(Elijah Wood) wondering, while "sex" is what Ben Hood(Kevin Kline) has behind his wife's back(Elena Hood - Joan Allen) with Janey Carver. The Carver's house is led by a path between the two houses, where one can easily walk to get there. Paul Hood(Tobey Maguire) is gone on a train ride home. Paul narrates the movie, from beginning, to middle, and to mid-middle(we don't get no ending narration, which makes the film even more emotional). Paul has had his sights on Libbets Casey(Katie Holmes) back at school... which will later come into plot.I'll leave the setup to you. See, I had NO setup or any story points for me... and it's the best way to view it. Seriously. Just watch it.What I don't get is why The Ice Storm hasn't got the best of awards. Maybe because it was more "independent"-like. My guess is as good as yours... and it even makes me more mad that "American Beauty" got so many awards. But as everyone knows, "American Beauty" DID deserve Best Picture at the Oscars ("American Beauty" was a beauty). But in a season where "Titanic", "Good Will Hunting", "LA Confidential" and more spectacular movies were up for Best Picture, it must of been hard. But still, I love this movie and thought it was much more thought provoking than Titanic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>American Beauty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ice Storm, reminds me of American Beauty in that it shares some of the themes, yet did not receive nearly as much praise, which is a shame. Great acting accompanies a great script by James Schamus that is moving, haunting, symbolic, and real. The film doesn't try too hard, and is simultaneously effective. Like American Beauty, The Ice Storm focuses on a nuclear family with problems, however, the approach in Ang Lee's film is more subtle. You don't see children conversing about "offing" their parents without any real motivation. But you do sense the existence of an underlying pain that begins to float to surface through a series of actions brought about by the characters, and finally surfaces at the film's finale when the unthinkable has happened. The interesting thing is that, the characters in this film, aren't baffled by the event in the film's final scenes. The event is an awakening for the characters and quite cathartic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Me-Decade Morality Play</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll put a fine point on it: The Ice Storm is a comedy. Yes, its humour is so subdued and well modulated that hardly anyone finds it funny. Yes, the story features an undeniably tragic turn during the last third. Yes, the entire film seems somber and slow, perhaps even (literally and figuratively) coloruless. So is it a clever exercise in genre subversion, black comedy taken so far that the laughs are stripped bare? Hardly. The Ice Storm is comedic because it reverses our expectations as an audience (and as Americans in particular). If you could only attune yourself to its very delicate pitch, the laughter is audible.This is not a wry parody of the stylistic and cultural foibles of 1970s America, though that's how it may play from time to time and many people expected as much going in. Instead, director Ang Lee (and Rick Moody, who wrote the original novel) sets up a series of moral challenges in order to explore the sexual politics of that much-maligned decade. On one level, yes, we can say that this is true. The husband (Kevin Kline, who finds the right tone for an underdeveloped character) confronts his infidelity; the wife Joan Allen, spot-on) does likewise; their faux-naif daughter (Christina Ricci) wrestles, in mirror-like fashion, with the same issues. Their son (Tobey Maguire) separates himself from the family circus, both physically and emotionally, but is eventually confronted with his own moral dilemma. And contrary to all of our expectations, he is the only one who chooses wisely.We want a swinging suburban expose and are given behavioral object lessons; we want vibrant leisure suits onscreen and pulsating disco music on the soundtrack, but are given the most discrete visual and aural tableaux; we want to make plain the conflicted American sexual personae, but are given obfuscation and layer upon layer of inarticulate opinion. The Ice Storm knows what we want and refuses, by the very power of its form, to give in to us. We are teased by the film, frustrated, unsure of how to react or if we should even care. Life is more often than not a simple moral choice: do this thing or do that thing. Sex does not complicate the issue, contrary to public doctrine, but simplifies it. And that's pretty funny when you think about it.</fullReview>

There is a better sense of real people in this film, whereas in 'American Beauty' it bordered on caricature, thus distancing the audience just a little more.

		<shortDescription>a mood piece with a fine ensemble cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What some may see as a flawed film - i.e., boring, pointless, flat, or offering unsympathetic characters, Ang Lee's THE ICE STORM is actually a very well acted slice of Americana - that is, Americana in its suburban Connecticut, upper-middle class mid 70s incarnation. Not an epic story, with a complex plot, this movie is more what I would call a mood piece. And the predominant mood is one of sadness and pathos, as those depicted here continuously fail to connect with one another on anything but the most superficial levels. Now one might ask: is this reality? Is this an accurate characterization of a sudden shift in the culture at this time. Well, no, not really. of course, this is drama, right, not anthropology and the director, actors and writer are entitled to poetic license. Here this license is put to good effect.The other key point here is that the narrator is a juvenile, and he has a bit of Holden Caulfield in him (just a bit, that is). In other words, he feels disconnected from the adult world in, in normal adolescent ways, ways he doesn't fully understand. The movie plays off of this theme of the disconnect between children and adults; my favorite instance of this was Janey's (Sigourney Weaver) ludicrous pseudo-intellectual utterances while chastising of Wendy (Christina Ricci) for having just more or less terrified her young son Sandy by leading him in a game of doctor. In depicting a world of those who are young and psychologically adrift, in spite of seemingly having all the privileges one could possibly want, it captures something quite real. Having grown up in the same era, I can also say there were some subtle moments here which felt quite real.I would rate this rather high, then: 9 out of 10, particularly for some wonderful performances by Weaver, Allen, Ricci and Wood</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dysfunctional people dysfunction in dysfunctional 1970s US</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>God knows where cinema would be without Richard Nixon. Looking for a handy visual metaphor for what's wrong / right / good / bad and hey, let's turn on the television, there's ol' Tricky Dicky spouting off.Dicky's in Ice Storm, natch, because here's a study of microcosmic America slowly fragmenting. Like, er, ice. It's the 1970s, of course, and the height of Watergate (of course) so obviously everything's going to eventually splinter. Like, um, ice.So's everyone, too: adults, children, the entire population of New Canaan seems at this time to be ready to snap / fracture / splinter. Reason? They're all dysfunctional. Requote that: they're all abnormal. They're all overdressed 1970s mannequins in overstyled 1970s sets and they're all pretty much over wrought plot devices. (Bit like Tricky Dicky, really.)Of course, there is a point to The Ice Storm. It's about how dysfunctional people are miserable. Even the guy who's working on developing silicon (get it? 1970s? Verge of the great chip break-through? Wow, this period feel is just so authentic!) is miserable. (Worse, even Sigourney Weaver is miserable, but then anybody would be considering the make-up and costume inflicted on her).Quite what Ang Lee and a fairly good cast (though Kline sleepwalks through it other than in those moments when he's not raising his eyebrows) thought they were doing with a clunker like this is hard to fathom. The film has nothing to say and spends far too much time saying it.As to the storm, it's about as relevant to the plot as a hurricane or monsoon: anything could have been dragged screaming into the end to fill up the space, and arguably to greater dramatic effect -- storm, what storm? A few drops of rain. A few sprayed on special effect trees. Some forlorn attempts to get the characters' breaths to cloud on air that so evidently isn't freezing.America, one is delighted to say, wasn't like this and ain't like this -- which means the film as metaphor (which has to be the only reason why it was ever made) fails from the outset.Not only does it fail, it fails in most portentous style, with one of the characters reciting gibberish from some pulp magazine or other, all about open doors and walking in unknowingly, a level of intellectualising bettered in any first grade school yard.Ice Storm? Slight breeze, one would suggest. And chilling only in that, after viewing it, you realise how much time you've wasted on such gloss 'n dross.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is, without a doubt, the strangest movie I have ever seen in my life. I think it is a great movie, but I had to see it a few more times to get it.Kevin Kline, one of my favorite actors, leads the outstanding cast of this movie. In my opinion, Kevin Kline's character is as close to normal as you see in this movie.The child sexuality should not really be labeled obscene. It is not erotic, and no child nudity is displayed.The main idea The Ice Storm suggests is the fact that everybody is a "psycho", and the people that are not "psycho" do not care about the ones who are "psycho". Ben Hood (Kevin Kline) even states, "I don't even care that much."It's one of Kevin Kline's best, and he is followed by an incredible cast. I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys the "meaninglessness of life" theme, and I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys the challenge of interpreting a hard movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really can't say that I enjoyed this film, but can't dismiss it outright. One of the major faults this film has is that we don't sympathize with any one of the characters. It's too difficult. These are not happy people. While they are interesting, we just don't care if they make the 'right' or 'wrong' choices. The story itself is not much of a plot but a series of events that have only time connecting them. The actors are fine, especially Joan Allen and Sigourney Weaver. They manage to convey everything through their faces. Christina Ricci and Kevin Kline also deserve mention for their brave performances. The cinematography is also great, especially with the Ice Storm. I don't think this film was snubbed at the oscars, as some people do. It is simply not a film for everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good cast, interesting story, pretty scenery, slowly presented.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw "The Ice Storm" in theaters, I was guided by both positive word of mouth and good reviews, and I concluded that, while it wasn't the best movie I'd ever seen, it was really pretty good.First, there's the cast, led by two of our best contemporary actors, Kevin Kline and Sigourney Weaver, both of whom give solid, believeable performances as the two essentially self-absorbed extramarital lovers. Then, there are the young people involved. Christina Ricci and Elijah Wood are probably two of the best teen actors we have today. If there are any two candidates for solid adult careers out there, it is they. And they deliver solidly as the uncertain Kat and the deeply troubled Mikey, respectively. But don't leave Adam Hann-Byrd out. As Sandy, Mikey's younger brother with an enormous crush on Kat, he's totally believeable. And, yes, he gets lucky by the end of the picture!But the outstanding scene, to me, was the "Key Party" scene. A big fad in the early '70's, those dear, dead, pre-AIDS days, it worked like this: Couples arriving at a party were asked, on a "strictly voluntary" basis, to drop their car keys in a bowl. Later in the evening, all the women present closed their eyes and picked one set of car keys out of the bowl. Then they would spend the night with whoever owned the keys, their husband/boyfriend or not. One couple, Kline and Weaver's respective spouses, couldn't even wait until they got home. There they were, in the front seat of the car, at the height of the storm, going at it like maniacs, with their feet sticking out the window!!!!!!! Ah, the '70's. Nothin' like 'em.My only problem, and it's a minor one, is one of historical accuracy. I grew up in Westchester County, New York, during this same period. And all I could think was: Where was I during all this? Were everybody's lives as stultifyingly normal as mine and my parents'? Apparently, the filmmakers thought not, and the result is a somewhat one-sided story.But don't let this discourage you. "The Ice Storm" really is a good film. It starts slow, but stick with it, and you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>actors? what actors?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I disagree with some of the comments posted here by others. I have just seen this film and I thought it was very poorly done. I didn't think any of the acting was stupendous, it was far too subtle, or not there at all in most cases. The Director did not allow any of the actors to fully express anything, his concentration on subtlety left the movie bare, with little to involve the audience. The writing was also lackluster, although I believe the novel to be much better. This a classic case of a film full of talented people that are restricted to the point of being incapable of using those talents by the director. In addition the score does little to reinforce either the action of the film or the nature of its' themes. The photography and overall design tried to mimic that of not only the 70s (where it was set) but the pop films of that era. Unfortunately I believe that this alienates viewers from the 90s. Particularly the terrible photography ruined a most important aspect of the film. There were several potentially amazing scenes when Mikey Carver (Elijah Wood) is wandering around in the ice storm. The photography does little to enhance the storm's effect on nature. In summary, this film is hardly worth the $3 i paid to rent it. If your truly bored and have seen all the other terrible movies at the video-store, rent this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Ice Storm got to me. For three reasons. I'll keep it short.First, was the performance of Christina Ricci, growing out of her days in such movies as "Now and Then" or "Casper". In her open and honest face everything comes through, whether it be raw emotion or calm thought.Second, the movie was real. It was nice to sit down and view something sans the special effects, the cars chases, the ghosts, the murder, the slapstick comedy. Third and most importantly, it was quiet, thoughtful and intriguing. During those pauses set in just the right place, I barely breathed, I just watched the characters react. The film was fresh, honest, cold at times, but incredibly beautiful and real. I strongly reccomend it for anyone with an appreciation for a quality film.</fullReview>

The nearly ethnographic accuracy of everyday's life details (colours, shapes, fabrics, aso) added to the specific time location during the Watergate scandal turn the film into more than another fiction about how difficult it is to keep families together and being a parent. We are actually witnessing how social links desagragates: social decomposition may be the film's key word. The film does not have the ravaging humour of Todd Solonz's Happiness and just this coldness in tone makes it even more frightening: how far are we ready to go to keep the dream of the nuclear family alive ?</fullReview>

We are put right in the middle of the sexual revolution in a northeastern town on a Thanksgiving weekend in 1973.Kevin Kline gives another brilliant performance and his affair with Sigourney Weaver is very believable. Christina Ricchi also does a fantastic job as Kline's daughter turning to sex to find the love and comfort that she can't get from her parents.This is a thinking person's film and the way the story is tied together is brilliant.

		<fullReview>The Ice Storm transpires over Thanksgiving 1973, and is set in the well-to-do suburb of New Canaan, CT. As a young adult at the time it rings very true both in its attention to physical detail, and in capturing the mood of the time.It chronicles the slow dissolution of two neighboring families, the Hoods and the Carvers. Both have two teen-age children, one of whom provides the film's narrative. The adults have lost their moorings in a world of changing values, or so it seems to them. As they let go of the old, the have nothing to hold on to, and are slowly sliding into emotional dissolution. It's painful to watch, but so wonderfully acted your can't turn away.Maybe not a masterpiece but this is nonetheless definitely worth the rental. Grade A.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie a few weeks ago, and thought I would let it settle before I wrote about it. I have had the feeling lately that we are living in the most soulless period in our history. If this movie is an accurate portrayal of the seventies, I stand corrected. Perhaps the director intended to present to us a group of unsympathetic characters whose doings are of no real consequence. If he did, he succeeded. I cannot hang my sympathies on a single character. I know that wealth often corrupts, but this goes so far to prove this.The children are what I find most unattractive. They are made to seem like Yale scholars. How can they be so wise when raised by such a pack of amoral, non-intellectual boobs. Doesn't anyone have any satisfaction in their life. Movies need protagonists, even if they are sometimes weak. These kids are in need of therapy, I agree, but don't any of them have a sense of humor. The only one I found humorous is the guy who keeps blowing things up. He is so stereotypical of this loose cannon that people steer clear of, and yet his sexual repression is hard to follow. The daughter seems to go from place to place, ready to experience her sexuality, but has this sinister appearance. She's also such a know-it-all. "If only they listened to me." She is so unlikeable, why would anyone want to get near her.Then there's all the trading around and the kleptomania and the cries for help. I've been to New Canaan many times. In the fall, it is one of the prettiest areas I've visited. This movie could have made its point and still given us a balanced picture of the people who infest it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Necessary Evil</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Ice Storm" is a film that is so layered with symbolic meaning that it demands multiple viewings. Otherwise, it would be much too easy to brush off the film as a cold, depressing, and pointlessly bleak portrait of the lives it depicts.On one level, Ang Lee's film is about two upper-middle class New England families--the Hoods and the Carvers--and how they are forever impacted by the sexual revolution of the 1970s. On another level, this film concerns the healthy balance that Nature provides and how subverting this balance can lead to destructive, and even tragic, consequences.In both the Hood family and the Carver family, the parents essentially behave like children, while the children, who have no reliable (or respectable) authority figures to supervise them, stumble precariously into the arena of adult sexual awakening. Ben Hood (Kevin Kline) and Janey Carver (Sigourney Weaver) engage in an extramarital affair with one another because their spouses do not sexually satisfy them; Ben's wife Elena (Joan Allen) is frigid and Janey's husband Jim (Jamey Sheridan) is impotent. Essentially, Ben and Janey are so engulfed in their own selfish wants that they are oblivious to the potentially destructive consequences of their actions on their families.But their spouses are certainly not without foibles of their own. Elena Hood suffers from a mid-life crisis of sorts that leaves her longing to be free of adult responsibilities. In one scene, Elena watches wistfully as her daughter Wendy (Christina Ricci) rides past her on her bicycle, and a bit later we see Elena herself ride a bicycle into town and get caught shoplifting, which, incidentally, is a petty crime that her daughter is also involved in. And then there is Jim Carver--the clueless, mad scientist type who is so obsessed with his work that he has never learned to communicate with his own children. When he asks his sons Mikey (Elijah Wood) and Sandy (Adam Hann-Byrd) how school is going, the boys are so puzzled by what should be a mundane inquiry that they cannot give a coherent response.Indeed, failure of communication is a theme that is prevalent throughout "The Ice Storm." Just as Jim cannot talk directly to his children, so Ben fails to do so with his own. There is a notable scene in a car between Ben and his son Paul (Tobey Maguire) in which Ben awkwardly attempts to broach the subject of masturbation. It is obvious to everyone but Ben that Paul is at a stage of adolescence where he would be fully aware of such issues. The puzzled look on Paul's face confirms his own astonishment at his father's cluelessness. Similarly, when Janey Sheridan scolds Wendy Hood for sexually coming on to her younger son Sandy, she does so not through a forceful reprimand but by spouting out obscure, irrelevant facts about Eastern cultural traditions.What becomes painfully clear as "The Ice Storm" progresses is that the lives of these two families are slowly but surely spiraling out of control, and someone is ultimately going to have to pay for these sins. The time of reckoning finally arrives on the night that both the Hood and the Carver adults converge on a key party while a fierce ice storm strikes the area. The key party--in which the husbands toss their keys in a jar and the wives sleep with the men whose keys they randomly fish out--marks the lowest possible point of moral abandonment by the Hoods and the Carvers. Director Ang Lee effectively intercuts these crucial scenes to reveal that as the party progresses inside, so the ice storm rages outside--as if to vent Nature's fury at the chaos that man consistently chooses to embrace over the natural order.When the storm finally clears, and the effect of the alcohol wears off, what rises with the morning mist is a tragic revelation that wrenches all characters from their careless moral and spiritual slumbers. This is a devastating finale, and what is even more heartbreaking is the silent understanding that, for these two families, tragedy was clearly a necessary evil.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A chilling, confronting and altogether well-made expose on American family in the 1970's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When one of the characters breaks down and cries, we realise that the people we are seeing in The Ice Storm have no direction. Their lives comprise of wandering aimlessly through a haze of extramarital affairs, experimentation with drugs and sex and taking everything they have for granted. The Ice Storm shows how children mimic their parents, one character is portrayed brilliantly by Christina Ricci, who plays a young nymphomaniac obsessed with sex. She is a teenager in an uncertain time, and we eventually realise that the children in the movie have more direction and more control over their lives than the adults, who hasten to reprimand the kids for things they otherwise do.It's 1973 in America and two upper class families collide head on in a tale that illustrates American family with so much integrity that you'd swear it's a Robert Altman piece. It's told by Ang Lee, a Chinese man who immigrated to America, and it's his perspective of family back then. The Ice Storm delves into how people were quick to adulterate because it was the thing to do, and the sordid key parties, where woman fish car keys out of a bowl and sleep with other wives' husbands.Each of the characters in the movie are played brilliantly, notably by Kevin Kline who delivers a portrayal of a man with no control over his life. He has two kids of whom he rarely sees, a wife whom he's cheating on and a life that is utterly perfuncatory. Also, there's the WASP vixen played by Sigourney Weaver, whose numerous affairs result in her totally losing control over her family. There's the kids who are gradually learning the in's and out's of life like sex and drugs. Lastly, there's the teenager who narrates the story: he has control over his life, and it takes one who is in control to tell a story about people out of control. The two balance perfectly.All of these problems come face to face in an extremely confronting denouement, which results in each of the characters to analyse their own lives. It's a really sad story. We have pity for these characters.The climax is amplified and emphasised by the ice storm which hits where they live. Ang Lee captures each icicle which dangles from the tea leaves; the slick roads; the chilly air. It's shown with such precision and such care that it heightens the emotional impact in a film that was already charged with it anyway. It's a deep film that requires much concentration and thought.Each of the performances are brilliant, the script is first class, the impact is phenomenal and the visual side is breathtaking.Ten out of ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you look at it vaguely, "The Ice Storm" has absolutely no plot. But that`s what makes it so interesting. It is a coming of age story between two families in the sexually-revolutionary era of the 70s. There are a lot of brutally honest scenes in this film, as it shows how people were first restrained, but eventually let themselves go, experimenting with sex and drugs. It is almost disturbing too see how sexually active the teenagers in this film were (Christina Ricci, Elijah Wood, Tobey Maguire). But it is a realistic film, and the symbolic use of weather and other things adds a nice, artistic touch to this film. The "ice storm" in this film is the main metaphor, as it represents the character`s freezing out to the important things in their life. The performances are outstanding, especially Sigourney Weaver as the "ice queen", who ultimately loses the most in the end. This film is very obscure in a way, so it forces the viewer to fully understand all the under-lying meanings. "The Ice Storm" has a very tragic finale, and it will leave you heart-broken.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It seems to me that while the 60's were a time of clarity - you were either on one side or the other - the 70's were a time of confusion, at least for suburbanites, for whom the 60's mores(like the sexual revolution) were finally catching up to them, and they didn't know what to do about it. For me, that was one of the main points of the original novel by Rick Moody, and this powerful film, this feeling of confusion and being adrift, because no one knew what the rules were.This is perfect territory for Ang Lee, because this is a film less about what people say than how they act, and all of his previous films have been studies of human behavior. From the line for the train, where everyone male is wearing the same trenchcoat, to the key party, we are allowed to see the internal effects on each person of their behavior, even if they themselves can't see it. Lee is elliptical in his approach, which does take some getting used to, but his compassion is obvious. And all the performances are excellent, especially Ricci, who shows she's going to be a big star someday.</fullReview>

Yeah, it was depressing, but it was designed to be. That's what makes the film very enjoyable and enables the cast to shine. Aside from all that, the film was beautifully put together and marvelously acted-especially Joan Allen as Elena Hood. What a tour-de-force performance in a role that is really very quiet and subtle, she projected Elena's emotions perfectly. Not to be missed. Along with "Boogie Nights' definitely the best film of 1997</fullReview>

And that is not a bad thing, or a good thing. It wouldn't have mattered if I missed it. Some may fancy the film's unrushed subtlety; others will wonder what the scuttlebutt was all about.

		<fullReview>Ang Lee has indeed created a modern masterpiece. The film deftly explores the many dimensions of loneliness and sexual frustration that were very prevalent in the early 1970's. The cast is exceptional as well - including top honors to Christina Ricci and Sigourney Weaver. It's a shame that the film was not nominated for any Oscars, since it is such an interesting character study and fascinating to watch again and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most overlooked movies of 1997!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Ice Storm" was in my opinion one of the best acted movies of 1997 (L.A Confidential , The Wings of the Dove, and As Good As It Gets were the others). Once again Ang Lee's talents as a director was ignored again by the Academy (ex. 1995's Sense and Sensibility"). It is too bad that he was shunned again by the Academy for this movie was not even nominated for a single Oscar for its efforts in cinematography, screenplay, directing, and in the main acting categories.Joan Allen gives a real strong performance as the tortured and neglected wife Elena Wood and deserved to get some kind of recognition like a Best Actress nomination at the Golden Globes or Screen Actors Guild Award Nomination, and especially an Oscar nomination. Sigourney Weaver played a brief but stinging role as the unhappy Janey Carver and should have been nominated for a Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination. Christina Ricci displays such talent and maturity well-beyond her seventeen years and should have gotten in if Sigourney Weaver didn't. Tobey Maguire and Elijah Wood were stellar in this movie and they have terrific futures ahead of them and Adam-Hann displays that talent just as well. Kevin Kline's role was wonderful in his performance and even though he wasn't going to get recognition for this movie it was an excellent effort.Probably the best examples of movies that didn't involve high glamour special effects and mindless violence to make it entertaining. When I left the theatre I was completely quiet for about minute because it left a very icy feeling that we all should be happy that our families love us and that we should be thankful for the love we have and not to take life for granted because it could be taken from us in a flash.The Ice Storm was a beauty and it was too bad that this movie didn't get recognized properly but I'll leave this movie with a perfect 10 and say that this was one of the best if not the best movie of 1997!!</fullReview>

The party definitely was effective because the atmosphere was so familiar to me even though I grew up in the 80s. The film has an extraordinary atmosphere with great performances, even though there's no real plot to the film. It still works anyway. Highly recommended.

		<fullReview>I will not keep you long. I just watched this film again this evening. I contain the passion that accompanies recent viewings. Someone please tell me that this film is not the most overlooked piece of art of 1997. I go to "Blockbuster", and there it sits on the shelf, like the deformed baby nobody wants to adopt. I think people forget that "period" pieces are not just frilly sleeves and British accents. A "period" piece is a film that attempts to capture the bygone. Ang Lee has a sense of nostalgic atmosphere that rivals my own dreams of the years that I actually lived through. His films seem more real to me than my memories. I have been to New Canaan, CT. I was born in Wilton, CT...a spit away. I vaguely remember the storm. Ang Lee's film, and Rick Moody's book, are more real than my infantile gasps at the sounds of simple weather. I guess that is what all noble art becomes; not only the reflection of truth, but a certain truth itself...the only true expression of your own silent speculations. Truth because it was finally told. Truth, because someone spoke for you (more eloquently)about the storm. Their words sounded more genuine than the wind you remember.See this. It's better than what you just picked up. I'm almost certain. Put down "Deep Impact", and trust a stranger. I will accept your thanks in advance. "Too-ta-loo": (my language for goodbye).Oh yeah. I'm also a little drunk. oops?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Were the 70's Really that Bad?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fascinating, how the culture's global assessment of the '70s seems to get more negative from year to year. As someone old enough to remember, I felt this film caught beautifully the special quality of the alienation between parents and children in those days; the anger of middle-aged women caught in old-style marriages that suddenly weren't working and the confusion of middle class men who were working hard to pay the bills, the way their fathers had told them they should, but were suddenly confronted with wives who wouldn't sleep with them anymore (or were sleeping with the neighbors) and children who wouldn't talk to them.I think though, that with all the "reassessing" that's going on, there is a real danger that the tremendous energy and sheer frolicsome exuberance of those times may be forgotten. It's true that my family and nearly all my friends' families were more or less dysfunctional then. Still, I had a hell of a time. If I had a choice, I'd rather be depressed and lonely in the '70s when I could console myself by going to a friendly neighborhood orgy or anti-war demonstration (pick your poison) than in the '90s when people just lock themselves up at home and take Prozac until the darkness recedes sufficiently that they can face their computer screens again..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The term 'subtle' seems to be oft used in describing this movie - it is entirely appropriate. But combined with it's very gentle subtlety is something far more powerful and moving just underneath the surface. This is not a movie that many people will walk away from and be able to quickly forget. I found it difficult to connect to the mood of the times (having barely been born), or the motivations of the actors (particularly why choose Sigourney Weaver over Joan Allen??? Bizarre!), but nevertheless was profoundly moved by the story, the brilliant acting, and the starkness of the emotion. A few minor peculiarities - ie the narrator is absent for the majority of the tale and his story is essentially a non-event, don't detract from the overall quality of the movie. Be prepared to be affected.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometimes going to the movies is depressing - especially when the subject matter portrayed on the screen is less than joyous. Such is the case, especially, with Independent-type art house films like "The Ice Storm." While it features an all-star cast (Kevin Kline, Sigourney Weaver, Elijah Wood, Christina Ricci), the plot is subdued, virtually non-existent, as it starts in the middle of these people's lives and ends in the middle as well. It's the story of families, dysfunctional just as it was becoming trendy in the 1970's, who share nothing with each other, but heartache and cold emotionless relationships with everyone. Each character shows little care or concern for one another - only a blank love-void existence. The 70 's were a decade of experimentation with drugs, sex, and alcohol - and everyone, children included, are involved in this exploration.The performances put in by the children outshine their more famous adult co -stars, and that's good. Because it's easy for adults to play emotionless characters - they get plenty of practice. But for child actors to extinguish their natural emotions for a life completely void of feelings is difficult. Sigourney Weaver received a Golden Globe nomination, but I would rather have seen Christian Ricci recognized for her performance. She has a long career ahead of her.This movie is not a pleasant film experience - instead it serves as a warning, or a lesson, or maybe just a look at life and how it is. But it is a look at life being played out in tragic ways - not because of the tragedy that occurs towards the end of the film, but the tragedy of a family without love, and a life without emotion.</fullReview>

Ang Lee has definately grown alot as a director since some of his previous efforts.The thing that holds greatness off is one key performance that fails to live up to what is needed. Joan Allen is her normal brilliant self, and was deserving of an Oscar Nomination. Sigourney Weaver was very good, but the performance that seemed a little.... empty was that of Christina Ricci. I think she is a talent, but I have never seen an actress who has consistently left me with no impression whatsoever. For the role that Ricci played, a better choice in casting would have been Natalie Portman... that girl can do anything.All in all, we are given brilliant, 3-Dimensional characters, an intriguing plot, and great performances, along with great direction. It is a very good movie which was number 10 on my top ten list.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Somewhere last winter, in the midst of all of the hoopla about "Good Will Hunting," (deserved) "As Good As It Gets," (deserved) and "Titanic," (undeserved) this completely realistic, marvelously satirical parable slipped through the cracks completely. This is a shame (and a great loss to the casual moviegoer), because the insights provided in this awe -inspiring tribute to the mutation of the clueless upper-class New England social circles in the early 70s are not to be missed, and certainly not to be taken lightly. Kevin Kline and Joan Allen star as the unfaithful husband and tortured housewife that we are all so familiar with, though more through personal experience than anything else. First-rate supporting performances are turned in by Christina Ricci and Tobey Maguire as their children, and a nicely apathetic Sigourney Weaver as the mother whom Kline cheats with. There is so much perfectly leveled dialogue full of poignancy and irony in every scene; Ang Lee and so many others deserved Oscars for their work on this breathtaking film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Ice Storm is a brilliantly funny, satirical look at the fallout of the sexual revolution and its effect on an upper-class community, two neighboring families in particular. It presents the early seventies as a time of cultural confusion, with its "modern" trappings now appearing strangely foreign and often utterly silly. There is not a false line of dialogue nor a throw-away scene in the film, and the performances are uniformly excellent. Ang Lee has crafted this film with a startling eye for nuance that perhaps could only be beheld by an outsider. Kevin Kline and Christina Ricci are stand-outs, as the dense father/inconsiderate husband and his rapidly (if unevenly) maturing daughter. I have seen this movie five times in the last two months and look forward to watching it again. In fact, any time in the future that I may flirt with the notion of going to see a movie like Armageddon or Godzilla, one without a shred of imagination or respect for its audience , I will instead go back and view The Ice Storm once more. Repeated viewings of this one are far more rewarding than to waste even a minute watching the aforementioned and their like.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Film With Great Actors Giving Great Performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved The Ice Storm. It's one of my favorite films. It takes place one thanksgiving, in the early 70's. When we first see the Hood family, they are perfectly normal. Kevin Kline is a loving husband, Joan Allen is a typical wife, Tobey Maguire loves comics, and Christina Ricci doesn't like Nixon. A perfectly normal family, in fact, they are nothing but. Kline is cheating on his wife with Sigourney Weaver, Allen is suspecting, but tries not to show it. Ricci is a fourteen year old experimenting with alcohol and sex. Maguire is in love with a girl, and she likes him too, like a brother.This all culminates during an ice storm. Everyone breaks down, in some form or another. Kline is unable to keep his secret from Allen, and she doesn't react with shock. In fact, she acts relieved. This is before she cheats on Kline during a car-key exchange, that seems right out of the seventies. That being said, every single one of the actors has their moment to shine. From Kline down to Elijah Wood, every actor delivers a masterful performance.This is all done through Ang Lee's direction. Lee is a great director, and here, he shows it. He perfectly captures the decade, in his use of music, costumes and sets. The cinematography is great as well. All being said, The Ice Storm is one of the best films of the nineties, and in my option, the best film of 1997. Watch it and immerse yourself in a world of pain, longing, lust and booze. In other words, just watch the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So close, yet so far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Look, I think Ang Lee is a fine director, but this film misses the mark despite aiming for the right target.Lee effectively uses a melancholy, wintry backdrop -- along with the Watergate scandal -- in his attempt to convey the post-'60s disillusionment that existed in the bleak and almost-cozily forlorn early-'70s...Almost.Unfortunately, the wonderful opportunity to capture this now-distant era wound up being reduced to a cliché'd cartoon. The acting mostly isn't very good (even from good actors) and the dialogue seems forced and trite in its efforts to feel "to period".Sure, Hollywood was better at doing period films in the '90s than the '80s, but the overall texture of this thing is off. It all feels more than a little pretentious.... It's not the subject-matter; it's the execution.Ang Lee clearly had the right idea in mind with this movie, and the physicality of it is near-perfect. But the effect is undermined by what feels like too desperate an effort to be meaningful, rendering the "My God, what have we done to our children??" type finale more silly--- and ultimately ringing hollow--- than anything else.Worth a look, to be sure, but the script is dire.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"There is a malaise that exists in your land ? what appears to many as the sudden and tragic disappearance of the American dream which, in some ways, has turned to nightmare." ? John Greene Part of a group of films ("Magnolia", "Safe", "American Beauty", "Fight Club", "Happiness", "Synecdoche NY", "Revolutionary Road", "Little Children" etc) released in the decade after 1995, all of which presented middle class American life as a suicidally dull bore, Ang Lee's "The Ice Storm" revolves around a small cast of affluent but disaffected characters.Most of the aforementioned pictures do the same things; they see the excesses of the 1980s ? a decade of materialistic pursuit and economic boom - giving way to a "comfortable capitalism" in possession of a suffocating underside. Forget the lower and middle classes. These films offered their audiences an array of wealthy characters, all of whom are subjected to a kind of pampered drudgery (the vacuity of materialism, of 9 to 5 routines, of cultural overload, of over stimulation etc). In almost all cases, these characters cope by resorting to violence, sex, drugs and/or fantasy. Such coping mechanisms, or addictions, always fail; in these films existential nausea knows no escape. All these films also fail to conjure up any new languages of despair (Antonioni, Bergman etc) and all seem blissfully unaware of the socio-psycho-economic causes of their ailments ("Eyes Wide Shut" would come along and rectify this).And like most of Woody Allen's work, these films also understand their character's problems solely through the lens of sexual disenchantment. They're populated by emasculated characters who see their plights as being a result of unfulfilled sexual desires. In other words, these films reduce happiness to biology. A lack of orgasms. A glitch involving neurochemicals. Indeed, Todd Solondz's "Happiness" liberalises this by ending with a kid ejaculating on his front porch. Few of these films recognise that desire is always buffeted by larger forces, and even fewer broaden their scope beyond the bedroom.7.5/10 ? Slickly shot and entertaining, this did what Sam Mendez did with "American Beauty" in a much less pretentious manner. Unfortunately, like most films in this cycle, it amounts to a kind of shallow existentialism. Worth one viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE ICE STORM **** Rick Moody's screenplay seems somewhat pretentious and unstable because its themes (marital issue, promiscuity, adolescence) aren't explored very deeply before it goes on to the next one - making it seem as though all he really wants is to give his characters emotional charge, or lack thereof - and not ending with quite the resolution it needed. However, the basic gist of the story still penetrates through as the film establishes itself, about life in 1973 Conneticut, where the barriers and rifts that form, amoral events that take place, and new facets of life being explored between all of the characters effect each of them differently. All of the events take place over the course of a weekend as an ice storm forms. Rick Moody and Ang Lee, a gifted director, work well together to coat 'The Ice Storm' with plenty of creative elements of film technique, but there just isn't much solid backbone to base it on. Four out of five stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well-Made, Intense, Above Average Drama With Great Ensemble Cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a chilly Thanksgiving weekend in 1974 in Connecticut, and the Hood family is having some problems. Dad's having an affair with a family friend, Mom's looking for something more than housewife drudgery and kids Paul and Wendy are trying to expand their sexual horizons. Is their unity splintering, and what force can bring them together again ?This is an impressive ensemble drama with an intriguing setting and a potent atmosphere of middle-class decadence. It's hard to like any of the adult characters in this picture, who belong to that interesting counter-culture-turned-parents generation who must surely win the award for most self-obsessed hypocrites, with their boring group therapy, indulgence in light narcotics, tedious wife-swapping parties and twisted double-standards towards their children. The kids on the other hand are all very sweet, despite their many flaws. The strength of the movie is the strength of the top-notch cast, all of whom are excellent, but particularly the underrated Allen as the timorous wife who holds the family together at the cost of her own individuality and the amazingly intense Hann-Byrd (the kid from Jodie Foster's Little Man Tate) as blank-faced boy Sandy, who can only get his parents' attention when he resorts to pyromania. Director Lee skilfully blends the characters and story threads together with a discreet, subtle style and the visual metaphor (a freezing rainstorm that covers everything in a layer of ice) richly embellishes the atmosphere of a family and a time that is superficially sparkling and pretty outwardly but cold and hard inside. The movie also has an odd comic-book connection in that narrator Maguire ascribes the events to the edition of The Fantastic Four he is reading; he went on to play Spiderman and Lee went on to direct The Hulk. Based on a book by Rick Moody and featuring a great unusual score by Mychael Danna.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ang Lee is in my opinion the second best director working today, after Steven Spielberg. His work is all very different from anything he has done before. And this The Ice Storm is his best work. The Ice Storm is one of the best family dramas ever filmed. It and American Beauty . Those two films are both great and amazing but it is not hard to tell which is the better film. The Ice Storm is the better of the two films even if it doesn't have a performance that can top that of Kevin Spacey as Lester Bernham. The plot revolves around two families that live in a small superb of New York City in the mid seventies. One family consists of the sexually unhappy father who is having an affair with one of the neighbors played superbly by Kevin Kline, the happy but conservative wife played by Joan Allen, and their two kids played wonderfully by Tobey Maguire and Christina Ricci. The other family makes up of a father who is rarely there played by Jamey Sheridan, a mother who is wicked in her affairs and friendships and doesn't know how to let her kids know how much she loves them played by Sigourney Weaver and their two kids. The spacey teen who is dating Christina Ricci's character is played wonderfully by Elijah Wood and the quite nerdy younger brother played by Adam Hann-Byrd. The two families are put together in several incidents including a freak Ice Storm and a game of wife swap. All the characters are unhappy people but somehow even those of us that are most happy will find something they connect with. The Ice Storm is also a movie that everyone should see at some point in their life because it is amazing and very important.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was a 19 year old living in Southern Connecticut(about 50 miles from the RealLife place of New Canaan Connecticut) in late November 1973 when this movie is supposed to be set in. First of All,I can remember that there was a for-real, very bad Ice Storm that happened almost completely unexpectedly on a weekend night time frame wise between after Thanksgiving, but at least a week or two before Christmas 1973. I was caught in that storm. I was in my car,and on my to my Girlfriend's(she was 17 yrs. old)House.That Night,when I left my own home rain fell,butwhenI was driving on Interstate-95 the rain changed quickly to pounding ice pellets, and my car's defroster couldn't prevent all of my windows from freezing over. In the Darkness, and with only a very glaze view of things on the highway from inside my old Chevy, I could now just barely see other drivers headlights, and taillights which prevented me from a having or worse causing a very bad collision on the Interstate in the darkness. I moved my car as far to the right as possible, and luckily in no time in front of me saw a car's taillights veering right and descending-An Exit Ramp! Relief!-I immediately followed this car, and when I got to the bottom of this ramp,further luck,a gas station that was actually open at night(Remember the 1st Big Energy was going on then)with an attendant on duty. This Attendent sprayed all of my car windows with deicing fluid.This took care of that problem nicely for then at least. I also bought a can of WD40 from him to use in case the same problem came back on my journey. I next used the Gas Station's telephone to call my girlfriend and let her know why I was running late (I was also within 5 miles of her home so it was easier than turning back 15 miles in the other direction)but would soon arrive. Upon my arrival,she told me that her parents had already left to go visit relatives (also in another town)and thus encountered the exact same driving conditions that I had going the other direction. Her Parents knew of our plans to go out that night,and had called her immediately upon their arrival to try and get ahold of me if I hadn't left to advise to not attempt the trip and stay home,but if I had already departed my own home, then we should both just stay put there and not attempt to travel anywhere. Thats exactly what we did. We started off watching "Columbo" on TV, but eventually ended up on the floor of her living room next to the family Christmas Tree making love. Thats the main part of my story,and thats where I relate to parallels in the lives of these fictional characters. By the time her parents managed to get back,we had straightened up enough,and I ended up sleeping on their couch that night.As for the rest of the movie,I had an Uncle then who reminded me a lot of the Kevin Klein character in this movie. He was then a 40 something successful businessman,who had been married to his wife for well over 20 years, with a nice home,family,and overall lifestyle,but,unknown to all of his family he was having an affair with a woman who was also married. His wife would eventually find out,divorce him,with the result being that he would lose his very nice home and many of it's nice furnishings. His long established business failed over the years,he drank a lot more,and would die from health complications due to his drinking mixed with diabetes. He did marry his girlfriend after she obtained her own divorce and they stayed together until she passed on a couple of years before him. Yes, the attitudes in this movie reflected a lot of what was really going out there in real-life in those days.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that lasts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ice Storm is a film that lasts in the memory.Its a tragic story of non-communication set within a beautifully composed snapshot of 70s mores. The cast is outstanding, and the story slowly travels down the slope to its sad ending with a sense of inevitability in which we can each see parts of ourselves and echoes of our own relationships and unhappiness reflected from the screen.The characters each travel through their own emotional maze, unable to see over the hedge to those closest to them. The wife-swapping party is a scene of tawdry desire in which the audience is able to see through the shallow hysteria which the characters are unable to penetrate.I read Rick Moody's book after seeing the movie. Its one of the few instances I can recall in which a book has been so beautifully presented on screen without loss or change to its basic elements. I recommend both.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Over-the-top and contrived, but with four great young actors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Ice Storm" is a film that isn't particularly special in any way. It's about a few middle-class families living in Connecticut, 1973. It doesn't really make clear what it's trying to say, but I assumed it was all about how middle-class families, despite their outside appearance, may not always be perfectly functional. (However, we all know that already and this doesn't contain much new material.) It trundles along with an average and slightly disjointed script, and portrays contrived and fairly unrealistic scenarios. The story is rushed sometimes, but then changes unpredictably to a slow pace. The cinematography is all right though, if you like looking at lots of shots of ice.The only real strength lies in the performances. Although the adult actors (lead by Joan Allen, Kevin Kline and Sigourney Weaver) are fine, they're nothing special. Fortunately, however, we have four younger actors: Tobey Maguire, Elijah Wood, Adam Hann-Byrd and Christina Ricci. Of these, unfortunately the only one with a decent amount of screen time is Christina Ricci, and her character is so annoying that her performances starts to become that way as well. Most of the other characters lacked character development. (It was interesting to see Tobey Maguire and Elijah Wood when they were younger than they were in their most well-known films; and great to see Adam Hann-Byrd who matured from "Little Man Tate".) The back of the video box informs me how everybody embarks upon their own "sexual odyssey" at Thanksgiving. That was an incredibly stupid way of describing the ridiculous and lame events that occur in the film. The ending is not satisfying and is almost rushed. Apart from the young actors, the end was my favourite part.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Might be the Darkest Movie I've Ever Seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First the good, then the bad. Ang Lee is a terrific director in my book. CROUCHING TIGER, RIDE WITH THE DEVIL, and even HULK are excellent films in my book. He always has a great look to his films, and while not fast paced, are still well paced nonetheless. The cast he's assembled for THE ICE STORM is pretty amazing all by itself (including a pre-Spider-Man Tobey Maguire and and a pre-Frodo Elijah Wood). And Lee gets that cast, like all of his casts, to generate real people that I find believable on screen.But of all the movies of his I'd seen, nothing really prepared me for the kind of desperate realism portrayed here. I'm not sure any film I've watched played out as dark as this one. Sure, THE EXORCIST is dark, but there is something about those characters that are removed from me, not quite real or close to my reality. That and the horror aspect distanced me from it. TAXI DRIVER is closer to a reality I recognize, but again there are elements that seem removed and stylized, although that one hits pretty close these days. THE ICE STORM, however, gives such real and convincing performances that it's much more horrifying to see what 'normal' people - not demons, monsters, or stylized psychopaths - are capable of. Some of the characters here reminded me of some crazed train engineer who, upon realizing he's on the wrong tracks, just drives faster.So while Lee's film is involving, it never rewarded me in the way I think films have to. I just couldn't find anyone to root for here, and that was a frustrating experience (though not as frustrating as RAGING BULL - I'm sorry, I think it's Scorsese's worst effort, but that's another topic). It's hard for me to say if there's more bad than good to the movie, and my vote lands in the middle. People who loved MONSTER'S BALL or RAGING BULL might find this entertaining. But for most moviegoers, I'll recommend Ang Lee's much more balanced RIDE WITH THE DEVIL and say pass on this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is this a first? I'm typing this while I'm watching this movie for the first time.I have never felt such a strong sense of a movie being hard to watch--while being a must-watch--since Dazed and Confused.Perhaps this movie is a sort of barometer of one's own emotional state. Perhaps the more this movie hurts, the closer you are to your own true self.It's funny how we see things differently in retrospect. Is this a repudiation of the amorality that came out the "liberation" '60s?The imagery of this movie is incredible. The writing gets better and better with each passing moment.It makes me ponder, again, the meaning of the fact that every 100 years or so, the Earth has a new crew. Movies like this raise the stakes on this reality.But how much have things really changed? In particular, there's an understated aspect to this movie that tragically remains understated to this day: American oblivion to social reality. We are now (Nov 2004) involved in a stupid war in Iraq, where we have no business being, and Americans not only don't care, but they reelected the administration that engineered this moral fiasco. Isn't that, in a way, worse than what this movie depicts?This movie is insightful, especially to the extent that what we see is perennial. It's just not easy to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Screwed up morals!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Ice Storm' is a story about two rich suburban families from New Cannan, Connecticut who have love affairs between each other. One family the Hoods are about to get divorced. Mr. Hood has an affair with his neighbor Janey Carver who is married to Sandy Carver who is a successful businessman who is often in business trips and rarely home. Elena Hood seems to be in search of some counseling both psychiatric and spiritual to help her breaking family but Mr. Hood is not supportive of it. Elena's trust in her husband weakness when they go to a key party because she suspects that her husband is having an affair with their neighbor. She seems to get back at him by also participating in the key party and leaving with her neighbor Mr. Carver. While they are at the key party Wendy Hood and Jim Carver get undressed and sleep together and Mickey Hood goes outside during an Ice Storm and is fatally electrocuted by a fallen electric pole. Also Paul Hood, the eldest son of the Hoods, goes to New York to meet with his crush from High School, Libbets Casey, and comes back home to find his father crying in realization of his bad example as a parent. This is not the type of movie I would choose to see. However, after analyzing it, I like the logic and message that it gave. I would not say I related with the way the children acted in the film, but I could understand why they acted the way they did. When I was small, my parents would work a lot and that kept us separated; just like the kids in the film. But even though when there is distance between parents and children, the kids often follow their parent's behavior and example. They can even pay the consequences of their parent's actions. In the movie Wendy was very sexually open by exploring her opposite sex. Her parents did the same by being unfaithful and by participating at a key party. This makes it clear that Wendy's behavior came from her father for instance, as the film showed that he was having an affair with his neighbor. Also Wendy and her mother Elena pick pocketing was shown in the movie to be related. Even though the daughter was not aware of her mother's behavior, she picked up the same habit of steeling. This film has made me reflect upon how family stability reflects upon the stability of society as well. Society starts at home, bad family ties creates a bad society. Throughout history there has been a correlation between bad morals and failed in life. Not only does the movie portray the view of a ruptured family but also of a ruptured society. By showing Wendy's disapproval of the current president Nixon it reflected the type of disloyal society of the time. Nixon being a symbol of a leader who is trusted by a nation but whose disloyalty creates a breakdown of trust in society. This also shows another influential part of the movie, about how bad leaders can cause chaos; as Nixon did for the United States with his corruption, Ben also with his unfaithfulness was a bad role model in his family creating a home with lack of morals. There seems to be no indication of good parenting or a good influential role model in this film. And because of this Wendy is so sexually explicit and Mickey died for not having any parental supervision. Children suffer when there is a lack of parental guidance and example. If parents do not understand their position and role in their family, it will be hard for them to raise sane children. If parents lack morals and don't maintain good communication with their children, children will be raised with a lack of morals and a sense of confusion, because they don't have a sense of security from their distant parents. Both families in the film had unsupervised children who were not mentally and emotionally sane. Wendy in the midst of puberty was already very sexually open; and even though her mother noticed it she didn't seem to care or teach her daughter good morals. Mickey was in fascination with 'molecules' and went out late at night during an ice storm and died from lack of parental supervision. And Mickey's brother who is probably less than ten, also had is own fascination with explosives, and could have almost killed himself while he was blowing up his airplanes with dynamite at home when he was alone. If their parents were conscious of their roles and practiced good parenting by communicating, giving emotional security to their children and keeping good family ties, 'The Ice Storm' would have been a whole other story. Even though both families had money and could offer their children many material things, money could not and does not buy good parenting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silence stands for despair</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>These are the stories of the dysfunctional families that have to deal with the variety of problem that occur. The story is pretty simple and is about family strife. Wendy is a typical adolescent exploring her sexuality. At the same time her parents, Ben and Elena are having marital differences. Ben is cheating on his wife with Janey, the wife of his close friend Jim. The irony comes up with Wendy who is has sexual relations with Janey and Jim's son Mikey and his younger brother Sandy.Mikey seeks stability in his life of chaos and troubles. He yearns for his stability because he lacks a secure family life style. Mikey is fascinated with molecules and the cleanliness; he believed the molecules had stopped when they were frozen. Everything being frozen is a symbol of stability, but this is an illusion because the ice will soon melt and therefore no longer be stabile. Immediately after Mikey sits down and finds his solid base death follows. He is completely drawn into the wires and flashing lights: these lights portray a snake. This snake is a symbol for the temptation for sex within his family, so in a since his families obsession for sex kills him. In this movie, the characters desire sex and lust for one another and it shows how people in the past had different morals and standards than we do today. But the longing for sex and affairs are equal to the breaking of relationships. The key parties in a scene symbolizes the breaking of relationships. The key parties are the official rock bottom in a couple's relationship; true love which should be the basis in the relationship is not being valued. In the final scene, the family gets in a car and a silence reigns over them as the father begins to sob. To me this silence stands for despair. In the previous scenes when something went wrong and the parents both knew it occurred they would say to be silent or we are going to ruin everything. And this final scene is parallel to all those previous moments. The whole family knew something terribly wrong had occurred with both the death and the sexual affairs, so in result there is just a long silence in which they are covering up their problems instead of facing them and in the end the father can no longer handle all the hidden emotions and begins to cry, the father finally coming out and expressing his emotion through crying could be a sign of hope in the future to get passed their many problems of life within the dysfunctional family. As the characters withheld their thoughts and feelings of either hatred, despair, or love they ended up sunk into greater depression. But as they share their locked up emotions they are freed from their sorrow and find happiness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review, and SPOILER of a shocking movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Andrew R 9/29/04 The Ice Storm"Ice Storm" is a film about two upper class families living in New Canaan, Connecticut during the 1970's. From the outside they appear normal, well adjusted and leading perfect lives. In actuality, they are lost with little purpose or direction. Numb to their feeling and feelings of those around them. Their inability to relate to each other causes feelings of emptiness and great desire to find something to fill them up.Each searches for some way to do this. Benjamin Hook is unhappy in his cold marriage and has an affair with his next door neighbor Janny Carver. The affair turns out to be a mistake for both of them. Elena Hood is an unhappy house wife, and seems to satisfy some need she has by stealing lipsticks at the local pharmacy. Jim Carver is preoccupied with his work, ignoring the needs of his wife and having little impact on his sons, who aren't aware when he is away from home.As the adults are pursuing their outside interests, their children are experiencing with drugs and sex. Like their parents they are making poor choices. Trying new things, with no thought of how it may affect the lives of others.At this point I feel very little sympathy for the main characters. They seem so dysfunctional and pathetic. So many people would give anything to have their life style, but the Hoods and Carvers do not appreciate how fortunate they are. They expect other people to make them happy, and feel they deserve more.The families are warned by numerous news reports that there is a terrible storm coming. Yet, they refuse to heed the warnings, and venture out at great risk. This is exactly what they do in their personal lives. They are oblivious to the warnings signs of trouble in their relationships and engage self-destructive behavior. The adults go to a friend's party are tempted to exchange partners for the evening. In the meantime two of the couples children are having sex together, the prep school son is using drugs and trying to get a girl he likes to become interested in him and the other son is out in the storm placing himself in physical danger.It's not surprising that the author uses the death of Mike, as a way to force these characters to wake up, and take charge of their lives. We are never told what decisions or changes they will make, but this tragedy has changed their lives for ever. Hopefully, they will begin again to build trust, commitment and the love they are all seeking from each other. Then again, I don't expect they all lived "happily ever after."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Among The Greatest American Films Of The 90s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Possible Minor Spoilers*The post-war illusions of the 50s, the progress and disappointments of the 60s, post-hippie disillusionment, the positive and negative fallout from the sexual revolution, and the cold, reactionary paranoia of the Nixon years all collapsed - collectively - into the disorienting fragmentation/liberation of the 1970s. This process is captured hypnotically in Ang Lee's ICE STORM, which is basically a period piece, avoiding nostalgia (this film is every bit the doomy sibling of Richard Linklater's DAZED &amp; CONFUSED) in favor of a sociological/historic take on the era. The sterile anti-styles of the day (a pastiche of the groovy and the gauche - 50s modernism, 60s earthiness, 70s upward mobility) are flawlessly recreated and - along with the titular weather event - symbolize the characters' alternation between cerebral and chaotic responses to the new freedoms of the era that have inexplicably opened up before them. The adults (centered around two families) semi-secret sexual misadventures are pursued with a pathological coldness, and the similar fumblings (sex, booze and mysterious pills that Tobey Maguire heists from the medicine cabinet of his friend's parents) of their offspring seem more angry and compulsive than innocent. Within all of this darkness there is room for humor - when Kevin Kline's eldest son (Maguire) is introduced, he is seen in a boarding school dorm room sucking up bong hits as Frank Zappa's 'Dirty Love' plays in the background. Shortly thereafter, Kline attempts to deliver a 'birds-and-the-bees' speech to Maguire, which quickly degenerates into an explicit, yet rambling mess. But even the humor in on display here carries dire undercurrents of confusion and unarticulated rage - Elijah Wood blowing up his model airplanes before destroying a flower arrangement with a whip (these are not people who should have whips laying around the house), or a high school band slogging through a dissonant rendition of Maureen McGovern's already dreary radio staple 'There's Got To Be A Morning After' (music is very strategically deployed in this film, with song titles or lyrics very well used as discreet commentaries on the overall story). The impeccable look of THE ICE STORM, the accumulated weight of the characters' stunning neurosis and confusion, the music and cinematography all coalesce masterfully as the film builds toward a seemingly inevitable conclusion.</fullReview>

All of the usual technical aspects were strong in nature, and proved Ang Lee is quite a gifted director. After seeing this film, I decided Ride With the Devil can be forgiven. This was probably the first film where I started to admire Tobey Maguire's averageness, which I think is a very strong character trait for him. Christina Ricci shocked me in this film, and forever changed who she was as an actress (sadly, her `weight' issues drove her to an eating disorder). Kevin Kline was awesome, and the scene at the end simply sums up the entire film. Dark and unusual to say the least.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Satires about seventies sexual mores were made in the seventies, so why bother now? Kids will be bored and oldsters dismissive of silly scenes like the Nixon mask. Ang Lee fails to produce anything other than the cinematically mundane, as usual. Photography is curiously blurred. I seem to recall Joan Allen in a film about a serial killer and it's an indictment of the industry as a whole that all the adult leads have appeared in films about serial killers. There are a few laughs but this film caused a serious falling out between me and my parents. There is a scene where Christinna Ricci, dressed rather improbably as Little Red Riding Hood, arranges a liaison with Elijah Wood in an empty swimming pool. I went into the kitchen and there was some frantic yelling from my parents. "You're missing it, you're missing it, they're having sex!" They squealed. I had missed it and was most miffed. Let's face it, the only reason most people will set down to watch 'The Ice Storm' is the promise of some rumpy pumpy, albeit in retro flares. Distraught, I was determined to see it again at the earliest opportunity. Niavely, I assumed the afore-mentioned amorousness was between Ricci and Wood, possibly alfresco. Sadly, Al wasn't involved and I was very Ang Lee. So I stormed around to my parents and demanded an explanation. "How could you possibly think I was missing anything involving a middle aged couple having very brief, under the sheets sex? Recommend something hotter next time or I'll never visit you again!" A strange smile passed their lips. "Have you tried 'Emma'?" They replied in unison.</fullReview>

Well, the two are truly not that similar in their tones even though they both deal with two families dealing with their terrible lives in suburbia. While I enjoyed the performances in "The Ice Storm," the nature of the film was rather clinical and off-putting. The "ice storm" in the title was ultimately a metaphor, which I thought was a little heavy-handed. The cinematography was excellent, the music eerily haunting, and the performances superb, but it didn't really connect to me although I knew it was well made.

		<shortDescription>Interesting character study</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ang Lee's The Ice Storm starts off with Tobey Maguire talking of the paradox within The Fantastic Four comic books. This sets us up for the film, which is a paradox in itself. The paradox shows us how actions within a family unit can lead to a storm. This is epitomised materially by an actual storm that hits the neighbourhood, and has an effect on all of the characters. The start of the film is also ironic as both the director and the actor playing the character that reads the comic book would have their future in comic books; Ang Lee for 'The Hulk', and Tobey Maguire for the fabulous 'Spider-Man' films.The story takes place in a small neighbourhood in 1970's America and features two upper class families at it's centre; the Hood family, which consists of two parents (Kevin Kline and Joan Allen) and two children; a fourteen year old girl (Christina Ricci) and a sixteen year old boy (Tobey Maguire) and the Carver family, which consists of two parents (Sigourney Weaver and Jamey Sheridan) and two boys (Elijah Wood and Adam Hann-Byrd). It is mainly through the interactions between these families that the story progresses; Kevin Kline is having a purely sexual affair with Sigourney Weaver, which leads to suspicion and later jealousy from Joan Allen. At the same time, Christina Ricci is 'experimenting' with Elijah Wood and later his younger brother, which leads to protectiveness from her father etc. From this tight bond between the eight central characters, we are able to see why the characters do certain things, we see that it is their insecurities that drive them, usually to hypocrisy and it is this character study that makes The Ice Storm a good film. Due to the number of characters, and the relatively short running time of the film, it is impossible for them all to develop fully and for us to get to know all of them, and because of the way the relationships are shown, it makes the film seem deeper and more complex than it actually is. Two years later, a similar format to the one seen in this movie would be used to a much better effect; in a film called American Beauty. This predecessor never reaches the highs of that film.Ang Lee has assembled himself a marvellous here. Kevin Kline is an underrated actor who always gives a good performance, as he does here. Sigourney Weaver is ultra-seductive mode, and this is probably the sexiest she's ever been in a movie. Joan Allen is sultry as Kline's wife, but her performance is believable and she brings a great life to the movie. Meanwhile, on the younger side of the cast, Christina Ricci impresses very much as the smart and curious young lady of the film. She's a beautiful actress, and one with talent too. Her performance is the standout of the film for me; she's the most real and the most enticing by far. Despite being a big fan of Spider-Man, I've always found Tobey Maguire to be annoying. He's annoying here too; he has talent, but he's very annoying. Elijah Wood is as turgid as ever in this film. He would, of course, go on to become a 'big thing', but it's clear to see that he's rubbish, from this film and his later performances. As he would later show with Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon; Ang Lee has a great directorial flair, and he shows it off here. The film is also supremely well written and there isn't a line that appears out of place for the character that speaks it. This allows us to get to know the characters and that is what you need to do in a film of this ilk. The Ice Storm is overall a good film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After being highly recommended to me, I sat through this film wondering what the whole attraction was. Yes, this film is good. It is technically superb, the mood evocative and the period detail sublime. However, all the characters, save that of Tobey Maguire's (perhaps) are repulsive. All in their own way are self-absorbed and ultimately selfish. Now, I have been accused of being both those things in my life, but I have to say that if that is indeed the case, I can't hold a candle to these characters. They are unrelentingly awful people, and not in an "interesting nihilist Russian kind of way" either. Weaver's bored housewife is perhaps the ultimate ice-queen, but those around her are just as unworthy of any respect as she. Sure, the performances are great, particularly Kevin Kline's, but without any sympathy for its characters this film becomes a sterile and bleak experience. Watch this by all means, it is a well crafted film, but its subject and characterisations are as cold and unfulfilling as the titular ice storm.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Angst is boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie reminded me of European 60s art films where everyone has lots of sex and are bored and miserable. Most people I know would be very happy to be rich, attractive and having a lot of great sex. I kept thinking when I watched the actors moan and groan, not in ecstasy, but in misery, "Get a life, you rich, spoiled people! One of your kids could be autistic, you could have a terminal illness or be unemployed. Get over it and volunteer at a homeless shelter. You'll feel much better."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful but pointless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ang Lee's underplayed style and attention to detail are simply breathtaking. However, despite this being a story well told, it's just not worth the telling.The biggest failing is that the characters are underdrawn and uninvolving. They're so angst ridden and generally miserable that I just can't bring myself to care about what happens to any of them. This is in contrast to other Ang Lee films: Sense and Sensibility (lots of dialogue), Eat Drink Man Woman (exquisitly expressive acting), and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (sympathetic stereotypes that don't need a lot of dialogue to explain).Also, Kevin Kline is badly out of place, in stark contrast to the otherwise splendid cast. He is an enjoyable actor in fluff or stagey pieces, but is far too hammy to (under)play serious drama. To be fair, he helps to prevent the film from becoming too maudlin too quickly, but he seems unable to lay his upstaging instincts aside towards the end. More can often be less, Kevin.The same goes for the pointless voiceover by a character who isn't even central. This seems Bladerunner-like, and I can't help but wonder if it was tacked on afterwards. The music also strays a little towards the orchestral once or twice, rather than the sparse breaks that Ang Lee prefers. This spells post production nervousness, much as the casting of Kevin Kline might indicate the chill hand of commercialism forcing unfortunate compromises on a director who can demonstrably do better given decent material, talent and a free reign.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great and overlooked genre movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not really sure why this movie got pretty much ignored, at the time of its release. Not just by the movie goers, which is perhaps somewhat understandable but more so by all of big award ceremonies. By all means this movie should had swept a couple of them and it truly earned some more recognition.Drama's normally aren't even really my kind of thing but I just got captivated by this movie and was really liking it. Guess the main reason why I like it was because it wasn't being a pretentious or melodramatic one and it deliberately kept things small, which gave the overall movie also a sense of realism to it.For me it was a movie about people in search of themselves. Basically all of the characters are unhappy with their current situations and are searching for ways to break out and to get more in touch with themselves. This goes for the movie its youngster, which also makes this a sort of coming of age movie but also for their parents. Every character goes through some sort of inner transitions and the movie does a great job at balancing it all out.Basically everybody has a fair share of screen time in this movie. There aren't really one or two main characters but more like five or six of them. Every storyline is about as equally interesting and good to follow as the other. At least in my opinion of course. I personally got grabbed by it all, also since it isn't really being a standard drama, that is being predictable to watch from start till finish.It's also a movie that is being made great and intriguing to watch by its cast-members. It truly has an impressive cast-list, with actors such as Kevin Kline, Joan Allen, Sigourney Weaver, Tobey Maguire, Christina Ricci and Elijah Wood, among many others. A cast to kill for and everybody did a great job, playing their character.A really overlooked Ang Lee movie, that is definitely worth checking out!8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another interesting mood piece from Ang Lee...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The icy atmosphere of THE ICE STORM is a metaphor for the icy relationships of two families living through the '70s in a middle class Connecticut neighborhood. Both families are rather dysfunctional with the adults and minors unable to establish a meaningful rapport.KEVIN KLINE and JANE ALLEN are particularly convincing as the parents whose marriage is definitely on shaky ground once he starts having an affair with a restless female neighbor (SIGOURNEY WEAVER), whose husband is away so often that his own kids don't even know when he's gone.Their son, TOBEY MAGUIRE, is the pivotal viewpoint for the youngsters, off to New York City to party with some friends but making the trip back to Connecticut at the height of the ice storm. All of the characters are similarly effected in some way by the storm, but unfortunately none of them really come as alive as the wintry landscapes. The cinematography is gorgeous, depicting the icicles glittering on branches and frozen patches of land.The production values are terrific, but the fault lies in the film's slow pacing and the lack of sufficient interest in the mostly unlikeable characters.Visually, it's a treat with some wonderful photography--but most of the characters are as cold and remote as the winter landscapes. It's not easy to care about any of them. Their emotional distance from each other is so apparent that it alienates the viewer from caring about them. But Kline and Allen do a terrific job as the parents most affected by the storm and its consequences.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well-played but voyeuristic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is it well-acted? Yes. Is it well-played? Yes. Is it representative of real life? No. It is hollyweird's idea of what middle-class life is because they do not experience it. The movie is cynical and more like science-fiction than drama. But, it is engrossing and well-acted. Ang Lee is the king of depressing cynicism. The movie is highly voyeuristic and cannibalistic in its view of everyday life. But, I cannot fault the intention -- it accomplishes what it sets out to accomplish. So, in that context, it is excellently portrayed. However, only watch it if you have a fatalistic view of your neighbors. The comparisons to "American Beauty" have some credence but "Ice Storm" lacks a sense of humor about itself. This is a movie mistake -- wherein the director takes the material too seriously as if it were an ultimate truth. Good movie, bad taste in the mouth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Should Have Been Much Better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, I'll say that this might have had a more positive impact if I'd seen it in a theater. The people who loftily announce that they never go out to movies since getting a DVD obviously don't have children, dogs, cats, or phones.THE ICE STORM takes place over Thanksgiving weekend when America was in the throes of Watergate. To understand why nobody is nostalgic about the 1970's, just watch this film and check out the clothes and hairstyles. Through much effort, Sigourney Weaver actually looks unattractive. Now that took work. She's one of the most beautiful actresses in American films. Never mind that she'll be 59 in October, she's a great looking woman.In this film you have smoking, drinking, drug use, adultery, and in the second act we see what passes for an orgy among white suburbanites. Several characters attend a "key party" where the husbands put their car keys in a bowl and the ladies draw keys and pair off for the evening with their owner. Sort of like Tupperware parties, but with men as souvenirs.But we don't feel guilty about watching this because none of the characters have any fun doing it. This is what a porn movie would have been if Cotton Mather had written the screenplay.If characters are going to misbehave, let them do it with the glee of the movies Russ Meyer directed. Darn, are those ever coming to DVD?THE ICE STORM has so much going for it. Great actors and direction. Tremendous photography. Great musical score.But I kept hoping that Cher would walk over from the set of MOONSTRUCK and start slapping people and tell them, "Snap out of it!"Because these people are so self-absorbed, they don't use common sense. At the end of the second act an important secondary character is accidentally electrocuted by fallen power lines. Kevin Kline's character finds him lying beside the road late at night. In the next scene it's full daylight and Kline has put him in the car and driven not to an emergency room but to his house.One nice thing about THE ICE STORM is that it celebrates tall actresses. Joan Allen, 5'10"; Sigourney Weaver, 5'11"; and Allison Janney, 6'00" although you should never call a lady six feet tall- instead your should refer to her as being 5'12".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The previous review here is a comprehensive one but I'd like to add my few pennies' worth as there are some things not mentioned.What elevates this film above others in my opinion is the complete absence of historical context and the music. The film is apparently set in America in the 1970s to judge by accents and fashions and yet, unusually for period films, contains practically no familiar historical references at all. This may be because I'm from the UK but a few other things makes me think not: the score for the film is oriental (there is no period music) and the film has a startling lack of scenes outside the confines of the small suburban world viewed.I feel with that this lack of context, lack of landscapes and unusual music, the director wanted to do two things. Firstly, imbue the film with a sense that the subject matter was not tied to the place or the generation and, secondly, to leave the viewer both feeling claustrophobic and imprisoned in the place and at the same time disoriented and disconnected from it, a very adolescent perception.I may be way off mark with all this pretentious drivel but, hey ho, it is still a great film. Really. 10/10 is a bit far though - it doesn't have any explosions in it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of my favourite films ever. I absolutely love the feel of it, wonderful 60s/70s feel, wonderful performances from Sigourney Weaver, Elijah Wodd, Kevin Kline, Christina Ricci and Tobey Maguire (And Katie!). Loads of my favourite actors. i love the honesty of it, it seems real to me, the awkwardness of the teenagers and their budding sexuality, I really believed this film. I don't agree that Tobey Maguire is too blank faced or that Katie Holmes would never have had him in her house, s'not true. Tobey is a great awkward teenager, and I can imagine exactly that situation occurring, in fact something like that has happened to me in the past on more than one occasion (with myself as the less attractive teenager!). I love the reality of the rejection of the better looking kid (as happens to Elijah Wood). I am such a fan of Elijah Wood, I really hope playing Frodo the Hobbit has not typecast him too much as a comedy fantasy character in everyone's minds, he's also great in The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Not that I dislike his performance as Frodo - I think it's great - I just know that will put loads of people off him. Do watch this film!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film, The Ice Storm, explores marital infidelity, adolescent irresponsibility and political changes with the Watergate incident, signifying not only is the climate changing outside but also in the wealthy suburbs of Connecticut and politically changing in the United States. 'The Ice Storm', takes place in 1973, in the New Canaan, Connecticut, as the storm is approaches within the city, several storms are taking place in the lives of the Hood and Carver family. Ben Hood is having an affair with his neighbor, Janey Carver. His wife Elena Hood is a shoplifter, who is being hit on by a longhaired minister, named Philip Edwards. The Hood kids Paul, Wendy, and Ben and Mikey Carver explore sex, drugs and other adolescent behaviors. The adults goes to a wife swapping party where men put their car keys in a bowl, and the women fish out a pair of keys and go home with the owners of the set. During the storm Mikey Carver decides to adventure outside without caution on to the slick and hazardous surface where dangerous power lines have fallen, causing an electrocution. Reality finally sinks in and the families realize their families are the most important in their life. The title 'Ice Storm' along with some other words in the movie had double meaning. For example, the storm represents the atmosphere of the climate, and it represented the storm in the family lives. The cracking of the trees was a metaphor of the cracking of the family. When you choose to venture out into the ice storm you could fall from the slippery surface, and the people in the film who choose to venture out into irresponsible behavior fall in drugs, sex and even death. Although the ice storm looks beautiful, the surface areas become slick, tree limbs grow heavy and crack under pressure and fall on power lines causing destruction. Adults are cracking under social pressure by cheating on their spouses, drinking alcohol, and doing drugs causing break down and destruction in the family, example spouse cheating, Janey Carver, ' Ben, you're boring me. I have a husband. I don't need for another one.' The parents do not really have an open line of communication with their kids. For example, Jim Carver: 'Hey guys, I'm back!' Mikey Carver, 'You were gone?' The kids are also into their own adolescent behaviors. Wendy Hood, 'I'll show you mine if you show me yours'. I did not like the movie, 'The Ice Storm'. My initial response was it was very weird and the ending was depressing. I found it strange for married couples to be wife swapping so openly. The parents were having affairs and spending very little time with their children. Wendy Hood tried to discuss the Watergate issue with her parents and they show very little interest in her conversation. The only fun the kids seem to be having was experimenting with sex and drugs. They all seem to hurt people they love and take for granted what is most important in their lives. The parents and the kids experimented with drugs, but for the 1970's, this seems to be politically accepted. The author made a great choice for the title of the film, 'The Ice Storm'. He really makes you think about your own life, your own choices and the consequences that may occur from your choices, when storms of life are raging.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie takes place Thanksgiving 1973, in the small town of New Canaan, Connecticut. There are two families, the Cavers and the Hoods. At first glance the families are a stereotype of a suburban family living in an upper middle class neighborhood. There is nothing special or out of the ordinary about these families. The film just shows each individual's faults and how it affects the people that surround them. Initially, the movie seems boring. Being so accustomed to fast action movies, the slow pace this one take to develop leads you to believe nothing is really occurring between these two families. There is no hasty music or scenes; on the contraire it's slow and relaxing.At the surface, the father, Ben Hood, is a man of good hart, has difficulty expressing his real emotions and needs. During the whole film he tries to 'act' as a father, husband and neighbor. The mother, Elena, finds her self feeling empty seeking guidance in a 'Self Help Book' and questioning her spirituality. Her daughter, Wendy 14years of age, and son, Paul a 16 year old, try to commence their sexual life.Skin deep, things are very different. Families are becoming self destructive. Ben tries to drown his unhappiness with alcohol while he carries an unsatisfying affair with his neighbor's wife, Janey Caverns. Elena behaves as she knows nothing of the affair. She continues to act her role; simultaneously she grows bitter and angry. Wendy and Paul are caught in the middle of their parent's instability. Wendy expressed her discontent with the world by being verbal and rebellious, steeling, smoking, and exploring her sexuality with two brothers. Sam tries to find acceptance and heads to New York in search of a girl, socially and economically out is his reach.The night of the Ice Storm, everything changes in such a magnificent way. It begins with the scene were the Carvers son, Mickey, explains that when the temperature drops and it get cold, molecules don't move as much, making the 'air cleaner' as a simile . He suits up to explore the icy night and is sweep away in his exploration. As the storm develops, the air between each member is cleaned. By being forced to confront their inner feeling a spiritual freedom is found. Ben and Elena confront the affair and their unhappiness. The same nights Ben and Janey confront status of their affair and how unfulfilling it has become, putting an end to the relation. The same night Wendy loses her virginity with Sandy and the same night Sam confronts his feelings about sex with a woman learning how to deal with reject.All is clean again, but in order to appreciate all the thing that have occurred these families must experience real drama. That is when Ben Hoods discovers the lifeless body of Mikey on the street (he had been killed by an electrical line during his exploration). Ben takes the body to his parents house were every one, but Paul who is stuck on the train coming back from New York, is there. The shocking sight of a dead child brings everything into perspective. Latter, Paul's family arrives to the train station to pick him up. They are so relieved to see he is well, that Ben can not hold back his cry of sadness and happiness. This movie masterly represents the frigid emotional life of suburbia. The format of the movie, being slow and relaxing fools you to believe nothing is occurring. Just like these families who live their lives not appreciating the small things that surround them. By the time you become aware the movie is coming to an end, a shocking awakening of everything that had occurred hits you, making you rethink the whole film with greater appreciation while producing a fascinating emotional twist.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's a sadly fashionable tendency at the moment to dismiss films made in the 1970s as dated, often on no other grounds than their content, while fetishising modern movies that are set at that time. There's a certain arrogance in the viewpoint that people then did not know what was really important about their era, but that we do now; and regardless of which view history eventually confirms, it's hardly surprising that it is the supposedly dated originals that actually offer more demanding viewing than their contemporary competitors, wrapped in a comforting blanket of hindsight and nostalgia. In 'The Ice Storm', for example, we get a story of key parties, Action Men and Watergate; which, methinks, says more about us than it does about its characters.Ang Lee has proved an adept director in many genres, but aside from the predictably retro feel, 'The Ice Storm' has other limitations. Everyone (not just an exceeding young Christina Ricci) and everything looks beautiful: there's none of the authentic grime of a film by Mike Leigh or Ken Loach; while, closer to home it lacks the quirky vitality of Hal Hartley's early takes on American suburban life. There's also little in the way of conventional plot, just a lot of heavy symbolism and a hint of reassuring moralism at the end. Overall it's quite a cold film, perhaps because none of the characters are really held responsible for their actions; but it echoes with the empty seriousness of Oscar material. Not an awful film; but Lee has done better elsewhere.</fullReview>

Outstanding adaptation of Rick Moody's novel about dysfuncitonal WASPS in New Canaan, Connecticut circa 1973 with telling, tragic yet heartfelt performances by all particularly Kline as a family man caught in a maelstrom of infidelity with cold fish Weaver (also ecellently dryly cruel), Allen in yet another patented (but equally effective) tormented spouse role, but it is Ricci who is the film's true center of pain/confusion and ultimately understanding of how the metaphorical ice storm envelops all (just as well as the literal one). Adapted by James Schamus and directed with detachment yet painful accuracy by Ang Lee. Think `Ordinary People' penned by John Cheever. Best moment: daughter Ricci and father Kline's walk in the woods and the heartwrenching fade-out at film's close.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good story which might be classified as more or less sociological, very good photography, the music slots in just right; most of the interpretations are more than acceptable; but ???.With all those `cute kids' (Maguire, Ricci and Wood) in the middle of all those big names (Kline, Weaver, etc), one might be tempted to believe that something super special is in line. Not so, I am afraid to say. The individual performances are quite good, even very good; even Sigourney Weaver comes up with the only rôle I consider to be worthy of her since `Gorillas in the Mist'. What might be wrong, perhaps, is that as this film tends to be allocated the sociological ticket, it misfires somewhat: the promise is there, but the characterization is rather shallow, so that you are left with expecting more. I would have liked to have seen more depth in the main characters, rather than having more and more players. I will not cite Ang Lee as being the cause of the failure to connect; he is a proven director. However, I cannot help feeling that a European director might well have enhanced credibility with a subtler hand.I would like to know how in Connecticut it can be pouring with rain during a freeze-up? If the temperature is below two or three degrees Celsius, it may well snow, but it is impossible to rain, at least according to my old sciences school-book. At least this film convinces me far more than `American Beauty'. It has more interesting points to tell and the interpretations are far better, more real. I shall have to see this one again sometime, but dreading seeing more flaws than those I have already noticed. Slightly over a six on my scale.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>CAUTION -- MIGHT CONTAIN A SPOILER OR TWO --The "Ice Storm" is set in 1973, in Connecticut, and the main protagonists are two families who live within walking distance, each with two teen-ish children. Kevin Cline and Joan Allen play one set, while Sigourney Weaver and Jamey Sheridan play the other parents. The children are played by Tobey Maguire, Elijah Woods, Christina Ricci, and a couple of others. I was a 20-something, married adult with children in the early 70s, and I certainly did NOT feel that this film represented that period very well, unless it was specific to New Canaan, in which case it did not have broad appeal anyway. The tone of the film was too dark, the characters too one-dimensional, for me to care about them. The party with "keys in the bowl wife swapping conclusion" did not seem realstic at all. The parents were entirely too permissive with their children. The film to me was too much of a dark caricature for me to enjoy it very much. So I give it a 6/10 rating, because it was well-filmed, and has an all-star cast. Other films which carry a theme of family dysfunctionality, which I think are better and which I rate higher are "The Nephew(98)", "My Life So Far(99), "The War(94)", "A Map of the World(99)", and "Eve's Bayou(97)", just to name a few. I can acknowledge that some viewers feel this is one of the best films they have seen, but for me it mostly falls flat, and my attitude at the end, after the boy is electrocuted and the father is bawling while the mother sleeps, "So what?"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Major Disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rented "The Ice Storm" with very very high expectations. I had just seen "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon", loved it, and wanted to see some more of Ang Lee's works. I had always had a lingering interest in the film after seeing Gene Siskel rank it #1 on his top 10 list for 1997. So I rented it, watched it, and am experiencing a feeling of disappointment no other film has ever matched. To be honest, I didn't like this film at all. Yes, it was well-made; yes, it had a very talented cast who all seemed to pull off their roles competently; yes, Ang Lee did a fine directing job. However, something is definitely missing from this film. It doesn't seem like it was made for any reason other than to show a pretty accurate family caricature that serves to inspire sympathy and intrigue. I only felt pity for the characters, which is different from sympathy, as it seemed like they had no redeeming qualities I could identify with. The film in general is very depressing, and the salvation it suggests the members of the two families achieve at the end of the film feels contrived and without substance. It strives to be an "Ordinary People" or "American Beauty", but it just doesn't work. I mean, it's like "American Beauty" but without any of the excitement, heart, or inspiration- it is lifeless. Any message sent in the story only serves to further the storyline and explain why some things are happening, and there is nothing positive that can be taken from this film. Perusing reviews, I see that a lot of people felt this film was excellent, of the highest quality. Yet, I also noticed that no reason was ever given in the reviews for why the reviewer thought the film was of such high merit. What really makes films great is the personal feelings they inspire, and the praise I saw was all objectively-based. There is no way this film can be enjoyed by any viewer while watching it. I think that people who would bother to see this film(pseudo-intellectuals like me) saw it, weren't sure what to think of it, and gave it a rating of 10 because Ang Lee directed it, it's not mainstream, and it's critical of the fragile family intrastructure. I'll have to give this a rating of 6, despite my feelings about it. It gets as high as a 6 because the performances were good and there were some great camera shots. Plus it is important that films like this exist, despite my misgivings about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It left ME cold.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those "meaningful" films ... a series of vignettes of the polyestered '70s, and a confused storyline that never coheres enough to make sense the first time through. So, of course, we watch it again to see how our linear comprehension faculties have failed us ... just to find, after investing ANOTHER two hours into this jumbled mess, that the fault lies elsewhere. This film has value, but don't expect a traditional storyline. Sorry, but I like a feeling of fullness after a meal and after a film. Five out of ten for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frigidity Notwithstanding, there is Something About this Cold and Hard Look-In on Sexual Behaviors, Circa 1973. People's Personal Beliefs and Peccadilloes about Said Subject are Never that Interesting and Almost Always Embarrassing to Watch Unless the Observer is a Certified Voyeur.In this Movie Sex is the Thing in all Things and the Discovering of and Experimenting with are Laid Out for all to Intimately and Intensely View as the Cringe Factor Creeps in and Seeking a Place to Hide becomes a Way to Escape this Uncomfortable and Pointless Display of Less than Insightful and More than Common Knowledge about Carnal Knowledge is Presented as Profound and Artsy Cinema.Sure the Early Seventies was an Era that the Free Form and Uninhibited Behavior of the Baby Boomers Counter Culture Revolution was Finding its Way into the Shagged Living Rooms of Middle Aged Neurotics and into the Lives of Youngsters who hadn't come of Age in the Mid to Late Sixties. But......all this Seems more Interesting in the Mind and on Paper than in a Movie. An Ultimately Boring Movie that is Downbeat and Dull with a Septic Sensuality that didn't need an Ice Storm to stop the Molecules from Moving. They were already Stationary to Begin with and this is Like Staring at a Wall Void of some Really-Cool Posters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ang Lee directs this insight into the lives of married couples in suburban Connecticut coping with adultery, drinking, wife swapping and indifferent children. The versatile cast holds this stark story line together. Kudos to Kevin Kline, Sigourney Weaver, Joan Allen and special recognition to Katie Holmes and Christina Ricci. Holmes' sexuality stole the show for me and Miss Ricci is totally tremendous as a 14 year old seductress. Tobey Maguire and Elijah Wood were boring and lifeless or probably just miscast. Honesty can be harsh and life altering as this movie proves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Against the inevitable comparison, it was just okay.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps this isn't fair but I saw this film only after I had heard everyone and their mother say that American Beauty was a lot like The Ice Storm. Now to be honest I didn't go into this film expecting another film exactly like American Beauty but I did hope for something similar, you know a similar theme and a similar feeling when the film was finished. Sadly, I got none of that. And again maybe it is unfair to compare this film with what I consider to be the third best film ever made ( still behind my two all time best films, Jaws and JFK ) but American Beauty was everything that this film may have wanted to be but just couldn't. What I found lacked in the film was pretty much everything. There was nothing glaringly wrong with the film but nothing done extraordinarily well either. And for a studio to invest 18 million dollars into a film like this, you would think that first of all there would be a fair bit of marketing done for it ( I did not see this at the theater when it came out and I see everything that goes to the theater, I even saw Tea With Mussolini and Wing Commander, but this film was gone in about a week in Toronto ) and second, you would think that with a cast like this they would be able to spin a better tale with what they were given. Having said that, I did enjoy four performances immensely in the film. That being Christina Ricci as the young, sexually awakened daughter, a pre-Dawson's Creek Katie Holmes as Libbet's Casey, the young, wealthy vixen and the object of Tobey Maguire's lust, Elijah Wood as another young man learning about his sexuality and Joan Allen looking very sexy, worn out and confused all at once. But the problem with enjoying all of these characters is that I wanted to know more about them. I wanted to know more of their thoughts and not have to rely on my imagination to understand where they were coming from. There was some wonderful writing at times in the film, but there were also times when they could have expanded on what was happening. I mean, is less always better? In this case it isn't. So many times I was left wondering if that was all that was going to be said knowing full well in real life it never would have been left the way was in this film. If you found out your husband or wife was cheating on you, would you bitch about it for two minutes and then agree to go a party where the culprit was going to be? And then further more, would you, as the one who committed the offense spend a good portion of the party with the woman that you were sleeping with knowing that your wife knew who she was? I wouldn't. And there are just too many false notes in the film like this one for me to believe that this film was as deep and chilling as people make it out to be. American Beauty is hands down a more intutitive film in exploring the problems with marriage, teens, sexual angst and a plethora of other issues that both movies seem to dive into.The Ice Storm is interesting and it is good in a few ways, but over all it falls short of my mild expectations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of the thousands of movies I have seen, there are a select few I will remember for the rest of my life as being the worst movies I have ever seen. The Ice Storm tops this list. Nothing is good about it, and I'm sorry that I'll never get that two hours of my life back. I should have trusted my instinct and turned it off after the first 20 minutes of being mind-numbing bored. There are a lot of good actors, all of which the talent is completely wasted. Not one of the characters is likable, except maybe Tobey Maguire. Everyone is cheating on someone, and oh, yeah, there's an ice storm going on outside during the last half an hour of the film. We see one car go in the ditch, one branch fall, and one downed power line, is all it amounts to. Do yourself a favor and avoid this one. And to all you people giving this film a great review, HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MINDS?????!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classy and intriguing fable about the boredom of the middle-classes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a small, comfortable suburb of Connecticut several families live their lives around one another as friends. Both the Hoods and Carvers are friends and have children who are also friends. Ben Hood is also having an affair with Janey Carver, while Jim is distant from his family. Elena Hood suspects but herself is trapped in a sort of frozen emotional reality. Meanwhile their children are experiencing the same sexual freedom in the air as their parents ? neither of which seem ready for it or able to deal with it.Ang Lee has made a name for himself on the bad of repressed emotions and restrained expression but this is easily one of his finest films as it portrays the inability of two family units to cope with the "sexual revolution" they experience in their own neighbourhood. The plot is not so much about one narrative flow but about the characters within the story ? making it perhaps harder to make it work, but yet Lee does it. Making it look easy, he steps into a culture and a time that he never experienced himself and made me feel like he must have first hand knowledge of the period ? which I suppose is due in a big way to Moody's novel and Schamus' screenplay. The sense of boredom is palatable and the sexual pleasure that is sought out as a result is well delivered as "innocent fun" that ultimately taints at best and destroys at worst. It is a strangely old-fashioned moral fable that is as compelling as it is low-key. I have read those who bemoan the film for its cold air and slow pace but I can only see the very things they take issue with as being reasons why the film is strong.The cast is classy and mostly spot-on, which is just what is needed with a film that is about characters more than a "this happened then this happened" narrative. Kline shows a real subtle touch that I have rarely seen from him and he is strong in one of the key roles. Weaver perhaps dominates Allen because her character is so much larger, but I found the latter to be much more rewarding in her performance. Just as impressive than the adults (if not more so) are the child actors. Maguire, Wood and Hann-Byrd are all excellent but Ricci just steals it as a girl discovering the power her sexuality and using it. Ironically the teenager who went onto greatest fame is Holmes, who is also the least of those here and the least worthy of her fame.Overall this is a classy and intriguing film that is professionally made and impressive. Some may struggle with the narrative but for most viewers the characters and themes will be more than enough to fill the film. Ang Lee does it again and the cast are more than able to take the material and produce the goods.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not good (tiny spoiler included).</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was led to expect something really good from all the reviews I had read and heard and as a fan of Sigourney Weaver there was an added incentive for watching The Ice Storm. I wish I had remembered my experience of Alien Resurrection which also had rave reviews. I am reminded of Sturgeon's Law that 90% of everything is crap, which pertains so much to cinema (at least contemporary cinema). This film offered not one frame that was original. I was astounded that so lauded a movie could be so hackneyed - and so utterly dull. Sure, the characters were realistic and beautifully acted; but I don't want to pay to people-watch - I can stand around town and see more entertaining people. These lives were ORDINARY. They were ordinary, shallow, self-obsessed, self-opinionated everyday folks who interested me not one jot. Talk about a film that sagged in the middle - this one was on its belly from the beginning. It's a sad indictment that the only part that even remotely raised interest was Christina Ricci un-doing her jeans; and there was no pay-off then! Fabulous title; how clever! How ironic! NOT! Wasn't it beautifully filmed!? Perhaps (I say hesitantly), but to what end? If the viewer doesn't care for the characters, no amount of atmospheric cinematography is going to save the film. I was silently cheering that irritating weird kid that we were 'supposed to sympathise with' towards his oh so protracted and telegraphed demise. I knew that the sooner he was gone, I could go too. An obscenely pretentious, unoriginal waste of money. To think an average movie in America costs $40 million+ nowadays... yet I just wish I could get *my* money back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All that acting out is gonna lead to trouble!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Solemn movies which hope to expose the underside of human nature (like, say, "American Beauty") either intrigue audiences with their melancholy passages or simply put people off. Personal taste will have to determine where "The Ice Storm" falls. It certainly has a good cast of actors and an interesting production design. The picture had great possibilities, however both the central issue--how our carnal desires lead to trouble--and the answers we get are old news. There's the stifled housewife who dusts off an old bicycle so she can regain the freedom of her girlhood, the teenage daughter acting out what she doesn't see at home, the father having an affair with the neighbor. It plays out distressingly, like a familiar TV show. Although better than "American Beauty", "The Ice Storm", which takes place in 1973, makes obvious, rather redundant points against our culture (or, what was our culture), yet director Ang Lee is so overly-precise in his handling, he neglects to modulate the characters' behavior--and if this was intentional, he doesn't recognize the irony; he smooths over everything so all we have left to respond to are the performances. Christina Ricci and the ingratiating Tobey Maguire do the stand-out work; Kevin Kline, Sigourney Weaver and Joan Allen are reliable as always. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And who goes driving in an ice storm? Puhleeze!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This kind of nihilistic tripe should make all of us angry. I don't know anyone like any of these characters--they're so incredibly witless and boring and enervated--no one says or does anything clever, charming, optimistic, or plausible. Joan Allen apparently thinks that soulless nonexpression is great acting. God in Heaven, a person on Quaaludes reciting the Gettysburg Address could not have given a more sluggish performance. And what's with her character's stealing of lipsticks from the pharmacy? Utter nonsense! And Christina Ricci is the creepiest creepshow in movies. Every time I see her, I want to take a hot shower and go to confession. This movie reeks of pseudo-cynical anti-Americanism, a la J. D. Salinger and his vomit-inducing angst and neurotic bellybutton-gazing. Oh, and the voice-over tragi-profundities had me rolling my eyes and making gag-reflexes. This is supposed to be "really heavy, man." Well, it was nothing more than a college sophomore stoned on pot bought with Daddy's money. Ask yourself, Do any of these people have extended families, such as grandparents, aunts, uncles? No, they live in a Connecticut vacuum as remote from real people as the planet Pluto. Even the way the writer has them respond to the weather, for God's sake!, is devoid of correct human observation. Having lived through some major ice storms in my life, I can tell you that no one goes walking, let alone driving, in such weather. If you can't get right so simple a thing as how people react to weather, then there is no hope whatsoever that anything else is right. This, and everything else in this movie, rings false, false, false. And don't tell me the performances were good because they were "nuanced." The actors were sleep-walking throughout, allowing vacancy to masquerade as heart-felt acting. Find a smile here--I dare you. No, the closest you will come to is a smirk--everyone is just too cynical, don't you know. Life is just so empty. Love doesn't really exist. No one has pets or hobbies or a past or emotions or passion. This is just the droppings of a writer whose only writing ability consists of spelling words correctly.Now, on the plus side, the photography of the ice storm is first rate. But that's akin to saying "Other than that, Mrs. Lincoln, how was the play?" There just isn't any point to this drivel. The nineties, mercifully, are over, and so are movies like Ice Storm and American Beauty. They are embarrassing reminders of the moral bankruptcy of that period's art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dysfunction Junction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Suburban anomie turns deadly - deadly dull that is - in this adaptation of Rick Moody's tale of next-door neighbors discovering the jaws of life in 1970s New Canaan, Connecticut.There were three slice-of-life films set in the American 1970s made in the 1990s, split up chronologically and geographically as if by design. In reverse order, "Boogie Nights" covered the West Coast in the late '70s, "Dazed And Confused" central Texas in the mid-'70s, and this focused on the East Coast in 1973. "Ice Storm" aimed closest to where I lived, yet the film feels the furthest afield of any '70s I remember. There's no crunchy, funky, good-time neon-blue candy power-pop feeling coming off this baby. It's cold, emotionless, almost Scandinavian, and not in an ABBA-ish way.Thanksgiving, 1973. While the Watergate scandal consumes the country, the Hoods and Carvers hunker down for some holiday cheer, little imagining the storm brewing over their heads. When Ben Hood (Kevin Kline) and Janey Carver (Sigourney Weaver) aren't meeting for illicit sex, kids Mikey Carver (Elijah Wood) and Wendy Hood (Christina Ricci) do the same. Elena Hood (Joan Allen) alone seems to sense something seriously wrong, but is too locked into her own cocoon to do anything.The problem with "Ice Storm" isn't just that the plot, as it develops, feels a little too dire for the situation. The problem is it's hard to care. The characters aren't awful, not even Janey, despite Weaver's tarantula-lady wardrobe. They are simply inert and unsympathetic, living la vida coma with their prescription drugs and meaningless sex games.I want to totally align myself with Graham Deans Williamson's review from August 31, 2004: There's a lot of good things in this film that never come together, and not enough surface pleasure to make the medicine go down smoother.Director Ang Lee and screenwriter James Schamus make a point of hitting us over the head with the ice theme, it forever crackles in trays, rattles in glasses, and crunches beneath our feet. No metaphor is left unhammered, from the opening dissertation by older son Paul Hood (Tobey Maguire) regarding the comic-book heroes Fantastic Four as symbolic of family, "the closer you are drawn back in, the deeper into the void you go." When Wendy makes her move on Mikey, she wears a rubber Nixon mask, the ultimate symbol of corruption, although Lee and Schamus conversely take pains to present their pubescent explorations as the only thing about this life worth having.There are also the ridiculous contrivances, such as a "key party" where husbands and wives swap partners as if it is some casual New Canaan tradition, never mind the facts of how gossip about such a thing would have gone down the next day in the kind of uptight WASPy enclave we are presented with here. Much of the high drama at the movie's conclusion falls into this category as well."The Ice Storm" is the kind of film I wish I could like, having lived through the time period and remembering well the sense of society crumbling around me, along with the heady pleasure of unbridled kookiness. But if it had been in real life like it had been in the movie, I would have been better off kidnapped by the Symbionese Liberation Army. It's hard to care much when no one on screen does.</fullReview>

It wasn't particularly badly acted, but it didn't present anything that made me care about what was happening to the characters. I remember that most of the movie was drab and muted. Perhaps it was intentionally shot that way to relate to the mood. But to me that factor, along with joyless characters made me feel very detached and uninterested.

		<fullReview>Set in the 70's in suburban Conneticut, it centres on a family that is getting together during Thanksgiving. However this family and surrounding friends are far from normal. With the husband having an affair, the kids sexually experimenting (nothing to gregarious) and doing drugs, this family is not the only odd one on the block. The mistress's family is just as bizarre with 2 kids one, who I can only describe as a weirdo, the other socially inept and only seems to enjoy blowing up his toys. In the climax of the film during an ice storm the parents are all at a party in which everyone is suppose to swap partners, while the kids make their own mischief.This was a film that had a lot going for it, nice direction, a unique story, a GREAT cast, but it just did not happen. None of the characters geled or had any real emotion. The guard rail scene was particularly pointless cause I had no feeling for the characters involved up to this point (can't explain it or I'll give a key scene away). I am begging to wonder about the Kevin Kline theory:Kevin Kline - moustache - good movieKevin Kline - no moustache - bad movieKevin Kline does not have a moustache in this film. But this is not the only reason why this film is disapointing.Rating 4 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One step above 'A complete waste of time'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has a great cast, a very skilled director and crew but it was all for nothing. Ang Lee has directed at least two very good films (Sense and Sensibility &amp; Ride with the Devil) and two over-rated films (this waste of film stock and Crouching Tiger).The story takes place in suburbia but not any suburbia that ever existed except in someone?s bad acid trip. Not one of the characters is at all interesting to watch but it's not because at least one is somewhat sympathetic. Ms. Ricci's Wendy is a lost girl that you feel for but the rest of these characters are cardboard cutouts or wild exaggerations. At first, I thought that the movie was satire because it is so false but the film is not supposed to be a satire or some skewed version of Ms. Ricci's 'Adams Family' movies. The 'Adams Family' movies are more true to life than this movie. One note about actors--Ms. Holmes in a quick performance steals scenes from Mr. Maguire and the rest of the cast has done much better work elsewhere (see below). The cinematography of this film by Frederick Elmes is fantastic as is the production design of Mark Friedberg it is just a shame that it was thrown away on such a bad script. Rating 2 stars out of 10.If you must see, a movie by Mr. Lee rent ?Ride with the Devil? where Mr. Maguire shows that he can act. If you want a movie with Mr. Kline rent, ?Life As A House?, Ms. Allen and Mr. Maguire are Oscar material in ?Pleasantville?, Mr. Wood was good in ?Lord of the Rings? and Ms. Holmes shines in ?Wonder Boys?.</fullReview>

The characters don't really talk to each other; instead they seem to spend about half the time quoting their own character descriptions, and the other half reading crass psychology essays at each other (although I've heard real-life university psychology professors give more entertaining lectures than this film does).About the only scene missing from this story is the one where the dastardly villain ties the pretty maiden to the railway tracks in order to get the inheritance (or maybe I fell asleep and missed that bit!) It seems to contain nearly every other melodramatic cliché around, and then some!It's very frustrating watching talented actors with the range and personality of Kevin Kline, Sigourney Weaver &amp; Elijah Wood reduced to playing the sort of stock caricatures that practically any hack drama school graduate could walk through in their sleep (and usually do).</fullReview>

Funny how hollywood likes to make a big to-do about "shocking" social events like sex &amp; drugs, pretends it's making the Big Revelation about the Decadent Middle Class &amp; then comes out with something so sappy it looks like it was made by untalented high school kids. This is a TV sitcom with no laughs. I did learn one thing after watching this dog, however, Kevin Kline's worst nightmare has to be Kevin Spacey (and here I always thought it was Kevin Costner).</fullReview>

This movie went nowhere and ended up in the same spot....nowhere. If I had to say something decent about the movie it would be that the acting was okay and Katie Holmes looked fine. Other than that, this one was a bomb.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Movie is very slow and the background score is almost same for entire movie. The director makes us feel that something interesting is soon to take place but no such thing happens and the movie ends with nothing much to tell. The characters in movie don't express their feelings; sleeping with any one is forgived and all pretend that nothing happened. Movie has no life or should I say soul? I did waste my time watching this movie. background music is not good at all same music is used in different situations. characters have very less dialouges and only references pull the movie ahead. Director does not seem to be clear about start and end of movie, the character reading fantastic four and comparing with the movie theme is not impressive.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was filmed at my high school. St. Lukes in New Canaan Connecticut. In the class scenes several of the schools students were used in the filming due to them having long hair. Also the athletic fields were used and subsequently were damaged due to the equipment on the fields for filming. Also sigourney weaver was in the movie who was in ghost busters with bill Murray, Bill Murrays sons homer and Luke went to this school but were not in the film. There also were numerous locations in new Canaan used for other parts of the filming such as the pharmacy, train station, waveny park and other various locations. ALso the movie is set in during an ice storm but the movie was filmed during a warm spring and you can see the actors sweating during the scenes due to the weather.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Ice Storm" is movie that shows us the dysfunctional members of 2 families and their relationships. The story is set around Thanksgiving 1973 in suburban upper class Connecticutt in the midst of the Watergate scandal. This movie has been often compared to "American Beauty"; in all honesty Ameircan Beauty" is the movie "the Ice Storm" wanted to be but failed to. While this movie boasts of an excellent cast that includes Kevin Klne, Joan Allen, Sigourney Weaver, Cristina Ricci and oddly enough, Elijah Woods and the creepy kid from "Little Man Tate". While national politics may affect society's mood at times, can it really cause adultery, or swinging? Are these characters so spoiled with money and the good material things in life that they turn to deviant actions in order to satisfy their urges? While "American Beauty" shows us the complacency and boredomness of suburban life, "The Ice Storm" didn't create any connection to it's characters. Maybe there were too many. At moments, their motivations weren't explained. The adults seemed too casual about the swinging; are they ready to accept any counter-cultural trend without judging to it's after-effects? If the parents are strange, so are the kids. The motivations behind Cristina Ricci's actions are never explained. And yes, she is creepy in the Wedndesday Addams mold. If you want to see adults swinging try "Bob &amp; Alice &amp; Carol &amp; Ted".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a beautifully directed film and the story is basically sound enough, what there is of it. The cinematography is at a level you might well expect from a top director - extremely good. Lighting is excellent, the acting is excellent the scenery of the 1970 households is spot on. Everything is right and very well done.But my goodness, what a boring pointless film! I felt like I was watching a diluted daily soap opera. In soap operas they sometimes try to cram in a few crazy happenings now and again to wake you up. This movie was so slow, nothing seeming to happen and such events as would occur in the routine lives of anyone occurring here seemed to be more boring and uninterestingly portrayed than in real life. In this movie I felt no connection whatsoever to the characters on screen, they were surreal and there was nothing to especially like or dislike about them.Because of the director I continued to give the movie my full attention but I really feel that it is a movie for ladies only. I don't feel there is anything whatsoever in this movie to appeal to male moviegoers. It's like watching gossip happen.Not for me this one. If you can enjoy 1970's period pieces then you might enjoy it but for me it was like watching the Brady Bunch but without the humour and where nothing happens.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pretentious trash masquerading as "film" yet bordering on child pornography. If hell was a movie, this might be it. (Hey, maybe that's the point Ang Lee, artiste, is trying to make!)This movie has been compared to American Beauty and identified as a "real" picture of suburban life in the USA. How laughable! This movie is boring, stupid and unrealistic on many different levels, not least of which is the infamous "key" party.Tobey McGuire (?) looks like he wandered in off the set of Dead Poets Society. One wishes he would return to the cave with his comic book. It's always amusing to see Kevin Kline strut around showing off his fuzzy chest, but he portrays the biggest doofus I've seen him play since Sophie's Choice, or maybe The Big Chill. (I don't think he's acting.) Christina Ricci certainly has seen the endowments to her trust fund blossom since Mermaids, but she apparently is still stuck in Addams Family Values. Where was Lurch? Sigourney Weaver is about the only nice thing about this movie; that and the appearance of the closing credits. Oh yes, that elf from the Santa Clause shows up as a pot smoking freak. Bernard, shame on you! Shame on me for renting this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What an Unpleasant Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Suburban malaise is a subject that can make films fascinating ("Little Children," "Far from Heaven") or nearly unbearable, and "The Ice Storm," Ang Lee's screen adaptation of the Rick Moody novel, is unfortunately the latter.There are lots of emotionally constipated characters in this movie, all of them unpleasant, and I had a miserable time spending 2 hours with them. Movies like this have to be careful in giving you something or someone to care about, or otherwise the result is a bunch of overly-privileged yuppies whining about the same problems everyone else has.The impressive cast features Kevin Kline, Joan Allen and Sigourney Weaver, all of them wasted.Grade: C</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It works not</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you just take a "family comedy" and invert all the clichés you still don't have something worth watching.I'm amazed at how quickly some movies manage to be annoying: You know you're going to not like a movie when in the first scene a hollow-brained Kate Holmes mouths a 2-sentence idiotic summary of Dostojewski's "Brothers Karamasov".Every single scene, every sentence tries its hardest to be "different" - this is more disturbing than the movie trying to be disturbing...This is uninvolving and unbelievable from the first moment with the actors, directors and writers being unable to create something. Maybe it's just Ang Lee who evidently doesn't understand Western life. I guess the movie would work if it was set in Japan or South Korea.It looks like a patchwork of scenes which themselves could be moderately funny mini movies.I don't find the cast terrific, it is exactly the type of people you expect in such an attempt at "Darkness", "Europeanism", "Cynicism" or whatever it wants to be.This is probably for Americans who'd love to watch European movies from the 70s but don't want to read subtitles. It's really weird when Hollywood picks up something from the past and tries to re-do it.Uh...one final word on "politics". The Nixon era is repeatedly cited through inept means such as TV clips. Why...? So this is set in the early Seventies! Wow! Yeah! This makes the movie all the more good and credible and plausible! Right? Right...Check Beatty's "Shampoo" for useless references to the Nixon era that are supposed to give the movie an edge that it doesn't have.It's wishy washy just like all the stories in this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great production values, lousy movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The characters were extremely flat and unsympathetic. I didn't see an emotion expressed by any of them, unless it was lackluster depression. The characters were not developed. The film had good production values, nicely shot in a beautiful Connecticut village. But the story went nowhere. We watched this on cable and I frankly started to fall asleep and couldn't bear to finish watching it. And I wasn't even that tired, just bored to tears. I couldn't care about any of the characters, I couldn't identify with any of them. I kept waiting for something to happen. The best scene was when the daughter rode her bike through town. My own childhood was more interesting than this movie. Why this film has received so many high ratings is a real puzzle to me. It's got no magic, no interest and no emotion. By all indications the characters were going through some serious changes -- pubescent sexual experimenting, adultery, mid-life angst, but no one even raises their voice or gets excited about anything in the slightest. It's ridiculous. Pathetic. I hated this movie. This movie is like watching the walking dead, which maybe was the whole point or message of the movie?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How about being left in your seat shivering?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hope I can hold myself back from writing too much, as this movie doesn't deserve to be talked dead. There's another winning performance in one of the leading roles from 17-years-old Christina Ricci, playing a believable 14-years-old, a little girl lost who can act like a young seductress and thus eventually finds security. There is a quite high amount of erotic scenes involving teenagers in this film, which may make one worry, the line of good taste is not crossed, but what the picture does is suggesting very intensely what happens. It's an honest and - this is unique - fifty-fifty mixture of problems of adolescents with problems of adults in terms still having to grow up. Nevertheless, this mixture is getting boring eventually, but then - but I'll leave that for the last paragraph.All actors are good here, except for Tobey Maguire as Ricci's 16-years-old brother. He is too old for the role and his facial acting is too dull. Whereas Katie Holmes, who plays his love-interest with that strange name, Libbets, is outstanding. I like Joan Allen's performance which is very unobtrusive and very good as I like Adam Hann-Byrd's. His character looks strange and is strange, but he makes him very sympathetic. And I really like the caring shallowness of that Sigourney Weaver character. Almost great.In the final ten or fifteen minutes, you really come to feel that the movie was directed by an Asian man and not by an American. Because the movie changes into some brutal and merciless kind of poetry. It would be wrong and hardly feasible to describe what happens in these final scenes but they make you understand that there is more truth and more emotion in this movie than one can bear. Hardly one word is spoken during those ten minutes, but watching them you are sitting there, s h i v e r i n g and b r e a t h l e s s ! As far as I can see this movie is a rather difficult one to watch and the symbolic meaning of the ice storm in the movie is over-estimated. But my rating for "The Ice Storm" will be 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now, it's only been 12 hours since I screened "Ice Storm" and I gotta say the material falls surely into that slot in my brain reserved for material that is not disposable. "The Ice Storm" is soul source material that resonates in the long term, Cassavetes-style.The performances are A+, the art direction exemplary, the story a well -structured, multiply parallel progression presented with a high degree of tension generated by offscreen awareness of plot/character developments.This film IS pressure, temptation, collapse carefully dragging the viewer where you know you don't wanna go, but secretly can't help needing to find out the truth from the Truthteller, and you know you're gonna get the real magillah. Ugly, icky, and at times disturbingly stimulating (I shudder )."Ice" is like knowing there is going to be a serious accident on the highway at a particular road marker, you are compelled to go stand at the spot and watch it, then you can't turn away from the scene after the collision occurs.The only problem/issue that continues to come up in my analysis is the presence of the director's hand in all this. I am recognizing that what I think is missing or lacking is not a failure of the director, but is, rather a conditioned expectation of a non-descript cinematic element that I NEED to be represented. When something unique comes along with this level of cinematic skill and quality star value/performance, I apparently have this need to also feel an awareness of the filmmaker's consciousness in an overt sense."Ice" is NOT this. Ang transfixes the plot/story drama with covert control techniques that simultaneously disarm and dominate your conscious faculties , while skillfully cranking up the Emotionometer by creating a conscious, quasi-real time frame/spatial identity to this suburban nightmare. I have a deep respect for those special, few-and-far-between filmmakers reminding me that there is more than one way to direct a contemporary film.Beware, this is one that will stay with you for a long time...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ice Strom</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From director Ang Lee (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Brokeback Mountain), this is an entry in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You, I needed to see it again to see if I agree. Basically it is Thanksgiving 1973 in New Canaan, Conneticut, during the days when the Watergate scandal has unfolded with President Nixon as the most guilty involved. The story focuses on neighbouring families, the Hoods with husband/father Benjamin 'Ben' (Kevin Kline), wife/mother Elena (The Bourne Supremacy's Joan Allen), son Paul (Spider-Man's Tobey Maguire) and daughter Wendy (Sleepy Hollow's Christina Ricci), and the Carvers with mother Janey (BAFTA winning, and Golden Globe nominated Sigourney Weaver), husband/father Jim (Jamey Sheridan) and sons Mikey (Elijah Wood) and Sandy (Jumanji's Adam Hann-Byrd). The grown-ups are having troubles, Ben is drinking, in a dissatisfying marriage and having a not passionate affair with the bored Janey, Elena is also bored but unsure what to do about it, and Jim is hardly involved with his family. The youngsters are no different, Wendy is playing sexual games with a few boys from school and next door, Paul who sometimes uses drugs and compares life to the Fantastic Four comics is trying bed Libbets Casey (Katie Holmes), Sandy has a thing for Wendy, and Mikey has a thing for violence. The clear fact is that the two families lives all connect together in some way, and neither the parents or children of either clan communicate properly with each other. This may change when the cold weather comes along, and an ice storm forces the generations to face their problems head on. Elena does discover the affair between Ben and Janey, Wendy and Sandy do get close to each other, Paul looks forward to returning home after seeing Libbets, and tragedy strikes when Mikey is electrocuted resting on guardrail struck by a power line. In the end, the Hoods and Carvers have probably learnt some needed home truths with the devastating events adding to affect, but they try to pull together. Also starring Henry Czerny as George Clair. The casting of Kline goes against what you'd expect from him perfectly, Weaver and Allen I agree are the strong female characters, and the casting of young talents like Maguire, Wood, Ricci and even Hann-Byrd is fantastic. It is a good family based ensemble drama that really makes you feel something for each and every character, and the ice storm itself is well done as well, a very accomplished film that should certainly be seen. It was nominated the BAFTA for Best Adapted Screenplay. Sigourney Weaver was number 20 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars. Very good!</fullReview>

We`re all hypocrites in life but hypocrisy is only bad when committed by other people I won`t put the boot into THE ICE STORM too much . Unlike another well named movie THE BIG CHILL I didn`t want to throw something at the TV while it was on mainly down to the directing from Ang Lee who has assembled a very good cast many of whom like Elijah Wood and Toby Maguire are up and coming names and amazingly I found Sigourney Weaver dead sexy in this movieBut the basic problem is that no matter how well directed written or acted the film is there must be some compelling tempo and this is where THE ICE STORM fails</fullReview>
