		<shortDescription>The Hollywood Myth FOREVER Shattered !!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Until 1950, American films were strictly entertainment, some deeper than others. Studio executives were very protective of image and star-making. In essence, everything seemed perfect. Billy Wilder, Charles Brackett, and D.M. Marshman, Jr. created a stunning work of art that splits the Hollywood sign in two and exposed a dream factory for what it really is: a struggle to both gain and keep notoriety in the limelight. "Norma Desmond" and "Joe Gillis" are at opposite ends of this warped Hollywood mindset, with Gillis, played by that most cynical of actors, William Holden trying to pay the rent and Norma (Gloria Swanson) living a lie as a silent queen whose star burned "10,000 midnights ago". How a picture with such a snide look at the industry could come out in 1950 is simply mind-boggling, considering some of the light fodder that came out of Hollywood at the time. It has inspired many modern day disciples such as Altman's THE PLAYER, and Sonnenfeld's GET SHORTY, both of which took their vicious, hilarious parodies to the jugular of the movie capital of the world. SUNSET BLVD is the father of all socially oriented pictures regarding the movies and is by far the best.The images of this beautiful black and white powerhouse are fascinating and unforgettable: the dead writer floating in a pool, eyes wide open, looking right at us at the beginning; the eerie pipe organ that plays by the breeze in the middle of one of the most deep and dustiest sets ever; the funeral ceremony of the dead monkey in Norma's courtyard ("That must have been one important chimp. The grandson of King Kong perhaps." says Holden in a delightfully crisp and wise voice-over.) Holden pulls his car into a driveway off of the boulevard that will change his life forever. He is the emblem of the struggle to get notoriety. He has only a few B Movies to his credit. Swanson as Norma Desmond is the symbol of lost fame and has become the talk of legend. What is ironic about her character is that she may be playing herself in an odd way. She WAS an actual silent star whose career went down the tubes after the talkies came about. Her madness combined with Holden's last drop of naiveté combine to give us one of the most electrifying "give and take" between actors I've ever witnessed.Both lead parts were passed over by several actors. Holden was eventually forced into it as a contract player. How could you pass on such a script? Even "wax figures" (as Holden calls them) Buster Keaton, H.B. Warner, and Anna Q. Nilsson come to Norma's to play bridge, of course being Hollywood outcasts themselves, after the invention of sound in film. Some of the dialogue takes a swing at actual movies and people (GONE WITH THE WIND, Zanuck, Menjou). This must have brought the house down in Hollywood screening rooms throughout the town. Louis B. Mayer even condemned Billy Wilder for "ruining the industry". The film is sad and darkly humorous depicting the antics of Norma, who is quite insane, and Holden who is going along with what Norma is giving him, but has plans of his own. Another wax figure still alive and kicking in 1950 appears as himself in an important role. Cecil B. Demille, who once directed Norma/Gloria back in the silent heyday, tries to set her straight, telling her pictures have "changed". They had indeed, especially after this searing comment on celebrity status. I wonder if they knew what they were creating while making this gem.Scenes are shot right on the lot of Paramount Studios (even the front gate), and Norma's mansion is an unforgettable piece of history and gloom with a floor that "Valentino once danced on." There is so much to discuss, but little to enlighten you on how great SUNSET BLVD is without you seeing it. Just two years later, films began to crop up with the same tainted view of Hollywood, most with varying degrees of deception. SINGIN' IN THE RAIN, one of the all-time entertainments quietly had a nasty taste in its mouth regarding celebrity and the invention of sound movies. Watch these films closely and see the skeletons of the modern Hollywood bash films.RATING: 10 of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They Don't Make 'Em Like This Anymore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is such a great film on so many levels I can't really settle on where to begin. It is so beautifully shot (in that stark black/white that only nitrate negative could achieve), has a witty, clever and extremely well-written script, features some of the best acting in film's history, acrobatically balances the main plot/subplots with expert precision, contains some of the best characters on celluloid, has many true-to-life parallels (Swanson's career/real life cameos/DeMille's involvement/etc) and is peppered with such great dialogue/narration that today's film writers should take note. If that weren't enough, there's even a cameo by silent film great Buster Keaton (among others).One of the most appealing aspects of this film is how, in the story, an aging, forgotten star is trying to recapture a bygone era (the silent film era). What's interesting is that now, so many years later, we're looking back at her looking back. To present day viewers, Gloria Swanson of the 1950's is a long forgotten lost gem and to experience her own longing for the 1920's is especially captivating (and a little chilling, I might add). I don't think this film could have had that same effect when it debuted and maybe this added dimension holds so much more appeal for today's audiences. We all know that nothing lasts forever, but we don't often consider the abandoned participants; much like the veterans of a past war.In response to the famous Swanson line (while watching one of her silent films): "...we didn't need dialogue; we had faces", I'd like to also add that they "didn't need movies; they had films."They truly don't make them like this anymore. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Billy Wilder masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have yet to see a Billy Wilder film that I haven't loved, and Sunset Boulevard is definitely one of those films. It's interesting to watch the film during different times in one's life ? when I was a child watching this film, I thought the story was good and that Norma Desmond (Swanson) was a pretty scary lady. In my teens/college years, I appreciated it as a certified classic and for its commentary on Hollywood. Now, in my late 20's and early 30's I found it to have a different impact on me ? I was saddened by Desmond's mental illness, and when she makes her final descent down her staircase and utters her famous line as the camera pans the faces of the people around her, so full of pity, and the care her butler/ex-husband takes to make sure she's happy for maybe the last time in her life made more of an impact on me than any other time in the 20-odd times I've seen this film. There are only a small handful of central characters in Sunset Boulevard and they are so richly written that this film will remain timeless. There are not a lot of `dated' themes in this film ? the circle of life that is Hollywood isn't going to be much more evolved in 2050 than it was in 1950. If you haven't seen this film, watch it because there is something for just about anyone in this film.--Shelly</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very brave look at Hollywood when Hollywood was bullied by an absurd censorship.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Usually, Cinema is considered as the most delicate form of art because it has the biggest potential to become 'dated' one day. Once a movie thought as 'mind-blowing' can easily become a 'turkey' a decade later.This is not the case here. Sunset Boulevard still remains as one of the most eerie film in the cinema history and still a realistic depiction because of its reflection of Hollywood. It can give you the idea of the dream land's transformation into a nightmare.The film is about a troubled script writer 'Joe Gillis and a forgotten silent film star Norma Desmond's weird relationship and the madness that surrounds them and the people around them. Don't wanna give much of the plot, on account the fact that it is a pure gem that should be invented without knowing nothing. But I can talk about the cinematic aspects of this movie.This movie has some very eerie moments because of using a great cinematography. The moments of burying the dead monkey and watching the old film of Norma Desmond are exquisitely presented. The movie has some one of the most innovative scripts of cinema and that is certainly justified by the unforgetable and memorable lines captured from the film. The directing is top-notch but who are we kidding it is Billy 'the great' Wilder. The end of the movie is one of the most chilling part of the movie and it can truly give you some nightmares about insanity. The narration of the movie by the head character was probably done by this movie at the first place and this influenced so many movies afterwards.One of the reasons that this movie is still not dated is because of its courage. The Hayes code was at its peak at the beginning of fifties which manipulates the producers to limit their bad thoughts on one subject, especially on Hollywood. The movie got 11 oscar nomination but only got 3 of them. Apparently, the reason was its harsh criticism on Hollywood.There are some arguements about Sunset Boulevard's genre. It is considered as the greatest film-noir of all time. I don't think it is a film-noir at all. For some aspects, the movie has some noirish elements such as the black and white German-expressionist cinematography and an 'on the edge of insanity', femme-fatale but these two are not enough to make a film-noir. I think this is a psyhcological drama with some horror(the end is horrifying for me) and with some very very dark comedy.Overall, This is truly a classic and one of the best movies of cinema history that will never lose its effects on cinema. Heavily influences American Beauty and Mulholland Drive, also making those movies a must see. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Performance in Film History: Gloria Swanson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot has been discussed at length in other comments.To me SUNSET BOULEVARD has it all. The comedy is sly, the drama is of epic proportions because it's not JUST a story about Hollywood or an aging actress. It's really about the giving up of dreams.Norma's dream of return, held to for 20 years, is ironic because Norma so closely parallels Gloria. That Norma cannot make a comeback in 1950 even with connections to DeMille is sad. The sadness is due to Norma's refusal to accept her aging or the politics of Hollywood that worship youth. It's ironic that Norma has no place in Hollywood (the parade has passed by) but DeMille is still working and in the scenes from Samson and Delilah we spot other old-timers like Henry Wilcoxon and Julia Faye--still working but not as STARS. The final irony here is that Gloria did make the comeback that Norma couldn't make.Norma has a thing about STARS.... she says at one point... "the stars are ageless." Well this is true in a filmic sense. I can still watch Gloria Swanson in THE LOVE OF SUNYA or MANHANDLED and yup, she is ageless. She is still twenty something. That screen image is forever held up like a bad mirror to the reality of being 50. On another occasion Norma says "nobody leaves a STAR, that's what makes one a STAR." True again, but it's not just Gillis who is leaving Norma, her fans have already left. Hence if one is left, one cannot be a STAR.Gillis also gives up his dream (temporarily) of being a writer, Max gives up his dream of directing, and even Betty gives up her dream of love with Gillis. Scary stuff.The film is also about LOVE. Look what these people have done for love: love of another person or love of fame or whatever. Max loves Norma. Norma loves Gillis. Gillis loves Norma and Betty. Betty loves Gillis and Artie. Artie loves Betty. And all of them love Hollywood.Everyone is crushed at the end of this film..... The scene of Max "directing" the scene as Norma descends the staircase is one of the all-time great scenes in a film. Norma's final speech, which sums up everything ("there is nothing else"), is devastating. Can she really be insane and make this lucid speech? If she's NOT insane then she has knowingly killed Gillis to prevent his leaving her (a STAR)....... Also the shots of Max blinking away tears as Norma descends (supposedly into madness) and also of Hedda Hopper crying are equally as devastating as Norma's speech about "being back" and "all those wonderful people out there in the dark" (which of course includes us every time we watch the film).I cannot think of any other film (possibly CITIZEN KANE) that works on so many different levels. And Gloria Swanson gives the greatest performance in film history!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better Late Than Never</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although this movie was made 8 years before I was, I saw it for the first time yesterday and I was blown away! I have spent my life missing what has just become one of my favorite movies of all time.The acting was superb, the storyline riveting and the characters were people you could care about. Max was my personal favorite. There was a quiet, tragic dignity to him. I expected something to be revealed about him but was not prepared for the truth.I've always liked William Holden but my experience with Gloria Swanson was limited to her brief role in "Airport 75". I will now look for more movies by her. What an expressive face.It was fun to try to recognize some of the old time actors that were portraying themselves. An all around excellent movie. One I truly regret having waited this long to see. But it is definitely a case of better late than never.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every time I go to L.A., which isn't too often, I look at these palm-bemused, once smart stucco facades, and wonder if a Norma Desmond from a later era might be hiding from the world inside them, buttressed by cable TV (AMC or TCM, no doubt), a poodle named FiFi or Sir Francis, walk-in closets full of leopard-print Capri pants that haven't fit in decades, and a world class liquor cabinet that has seen heads of state under the table on a good night. It is because of Sunset Blvd., for certain, that my mind could ever go there. It is one of the most indelible films you will ever see.This film is great for many reasons, not the least of which is because it is Hollywood's first look back at itself. In the milieu of this film, the silent era is only 22 years behind us. The people left behind by the rush to sound can still palpably TASTE the fame, the accolade, that particular past being not so very dim and distant. The sadness of their lives was real, and at that point in history, all around, if hidden. Way more has been made of the supposed "savagery" of this film vis a vis the faded star than I think exists now, or ever did. The often cynical Wilder is deeply in touch with the tragic here, as much as the grotesque.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie deserves all the accolades it has gotten here, as well as "Maltin's" four stars. It certainly ranks up there as one of Hollywood's greatest achievements. Seeing it again only reinforces my opinion that William Holden was one of the truly great actors of the last [!] century. Gloria Swanson, however, steals every scene she's in; you can't turn away from watching her, even though she makes you really uncomfortable - it's like watching a train wreck. I don't know if the black &amp; white was an economic or an artistic choice, but the film would never have been as effective in color. The opening shot - the floating, dead body of Joe Gillis, eyes wide open, shot looking up from the bottom of the pool - is one of the great shots, and an unforgettable opener, matched perfectly by the unforgettable closing closeup of Norma Desmond. To have Cecil B. deMille actually play himself was an inspired touch. Throw in Eric von Stroheim and you have an unbeatable combination. Truly one the all-time must-see films, although I don't know how to classify it - film noir? black comedy? Hollywood fable ? horror story? psychodrama? Who cares; just see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true Hollywood horror story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hack screenwriter Joe Gillis (William Holden) accidentally falls in with faded screen legend Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson). She lives in a crumbling old mansion with her butler Max (Erich von Stroheim). She refuses to believe that she's no longer remembered and will never make another movie. She gets Gillis to stay with her and rewrite "Salome" which she thinks will be her comeback. Gillis has no other choice and things slowly get out of hand.A VERY cynical view of Hollywood--especially for 1950. It shows what Hollywood does to people like Norma--it makes them stars, tells them that they're great and dump them coldly when they're no longer needed. It also takes swipes at directors, agents, screenwriters, even entire studios! It has a tight quick script, is appropriately filmed in gloomy black and white and is masterfully directed by Billy Wilder. Everybody thought this was a bad idea when it was being made. It was believed to be too cold and vicious for the public. Also Holden was warned it would ruin his career by playing a younger man kept by an older woman. But it turned out great and is now rightfully considered a classic.The acting is almost all good. I never thought Nancy Olson was that good. Her character is too pure and sweet to be believable. Everybody else is right on target though. Holden is just great in his role. You see the pity, anger and helplessness on his face when he realizes Norma is falling in love with him--and he's trapped. von Stroheim was equally good as Max who encourages Norma's delusions. Swanson however is just magnificent! She has a very showy role and could have overplayed it--but she doesn't. She's mad for sure--but you only see it peeking through every once in a while. When she loses it completely at the end it's frightening. If she had played it like that all through the movie it never would have worked. How she lost the Oscar that year to Judy Holliday for "Born Yesterday" is beyond me. This is a must see and a true Hollywood classic but VERY cold and cynical. A 10 all the way."I am big--it's the pictures that got small". "All right Mr. deMille--I'm ready for my closeup".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Bitter and Tragic Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Hollywood of the 50's, the obscure screenplay writer Joe Gillis (William Holden) is not able to sell his work to the studios, is full of debts and is thinking in returning to his hometown to work in an office. While trying to escape from his creditors, he has a flat tire and parks his car in a decadent mansion in Sunset Boulevard. He meets the owner and former silent-movie star Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), who lives alone wit her butler and driver Max von Mayerling (Erich von Stroheim). Norma is demented and believes she will return to the cinema industry, and is protected and isolated from the world by Max, who was his director and husband in the past and still loves her. Norma proposes Joe to move to the mansion and help her in writing a screenplay for her comeback to the cinema, and the small-time writer becomes her lover and gigolo. When Joe falls in love for the young aspirant writer Betty Schaefer (Nancy Olson), Norma becomes jealous and completely insane and her madness leads to a tragic end."Sunset Boulevard" is a bitter and tragic masterpiece of the genius Billy Wilder that exposes how Hollywood uses people and forgets them when they get old and are considered decadent by the industry. Further, it also shows the consequences of the lack of adaptation of a former star to the end of a successful career, being forgotten by fans and the industry, and the price that some persons accept to pay to join this business. The last time I saw this film was on 22 September 2002 and even having watched "Sunset Boulevard" for maybe five or six times, I still get excited with most of the scenes and I dare to say that it is in my Top 10 movies ever. The DVD has an interesting documentary called "Sunset Blvd.: A Look Back" (a.k.a. "The Making of Sunset Boulevard" with the presence of a still impressively beautiful Nancy Olson telling peculiarities about this awesome feature. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): "Crepúsculo dos Deuses" ("Dusk of the Gods")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greatest star of them all?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched SB again -- three times -- this past week, for perhaps the 100th time.The film is virtually flawless, IMHO. (Except for the distracting shadow of the camera on William Holden's back as he moves to Norma's bed to wish her, "Happy New Year, Norma . . . ," a technical flaw I've never understood: why wasn't the move re-lit and re-shot, since everything else in the film is perfect?) But what continues to haunt me is Swanson's performance. Her silent-screen "theatricality" is always remarked upon. Yet there are several moments of utterly contemporary "naturalism" that show she knew exactly what she was doing as an actress (and Wilder, as director).Her sweetness in her "bathing beauty" scene, where she recounts her days in the line with Marie Prevost and Mabel Normand, then leaps onto the sofa beside William Holden -- is so beguiling that you completely understand her sex appeal and warmth (for a moment). When she asks for his match (for a moustache for her Chaplin impression) and tells Holden to close his eyes, "Close 'em!" -- the "Close 'em!" is clearly an ad lib that is so real and intimate that it is almost instantly lost in the macabre sequence that follows -- all flashing eyes and volcanic eruption that C.B. DeMille himself hasn't phoned her.Soon afterward, believing she will be making "Salome" for DeMille, there is the astonishing montage of Norma's marathon beauty treatments in preparation for her "return." Extreme closeups of Swanson's face, without makeup, reveal a still-youthful, lovely woman with flawless skin. Even under the magnifying glass, even with the "worried" expression of Norma Desmond, Swanson is stunningly beautiful for a few moments. Ironically, for the rest of the picture, she had to be made up to look older. Yet here we get a glimpse of the real Swanson at 50-whatever, and she looks merely a few years older than Holden.Finally, the entire sequence when Holden returns to find Swanson phoning Betty Shaefer to tell her the truth about Joe Gillis, Swanson is in cold-cream and "wings" to smooth her cheeks and eyes -- an actress completely exposed and without vanity.She plays the entire sequence "naturalistically" and in complete contrast to her theatrical, "I AM big. It's the pictures that got small," style.Here, in her bed, caught by Holden, realizing she's going to lose him, she begs him, "Look at me!" The desperation and helplessness, the momentary admission of reality as Norma acknowledges her fears and insecurities and pleads with Holden, are heartbreaking. Swanson's playing in the scene is astonishingly courageous for any actress, and deeply true to the character.Finally, as Joe packs to leave her and Swanson pleads with him to stay -- grabbing his luggage and begging, "What do you want? Money?" -- again her playing is ratcheting up emotionally into madness, yet is still as contemporary as any Stanislavski method.Everyone tends to remember Swanson's over-the-top stylized performance: yet her total control as an actress, and her naturalistic moments and emotional nakedness, however fleeting, are something to behold.Swanson's is truly one of the most astonishing performances on film. Her range here is jaw-dropping.Watch her transitions in the Chaplin scene alone, in one continuous take, from heart-rending comedy to blind rage. No cutaways. Amazing.I happened to see Swanson live at the Huntington Hartford Theatre in Hollywood, on Vine, in the late sixties, in a stage show written especially for her, called "Reprise." This piece-of-fluff comedy about a famous movie star returning to her home town was hardly Tony-Award winning. But from her first entrance, you were in the presence of a great actress.Barely five feet tall, she swept in and immediately established a bodily "line" that commanded attention from then on.Her performance was delightful. Even more so when, after intermission, the second act began with her character giving a Q&amp;A session at the local Rotary Club.Swanson walked down steps and into the actual audience, greeting "old friends" (that night's audience members), reminiscing about her career -- even sitting in a man's lap and "teasing" him for not remembering when they "dated" -- as real film clips from her silents played on a giant screen onstage.She was outrageous and girlish (she was approaching 70 at the time) and delightful, poking fun at herself and her "character's" career.It was a brilliant bit of stagecraft and an impressive revelation of the "real" Gloria Swanson.Audiences were captivated and irresistibly charmed by this still-stunning-looking yet down-to-earth "young fellow" -- over fifty years after she first took the world by storm.Swanson was the antithesis of Norma Desmond. She was entrancing, magical, adorable, and everybody wanted to take her home.Honestly, perhaps the only other two live theatrical performances I've ever seen (and I've seen hundreds) that could compare to Swanson's sheer talent and charisma were Maggie Smith in "Lettuce and Loveage" and Vanessa Redgrave in "Orpheus Descending." Believe it.Not every actor understands the difference between film and stage performance, nor can every actor deliver that difference vocally and physically (this was WAY before the days of amplified body mikes). Swanson did.I was in first grade when "Sunset Boulevard" was released. I was in my 20s when I saw Swanson onstage in "Reprise" in Hollywood.You could still see the magic that had made her the global phenomenon she had been in silents. You could still see the technique that astounded audiences with "Sunset Boulevard" three decades later.You could understand where Billy Wilder got his line: "She was the greatest star of them all." Every time I watch SB, I think: "She probably damned well was."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although at that time she hadn't appeared in a film for several years and wasn't to make one for several for several more, Gloria Swanson remained a presence in the Hollywood of the thirties, the only legendary silent star to sustain an image and continue to interest the film studios, which put her under contract and announced her to star in a series of projects?none of which were realized? While she wasn't to regain her former eminence until her celebrated comeback as Norma Desmond in Billy Wilder's "Sunset Boulevard," a scathing satire on Hollywood and the self-delusions of its former heroes, she maintained her silent-screen image as the personification of glamor, and as such wasn't the initial choice for the role of the faded silent star? Like many small people who achieve greatness, Swanson was a powerhouse of energy, vitality, ambition and shrewdness, untroubled by insight humor to slow down her pace? The key to her success, the charm of her personality, the glamor of her career and the secret of her survival was superbly captured by herself in one of the best autobiographies, Swanson on Swanson?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A somewhat savage, somewhat sick peek behind the Hollywood curtain</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Sunset Boulevard," Billy Wilder's barbed take on the Hollywood studio system during its heyday is by turns volatile, funny, suspenseful, and--at its core--more than a little creepy. By today's standards, this 1950 film still takes some relevant shots at an industry that seldom acknowledges its superficiality, but is also just as dated in other regards. Wilder takes a truly original concept, bending Film Noir, satire, comedy, and pathos in the telling of Joe Gillis (William Holden), a down-on-his-luck screenwriter (the repo men are threatening to take his car, for Pete's sake!), who winds up all but imprisoned in the lonely, secluded mansion of Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), a washed-up silent-film starlet harboring delusions of a comeback. When drafted to revise Desmond's self-scripted version of "Salome," Joe becomes very aware of his unhinged provider, and quickly begins a collaboration with the young, rhinoplasty-friendly Betty Schaefer (Nancy Olson). While Holden and Olson are--in the midst of this send-up--fresh-faced stars, "Sunset Boulevard"'s axis of madness hinges squarely on Swanson's full-bore performance, a blend of incestuous sexuality and mid-life crisis (she makes Baby Jane seem warm and cuddly by comparison) that makes her advances on Holden genuinely unappealing. The performance is a bit more tricky than one might give credit--as a woman whose fame has declined, her sustained hunger for it fuels her delusion, therefore rendering Norma Desmond an actress who literally acts out her everyday reality, to the point where any semblance of humanity is absent (her actions and words possess the overt dramatics of a woman seeking the Best Actress Oscar). While the film is beautifully photographed and performed, the sheer ambition of the project is something of a flaw--with so many genres represented, "Sunset Boulevard" is problematic in synthesizing a coherent vision. But what is here is quite influential, and certainly worth a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hollywood &amp; Sunset</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Widely heralded as a classic upon its initial release, the Billy Wilder-Charles Brackett production, Sunset Boulevard, is a superb piece of work in nearly all departments; and yet at some levels it disappoints upon repeated viewings. This is not an easy movie to love. The people in it are unsympathetic, as the leading male character is a hack screenwriter turned gigolo; and the woman he lives with is a mad former silent movie star who pins all her hopes on this third-rate writer's ability to write her 'comeback' picture. Neither is an amiable sort, but he is at least sane; and though he has an understanding of decency, he never quite achieves it. His goal is success. That he decieves two women who care for him deeply bothers him from time to time, when it is an inconvenience, but doesn't otherwise seem to bedevil him or prey on his thoughts. As a cynical picture of postwar Hollywood the movie is flawless. It captures the moment when the the studio system was at its absolute peak as well as at the start of its decline. The secondary characters are more likeable than the major ones, notably Erich von Stroheim's butler. Yet the film is not a satisfying portrait of mental illness, as the insane Norma Desmond, while superficially credible, has no inner life, or even a hint of one, as her demons appear to come more from her neglect by others than anything to do with herself. Her gigolo, Joe Gillis, is believable as a hustler but seems, in his narration and occasional asides, to be brighter and wittier than his behavior suggests. The characters, in other words, go through their motions, as the plot dictates; and while they are very interesting in what they do or fail at, they seem to have no life outside of the story. This is a movie about Hollywood rather than people; an immoral 'moral tale', it sometimes leaves a bad taste.For all its flaws, though, the movie works like a charm even when it is not itself charming. As Norma Desmond, Gloria Swanson is magnificent, larger than life, and every inch the former silent movie queen she plays in the picture. Her final scene is priceless, and the best shot in the movie. William Holden made a new career for himself thanks to Sunset Boulevard. For over a decade he had been playing rather bland, boy next door types, and his work here was a revelation. Joe Gillis was his best performance thus far, and made Holden overnight a hot property, and shortly thereafter the biggest male star in the business. His dry, almost affectless Midwestern delivery of dialogue and, especially, narration; his mixture of good manners and ambivilant morals; and his ability to command the screen with a flicker of expression, put him immediately into the major leagues. Sunset Boulevard does not in the end tell us more about Hollywood than the Selznick-Wellman A Star Is Born, but it does its job better, with pungent dialogue, brilliant acting and a sense of style rare in movies of the time and unheard of today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is often cited as the first and sometimes the best of explicitly folded films. That's where you have a film within a film and the two merge. It isn't the first or nearly the best of course, but because it was made by a slick Hollywoood director is seems simpler than it is.The setup is simple: the outside movie is the one we are watching (obviously), reinforced by the control of a voice-over. The movie within is the fantasy world of an aging actress, "directed" by her husband-butler-director (played by a real director. They are missing a writer which is where the crossover occurs. We watch as the writer becomes engaged (literally as it turns out) to write the inner movie. He escapes at night to write a third movie, presumably all three to be produced by deMille who plays himself. The three merge at the end, resulting in the writer's death.We know something is up at the very beginning. The original "writer" is portrayed as monkey, literally. On the monkey's death, they expect a replacement and prepare a room. The machinery of noir fate directs our hapless writer to that room (a hack plot device having to do with a car repo).Folded films don't often provide room for folded acting, usually the two are are distinct. Most viewers of the film will think it merely an opportunity for an aging actress to play an aging actress, something like "All About Eve" of the same year (and which influenced this project).Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On my first viewing, I wasn't particularly impressed with this movie but I liked it a lot more on the second and by the third - when it's magnificently transferred on DVD - I was fan, too. This is a good visual film, particularly when it shows the inside of this incredible mansion where a lot of the scenes take place.To those who have never seen it, you are warned that it is not an easy film to view, it being a portrait of a pathetic has-been silent movie star who still thinks she can come back after a long hiatus and be a star again. Gloria Swanson, who plays the role, overacts and certainly is not appealing, even bordering on grotesque at times, but she isn't supposed to look good. That's one of the points of the story. Anyway, a young William Holden, in his first starring role, is okay and also provides the narration.The most interesting figure in the film to me was the ex-husband-now butler, played by Eric von Stroheim. He's amazing in this film. In supporting roles, I also enjoyed the wholesome Nancy Olsen and the young Jack Webb of "Dragnet" fame.This combination of drama-soap opera-film noir is one of the professional critics all-time favorite films. Odd how they love movies and Hollywood stars so much, yet relish films that tear them down, as this does.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Billy Wilder and Charles Bracket got the definite ghost story about Hollywood broken dreams. There's something vicious about the place and, on the other hand, this movie means the end of an era: Hollywood up to 1950. That year means, in my opinion, the last curtain for the so-called dream factory. And in that dream Norma Desmond and Joe Gillis become crazy. She becomes a fiend and he a pimp. The horror is that after 1950 Hollywood would never be the same and we can say that it's the end of the modern era and the beginning of postmodernism -what with the idiocy of the 50's era-?

		<fullReview>Sunset Blvd. could be looked at as a thesis on what fame does to certain people. For Norma Desmond, fame created a fantasy world that forever trapped her. Living alone in that giant house on Sunset, save for her servant Max, Norma whiles away the hours planning her magnificent return. Her fame kept alive by fan letters, and her hope of return kindled by Joe Gillis. For Norma, there is no other life than standing before cameras and acting out lives of characters that are larger than life. Of course, no one knows who Norma Desmond is. Gloria Swanson gives a magnificent performance. She runs from melancholy, to unbridled joy, to complete mental breakdown. William Holden is the ultimate cynic. He plays Norma like a fiddle but gets ensnared in her web of decaying glory. In the end, Joe pays the price for enduring Norma's insanity. As she descends that staircase in the final scene, you can see that she is completely lost in her own world. A world where no one grows old, where she is forever young, and where she is the greatest star of them all. After all, stars never age.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SUNSET BOULEVARD will always be inextricably linked to ALL ABOUT EVE. They both came out the same year; they both star legendary actresses playing legendary actresses; they both are cynical, sometimes savage in their estimation of show business. And, of course, they are both great films.But they are very different stylistically and philosophically. A primary difference is that EVE is about a survivor. Bette Davis' Margo Channing in EVE accepts, perhaps grudgingly, that change is inevitable. Either she adapts to reality, or she loses all. That is what makes Margo more than just "a great star, a true star." Margo's rival, Eve Harrington, may someday end up like BOULEVARD's Norma Desmond, but Margo Channing never will.But if EVE is about life, SUNSET BOULEVARD is about death. Even their titles suggest this: "Eve" being the first bearer of life and "sunset" being the approaching night. In BOULEVARD, Gloria Swanson's Norma Desmond is to some extent already dead by the time the film starts, locked away in a haunted house, coming out only for the funeral of her pet monkey. She is bound by reputation and profession to a type of film-making that is long dead and nearly forgotten. Her life, like her career, is based on illusions of life.The prevailing interpretation of SUNSET BOULEVARD assumes that Norma is one of Hollywood's victims; that the town and the industry turned its back on her when she was no longer a star, her career sabotaged by the coming of sound in motion pictures. I don't buy that. The film clearly shows us that at age 50 Norma is still vibrant, still beautiful, still energetic and eager to make movies. Plus, she is filthy rich. This is not a woman who would walk away from movie making because she is afraid of her own voice. Indeed, her voice is magnificent; sultry, insinuating and theatrical. I don't think Norma went mad because Hollywood turned its back on her, rather Hollywood turned its back on her because she went mad. I don't think we are getting the full story here. Something may have drove Norma mad, but it wasn't talking pictures. Indeed, she may have been unstable all along, but I think there is something in her past that destroyed her, and I suspect that involves Max (Erich von Stroheim). In his "Great Movies" essay, Roger Ebert suggests that the love between Norma and Max, her ex-husband/ex-director/butler, is the heart of the story; that it's Max's love of Norma that validates her continued existence. I don't see that. I suspect that Max is less a servant than a caretaker or even a jailer. Max (like Joe Gillis, Norma's erstwhile boytoy) may be trapped in Norma's web, but it is a web of his own making. He appears subservient, but he is the one in control, he perpetuates her delusions and enables her madness. I even suspect that he only allows Joe into the situation because he knows that Joe is weak and no real threat to his power; and that he suspects that it will help placate Norma by feeding her fantasy of a comeback. There is more than adoration that cements the relationship between Max and Norma; perhaps guilt, jealousy, desperation -- who knows? All I know is that it is best kept as a subtext, a part of the film's impenetrable mystery. The less we understand Norma, the more intriguing she is.However, if I were to be so bold as to make one major change in SUNSET BOULEVARD, it would be to replace William Holden as Joe Gillis. I respect Holden as an actor, but his screen persona has always been one of strength and -- if not integrity -- confidence; he is not one who plays vulnerable with any conviction. Plus, he doesn't play the part of Gillis with any gentle shadings. The "romance" between Norma and Joe is the least convincing aspect of the film. Joe treats her with barely concealed contempt and a bit of occasional pity, which makes it hard to believe that a self-absorbed diva would even tolerate him, let alone make him the house pet. The role of Joe was originally intended for Montgomery Clift, an actor with a proven ability to appear passive, even as he plays sinister. His work in THE HEIRESS and A PLACE IN THE SUN illustrate this point. I see Joe Gillis, not as a bored hanger-on, but as sycophant who is in awe of Norma, even as he exploits her, and therefore he doesn't realize that he actually is the one who is being used (sort of a younger version of Max). I think Joe should be someone who is cunning, but naive about his own limits, not someone who is already bitter, corrupt and cynical as the story begins. Maybe I am wrong, but I get the feeling that Holden was very uncomfortable playing the part of, well, a mistress, and especially one kept by such an older woman. Perhaps his manhood was threatened and that uneasiness shows. Clift, or an equally rakish young actor like, say, Farley Granger or Robert Wagner, would enliven the story and make the romance with the perpetually needy Norma more credible. I don't think it is enough that the film shows that Norma enjoys manipulating Joe, I think it has to also be implied that to a certain extent Joe loves being manipulated. The relationship is after all a romance and to be credible as long-term there has to be the spark that it is mutually enjoyable. Holden's interpretation that Joe is just doing it for the money just doesn't ring true. While a pairing of the aging diva with an ambitious -- and yes, probably gay -- younger man is practically a show business institution. Yet, even with these reservations, it is undeniable that SUNSET BOULEVARD is quite a film. A little bit Hollywood satire, a little bit moralistic fable and whole lot of Gothic melodrama. And Swanson's just-not-quite over the top performance is mesmerizing. It was assumed that BOULEVARD would revitalize Swanson's career. It didn't. But apparently, it didn't matter to her: she dabbled in acting now and again, when the part amused her, but she had better things to do with her life. Swanson played Norma Desmond, but she lived life as Margo Channing.</fullReview>

The jaded newsman played by William Holden, the star herself, Gloria Swanson who just about steals every scene she is in, William does an excellent job in holding his own. This is the ultimate comment on Hollywood by Hollywood. And it holds true even today when we observe so many has beens behaving so inappropriately (Goldie Hawn, pushing 60, giggling like a crazed 15 year old comes to mind) because they cannot let go of their days in the sun and keep projecting their younger selves to us as they have not come to terms with the people they have become. My heart aches for Gloria in this, though she is most unlovable and treats people abominably. The old bit players shine in this also, and of course Eric who continues to worship her because he knows no other life but that of sycophant. A great, great movie. 9 out of 10 ( And I was so disappointed in the stage remake a few years ago. Nobody can top Gloria.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More than just about Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Sunset Boulevard" is considered to be one of the quintessential Hollywood films. It takes a bitingly satirical look at what makes Hollywood work. However, beneath its surface it is more than just that. It's a uniquely strange look what happens to a prima donna who's fallen from her high horse.Joe Gillis (William Holden) is a young, down on his luck Hollywood writer. He's just scraping by, trying to hide his car from repo men. He winds up in the house of Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), an aging silent film star who is working on her comeback screenplay. She gives Joe the job of fixing the screenplay, although her aim is basically to have him for company.The characters are well formed and incredibly well acted, specifically in Joe and Norma. They are three dimensional - each has their own internal struggles and desires. Joe, on one hand, relies on Norma to keep up his good life that it has, but on the other hand wants to go out and be with the girl that he loves. Norma is stuck in the delusion, kept up by her butler Max (Erich von Stroheim), that she is still famous.Holden and Swanson perform their parts brilliantly. Holden is the man trapped, with no way out. Swanson overacts, intentionally, saying every line with such grandiosity that she perfectly captures the way Norma feels about herself and her perceived stardom.This movie is about a woman who was once great and has fallen. She reacts to it not with acceptance, but an unconscious denial. She, along with Max, has convinced herself that she is still a star with legions of fans. Joe keeps up the charade because of everything that he is offering her. The idea of the middle aged woman keeping the young man for company is genuinely strange, but it fits the picture that Norma is trapped in the past, and fails to move on, but rather deny it."Sunset Boulevard" is a brilliant movie. It works on two levels - as a satire about the hollowness of fame and Hollywood, and also as a look at what happens when one has fallen from grace. Its status as one of the greatest movies of the era is certainly well earned, and it has certainly survived the test of time.**** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review for Sunset Boulevard</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A movie filled with heart-ache, love, tragedy, and ambition, Sunset Boulevard is one of the most interesting to have ever been on screen. It's plot is one of the rare ones that takes the viewer behind the scenes and into the Hollywood realm, albeit probably not painting the most accurate of pictures, but still adding to our, as viewers, limited knowledge of the Hollywood world. This movie is about desires and wants. There is the desire of the penniless writer to make it big and then there is the desire of the actress to know that she is still beautiful and wanted.Norma Desmond, played by Gloria Swanson, is a glamorous film star whose career abruptly ends with the introduction of talking pictures. And sadly enough, she is caught in her memories of a time when she was viewed as beautiful and glamorous not realizing that the world around her is still moving on. In Norma's lifetime, being a film star was all about the cinematic gaze and how it showed her. There was no sound to tell if an actress was good or not. The camera can make or break a person. She knew what made her popular and that was being under the constant scrutiny of the camera, of having it always on her. Sadly, when that phase of her life ended, she didn't know what to do with herself. Most women are objectified on film by the camera, the director, the audience, etc. and most would try and distance themselves from that but oddly enough Norma wants to be surveyed. She wants to be scrutinized or praised or whatever else, as long as she is getting the attention she craves. I suppose Norma feels that this attention is what she needs to be happy. Attention and approval from others is what kept her going and without it she became a pitiful woman. And the littlest bit of approval she gets makes her feel that much more important but when its revealed the fan letters she receives are from her butler, once her husband, you can't help but feel sorry for her. Overall I think that you will love this movie. The cinematography is incredible and creates an amazing setting and atmoshpere. The movie shows the worst sides of what some view as the most glamorous lifestyle and way to live.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The seedy underside brought to life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this film because of its realism. The seamy and unclean underside of "Hollywood" is given flesh and blood by both William Holden in his calculating manipulation and Gloria Swanson by her cold, grasping desperation. The technique of telling the story from the viewpoint of William Holden's character, who has already paid the price of his cynicism and greed, was so effective as to be priceless. What was best, for me however, was the sympathy that both the lead characters managed to evoke in spite of their obvious and outrageous flaws. What could be more realistic, pitiful, but superbly tragic than the butler writing phony fan letters to his faded star employer? The fact that Sunset Boulevard was filmed in black and white I believe added to the power of the acting and the effectiveness of the narrative in the sense that it lent a grimy aspect to what was truly a dirty little story of personal failure. I also believe that because it was in black and white, I was never distracted by the scenery or the beauty of the sets and I was able to concentrate on the central aspects of the acting of William Holden and Gloria Swanson and the story they were portraying. This was one of the greatest movies of all time!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Billy Wilder classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very few past directors have made such great movies that they never aged and still appears fresh and entertaining today. One name that instantly pops out is Alfred Hitchcock, but although he is still considered the master of suspense, his films are now dwarfed by big-budget Hollywood action movies with stellar special effects. In my opinion, Billy Wilder's films have aged the least. In today's tradition of gross-out movies, his classic comedy Some Like It Hot still brings out the laughs and was recently named by the American Film Institute as the funniest American movie of all time. His Oscar-winning movie The Apartment still feels original, and its influence is still seen today-Sam Mendes cited it as an inspiration in making American Beauty. Wilder made many other classics, but arguably, his best film was 1950's Sunset Boulevard. This movie is about Hollywood; it reflects how the movie business has changed in that period when silent films have given way to talkies. It shows an aging silent film star Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), who, even though rich, still wants the fame and glory she once had. She is now isolated in her mansion, accompanied only by her butler Max (Erich von Stroheim), her house filled with pictures from the past, and she watches her past films in her own theater. She dreams of making a comeback, writing a ridiculous script, and hoping to send it to Cecil B. DeMille and make him direct it.The movie is seen from the point of view of Joe Gillis (William Holden). His character was well established-a struggling writer in need of fast money because he needs to pay his rent and keep his car. The studio rejects his script; he ends up asking various people for money, and fails. We are not surprised that when Norma asks him to edit her script and requests him to live in her house, he accepts. Later, when Norma admits that she is falling in love with him, he first despises the idea, but eventually ends up with her because he needs the money likes the lifestyle. The screenplay is very much well written because it develops almost every character. The butler Max plays a deeper role in the story that it may seem, and I will let the viewers find that out for themselves. A woman named Betty Schaefer also plays an important role; she is the younger attractive woman Gillis falls for but cannot pursue because she is engaged and also because Gillis cannot get out of his relationship with Norma.The movie's score by Franz Waxman impressed me. The music enters at the right moments, and it sets the tone for the entire movie. The casting is somewhat interesting. Swanson was also a silent film star and at one point in the movie, Norma and Gillis watches a movie called Queen Kelly with the young Swanson, and at that time, it seemed like Swanson was playing herself. The butler Max, admits that he was once a promising director: `There were three young directors who showed promise in those days, D.W. Griffith, Cecil B. DeMille and Max von Mayerling.' This is interesting because Erich von Stroheim was also a director, and more interestingly, he directed Swanson in Queen Kelly. In a scene where Norma invites her silent film friends to play bridge, the parts were played by real silent film stars-Buster Keaton, Anna Q. Nilsson and H.B. Warner. The real backbone of this movie is Gloria Swanson's amazing performance. She makes her character tiptoe the line of insanity, and she convincingly fell through it in the end. I enjoyed the way she overacts sometimes, showing us that Norma still lives in the past, doing pantomime for silent films. When Gillis told her that she used to be big, she immediately answers, `I am big. It's the pictures that got small.' She also impersonates Chaplin's tramp at one point, and it provided one of the biggest laughs of the movie.A minor drawback in the movie occurs in the beginning, where one important plot development is revealed. I believe that the movie could have been a little better if Wilder used a straight narrative rather than starting close to the end and tell the story in one big flashback. I still give this movie a perfect grade because it still works well even with the minor mistake, and it also deeply entertained me. Sunset Boulevard, like Singin' in the Rain, uses an important event in movie history and develops it not just into a great movie, but one of the greatest movies of all time.</fullReview>

Made in 1950 this film will capture the viewer each time it is seen. The references to the bygone silent movie era are somehow chilling. Much like when a person walks around ancient Rome or Egypt wondering how something so powerful and advanced could come to an end. Both Swanson and Stroheim were of course giants during the silent film years and their performances is this great movie even seem to show their perhaps real life animosity toward talking films. Holden as Joe Gillis a rapidly becoming down on his like screen writer who stumbles into Swansons world is fantastic. This is certainly one motion picture that could never and should never be remade or colorized, as the Black and White photography is brilliant. It didn't make AFI's top five of all time and perhaps should have. You can't consider yourself as one of "All those wonderful people out there in the dark" if you've never seen Sunset Blvd.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Love Poem to the Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sunset Boulevard (1950)A Love Poem to the MoviesYes, Sunset Boulevard is a love poem to the movies, to the silent era and its shimmer, and to the studio era and the beginning of the end of the Golden Age. Even if this isn't to your taste (and if not, shame on you), this has to be a perfect film. It's original and imitative, it's prosaic and profound. It moves with fluidity and visual splendor (odd to find myself preferring that word here). The main characters are so lonely and pathetic, and so deeply human and sad, you recognize yourself in them--your future self, at least.And it is a movie about love and death, about growing old enough to not know if you can be loved, and if you are loved, not knowing why. Both ways. This touches a chord for me. It comes at the end of my favorite decade for movies, the 1940s (which begins with 1939, expansively), and it comes as a pinnacle of film noir, though an odd example. It kills the main character in the opening scene and has him giving the voice-over anyway. Pretending to resuscitate an old silent screen star, played by Gloria Swanson, it actually resuscitates Gloria Swanson herself. It brings Cecil B. DeMille back to the screen, back actually on the screen, in a poignant and slightly ironic role (he plays the part of filmmaker with businesslike kindness, his sweetness genuine but also practical). And Erich von Stroheim, ever gloomy and disgruntled, but omniscient, too, the only one who seems to understand exactly why this is happening, and think it all for the best.If you are not (yet) an old film buff and have heard of none of these people from earlier eras, you can watch it as a richly filmed crime/noir/screenwriter movie (all three) with enough twists and interior monologues to satisfy even the most bored and jaded viewer. If we get past all the pre-post-modern references and homages built into the cast and plot, we can see something about Joe Gillis, a failing screenwriter played by William Holden, lost in the world, thinking he has morality and talent and even some good looks, but somewhere things have gone wrong. All he has to do is right himself, but the boat is stubborn, and only the illusion of redemption lures him out, and he begins to write even though he knows it's futile, and we know it's futile. We know in the beginning he dies in the end. Work, and working, whatever the milieu, is just that exercise some of us go through to make it to tomorrow alive, filling the days, persuading others that we're fine, that life has meaning. Such people (I'm not sure if I'm one of them) even fool themselves, because a life like that might have no meaning other than itself--the present moment, the doing as it is being done, and when it seems that the work will bear fruit--that Gillis's script has possibility--all becomes false and temporary.In this poem the heroine is unlikely and outwardly insufficient, and because of that she is perfect and more than enough--Nancy Olson, that person we really are out here in reality land, the one who is on the fringes of hope but who is, actually, happy inside. Or at least knows how to be happy--partly by dreaming, partly by taking chances, and mostly by being grounded and honest with yourself.Another aspect to watch is the insider look at movie-making. A few films swing you behind the scenes, behind the camera, and this does it during that big picture, factory feel of the studios, and though brief, it's a thrill. The fact that Norma Desmond (the Swanson character) is out of touch with it all is sad, of course, but isn't that also what life is all about, the passing of one thing and the rising of another?Who would have thought such a fantastical mind blower as this would be about the nitty gritty depths of reality? And what about the funeral procession for the monkey, coming down the stairs? My god, what a film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Generally considered as Wilder's peak,it lives up to its reputation.Fifty years later,it remains the best movie about movie world,not only hollywoodian .One hundred times plagiarized,never surpassed. First of all,there 's the Swanson/Von Stroheim couple.He directed her in the famous "Queen Kelly"(another must of the silent movies).Von Stroheim was too ahead of his time,his movies scared the censors ,so he was not allowed to pursue a career that would have been stunning in the talkies.Here he became (supreme downfall),Swanson's butler ,while we see one of his former colleagues,Cecil B. De Mille,playing his own role,still directing.Von Stroheim's character is called "Max von Mayerling" ,probably one of Wilder's private jokes: Stroheim once said he was the son of a lady in waiting of Austrian Empress Elisabeth (Sissi) whose son Rudolph committed suicide in Mayerling!And Wilder was Austrian too. Swanson is impressive too.The comeback myth is the dream of every actor whose star is slowly but inexorably fading.that she continues viewing her old -and real!- triumphs like "Queen Kelly,that she's writing an extravaganza shows that her comeback desire has reached the point of no return and that her only place in this world is the asylum.What Swanson did not achieve in the movie,she did it for real:she really could come back(as Lilian Gish),her performance,particularly in the last scene ,has stood the test of time. Wilder as a scriptwriter outdoes himself here;lines like "I'm still big;it's the pictures that got small" could be pronounced today ! 25 years later,he would try to update "sunset blvd" with "Fedora":the latter suffered by comparison,but it's a very worthwhile work that every fan of this great director should see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hollywood Gothic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the spotlight on Norma Desmond, one of the greatest movie characters of all time, played majestically by Gloria Swanson, "Sunset Blvd." oozes Hollywood Gothic, in a story that is as bleak as it is timeless.Although the script's protagonist is Joe Gillis (William Holden), unsuccessful screenwriter and opportunist, the heart and soul of the film resides in the character of older woman Norma Desmond, a reclusive movie star of years gone by, living in the past, vain, egocentric, yearning for a return to the camera.What makes Norma so memorable is her singular strangeness ... those over-sized hand gestures, eyes bugged-out, ghastly makeup, grandiose emotions, and living with her servant Max (Erich von Stroheim) in that overblown, creepy mansion, antiquated, baroque, and " ... out of beat with the rest of the world, crumbling apart in slow motion." Norma and her world are bleak beyond words. And yet, there's a humor in all that bombastic eccentricity.And the film's theme runs deep, as it turns on its industry overlords with a stinging indictment of Hollywood suits, cruel and heartless, spitting out actors and writers when they no longer generate money. Hollywood insiders are portrayed thusly as desperate, vain, egocentric, opportunistic, shallow, and delusional, much like Norma and Joe. Indeed, the Hollywood savagery of 1950 looks very much like the Hollywood savagery of today. Thematically, the film has not aged at all.B&amp;W cinematography captures the story's bleakness well. Sets and props are suitably specific and detailed. The film's score is at times as grandiose and majestic as Norma. And Wilder's stylistic and flamboyant directorial flourishes add to the film's supremacy.My only complaint pertains to the script. The voice-over narration is a bit overdone. And the second half plot gives a little too much attention to the Betty Schaefer character. It's Norma Desmond that I want to see and listen to.These quibbles aside, "Sunset Blvd." is one of the great classic films of all time, a noir drama, wonderfully dreary and grim, yet funny, too. And that final sequence with Norma descending the staircase, addressing those around her in a mannered whisper, head tilted back, all bug-eyed and never blinking ... then as she looks into the camera ... Just terrific!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"And must you chew gum?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It so happens that as I was watching Sunset Boulevard, I was chewing gum, and Gloria Swanson's clipped, derisive tone felt more like it was directed not at William Holden's washed up Joe Gillis in 1950, but at me, sitting on my couch in 2008. I didn't throw my gum away like Gillis does, but still, I did feel a little disconcerted. Norma Desmond knew I was chewing, and she didn't like it one bit.But this is part of Sunset Boulevard's charm. While it's a movie about the ways movies had changed, were continuing to change, and those they left behind, it also shows us how, in some ways, they've remained the same. Its references to the WGA, popcorn cinema, and the tragicomic nature of washed-up celebrity feel oddly contemporary while simultaneously being firmly rooted in the Fifties.While some of the period references to actors and directors went over my head - I'm no expert on the silent era - it didn't affect my enjoyment of them one bit. The fact that Wilder and his team were brave enough to include such comments gives the film a cool, relaxed feel even as the web that binds the characters draws ever-tighter.It's fantastically acted too. Holden is brilliant as the struggling everyman who quickly realises that he's gotten way more than he bargained for, and Swanson is pitch-perfect as the faded screen star whose grip on reality has crumbled far quicker than the walls of her mansion, right down to the wide roving eyes and claw-like hands. They're well-supported, especially by Erich von Stronheim's eerily restrained butler Max.Of course, great dialogue and performances are nothing without a plot to match. Despite the fact that the beginning reveals the end, Sunset Boulevard still manages to keep you hooked from the moment Holden sits at his desk for the first time right up until the movie's cruel, haunting, tragically human conclusion.Very rarely do "old" movies actually live up to their reputations, but I'm pleased to say that Sunset Boulevard does, and it's a credit to Wilder's team's ability that this noir-drama stands the test of time. A truly great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sunset Boulevard (1950)Number 1 - 1950Top 5 - 1950sTop 50 - All Time(first lines) Joe Gillis: Yes, this is Sunset Blvd., Los Angeles, California. It's about 5 0'clock in the morning. That's the homicide squad, complete with detectives and newspaper men.From that masterful opening sequence until the tragic conclusion, Sunset Boulevard maintains an example of classic film-making at its most original and revitalising level.This is one of the greatest works ever committed to film. I could stop right there and say no more. It would be justifiable...The film opens on the grounds of a run down, old mansion in Sunset Boulevard, where the dead body of a young man floats in the swimming pool. All around are news reporters and journalists, trying to capture a shot. Why? Because, the body lies in the house of an ageing film star, Norma Desmond, long forgotten after the silent era passed her by. The film revolves around the story of this bizarre, disturbed woman who was deserted by fame, her faithful butler, discoverer and ex-husband and a struggling writer who accidentally falls under her wings and she slowly, and pervasively drives him to the edge, as she becomes obsessed, fixated and jealous of any other affairs that this man has. Until, in the grand finale, she shoots him as he tries to leave her false hopes and bizarre world.This film, along with its main themes and tightly focused storyline, examines the power and corrosiveness of fame and its effects ones it leaves you. Norma Desmond is the deserted silent film queen, who spirals into madness as the world slowly forgets her day by day.Gloria Swanson, who plays Desmond is nothing short of astonishing. One of the greatest performances I have ever seen and definitely one of the best performances to be overlooked by the Academy.With outstanding performances from Eric von Stroheim and William Holden as the struggling writer, who initially finds refuge with Desmond, in this story about fame, madness and humanity. The direction by Billy Wilder is truly exceptional along with a great screenplay, a superbly suited score by Franz Waxman and creative cinematography by John F. Seitz, create an atmospheric film-noir.1950 was a good year for film. Sunset Boulevard was up against the equally recognised masterpiece All About Eve and the Best Picture was awarded to the latter, although I am convinced that Sunset Blvd. was superior. Regardless a timeless achievement and a film that is grounded in the list of the greatest films ever made.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although my recent revisit to SUNSET BLVD. must have been close to the twentieth time I've seen it, I'm just as stunned and captivated by it as the first time I saw it. In SUNSET BLVD, everything just clicks, complete with all the now classic taglines; "It's not me that got small, it's the pictures that got smaller." "We didn't need dialog. We had faces then." "I'm ready for my close-up now, Mr. DeMille." I can't think of any other picture about Hollywood - or the world of film in general - that has achieved this unique self-reflective look at the film community. Ironically, none probably could have dreamed of the magnificent performance Gloria Swanson turned in. At barely 5 feet tall, she commands the screen like no-one else and really towers above them all as Norma Desmond, the aging, completely delusional film star from the silent era. Hard to imagine Gloria Swanson wasn't first choice to play the part of Norma Desmond with Pola Negri (too much Polish accent), Mae Murray, Mary Pickford (too sweet) and even Mae West all considered for the part of Norma Desmond.The movie opens with the bullet-riddled body of a young man floating face down in the pool next to a mansion. Soon, the story is told with the brilliant device of a voice-over of a dead man, Joe Gilis (William Holden), recounting the events leading up to his death. A broke screenwriter, down on his luck and desperate to take on any job, he stumbles upon what looks like a deserted mansion, when he's hounded by some creditors. Soon, he's ordered into the house by a female voice that turns out to belong to legendary silent screen star Norma Desmond who retreated from the outside world, now living a lonely and isolated existence with her aging servant (Erich von Stroheim). After some lamenting the current state of the film industry, she offers Joe a job of doctoring her script for SALOME, which she plans as her comeback vehicle. Clearly this is never gonna happen, but Joe decides to take the job, and he money, but soon becomes a virtual prisoner of the actress's creepy past and increasingly delusional dreamworld.Almost every sentence, remark, Swanson's antiques and postures have become part of our cinematic heritage now, we sometimes forget how delightfully crisp and clever the dialog was at the time, and still is. After the death of Norma Desmond's chimpanzee, Holden acidly remarks; "This must have been one important chimp. The grandson of King-Kong perhaps." "And then the rains came, over-sized, like everything else in California."This film closed the door to the old Hollwyood-generation, opened one to the new and basically started a new era in self-conscious film-making and - in the process - reconciled the until then completely forgotten silent film stars. Of the three directors featured in the film, Cecil B. DeMille was still well respected and would make some of his greatest films in the years to come. Erich von Stroheim, now degraded to being Desmond's butler, was largely an outcast by then, just as the totally forgotten Buster Keaton who's allowed to play card games at Desmond's mansion once in a while. It's quite outstanding how the cynical Wilder achieves to really make us care about the characters, all of them, but especially Norma Desmond's, whose oblivious outlook on the world surrounding her and her own long since gone fame (Von Stroheim writes her fake fan letters) really makes you pity her fate.With the right ingredients, the right script, the right casting, Wilder was able to achieve phenomenal results. Needless to say, he made a whole string of films now considered classics, but this is the pinnacle of his career and head and shoulders above any other self-reflective turn Hollywood embarked on in all the years to follow. If forced to make a shortlist of ten films I couldn't do without, this one's on it.Camera Obscura --- 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rumor has it that Gloria Swanson was absolutely devastated that she didn't win the Oscar for Sunset Boulevard. 1950 was an unusually tough year for competitors, with the statuette eventually going to Judy Holiday for Born Yesterday. Admittedly, Gloria is fantastic in this film - she's able to send up herself, while also scandalizing the business she was product of - but the acting chops must really go to William Holden, who provides the willful self-loathing thread that ties much of this noirish and twisted tale together. Director by Billy Wilder, Sunset Boulevard represents classic movie making at its peak. Set in Los Angeles, it's a dark, twisted, cynical tale of love, deceit, and opportunism. The film is all about Hollywood behind the scenes and how screenwriters, directors, and actors will sell themselves out for fame and fortune at a moments notice. Spiritual and emotional emptiness, and the price of fame, greed, narcissism, and ambition is at the heart of this devilishly stylistic film, with the somber mood beginning almost immediately when a dead man is found floating facedown in a swimming pool.The man is hack screenwriter Joe Gillis (a very sexy William Holden). All we know is that Joe was at the run-down mansion of deluded former silent-film star Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson). Through Joe's voice over narrative it soon becomes clear that he was somehow involved with the wealthy Norma. Down on his luck, three months behind on his rent, and with his car about to be repossessed, Joe accidentally stumbles upon Norma's faded mansion while trying to escape the police. Norma initially mistakes Joe for a coffin-maker for her deceased pet monkey, but once she figures out that he's a screenwriter, she gets him to read one of the scripts she's been working on. Norma is an insane and faded silent-film star, who is hoping against hope to make a comeback. She's bitterly resentful of the price the "talkies" have taken on her career, so now she soaks in her own misguided and imagined greatness, in profile with the flickering projector lighting her outline in the dark. Joe is initially hesitant to help the glamorous woman, and then asks $500 a week for his writing services. But slowly we come to realize the contract is actually the other way around. In preparing for her return comeback, Norma quickly turns Joe into a pawn - or more to the point, a slave. Joe becomes a virtual prisoner in her rundown mansion; the moment he leaves, she slits her wrists, forcing him to come back. With minimal resistance, Joe allows himself to settle into the life of a kept man, as Norma desperately showers him with gifts and fine clothing. The house butler, Max von Meyerling (Erich von Stroheim), grimly looks on, tending to Norma's demanding whims and tolerating Joe's disruptive presence.Joe wobbles back and forth between heedless acceptance of his strange companionship with Norma and his half-hearted pursuit of a career. He sneaks away to collaborate on a project with Betty (Nancy Olson), a Paramount script reader who is engaged to Joe's best friend. Betty is gradually falling in love with Joe, but when Norma finds out, that he's been sneaking out to meet wit her, all hell breaks loose. The self-loathing motif is rampant throughout Sunset Boulevard. Max completely does away with his self-respect, Joe hates himself for his unwillingness to commit to a career or love, and seems to sell himself out for money and clothes almost immediately, and Betty despises herself for falling in love with Joe while she's engaged to another. Norma, despite her haughtiness, is the most blatant case of self-disgust. When she isn't raving about her greatness, she comes across as a frightened and tortured soul ? a sad and lonely woman, who is not only remarkably self-delusional, but is also trying to grasp one last chance at happiness. She thinks so little of her current 50-year-old self that she no longer acknowledges the present. Sunset Boulevard is a must see movie for cinema buffs. There are lots of treasures to be had here, including Nancy Olson's strangely under appreciated performance as Betty, whose misguided love for Joe spirals the film to its grisly conclusion. There's also the hilarious appearance of a skinny and madly grinning Jack Webb as a happy-go-lucky assistant director, and viewers will get a kick out of the excessive exuberance that Norma displays when she towels down a hunky and hairy-chested Joe at poolside. The funniest scene in the movie is when Norma rolls on top of Joe while he is reclining on a couch, and then does an imitation of Charlie Chaplin in order to cheer him up; the scene is an uproarious mixture of the sad, the funny, and the pathetic. Billy Wilder's accomplished direction is full of wide shots that capture the depressing set and brave close-ups of our anti-heroes. But in the end, Sunset Boulevard stands out, as one of the finest examples of the frenzied circus of obsession, fixation, and greed that is oftentimes symbolizes Hollywood.

		<shortDescription>Like Traveling To a Strange &amp; Memorable World</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching this memorable classic is like traveling to a strange and fascinating world. It succeeds as few movies do at drawing you in and setting an atmosphere that is both convincing and interesting. The trio of Holden, Swanson, and von Stroheim make a fine combination, and bring their characters to life most effectively. Aside from a couple of relatively slow stretches, it is crafted with great skill, and it's a film-noir worth watching and re-watching.Holden's restrained, gently cynical performance is an ideal way to look at the unusual world where Swanson's character, an aging former silent movie star, lives. Swanson succeeds very well at being weird but yet believable, sometimes even sympathetic, and von Stroheim rounds out the picture pretty well as a character with his own quirks. The physical atmosphere of the decaying mansion and its grounds, done with many well-conceived details, is also an effective and important part of the setup. It all works so well because it comes across as true-to-life not just as a portrayal of Hollywood but as a generalized picture of living in a bygone era.When you have interesting characters, an unusual situation, a good cast, and a director like Billy Wilder to tell you the story, you have rather high expectations. "Sunset Boulevard" does not disappoint.</fullReview>

She enlists him as a ghostwriter for her terrible comeback script, but she traps him in the house and he becomes her kept man....(nararrated by Joe(the writer)from a pool,dead)The praise: Brilliant,Brilliant.The way it depicts a woman clinging to her past stardom and narcissistic illusions of fame , in a grotesquely eerie castle of herself , with her dead chimpanzee , and her provocatively weird butler , Max . Everything is cuckoo, as Joe Gillis would say, even her Butler, Max, with the way he idolizes Norma and tries to preserve her glory with lies and deception. The simmering way it depicts Hollywood decorative luxuries is equally hot. Gloria Swansongives a truly brilliant performance as the obsessive silent queen, and so does Erich von Stroheim as the equally obsessed butler Max. William Holden also is great, and so is Nancy Olson as the honest Betty Schaefer. A must-see. The ending is one of the greats.

		<shortDescription>The Wild Roller-coaster of Fame</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In many ways Sunset Boulevard is like the reverse side of the coin of A Star Is Born. In that film we have young Vicki Lester going through all the travails and heartache before achieving her goal of movie stardom. Sunset Boulevard is the reverse. A Star Is Born has its tragic figure in Norman Maine who commits suicide rather than face being a has been. In Sunset Boulevard we have the character of Norma Desmond who has not taken that route. She lacks for nothing in the material world, she wisely saved and invested her money. But the acclaim of the audience is a drug she craves. She's been at the top on the celebrity roller-coaster and now is at the bottom.Into her life comes Joe Gillis quite accidentally. Fleeing from some repo men looking to take his car, Gillis drives into the garage of what he thinks is a deserted mansion. It looks pretty run down from the outside. Gillis compares it to the house of Miss Faversham from Great Expectations, little knowing how right he was.Billy Wilder was a casting genius though in some ways he fell into the cast he had. Gloria Swanson was not his first choice, he approached both Mary Pickford and Pola Negri for the Desmond role first. Gloria Swanson who actually had made the transition to sound well, but had gone on to stage and radio since her success in Music in the Air, drew from the experiences of many of her colleagues. At the time she was cast in Sunset Boulevard she had a radio show out of New York.Bill Holden was sheer serendipity. Originally Montgomery Clift was to do the part, but at the last minute he said no, feeling that this was to similar a part to the one he played in The Heiress. Wilder then went through the list of contract leading men at Paramount.Wilder saw something in Holden, God bless him. Holden had done a whole series of what he termed 'smiling Jim' roles. He was considered an amiable and non-threatening leading man. Although he had done well in a role as a psychotic killer in The Dark Past, Sunset Boulevard brought him his first real acclaim as an actor. An Academy Award nomination came with the acclaim.Nancy Olson and Erich Von Stroheim were nominated in the Best Supporting Player categories as was Swanson for Best Actress. Von Stroheim was another inspired choice. His is a strange part indeed. He was Desmond's first director in silent films and left his career behind to take care of her. He was also her first husband. Sunset Boulevard for it's time and with the Code firmly in place was a brutal look at the sexual needs of a middle-aged woman. Before Holden knows it, he's giving up his life as an aspiring screenwriter to be a kept gigolo. He doesn't like it, but can't leave it. When he does, it results in tragedy.Nancy Olson plays a reader at Paramount studios where Holden is trying to sell a script. She and Holden had good chemistry and after this they did four more films together. Casting Cecil B. DeMille as himself was of necessity for who could play the great DeMille, but DeMille. DeMille in fact was a former actor and playwright at the turn of the last century. In his autobiography DeMille lets us in on a private joke. He in fact did direct many of Gloria Swanson's early silent films and a pet name he had for her was 'young fella.' Note that when Norma Desmond comes to the Paramount lot to see him, he greets her with that same expression. Note that DeMille got a plug for his own film Samson and Delilah which was in production at the same time. It is the set of that film where Swanson and DeMille meet.You will never forget the finely etched characters of Sunset Boulevard. You can see it many times as I've done, but if you see it only once you will have it burned in your memory. Especially that last scene before the newsreel cameras where Swanson loses whatever sanity she has left. She descends down the stairs of her mansion and descends into the comfort of insanity.I've often wondered should a sequel have been done covering the trial of Norma Desmond. I'm sure Billy Wilder wanted to move on to other projects. Still that would have been a film to see.</fullReview>

Birth of a Nation, Some Like it Hot and Sunset Blvd. Of the three, I found that two were still great and this is one of them. (BoaN was the clunker, in my opinion). As timely today as it ever was, all of the archetypes presented ring true and could be cut from today's cloth as well as the vintage vicuna of Gigolo Joe's overcoat. The dialogue sparkles, the acting impresses, the direction stands out (some tracking shots are among the best ever committed to celluloid). Often imitated, never surpassed, it's as good as its hype.

		<shortDescription>Wilder's masterpiece: A vintage look at a Hollywood that is no more.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the very beginning of this film, with the external shot of the corpse floating in the outdoor pool, the audience gets sucked in. Sunset Boulevard is a fantastic example of artistry gone horribly wrong and selling yourself out for the betterment of yourself. All four main characters, Norma, Joe, Max and Betty are definite characterizations of four different types of person in Hollywood. Norma is of course the faded silent screen star so desperate upon making a comeback that in essence it just kills her and everyone around her. Joe is the down and out, very desperate screenwriter who stumbles upon Norma and falls head first under her spell. By the time he gets sucked into her web, it is almost madness as to why he cannot extricate himself from her grip. Max is the humble butler, who unlike so many other people has come crawling back to Norma because he simply cannot live without her. So, in essence he takes a menial job just to continue to stay with her in one form or another. Betty is the one ray of sunlight in an otherwise dark and foreboding world that threatens to crush anyone that gets ensnared in it for too long (i. e. the Hollywood system). But even so, her light is almost snuffed out towards the end of the film. We never really get to see what happens to her afterwards.I think what makes this film so great is its ability to wear its heart upon its sleeve. It is an unflinching portrait of what Hollywood once was (and is no longer) but some of the vestiges from this film can still be seen today. The bitterness and the knife-edge cynicism (not to mention the acting) is what, I think, draws so many people back to it for repeated viewings, myself included. For even if we've seen this film before, we can always see it again and pick up on certain things that we never noticed the first time around. For example, the home that the filmmakers used as Norma's mansion was also used a few years later in Nicholas Ray's Rebel Without A Cause. Gloria Swanson gives a heart-rending performance as Norma Desmond, the silent screen star so desperate to make a comeback. This film was sort of a "comeback" for her, having been out of the public eye since the early thirties. She albeit succeeded but however, she failed to win the coveted Best Actress award at the Oscars that year (1951). The prize even eluded both Bette Davis and Anne Baxter from All About Eve and went to newcomer Judy Holliday as ditzy blonde Billie Dawn in Born Yesterday. Frankly, putting both Swanson and Davis in the same category, I have to say that Bette Davis did actually give the better performance that year, but Swanson's Norma is still a character and a force to be reckoned with!Sunset Boulevard lost out to All About Eve, the Hollywood masterpiece about the Broadway stage, at the Oscars that year. Hollywood wasn't ready to award itself because some people didn't care for the way that the film was portraying itself (showing the dark, seamy side). I, however, still love this film and will always love this film because I think it shows Wilder at his most perfect, most distinctive period in his life.This is a true classic. Get this one on DVD as soon as you can!My rating: 4 stars.</fullReview>

Thus, begins this complex tale of love and desperation, courtesy of Billy Wilder and Co. Swanson is eerie and sympathetic in her portrayal of Norma Desmond. Everyone else is great, but it is Swanson who "grabs" the attention. Strongly recommened!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alright Mr. DeMille, I'm ready for my close-up.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is among the best and most tragic exit lines in film. And it also leads directly to the best conclusion (I feel) in movies in terms of proper cinematography: the clouding of the focus as Norma Desmond descends the staircase into her madness. Rarely does a film end so satisfactorily and perfectly.SUNSET BLVD. was not the first film to look at the uncertainties of cinematic success and fame. A STAR IS BORN had done so in the in 1937. It showed how as a star is nurtured by the system to great fame, another prominent star descends into oblivion and death. So why (if the story theme was not new) was SUNSET BLVD. such a tremendous hit and classic from it's first appearance in 1950? It boiled down to this: the personal poison of the great fame of the silent screen star Norma was not mirrored precisely in the fall of say Norman Main (although their two first names bear an uncanny resemblance). Norman had always had a drinking problem which he never controlled. Norma was not into that - she was always into a healthy physical lifestyle (except for smoking), but the effect of her publicity and the fan mail pushed her egomania to great heights. It made her so egocentric that she can only think of the people around her in her immediate cycle as the greatest representatives of all those millions of unseen fans - the wonderful people out there in the dark. They are there for her adoration only. Norman Main, in comparison, did find a measure of happiness in Vicki Lester, whom he discovered and helped to find her true potential. He was more selfless, to the point (as it turned out) of self-destruction. Not really like Norma Desmond. To her people are there to serve Gods and Goddesses called stars.One might also notice that Joe Gillis is not Vicki Lester. Joe and Vicki were both ambitious, but Joe really wasn't as interested in Norma (aside from giving him room, board, and a temporary job), as Vicki was in Norman. There was a mutual attraction there (Norman was not incredibly older than Vicki, as opposed to Norma's older age compared to Joe's). Joe also had his girlfriend/collaborator Betty Schaeffer. Vicki had no other lover on the outside - it was only Norman. That is why, when he commits suicide, Vicki goes into seclusion.There is a triangular figure in SUNSET BLVD. for Norma, in her butler Max Von Mayerling. He had been her first director and husband, and he is also (in his over-devotion to her) feeding her ego by writing hundreds of fan letters to her to keep her emotionally happy. It is a sign of her insanity that she never notices that the letters are written by the same hand. Wilder had used Eric Von Stroheim in FIVE GRAVES TO CAIRO as Rommel, so he knew what it was like working with him. Supposedly when Von Stroheim was being directed by Billy Wilder he wanted to throw in various tics and sexual habits for Max (like his carefully washing Norma's underclothes) which Wilder managed to push aside. Von Stroheim's performance (one of his greatest) was not harmed by these cuts, although one wonders what his performance would have seemed like if they had been retained. But by reducing the neurotic behavior of Max (to just his pathetic need to be near Norma to support her) it keeps us concentrating on Norma's psychosis - where it should be.Norma is the driving force to the end, pulling the wires that manipulate Max, Joe, Betty, even (out of a sense of pity) Cecil B. DeMille and his production staff (example: the light man "Hogeye"). Even with the "waxwork" friends who crop up for cards, Norma seems to be in control (they all congregate to see her - the richest among them). Even with people who are supposedly independent (the funeral home people who cater to her burying her pet monkey; the salesman on commission who urges Joe to buy the vicu?a coat) she manages to keep this control. She is the central sun/"Star" in this galaxy - and cannot brook any deviation. The rejection of the ungrateful Joe can only be appeased physically by his death, and emotionally by her mind clouding that failure and it's aftermath from her memory. From the start of the film, with all her egocentricity at work, only a psychic slap in the face was missing to complete the tragedy. Then she was finally ready for that close-up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was the first of Billy Wilder's work I've even seen, sure I've heard of him, just not seen any of his movies. Made in the fifty's "Sunset Blvd." is simply timeless &amp; it's easy to see why this movie of a washed up writer/ turned gigolo to a washed-up has-been actress is rated so highly. A superb indictment of everything that's wrong and distasteful about Hollywood and probably even truer now that it actually was when it was made. This film is also crammed with in-jokes and references that practically beg for multiple viewings. The acting by everyone is perfect &amp; this movie is such a wonder to behold.DVD Extras: Audio commentary with author of "On Sunset Boulevard: The Life And Times Of Billy Wilder" Ed Sikov ; Three featureless ("The Making Of Sunset Boulevard"; "The Music Of Sundet Boulevard", and "Edith Head: The Paramount Years") ;Morgue prologue; "Hollywood Location" map;Photo galleries; Theatrical trailerMy Grade: A+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sunset Blvd. (1950) ****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this picture was definitely more deserving of "Best Picture" of 1950 than ALL ABOUT EVE. Probably it was the more "offbeat" nature of this film in those times that worked against it, much like THE EXORCIST didn't have a chance of winning Best Picture in 1973 (I think THE STING and even American GRAFFITI were better, though). A magnificent film, with great direction by Billy Wilder, and a fine cast. Gloria Swanson initially struck me as way over the top and wild-eyed at first, but given the whole nature of the proceedings, it's kind of understandable. William Holden is perfect as the desperate house guest, and Nancy Olson is the ideal girl-next-door. Eric von Stroheim is striking as Swanson's butler. A keeper that I'll seek out for myself on DVD, I'd place SUNSET BLVD. as one of the best films ever made, and it will occupy a position in my personal Top 100. **** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers. Sometimes lousy movies can be redeemed through means of a plenitude of epigrams sprinkled on the script. This one has all the classic tag lines. "We had faces then." "I am still big; it's the pictures that got small." "Ready for my closeup, Mr. DeMille." "The audience doesn't know that someone writes the words; they think the actors make them up as they go along." And some lousy movies have little, barely noticeable touches that redeem them. Gillis storms out of Norma Desmond's house on New Years Eve after an argument, leaving his kept existence forever, but his long watch fob gets caught on the doorknob as he exits. (He'll be beck.) Norma visits a set on the Paramount lot for the first time in twenty years and, asked to sit and watch a rehearsal, the microphone on its boom brushes against her feathery hat and she shoves it away with irritation. And that last devastating dissolve.But this movie doesn't need that kind of redemption. The script -- the entire film -- is a classic that stands on its own two feet. Gloria Swanson's performance is overblown, as it should be. Von Stroheim -- or, let's call a spade a spade, plain Stroheim -- brings to his role the starchy oblige that he showed in "Grand Illusion." Holden will be remembered probably for three roles: "The Bridge on the River Kwai," "Picnic," and this. Brackett's script is well above average, even with its use of a voice-over, given by a dead man. Pat Olsen is mouth wateringly beautiful. She went on to make several other movies with Holden, none of them as good as this. The photography and art direction also stand out. This is one REALLY rotting mansion. Everything is out of date, from Buster Keaton to the tiny roach clip Norma Desmond wears on her finger when she smokes.Amid the bizarre melodrama there is one quiet, simple scene I always find appealing. Holden and Olsen are on a dark, deserted city street on Paramount's back lot, and she tells him she once had her nose fixed. He playfully leans down, examines it, and kisses it lightly. Then he backs away a few inches and warns her never to let him get closer than two feet. If he does, she should hit him with her shoe. Holden never indicates more than a momentary physical attraction, combined with a realization that he'd better not push the envelope. He later tells us he's "crazy about her" but we don't believe him. But in this effective and signal scene, Olsen's expression never changes. Her smile is sweet, agreeable, alert, and curious -- without in any way welcoming more intimacy. It all sounds rudimentary but it's tough to put this kind of exchange over and both performers do it splendidly. The story is elementary. Gillis, a failed screenwriter, is adopted by Norma Desmond, a rich but forgotten star of the silent days ("Oil wells in Bakersfield -- they keep pumping and pumping and pumping"), and he succumbs to greed, letting her buy him vicuna coats and "evening clothes" and whatever, in return for which he supplies the only thing she needs and he has to offer. But he doesn't do so without loathing himself. And when he falls for another girl, he decides to reject everything, Norma and girl friend and vicuna coat included, and go back to Dayton, Ohio. He doesn't make it. Everything about the story, Gillis's death included, is comic in a way, acerbic may be better, but very dark too. Wilder could be a phenomenally good director when the right script came his way, and this is an instance.</fullReview>

I am also sorry that "All About Eve" won Best Picture that year. Of course "Eve" is a great movie, but its not this.This movie is part of our collective memory and most of the dialogue continues to be quoted even today.

		<shortDescription>"Mr. Wilder, I'm ready for my close-up"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett were about the best writing team in Hollywood for more than three decades. "Sunset Boulevard" shows the men at the pinnacle of their profession. Billy Wilder directed the film with his usual panache at this nostalgic look at a Hollywood that had faded almost a quarter of a century before. If you haven't seen the film, please stop reading here.With the advent of the "talkies" a lot of film stars of the silent era lost their privileged positions as the most admired people in movies. When the new generation appeared in the scene, they were more accessible to the fans that flocked to see the new technique in the movies that came out. One of those movies stars, Norma Desmond, lives in the past as she never adapted to the new reality, which is evident in the way she stays out of the scene dwelling in her antiquated castle on Sunset Boulevard.Enter Joe Gillis, the man who never made it into the industry. As a writer, all his screen plays were rejected by the studio machinery because they were not what the heads of the production departments wanted to produce, or just were plain, not interested. Joe Gillis comes into the Desmond mansion by accident and it's an accident he encounters on his way out of it! Tbe egotistical Norma Desmond lives in the her palatial home with Max Von Mayerberg, the loyal servant, who was himself, somebody in the silent era. Norma falls for the young Gillis in ways she never expected, but as a desperate woman she wants to possess what she can't otherwise buy, even a man going through financial bad times the way Joe Gillis is.Billy Wilder got magnificent performances out of the three principals. William Holden had one of the best opportunities of his film career with Joe Gillis, a character he wasn't even scheduled to play, but which Montgomery Cliff handed to him in a silver platter when he refused to appear in the picture! Gloria Swanson, having experienced that old Hollywood, was a natural choice to play Norma, which was perhaps, the crowning role in her distinguished career. Erich Von Stroheim, the great director, himself, is absolutely wonderful as Von Mayerling.We see some of the silent era stars such as Buster Keaton, Hedda Hopper, Anne C. Nilsson, H.B. Warner, as well as Cecil B. DeMille, the director of Hollywood epics par excellence.The great musical score of Franz Waxman enhances the film. John Seitz black and white photography brings us back to that time. Ultimately, it's the genius of Billy Wilder that keeps things in balance showing a man who understood movies as perhaps the only one that could have directed the classic "Sunset Boulevard".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some observations re the film:The frequent imageries of death:Rats in the pool; The dead chimp; the decaying mansion; Norma's fellow 'silent-film' card ? players (referred to as the 'waxworks').The mansion possibly being indicative of an old 'Hollywood' ? and all its inhabitants ? crumbling. The same argument could be afforded to the old car.The derision conferred on Norma's age of '50&#x2032; years ? as compared to today's women ? and the accompanying notion of what she was capable of at '50&#x2032;.The novelty in 1950 of a women 'keeping' hack actor/writer Joe Gillis. (Note the smirk on the salesman's face when Norma is buying Joe clothes).Possibly the best imitation-cameo of Charlie Chaplin ever. ? by Norma for Joe's amusement. He looks more bemused than amused-this sort of 'aside' in the film presenting so well because of Waxman's flawless score.The impossibility of classifying this picture in to one category ? (horror, film noir, social commentary?) -It's really one of a kind ? a savage expose of Hollywood -possibly not receiving as many awards as it would have for this very reason.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*possible spoilers*What can I say in praise of this wonderful film that others haven't already? Certainly the acting's amazing, and the direction creative. The script contains many unforgettable lines others have already quoted here.What I can say is that this film is modern in a way no other film of its time really is. Each time I've seen it I can't beleive it's from 1950, its thematic elements just seem so fresh. Sunset Boulevard may seem familar to us with our current cultural obsession with celebrity and especially celebrity downfalls. We watch the E! True Hollywood Story, Star Dates, and the lowest nadir of all, Celebrity Boxing. I don't any other film, fact or fiction, has equalled this film in treating the theme of Hollywood's dangers.At the end of the film Norma Desmond, with the newsreel cameras on her, is sickly elated at being back in the celluloid eye, despite the fact she'd just killed her lover. The fact that celebrities today humiliate themselves on second rate cable networks and Fox spectacles attests to the outright addiction of fame.William Holden's character also attests to the oft-invoked "Boulevard of broken dreams." This is a theme explored recently by David Lynch in Mulholland Drive (which I think owes something to Sunset Boulevard), though not as successfully. So, to add to the praises others here have heaped upon it and Billy Wilder, I would say that this film's surprising relevance could make it accessible to those who might not fancy older films. If you want to start watching classics but are looking for a good starting point, look no further.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE film that speaks Old Hollywood!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film industry obviously did not know what had hit it when Billy Wilder's masterpiece was released in 1950. Fifty years later, such mastery in craftmanship still shows by still being fresh and alive, evident from the first of the unforgettable reels when William Holden's character, an unknown writer, is lying face down and dead in the pool of an extremely possessive star of the silent screen. Although not my favourite of Billy Wilder's works, ("Witness for the Prosecution" is my own special favourite), this was not actually the first time he had stirred Hollywood. "The Lost Weekend", a film more scarce in its circulation but just as brilliant, had five years before almost lost a release because the type of slap-in-the-face reality was something audiences were unused to. And it eventually went on to be the best picture of 1945. However, by casting light on an industry still even seen today as the perfection of life, the Paramount studios caused an uproar from coast to coast.One of the more interesting contenders at the Oscars "Sunset" had that year was "All About Eve". The Bette Davis/Anne Baxter film did eventually take the coveted prize best picture prize, but it is obvious that "Eve" too runs along pretty similar lines, but instead of shattering the myth about the golden days of the silver screen which went for the throat, the 20th Century Fox executives gave it a gentler shape by provocatively going after the theatre. Haunting music and even the black and white cinematography made me feel I was in for a special ride as the opening credits rolled. William Holden was in one of his best roles. This movie unfortunately made Gloria Swanson be better remembered by us as the tragic aging movie queen of the silent era, who was one of the many actors and actresses who phased out as the sound picture experiments became a sensation. Featured also are Erich von Stroheim as the first husband turned servant and Nancy Olsen as the young girl writing collaborator. All four received Academy Award nominations, though none won. Cecil B. De Mille, one of the great directors of the silent era puts in an appearance on the featured Paramount lot as himself.The screen play, as in all great Billy Wilder movies, is gripping and fiercely brilliant. Just some of the emotions captured on film, and some of the darker imagery has made it one of the best films of the 1950s, and one of the best movies in Hollywood history. "Singin' In the Rain" may have made it better known to us with the use of colour, dance and song, but it did not even go anywhere near "Sunset" despite the bitter sweet sensation the musical gem leaves. Deservedly so, this cinematic genius is first rate.Rating: 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The advent of the talkies created possibly the biggest-ever upheaval in the history of Hollywood and the impact it had on the careers of a large number of the industry's popular stars at that time was enormous. Many whose voices seemed unacceptable because they were incompatible with their image or because of a heavy foreign accent, found themselves out of work as did others who were simply unable to adapt to the demands of the new era. Billy Wilder's "Sunset Boulevard" provides a fascinating insight into some of the more ruthless and unpleasant facets of the Hollywood system in a style that's witty, cynical and realistic and also features a number of actors whose careers were profoundly affected by the arrival of the talkies.Joe Gillis (William Holden), a struggling Hollywood screenwriter with more debts than he can handle becomes involved in a high-speed chase when he tries to avoid the attentions of a couple of guys who are intent on repossessing his car. When one of his tyres blows out, he swiftly turns into the driveway of a run down mansion and successfully evades his pursuers. After parking his vehicle in the garage, he's surprised that the occupants of the mansion seem to be expecting him. It soon transpires that they'd assumed that he was the mortician who was due to deliver a coffin in which the lady of the house's dead chimpanzee was to be buried. Joe recognises the lady as Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) a former silent movie star.When Norma discovers that Joe's a writer, she seeks his opinion of a script she'd written for her comeback movie ("Salome") and then hires him to edit her work. In his financial circumstances the offer of this lucrative job is too good to refuse and at her request, he agrees to stay at her mansion to complete the task. Joe recognises that Norma is a delusional has-been who lives in the past and discovers that the fan mail she receives every week is actually written by her devoted butler, Max (Erich von Stroheim). The very wealthy Norma buys Joe expensive new suits and coats and together they watch her old movies a few times each week. Even more bizarrely, on New Year's Eve, she holds a party at which there's an orchestra but no other guests! Joe feels he needs to escape from Norma who's obviously fallen in love with him and so goes to a friend's party instead.Artie Green (Jack Webb) agrees for Joe to stay over at his place and Joe soon gets into conversation with Artie's girlfriend, Betty Schaefer (Nancy Olsen). Joe already knew Betty who worked as a script reader for Paramount and the two of them subsequently start to work together on one of Joe's unfinished scripts. When Norma discovers what's going on, she becomes incensed and determined to bring their association to an end.The most striking feature of "Sunset Boulevard" is its sharp dialogue and numerous quotable lines which vary from the purely witty to the deeply sardonic. The fact that these lines are delivered by a screenwriter and a particularly flamboyant retired actress makes their exchanges seem perfectly credible as both characters would naturally have developed a way with words during their careers.The film's opening scene in which Joe is seen dead and face down in Norma's swimming pool is brilliantly shot and the off-beat device of having a dead man narrating the story is typical of the cynicism and dark humour that runs through everything that follows. At this point, when objectively talking about himself, Joe in typical style remarks "the poor dope. He always wanted a pool. Well, in the end, he got himself a pool".The casting of Gloria Swanson and Erich von Stroheim who both had careers in silent movies, invests the events depicted with a great deal of realism as do the cameos in which Cecil B DeMille, Hedda Hopper, Buster Keaton and others are featured. Shots of Paramount studios and Schwab's Drugstore and the inclusion of an excerpt from "Queen Kelly" (1929) in which Swanson starred and von Stroheim directed also blur the lines between fiction and reality and add greater authenticity to the whole production."Sunset Boulevard" focuses on some of the more unglamourous aspects of Hollywood and must've made uncomfortable viewing for some people in the industry at that time. Its blend of biting humour and tragedy is very effective and the performances of its exceptional cast are consistently good from start to finish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know when occasionally you watch a film, and you think it sounds okay, but then it totally exceeds your expectations and you're just blown away by it? Well, Sunset Boulevard (aka Sunset Blvd.) was just such a film for me.William Holden ? who also narrates the film ? plays Joe Gillis, a small-time screen writer, down on both money and luck; as we find out right at the beginning of the film, Gillis won't be alive by the end of it. He meets former silent movie star Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), who cannot and will not accept the truth that her star has long since faded into obscurity and she has been all but forgotten by both the film industry, and movie-goers. Determined to have another hit film, she hires Joe to help her edit her self-penned script, but she soon becomes obsessed with him, and Joe finds himself less a guest, more a prisoner, at her dilapidated home, with only Norma and her mysterious butler Max for company.As you may have guessed, I loved this film. The storyline is a caustic and witty dig at a fickle Hollywood. The fact that viewers are informed by Joe's voice-over right at the start of the film, that he will not survive to the end, fills the ensuing scenes with a bitter sense of doom, and the contrast between Joe the narrator, who knows his fate, and Joe the character who we see on camera, who is unaware of what will befall him, is very effective (A similar idea was used years later in American Beauty, also with excellent results, although Sunset Boulevard was, for me, a much better film.)Gloria Swanson was excellent as Norma Desmond, and at times was difficult to watch. I disliked her character, but couldn't help feeling great sympathy for her. Deserted by her fans and her colleagues, she is losing her grip on reality. At times, she was manic and unpredictable; at other times, she showed tenderness and extreme vulnerability (the scene where she entertains Joe by dressing up as Charlie Chaplin is both sweet and disturbing, as her happy mood turns to anger). Swanson was nominated for an Oscar for her performance; the same year Bette Davis was nominated for her role in All About Eve ? both lost out to Judy Holliday for her role in Born Yesterday, which also starred William Holden. He was also nominated for Sunset Boulevard.William Holden shows his real talent for acting here. A not altogether likable character at the beginning of the film, he nevertheless gets the audience on side, as he and they come to realise the untenable situation in which he has found himself. He imbues his character with passion, tenderness, ruthlessness, and resignation ? oh, and he's darkly funny too.Eric von Stroheim is perfectly cast as Norma's taciturn and mysterious butler ? this role could easily have been a caricature in different hands, but he plays the part brilliantly.The main cast is rounded out by Nancy Olsen as Betty Schaefer, a young writer who wants Joe's help on a script; she is perfectly cast as a feisty but tender young woman who is dragged into Joe's nightmare world.In short, my opinion for what it's worth, is that there is absolutely nothing wrong with this film. It's gripping ? I felt unable to turn my eyes away from the screen; it's sad, it's tragic, and it's bleakly funny. It was a real victory for director Billy Wilder, and it's the best film I've seen in a long time. Very highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alright Sunset BLVD, are you ready for your close up?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is still big. It's the pictures that got small. There is nothing like watching Sunset Boulevard. It's a great movie that need to be in the center of attention. Name after a Boulevard in Los Angeles, this film noir was directed and co-written by Billy Wilder who destroy forever the iconic Hollywood image with his dark tale of greed, and the lust of everlasting fame. The film stars William Holden as Joe Gillis, an unsuccessful screenwriter who happen to come upon, a faded silent movie starlet, Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) who draws him into her fantasy world where she dreams of making a triumphant return to the screen. William Holden is great in the role as a man struggling to keep his masculinity. I like his moral decision in the end of the film. Serve them right. In a way, this movie was indeed William Holden comeback film as well as he fallen from the starlight after 1939's Golden Boys. Gloria Swanson is scary, charming and brilliant in the Femme fatale manipulative role. She does over act a bit, but that comes with the part. She's pretty much playing an extreme version of herself. Gloria, herself was trying to have a comeback with this film, after a number of fails films, include one with Director Erich von Stroheim in 1929's Queen Kelly. Art is mirroring real life, as Erich von Stroheim stars as Max Von Mayerling, her butler and the director that discovered her. There is even a chilling theater scene with all the main characters watching the film, Queen Kelly. Erich von Stroheim is just amazing in this film, and I have become a fan of his works. I didn't like Nancy Olson so much as Betty Schaefer as I felt she was way too chirpy for my taste and in your face shouting acting. I do like the silent film stars cameos like Director Cecil B. DeMille, Buster Keaton, H. B. Warner and Anna Q. Nilsson. I do like the cameo of the set of 1949's DeMille's Samson and Delilah. It makes the film seems more real to Hollywood, to know that another real life film was really taking place there. While, the characters could had been nearly unlikeable, Billy Wilder's comedy charm gives this movie some room to breathe. I have to praise the writing. It's amazing. Yes, some of the jokes went over my head, but the film was balance well enough for the drama and the comedy, not to feel overloaded. The narrative of film noirs are usually characterized as multifaceted and often confusing. It does commonly entailing the use of flashback and first-person voice-over narration. I'm pretty glad they open the film with the shot of the swimming pool, rather than having two corpses talking to each other at the morgue. I think it does sound stupid so I'm glad they use the dead body in the swimming pool idea. The corpse floating in the pool in the film's opening scene. The desired image proved difficult to achieve, and the problem was resolved by placing mirrors on the bottom of the swimming pool and filming from above. The underwater shot was pretty impressed at the time. The visual effects are amazing. Sunset Boulevard uses a lot of high-contrast lighting in Norma's house that creates dark shadows that works well. The lighting and the setting is to show the character is suffocating in their life. Norma is ever looking for the light. I love the foggy blur that it create when people get near it. It's symbolism at its best. The film also contains some German-expressionistic element such as the oblique vertical and horizontal angles. For some interior shots, the crew sprinkled dust in front of the camera before filming to suggest dirty or unclean. The house was old, and nice. The way the photographs were surrounding. It look like some odd Gothic church. The house was later used by Nicholas Ray's 1955's Rebel Without a Cause. It was pretty interesting. The score was composed by Franz Waxman was pretty good. Nothing worth noting compare to today's standards. It was just OK, at best for me. Here are some faults in the film in my opinion. The narrating goes a little bit too long. Show, don't tell. Plus, how do dead-men can do a narration anyways? Aren't they dead? The whole blooming Gillis-Betty relationship seem out of place as well. I know it's needed for the plot, but it's seem forced. I just don't see Betty having much interested in a man, she barely sees. The story was a bit influence by the real life tragedy of Mabel Normand and William Desmond Taylor, in which William Desmond got shot and killed. This film marks the first time that Hollywood was view in a negative light on film. The theme of this movie is that Hollywood creates dreams and stars, and then leaves them with nothing but their own outdated fantasies. In the other side of the coin, some people are so hungry for the fame, that they are willing to do anything for a shot at it, even destroying lives. Hollywood still love and hate the film for its criticism of the movie industry. It's still a bit controversial, ever today. Wilder show us the real Hollywood where few people had success and many fails. People mustn't starve for fame too long, else they risk being trapped in a world of their own making, a world where they become bitter and delude.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that I would put in my Top 10 Best list.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this film and can't believe I never got around to reviewing it until now, as I've seen it many times. I think I just assumed that I'd written a review for it or neglected to do one since it already has so many good reviews. Regardless, it's one of the best films ever--and possibly the best film Hollywood has to offer--it's THAT good.I think part of the reason I love this film so much is because it has perhaps the best opening scene in movie history. I adored the film's style and originality here. You hear William Holden narrating--narrating in a wonderfully cynical manner. And, as the camera pans down, you see a corpse floating in a pool. Suddenly, the camera is under water--and you see that the dead man is the narrator himself!! What an amazingly daring scene! And, to seemingly top it off, Norma Desmond's entrance is just sublime. But then you see that the film then works BACKWARD to explain how all this came to be--a truly wonderful style of storytelling! I could talk more about the film, but to me the beginning was THE film. Sure, Holden, Swanson and Von Stroheim were wonderful as well as Jack Webb in an interesting supporting role...but all you will probably remember is the introduction. And the directing and writing is wonderful...but you still keep coming back to the wonderful scene.The bottom line is that all would-be film makers should be forced to watch this film and learn from it. And, if such a thing COULD be done, let's also force them to watch "12 Angry Men", De Sica's "Children Are Watching Us", Majidi's "The Color of Paradise", and.......</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With a medium like cinema, which had such a distinct and holistic culture all of its own, it is bound sooner or later to lose itself in nostalgia. Either that or cynical self-parody. Sunset Boulevard is not about the way motion pictures were ? it is about the way motion picture people were, and continued to be.Indeed, the style of Sunset Boulevard was the very epitome of modern film-making ? voice-over narration, fluid camera-work, crisp cinematography. These contemporary trappings really serve to deepen the contrast and sharpen the disrespectful onslaught upon the olden days. Take the protagonist voice-over, something writers Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett really made an art of. It may often be functional, cutting corners in the narrative or elucidating on screen events, but more often than not it is superfluous to the story, and acts as a kind of enjoyably wry commentary on proceedings. It's a stylistic layer as much as the overstuffed set design and chiaroscuro lighting.Director Billy Wilder is often said (by Ed Sikov for example) to be someone who "does not call attention to the shot". On the contrary, he actually constantly grabs us with the images. While he was never fond of obvious trickery, Wilder loves the weirdness of natural effects ? such as Swanson's face skull-like in her sunglasses, or the close-up on her spinning parasol which begins the bathing beauties routine. He is great at filling the shot with "clues" and reminders, bringing them to our attention at the right moment ? such as those holes in the doors where the locks should be, which a line in the dialogue has made us associate with suicide attempts.But this is really a movie about stars, and central to Sunset Boulevard is the performance by Gloria Swanson. It was incredibly brave of Swanson to play such a brazen caricature of the kind of woman she could have become. But she brings all her long-standing talent and the knowledge of experience into the role. Norma Desmond is as much a creation of Swanson as she is of Wilder and Brackett. She has the kind of sleek, animalistic movement of a silent-era vamp, but tinges it with a frank depiction of middle-aged indignity. Her acting may be exaggerated and far from realistic, but remember she is playing a woman for whom life has become an act. Swanson is hammy because hamminess is real for that character. She clearly knew exactly what she was doing and what the pictures was about. Compare that to DeMille, who really had no sense of irony, and it's amazing he agreed to appear here. His performance is assuredly naturalistic (and ironically far better than most of what passes for acting in his own pictures), although that is also perfect for the part he plays here ? being himself! Whether or not he had agreed to appear, DeMille would have been a central figure to this story. He was really the sole survivor of the silent era; the only individual ? star, producer or director ? from that time who was still a top dog. And although Sunset Boulevard sets its sights on the Hollywood of yesteryear, it was really the Hollywood of 1950 that Wilder and Brackett were gunning for. Like Norma Desmond, the post-war industry had passed its heyday and was really living off the receipts of its past glories. The studio system was crumbling, and TV was encroaching on its territory just as sound had encroached on Norma's thirty years earlier. It was now the more modest productions by younger, free-spirited filmmakers ? productions like Sunset Boulevard itself ? that were beginning to rise to the surface.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With Sunset Boulevard film noir hit it's crescendo. The genre would linger on, but only as an echo of it's former self, like wind blowing through an old pipe organ. This story of a down on his luck Hollywood screenwriter and his peril fraught associations with a fading silent film star plotting her return to the big screen has all the things a noir fan loves; dark mysterious places, a near constant sense of looming danger, rapid and smart dialog and great narration by William Holden. But the film is about more than that. It is about the rough and perilous life that goes with any work in a business as tumultuous as Hollywood, and the unpredictable nature of celebrity. This is Hollywood shining a spotlight on itself and when the cameras aren't rolling, and the makeup isn't on, it can be a very ugly place indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>She Doesn't Want To Be Alone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Sunset Blvd." is the funniest movie ever made about the saddest of human conditions, loneliness.Struggling screenwriter Joe Gillis (William Holden) bounces around Hollywood like a pinball, flipped at every turn by the big wheels who ignore his attempts to latch onto their world. Only the repo men want his company. Then he finds himself in the mansion of forgotten screen legend Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), decked out as a memorial to someone not yet dead. Norma believes the world awaits her return ("I hate that word," she says of "comeback"). In her effort to elude time's heartless march, she abandons sanity and bids Joe join her.Billy Wilder's film is a satire of Hollywood with a nod in the direction of Evelyn Waugh's "The Loved One" (Norma initially assumes Joe is here to help bury her pet chimp). As a satire it scores points, but it's as a twisted love story that it makes its mark as a cinematic masterpiece. Norma fantasizes about her comeback, but it's her love of Joe that destroys her. Everyone talks about Joe's self-loathing as a foregone conclusion of his finding himself in Norma's presence and turning himself into a gigolo, but I think he's always carrying that dislike around, his self-inflicted price for failing to achieve what he wants from life and a prison of loneliness every bit as desolate as Norma's mansion. One might wonder to what extent that, more than Norma, serves as his ruin.It's also a marvelous black comedy, both of tone and out-and-out belly laughs, whether it's Joe getting unsolicited advice in the men's clothing shop ("As long as the lady is paying for it, why not take the Vicuna?") or his narrating how gentle people get with a person after he's dead. Holden's especially great in his voice-over work, letting every line stick with just the right amount of emphasis, and no hint of actorliness.Swanson's all actorliness, of course, in that magnificent way of hers which provides so much of the empathy and madcap zaniness to the film. Like Gene Wilder in "Young Frankenstein," she draws you in with her amazing eyes and makes you laugh and cringe simultaneously at her most emotive outbursts. It's a comic showcase from one not known for comedy, or for working in sound.Was Norma always this affected? A glimpse of her in one of her old movies (Swanson again, in her unreleased "Queen Kelly") shows a retrained, luminous presence not at all like the Norma we meet in the story. If this Norma played anyone on the silent screen, it would have more likely been Nosferatu. Just watch those hands of hers twist and pull, especially when she's drawing Joe deeper in her web.Norma doesn't mean to harm Joe. She just has no idea how real relationships work. To her, like mad Max her butler (Erich von Stroheim, a curiously shifting centerpiece whose true nature drives the point home), keeping people around is all that keeps her from a chasm of despair. When she talks to Joe, or addresses her imagined audience, it's not with the coldness of a user but real heart and soul. Unlike Garbo, she most emphatically does not want to be alone, and we can't help but like her for it."Sunset Blvd." makes a subtle, brilliant case that staving off loneliness to such a degree makes for a sickness all its own. I'm not sure whether or not that's the most depressing thing about the film, but it certainly adds to the power of its singular sting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolute Perfection</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sunset Blvd. is a terrifyingly realistic portrayal of a washed up movie silent screen star and her quest to rekindle her popularity... and a poor writer on the run from the police who gets involved with her. The story starts backwards: you see a man floating face down in the water, and so the story begins... how it all started.Norma Desmond is a character that you hate, love and feel sorry for all at the same time... she is very selfish, self absorbed and needy. But I felt a strong pang of sympathy when Norma talks about her script for Salome... how she has such high hopes about her comeback. She just wants to be loved again. I could not imagine anyone else playing Norma Desmond.. Gloria Swanson plays it to perfection. William Holden is great also - and I didn't realize this until someone mentioned it to me, but playing such a casual, nonchalant character such as he did against such a strong character of Norma is quite challenging. He did it wonderfully and delivered the lines with ease.After watching it the first time, I watched the bits I wasn't sure of - I was sure if I liked the lines the way they were delivered - and it grew on me. For example, I always imagined the magnificent last line delivered more slowly than Swanson did it... but as I watched it again, I began to like it more and more. Now that I have watched it twice, I cannot really find anything wrong with this movie. It has it all: drama, romance, two fantastic actors, comedy, emotions of sympathy, hate, greed, lust... I would say this one of the top 5 movies of all time, if not the top.After I saw this for the first time, there was a wonderful feeling as if I had just seen a special bit of movie history... and I was a part of that history. I don't know how to explain it, but it was a great feeling that cannot be described. This can appeal to all ages, from 12 and upward's I'd say! A true Hollywood masterpiece - they don't make 'em like this anymore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thrilling and disturbing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever since "Double indemnity" I've been a big fan of Billy Wilder and so I was curious to see this classic movie. "Sunset Blvd." turned out to be even more impressive.There is something deeply haunting about this picture. Right at the beginning it leaves little doubt as to its tragic ending. And although the development of the action looks predictable there is not a single moment of dragging. The movie is about Norma Desmond, a heroine from the silent movie area who hasn't realized that she has been long forgotten by the audience. Now she wants to make a comeback with her own movie for which she has written the script. Joe Gillis incidentally runs into her and, since he is a script writer (and young and handsome), she chooses him to polish up her script.**MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD**There are some remarkably chilly moments: Joe Gillis witnessing the scene of Norma Desmond's monkey's funeral or - towards the end of the movie - Max' confession to Joe that he was Norma's first wife.Some of the movie's intensity may come from the fact that Norma Desmond is played by Gloria Swanson who was in fact a star from the old days of silent movies. Her butler Max is played by Erich von Stroheim who was director of many picture with Swanson before sound conquered the movies. Their performances give this film a lot of credibility.All the four lead characters received well deserved academy award nominations for their performances. Holden plays Gillis effectively in a cool and reserved manner which contrasts very well with Gloria Swanson. Von Stroheim is playing her butler Max and his devotedness to Norma is touching and makes the audience sympathetic both with him and his master.The movie ends with a memorable scene where Norma descends the stairs with all her grandezza after she has shot Gillis with a revolver. She doesn't realize that this would be her last appearance in front of a camera. Often when movies have a sad ending, they become corny. Not this one. Wilder treats Desmond with the utmost respect throughout this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>very special look at Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not a romanticised view of Tinseltown at all, this Billy Wilder movie was more or less ignored on release - the year that All About Eve took all the awards and the kudos. It is a bitter pill to swallow since it takes a kick at Hollywood's guts and has one of the bleakest endings in the whole of cinema.Joe Gillis, a struggling writer, finds himself in the drive of a Hollywood palazzo when he wants somewhere to hide his car. The house belongs to Norma Desmond, who 'used to be big' in pictures, and Joe gets drawn to Norma and drawn into her weird world of flickering shadows.The acting honours in this movie go squarely to Gloria Swanson, herself a 'star of yesteryear' as Norma, who is superb as the actress living in the past. Not that she plays Norma as exclusively tragic(the scene where she impersonates Chaplin is priceless) but perhaps no one could get to grips with the demands of this part better. William Holden plays Joe, his breakthrough role, and he does the part very well, while Erich von Stroheim plays faded Hollywood director Max von Mayerling (naturally a reflection of himself), and newcomer Nancy Olson plays Betty, a girl too nice to become submerged just yet in dreamland's poison.The script is its moments of OTT-ness, but it is never less than interesting and draws in the viewer to the point when you are with Norma when she visits her old studio and talks of the joy of coming home; you are with Joe and Nancy as they fall in love among the cardboard settings of movie sets; and you are in the hall with Hedda Hopper watching Norma's last descent into madness. The musical version which appeared in the 1990s had the heart and soul of this movie in mind, and was an excellent tribute to it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All is not as it seems in Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>March 7, 2004**** Excellent!"Sunset Boulevard" ranks with "All About Eve" as one of the best written and best acted films of the 1950's. To me, 1950, ranks as high as the golden year of 1939 for Hollywood. I have just seen "Sunset Boulevard" for the very first time. I was very favorably impressed. "Sunset Boulevard" is the inspiration for all other Hollywood inside story films that came after. Gloria Swanson plays Norma Desmond who is a lonely insecure once famous silent film star living in isolation with her servant in a lavish, but neglected Hollywood mansion from the 1920's. William Holden plays the role of Joe Gillis, a down on his luck B film Hollywood writer who accidentally discovers her mansion. Erich Von Stroheim plays the loyal house servant Max Von Mayerling to Norma Desmond.A combination film noir, satire with dark, cynical humor, "Sunset Boulevard" excels. Being narrated by a dead man is a nice dark touch. There are cameos of several famous silent film stars including Buster Keaton, who play themselves in the film. Most notably, Cecile B. DeMile plays himself, who directed Gloria Swanson (in real life) in some of her silent films. The film has a romance substory that is done well. I believe this substory really serves as a distraction from the film's dark cynical tone.Both "Sunset Boulevard" and "All About Eve" are two excellent films of the same year (1950). Both were nominated for Academy Awards in many categories including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay and Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actor and Best Supporting Actress. Both films had similiar stories. To decide which film was the best film of 1950 was truly difficult and shows the folly of the Academy Awards. Both are excellent films (in different ways): most notably for writing and acting. "Sunset Boulevard" has the advantage of better cinematography for it's film noir, moody look and feel. "All About Eve" does have a "stagey" look and feel to it, using basic and simple cinematography. Both films excel with similiar stories, done with different tone and mood. "Sunset Boulevard" stands the test of time as a classic film, perhaps better understood and appreciated by film buffs, nonetheless, one of Hollywood's best films.</fullReview>

William Holden is magnificent, the kind of man's man that never seem to be onscreen nowadays.

But I guess it's part of the movie's theme: Hollywood is cruel and don't have anything to do with it.It works on the same concept of the Coen Brother's "Barton Fink" that says warns you that "if you want to win in Hollywood you'll have to be willing to loose your soul."Scary though.But still I can't wait for the DVD of Sunset Blvd.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After reading Wilder Times, one of the many biographies of Billy Wilder, just recently, I naturally revisted many of his films in the last few weeks. And today, I have just read of the death of the great Billy Wilder. This has prompted me to write my first review, on the IMDB, of my favourite of this man's long series of great films and screenplays.Sunset Blvd is suspenseful, witty, and tragic. Brilliantly written and directed, it is a classic for many reasons, but most notably that it is possible to like the movie more each time with each viewing. It may not be possible to appreciate such a detailed and rich film in one viewing. Whether it be the real Hollywood stars in cameos(Buster Keaton, Cecil B. Demille etc), or the skillful casting of Gloria Swanson and Erich Von Stroheim, that adds such a grim reality to their, all ready, well written roles, to just how frank and bleakly honest this movie was for it's time, in it's portrayal of Hollywood.For William Holden, a very handsome Hollywood leading man, to take on the role of a poor bitter writer,Joe Gillis, was, I consider a brave role, even by many of todays leading man standards. Gloria Swanson prevents the character of Norma becoming a ridiculous caricature and keeps her real and therefore tragic.(None the less, Ms Swanson also gives a famously delicious performance in this feisty role) And Nancy Olsen, who plays a very grounded and honest, Betty Schaefer, perfectly matches the unreality of the world of Norma Desmond.Goodbye, Billy Wilder. You will be missed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite a few flaws, Billy Wilder's condemnation of Hollywood's egotism is one of the best. "Sunset Boulevard" is grim, often depressing, and truly unforgettable. Its portrayals of a narcissistic woman's hunger for now-vanished fame, and the tough-guy writer who is engulfed by her destructive ambitions, overcomes some slight script flaws that result from over-striving for the noir tone. Sometimes the emphasis on the characters' utter doom is hard to take; more often, it is extremely effective. William Holden is perfect in the role of Joe Gillis, a down-on-his-luck scriptwriter; many actors could not convey his mixture of repulsion and fascination with the ex-movie star. Gloria Swanson is occasionally too melodramatic, but her grotesqueness distinguishes her character from the classic femme fatale of most films noir. Altogether a great film-- the camerawork alone is worth watching.</fullReview>

At times you hate her for her arrogance, then Wilder makes you feel pity for her when you find out that all the doors in her 60+ room mansion have the locks removed so that she can't lock herself in a room and take her life.The butler also does well as he atempts to shield her from the reality of her cruel world, by writing letters that she thinks is fan mail.Wilder did such an impressive job with this film, even including actual actors in the 50's at the time (even including director Cecil B Demille as HIMSELF) to play roles. The scene where she returns to the studio and an old stage hand shines a light on her but then only for a fleeting moment.

		<fullReview>Joe Gillis, a failed writer played with an efficient cynicism by William Holden, blows out a tire escaping the repo man, limps into the driveway of an old Sunset Blvd mansion to hide, and thus enters a decadent world that traps him like a babe in a sticky womb. In this morality-tale, a la Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett, we learn that even an accidental gigolo earns his keep, and then some.The voice-over and frame are appropriately reminiscent of a Forties' radio show, perhaps "Inner Sanctum" or "The Shadow." The images, from Gloria Swanson's greasy face and spidery fingers, to Eric Von Stroheim's wheezy organ, to the lighted pool with Joe's face down in it, ("This is where you came in") are indelible.This is a great movie, built on character and story, well-crafted amidst the haunting atmosphere of an "undead" Hollywood.

		<fullReview>Sunset Boulevard is a real classic I first learned about from parodies on The Carol Burnett Show in the 1970s. I didn't see the film until some 20 years later, when I found it fascinating. William Holden (Rachel And The Sranger, The Earthling) plays Joe Gillis, a bankrupt B-movie writer who drives his car into the garage of an apparently abandoned mansion on Sunset Boulevard to dodge the repo men. But the dilapidated place is occupied by two fascinating but weird characters, former silent screen star Norma Desmond (Goria Swanson) and her butler, balding, German-accented Max (Erich von Stroheim). Norma hires Joe to ghost-write a screenplay for her come-back, but he soon finds he's as much a kept-man as a writer, enabling more than one of the has-been starlet's delusions. The characters of both Norma and Max are fascinating enough to keep the movie going, and their relationship turns out to be more than it seems. The cast includes a very young Jack Webb, actually speaking like a human being, and appearances by Buster Keaton, Hedda Hopper, and Cecil B. DeMille as themselves. Carol Burnett made great fun of the role with Harvey Korman in the Max role 2 decades later, but the movie (directed and co-written by Billy Wilder) remains a grand drama, character study, and serious comment on the Hollywood star system.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Right up there with Citizen Kane</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brilliant film that is easily Wilder's best. A true classic that deserves to be ranked alongside Citizen Kane. And comparing the 2 films in terms of acting, atmosphere, dialog, conflict, symbolism, and theme (to say nothing of depth): Sunset Boulevard surpasses Kane. The ending is unforgettable and ironic:Max gets to direct, Norma makes a "comeback" before the cameras, and Joe has a story, his own. Like Kane, Sunset Boulevard begins with the end. The first shot is of the gutter with the film's title printed on the curb,and the first shot of Joe floating lifelessly in Norma's pool shows us he has sunk even lower: the film proceeds to show us how he got there.Sunset Boulevard is about the march of time:what time and technology does to people and what happens to those who don't or can't keep in step. And like Norma, the new Hollywood seems to be leaving Joe behind. The 2 cars in Norma's garage represent an unspoken bond between Joe and Norma; except for those cars the outside world has little use for these two. The finance company wants to repossess Joe's car and Paramount wants to use Norma's for a film.The acting is unsurpassable;the dialog and narration memorable, and the atmosphere in that decaying mansion is palpable. One of those films, like Kane, that improves with repeated viewings. Endlessly brilliant. The film hasn't aged a bit, and Swanson and VonStroheim lend it an authenticity that would be impossible for any subsequent version to equal. Essential viewing.The Paramount released DVD looks great and has worthwhile extras.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Setting the sun on a man in debt</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much has been said, mostly praising the very trivial exposure-of-true-Hollywood-glamour-emptiness aspect of this great movie. However, the movie deals with some interesting personal psychology as well - or perhaps - primarily.The irony of the Holden character narrowly escaping his harsh creditors only to be much further (morally) indebted in his relationship with Swanson is most funny. He engages in a relationship without true commitment. As the story goes on, he even wants to replace the love he has created with Swanson for the love of a younger woman. The classic fall of the noir male character is elegantly underway.The Swanson character is not evil. The murder she commits is not committed in cold blood, but as a result of the betrayal and lies of people she thought she could trust. I.e. Holden and the too kind director who does not have the courage to tell her the truth about herself.When Holden's true intents towards Swanson are revealed the punishment is immediate, but of course, on her part, well over the limit. The development of his character in the movie is, however, more interesting.I find the "kill-and-be-famous" ending of the movie to be a bit unnecessary even for the cynical story. It is true that a murder would probably be the only way for Wilder to convincingly dust off an old star and lead her back in to the fame light. Thus, however, Wilder chooses to prefer the theme about what leads to personal fame to the theme about betrayal of an indebted man and its consequences. The two themes do hardly float together like blood and water, even in a film noir, at least not in this one. It is great, though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A hack writer in search of refuge from creditors hides into a crumbling mansion inhabited by a faded silent movie star</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This excellent movie with bitter-sweet style deal with a hack , bankrupt screenwriter who writes a screenplay for a former silent-film star who has faded into Hollywood obscurity . It starts in the surprising opening scene by having the flick related by a body floating face-down in a swimming pool . What follows in long flashback is pulls into an ancient mansion in which a writer in search of refuge from his creditors , as he shelters and becomes entangled in the web woven by a known but now forgotten star of the silent cinema , being submitted to humiliation and exploitation . The star named Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) is high on hopes of a comeback and living in the past with her servant (Erich Von Stroheim). One of Wilder's finest and certainly the blackest and memorably sour of all Hollywood accounts of itself . Splendidly paced , the movie contains melodrama , acidity , bitterness , relentless indictment against Hollywood excesses , suitable sordid interpretations and precise direction . It's an over-the-top picture , though hampered by silly sub-plot related to sentimental triangle between William Holden, Nancy Olson and Jack Webb . Magnificent performances from William Holden as out-of-work gigolo-screenwriter who inextricably attaches himself to a faded possessive screen star ; Swanson is brilliant as the tragically deluded actress and realizes a real tour-de-force and of course superb Erich Von Stroheim as Norma Desmond's devotedly watchable butler . Likable appearing in brief card-game scenes from silent stars as H.B. Warner and Buster Keaton , furthermore Hedda Hooper and extraordinary intervention by Cecil B DeMille while filming some scenes of ¨Ten Commandments¨ with Henry Wilconson . This prestigious film deservedly won three Oscars , including best musical score by Franz Waxman , and best screenplay by Wilder and Charles Brackett . Awesome camera-work appropriately ¨Noir¨ by John Seitz .The picture is stunningly directed by Billy Wilder at his best . It belongs his first and better period during the 40s and 50s when realized sensational films as ¨Double indemnity¨, ¨Ace in the hole¨ , ¨Sabrina¨, ¨Stalag 17¨ and ¨Seven year itch¨ ; subsequently in the 60s and 70s he realized nice though unsuccessful movies as ¨Buddy buddy¨,¨Fedora¨ , ¨Front page¨and ¨Secret life of Sherlock Holmes¨. Rating : Above average , essential and indispensable watching ; harshly funny and riveting film and completely entertaining . It justly deserves its place among the best movies ever made .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Says Holden: "I sure drove into an interesting driveway..."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WILLIAM HOLDEN really hits his stride in the role of Joe Gillis, the down-on-his-heels writer who just happens to be drowning in debt before he comes upon a secluded and decaying mansion that is about to change his life. Wilder's script gives him plenty of opportunity to shine. His typically witty quip to servant Erich Von Stroheim is: "I sure drove into an interesting driveway" (after realizing Swanson intends to hold a funeral for her pet monkey). It's the kind of remark that stays with you through the entire story.Holden inhabits the role so perfectly that we can be thankful Montgomery Clift turned down the role at the last moment. And the screenplay by Billy Wilder provides plenty of other cynical and observant wise cracks that give his character of Joe Gillis such depth, conviction and truth.And, of course, GLORIA SWANSON, as Norma Desmond, in what has to be regarded as her film swansong (she did very little thereafter), is every inch the faded silent screen star who lives inside her rich imagination, inflating her ego with self-important phrases like: "It's the pictures that got small." With her cat-like eyes and claw-like hand gestures, she gets every nuance out of a role that is theatrical and larger than life, right up to the fantastic ending. One can almost sense why Andrew Lloyd Webber would fashion this into a terrific Broadway musical.Her meeting with Cecil B. DeMille on the set of a Paramount costume epic is priceless for the way it is written and played. When, at the conclusion of the film, she says: "I'm ready for my close-up, Mr. DeMille", it's a truly poignant moment.All of the supporting players are excellent, including NANCY OLSON, as the writer girlfriend that Holden shields from the truth until that final scene where he invites her to come over to the Sunset Blvd. mansion and exposes the sordid truth of his relationship with Swanson.As the man servant who is Swanson's loyal protector and was once Swanson's first husband and director of her early films, ERICH VON STROHEIM easily matches Holden and Swanson with a fine characterization of the patiently devoted butler.Swanson plays the demented star like a more glamorous version of Miss Havisham in GREAT EXPECTATIONS, the woman who lived among the cobwebs because of a bitter disappointment when a lover jilted her on her wedding day. And like Miss Havisham, she refuses to deal with the reality of her situation when the going gets rough--as it does when it turns out nobody wants her at the studios any more, they were only interested in her antique auto.Some old time Hollywoodians get some cameos (Buster Keaton, H.B. Warner) which give the film added interest and even Hedda Hopper is on the scene as a brusque Hollywood reporter. All of the technical details are perfect. Franz Waxman's score has a Salome-like flavor, especially toward the end when Swanson is in the full throes of her delusions.Expertly photographed, written, directed and acted, this is a film that has to be watched closely to fully appreciate every detail. With its superior script, it mixes film noir, black comedy and dark melodrama with a nice blend of shadowy noir B&amp;W photography, that has that Paramount sheen. A viewer is immediately drawn into the story which gets off to a brilliant start with Holden's brittle narration, the kind that strips all the phoniness away from any Hollywood pretension of glamor. Summing up: Highly recommended for mature adults. Holden's corpse floating face downward, eyes open in the water of the lighted swimming pool, is the stylish stuff that film noir addicts dream of.And Swanson's brief moment mimicking Charlie Chaplin is priceless.Trivia note: Holden's performance is right on target--the perfect degree of cynicism, disdain and self-loathing. He should have won an Oscar here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie opened my eyes to the genius of Billy Wilder compelling me to dig all his other movies. I watched his other movies one after the other and I was never disappointed. He really made some great movies on great themes without ever losing his focus on the entertainment value of the movie. 'Stalag 17', 'double indemnity', 'the apartment' all are such great movies. Most of the movie is narrated in first person and you see what the protagonist sees, a technique which has been used in so many movies after this. The narration is flawless and drama so intense that I watched the whole movie without batting an eyelid. The characters are real with shades of grey that you empathize and dislike at the same time. The whole thing is dark and a film noir in true sense. One of my all time favorites and I cannot over-recommend this movie to anyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hack screenwriter chances upon mansion of a faded Hollywood silent screen star who 'hires' him to ghost-write her return project "Salome", but who really wants him for her lover. Poor Norma Desmond: she's 50 years old and over the hill! Literate, but queasy black comedy has a great script and majestic performances, but creeps its way to the depressingly inevitable. The palpable aroma of vintage cigarettes and the smell of rosy perfume hanging in the air permeates this incredible Billy Wilder film; yet, the deeper it crawls into its dark corner, the more repulsive it all seems. It can easily be called a masterpiece, but is it an entertaining movie? Great to see Hollywood circa 1950, with Schwab's Drug Store still there, but it's sad to think that even in 1950, stars were being discarded, replaced by the new and the younger, and even a star like Norma Desmond couldn't get a picture made. Thank goodness she had those oil wells in Bakersfield ("Pumping...pumping."). There's a lesson to be learned from the film: invest! *** from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1st watched 1/4/2003 - 8 out of 10(Dir-Billy Wilder): Wonderful performances and edge of your seat story-telling in this classic Billy Wilder film. What I think really holds this picture together is the well-down over-the-top portrayal of silent film star Norma Desmond by Gloria Swanson. William Holden also does a good job of standing his own as well in a quiet but effective performance. Basically, this is a story about a failing screenwriter's accidental encounter with Norma Desmond who still lives in the past with the household staff playing along at every beat. He then becomes entangled in her web and has to fight himself out of her grip, but struggles with this because he is being taken care of financially and socially. But once Norma gets jealous of Holden's encounter with another woman the inevitable happens(which I will not give away). Overall, this was daring filmmaking for it's time with only some minor annoyances but otherwise splashingly good.</fullReview>

I really couldn't care less about the film's commentary on Hollywood; I watch this film to be mesmerized by Gloria Swanson. The premise of a kept man is creepy enough, but Swanson really takes this movie to another plane. If you have never seen this classic, do yourself a big favor and rent it.

		<shortDescription>Sunset Blvd: An intense and scary film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Sunset Blvd.' criticizes the mass media society. It is not just about Hollywood. "Sunset Blvd." is classic Billy Wilder work. He builds a story with a voice over, which creates an intense and exciting mood. Sunset Blvd. has many qualities. This is a tragic story about a fallen star and the inability to be a "normal" and "ordinary" human after have been some kind of attraction. This is a movie that after more than 50 years still has great power. And I think it will remain. Just the fact that "Sunset Blvd." really includes Paramount Pictures, Cecil B. DeMille, Buster Keaton, Gloria Swanson and Erich von Stroheim makes it so real and in the same time beyond reality. And who produced this picture? Paramount Pictures! Is it an impossible thing to happen today? When Norma and Joe watches a movie you can see what it is: Queen Kelly - one of the last silent movies, directed by von Stroheim and casted by Gloria Swanson ... Billy Wilder shows that the end isn't the only important thing in a movie. It is most of all the way to the end. "Sunset Blvd." is like a journey, and there is not only the characters in 'Sunset Blvd.' who has a development - it is most of all also a development for us, the audience, if we understand it. And I think we should. Rating: 10 of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an outstanding film. Though it was made in 1950, it is still timely today. You simply could replace a silent film star with, say, Michael Jackson and you could make this movie today. Norma Desmond is the ultimate tragic character in movie history. She is so out of touch with reality that she destroys herself. William Holden was never better. I think this is a superior film to All About Eve even though both films haven't aged. No character in All About Eve, though, is likable so it is difficult to keep with the film. Sunset Boulevard, though, is full of tragic characters but they are also likable. That is why it is superior.</fullReview>

Sure, any screenwriter has been drowned in the swimming pool of the villa of a star, shot to death, but the plot of the movie, it's a true story. Gloria Swanson was really an actress forgotten by cinema, Erich Von Stroheim a German director, not famous anymore and Buster Keaton and the other "ghosts" were really living in those conditions. Billy Wilder wanted to watch the dark side of Hollywood, the underwood of those forgotten, who won't surrender to their destiny.

		<fullReview>Though Sunset Boulevard IS an actual place in Hollywood, I've often wondered since seeing one of the true gems of the 1950's (the decade of the Big Lie, as I like to call it) if maybe Wilder and Co. were aiming for metaphor as well. Think about it: if Norma Desmond's life isn't in it's final stages by the time her boytoy pops up on her doorstep, then we may as well agree with her apparent belief that she's never going to die. Max (played by silent era film giant Erich Von Stronheim; when he talks of the three great silent directors, all they did was change the name for his role), who discovered, married, and now serves Norma passed his high noon in films long before. Then there's William Holden, who doesn't realize that his life and career are entering the last stages, right up until the fatal bullets hit him from behind (do you honestly think that he could tell this story so objectively until then?)."All right, Mr. DeMille, I'm ready for my close-up." A close-up of Ragnarok. A close-up that Norma Desmond, the greatest star of all, cannot survive. Like all gods and goddesses before her, her time has come and passed.

		<fullReview>When I was watching this movie, I hardly ever took my eyes off of Gloria Swanson whenever she was on-screen. Whenever she arches her eyebrows and her eyes get big and she starts to go crazy, her performance is so magnetic. She truly becomes her character. It probably wasn't hard for her to do; she, after all, was a glamorous silent film star herself who had all but disappeared from the scene for years before this movie was made. But her sharp delivery of the dialogue makes you believe every word she says. That isn't to say that the rest of the film isn't good. William Holden is very good, especially in those biting, darkly funny voice-overs. Erich Von Stroheim is very eerie as the devoted butler Max. (He was a silent-film director in real-life who made six-hour epics in the 20's, one of whcih actually starred Swanson. He did not, however, discover her and never married her.) The direction focuses heavily on the dark, fobodding, almost misty atmosphere of the whole thing, and the movie's all the better for it. But the best thing undoubtedly is Gloria Swanson's amazing performance as the greatest star of them all, Norma Desmond."I am a STAR!""I am big; it's the PICTURES that got small!""All right, Mr. DeMille, I'm ready for my CLOSEUP!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this movie last year ('98) around the Christmas season. It may not have been the best time of year to see it (Halloween would have best) but it was still worth a look either time. I love Gloria Swanson's scary, almost evil plot to take over William Holden's mind and making him her "property". You feel there is a chance he and Nancy Olsen's character will be able to get away from her and live their lives in peace together but the story is a tragedy so there has to be some disappointments. Norma (Swanson) refuses to let Joe (Holden) go but he still persists and she kills him. The audience tends to pity Norma for losing her career in the movies and for desperately trying to hold on to it (she surrounds herself with old publicity pictures of herself for comfort) even though it's dead and has no chance of redemption. After killing Holden, she practically becomes oblivious to the deed and suffocates herself into believing, "I am the greatest star there ever was". It is a great American classic. The greatest scary movie ever made!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Holden was robbed at the Oscars.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading my summary, I know that some of you that are fans of Jose Ferrer are going to write some bad stuff about me and what I've said which I do expect. Only hear make sure you know what I mean when I say Holden was robbed. I'm not saying that Ferrer wasn't good in "Cyrano de Bergerac", I'm saying Holden was a lot better in "Sunset boulevard". The reason I'm saying this is simply because throughout the movie, you think that there is no William Holden in the movie, that there was simply Joe Gillis playing himself through the whole movie and I'm not just talking about his acting, but his look and the voice-over especially, made you think that Joe Gillis made a movie about a part of his life. Joe Gillis (William Holden) is a down-and-out script writer who owes everybody some money, especially his insurance company which has had enough of waiting for him to pay and threatens to take his car if he doesn't pay on that day. Naturally, Joe doesn't pay and decides to leave town for a while to let things cool-off. But as he is leaving, he runs into the men from the insurance company and so they run after Joe on a road that leads far out of town and luckily for Joe, as he is in a rather sharp turn, he hits a nail and drives his car directly into a lost driveway losing the boys from the insurance company. Joe has no clue where he is. In fact, he thinks he is in an abandoned house's driveway. But as he approaches the garage, a man comes out of the main house claiming that "Madame" is expecting him. Joe doesn't know what the man is talking about but enters the mansion as he is asked to and follows the man upstairs where he meets "Madame". Now being a script writer, Joe recognizes "Madame". She is in fact the star of the silent movies, the great Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson). But Mrs. Desmond thinks that Joe is the undertaker who is there to bury her dead monkey. Joe explains the misunderstanding and asks if he could just borrow a spare tire and he would be on his way. But Mrs. Desmond refuses because she wants Joe to polish off the script she has written and that she wants to show to Cecil B. DeMille so he can direct it. And so her servant Max (Erich Von Stroheim) shows Joe to his room and he begins to work as a gigolo for Mrs. Desmond. Masterfully directed and acted, this is one film-noir you won't want to miss. Personally, I felt that Holden and Wilder did a better job with "Stalag 17" but "Sunset boulevard" is still an American classic. It was good to see Gloria Swanson back in action again. She was very good looking in this movie and played her part very well. But it is really the Holden-Wilder team that makes "Sunset boulevard" so good. The movie leads to a great ending and the filming is excellent during the whole movie. It's one of my favorite movies made by the great Billy Wilder and starring the exceptional William Holden. This one you really don't want to miss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welcome to the Hotel California on Sunset Blvd.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sunset Blvd. had to have influenced the Eagles classic hit, Hotel California. Parallels exist throughout, including the enchantment.Consider: 1) A man compelled to stop for the night, as did Joe Gillis, whose face showed his puzzlement and hesitation upon viewing Norma Desmond's estate on Sunset Blvd: "This could be Heaven, or this could be Hell."2) "Then she lit up a candle..." Norma lit many.3) "Her mind is definitely twisted," as was Norma's, and, "she's got the Mercedes-Benz." Only in Norma's case, the Isotta-Fraschini.4) "She's got lots of pretty, pretty boys that she calls friends." Norma had gone through three husbands and lured Joe into an intimate friendship.5) "How they danced in the courtyard..." Joe and Norma danced in the great room.6) "Some danced to remember" (as did Norma); "some danced to forget" (as did Joe).7) "So I called up the captain, 'Please bring me my wine.'" Max Von Mayerling served as butler/wine captain.8) "Pink champagne on ice." Lots of champagne consumed in the film.9) "We are all just prisoners here of our own device." That's the theme of the movie! Every character is trapped in his and her own way.10) "Last thing I remember, I was running for the door." Joe did also to "find the passage back to place I (he) was before." 11) Finally, "You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave." Precisely the fate of Joe.If this fine film didn't inspire other artists, I'd be very surprised. It adroitly captured the mood and seductiveness of Hollywood and California of the early '50s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sunset Blvd.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't enjoy watching this film too much, but it was a good change from today's crude, violent filled film. Not to say that it's not a good movie. The plot is extremely well written in my opinion. Norma Desmond, a silent film star trying to continue her career with the new sound films. This film gave me an idea of what the film business was like in the 1950's. It also makes me think and appreciate how far film has come today. Often I pass off a high speed chase or a battle scene in movie and forget how much time and effort has gone into it. Back to Sunset Blvd... The relationship between Norma and Joe is very interesting to watch unfold. Norma can't let go, and all Joe wants to do is be free from Norma and live his life the way he wants to. All in all,Sunset Blvd. is a well written film, but not my type of movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the third Billy Wilder film I have watched after Ace in the Hole and The Apartment. After watching these 3 films, it is quite clear to me that unlike most films of that era, Billy Wilder's films used to have substantial and thought provoking messages underneath the basic plot and Wilder loved to visually voice his opinions about the different strata of contemporary society. Ace in the Hole was an uncompromising and dark study of the media and its effects on society ,while the The Apartment was a comedy with subtle commentaries on corporate/office culture. Sunset Blvd. is a film which shows the dark side of the film industry. How cutthroat this profession can be and how quickly actors and directors can become obsolete if they fail to adjust to the dynamic nature of the business. The film revolves largely around Joe Gillis,a struggling screenplay writer and Norma Desmond, an arrogant and scarily delusional former Hollywood star of the silent era. Norma finds it difficult to accept the fact that her days of stardom are behind her and the film industry and film directors no longer care for the actors from the silent era. In order to hide from the current film industry which she considers demeaning and abominable, she has completely isolated herself from the world and deliberately caged herself in her lavish and extravagant mansion where she still is a celebrity. When she meets Gillis the screenplay writer, she thinks that he can help her finish a script which she has written on her own for a film which will be her grand comeback. Gillis looks at this as an opportunity to get money out of Norma and get some respite from his financial problems. But slowly he finds himself trapped in this mansion with no freedom (which is a metaphor for the film world and how it allures and then traps people with dreams of making it big). This fatal partnership in the end leads to devastating and diabolical conclusions for everyone involved. While watching the film, I became certain that the character of Norma Desmond must have inspired and influenced Satyajit Ray to create the character of Huzur Biswambhar Roy for his film Jalsaghar(The Music Room). Like Norma, Biswambhar who was once a respected zamindar was also arrogant and separated himself from the world, a world where aristocracy was slowly fading and giving way to modernism. But while Jalsaghar was a poetic and musical masterpiece which oozes empathy and the essence of humanism, Sunset Boulevard had a dark,neo-noirish feel about it. Billy Wilder uses a lot of metaphors and symbolism. The dream about the monkey dancing for pennies, the drawing of the curtains, the rats in the pool, the limelight falling on Norma for a few moments before being taken away,etc. all these metaphors will be very meaningful to the discerning viewers. The acting is marvelous. Gloria Swanson is fantastic with her over the top and extremely dramatic representation of Norma Desmond and William Holden's realistic acting provides a good contrast to the larger than life Norma Desmond. But the only thing that didn't work for me was the melodrama in some scenes. There were a few moments which felt too unrealistic and melodramatic,especially the scenes involving Betty Schaefer. But overall this is a chilling commentary on the film industry, the miserable plight of old, forgotten actors and the glitz and glamour of the movie world which can lead to delusions. The film ends with catastrophic consequences. But the final scene has to go down as one of the greatest scenes in all of film history. That final scene is poetic, profound and yet filled with immense horror.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Great Director Billy Wilder's Wildest Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most Film Buffs and Critics Love this Movie. Because it's a Great one about The Movies. It's the Cynicism and Bizarre elements that make the Film hold up and admired Today, but just imagine, it must have been even more Powerful in 1950. Because it was a Story about Hollywood in 1950 and the faded Silent Movie Goddesses and Filmmakers who were, but no longer, Golden because the Sun has set on their Careers that was their Life. "There is nothing else" says Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) as She "Talks" about the "Pictures".This is one of the most scathing indictments ever made on the Cult of Celebrity and the Hollywood Studio Machine. But it is also a sad Story about those who never quite made it. Theirs is also tragic. The Silent Movie Director (Erich Von Stroheim), the struggling B-Movie Writer Joe Gillis (William Holden), and the innocent young Girl, Betty Schaffer (Nancy Olsen) who is rejected by the Man She Loves.The Film is close to a perfect Picture with delicious Dialog, smart alack Symbolism (the pet Monkey (King Kong's cousin) dies and so Joe is the next one to be put on a leash (a gold fob gift) that snags on the door as He tries to leave).Much has been written about this one and there is no shortage of analysis on Disc Extras, Books, and Online. When You see it for the first time, you too most likely will want to "Talk" about it, after all, the "Silents" are a thing of the distant Past.Silent Star Norma Desmond......"They had the eyes of the world...that wasn't enough, they wanted their ears too...they wanted words and talk...talk, talk, talk, talk, talk."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Undoubtedly one of the greatest American films of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sunset Blvd. is an absolute masterpiece. From the first word spoken to the last you can see and hear how well written the script was. It was ahead of it's time in 1950 and, in 2013, cannot be redone without failing. There was much hullabaloo about who would play Norma Desmond. And, although she may have not been the first choice, Gloria Swanson nailed it in the role of a lifetime. The role of any actress' lifetime. Miss Swanson's performance touches the border of being campy and too over the top. But, in just touching the border and never crossing it, she left behind not only one of the greatest performances by an American actress, on film, but one of the most indelible film characters of all time. They remade Psycho and it failed. This film should never be remade. The only actress that could possibly fill Miss Swanson's shoes is Meryl Streep. And, she is too fine and smart an actress to attempt it. It is an impossible role to recreate. This movie has provided us with so many memorable lines &amp; scenes. I only hope that younger people continue to appreciate the depth and range and how very special and brilliant this film, its script and cinematography are.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Are you ready for your close-up review of Sunset Boulevard?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joe Gillis (William Holden) moved to Hollywood from Ohio in hopes of becoming a successful screenwriter. But, alas, although he can produce a script in a very short period of time, he has no luck in selling any of them to the studios. He's borrowed money from everyone he knows and, now, his car is on the point of being re-possessed. In fact, on one critical day, the repo men are waiting for him and only a bit of quick thinking on Joe's part delays the inevitable. Joe's tire blows and he makes a sharp right turn into the driveway of an enormous mansion. Seeing that the garage door is open and near empty, he sneaks his car into the building. Before long, a servant named Max comes out to greet him and invites him in, thinking Joe is there to see the lady of the house. SHE is silent film star Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), who is very wealthy and reclusive. She also may be slightly touched in the head, for as she shows Joe around the place, she asks him to arrange a funeral for her monkey! Needless to say, the mansion is filled with photographs and other objects from her glory days. As the conversation continues, she discovers he is a screenwriter and she immediately asked him to help her with a script for her big comeback. That would be the role of Salome, where she will dance and end up with the head of John the Baptist. Having really nowhere to go and no money, Joe agrees. He is given rooms over the garage. However, Norma wants more. She falls for Joe and the younger writer becomes sort of a "kept man". This is degrading and humiliating for Joe but he likes the caviar and new clothe, after all. But, with there being little chance that Norma will ever make another film, how does Joe go on in this arrangement? Here goes, folks, are you ready for your close-up review of Sunset Boulevard?This classic film by master storyteller Billy Wilder is a must-see. First, the two main stars, Holden and Swanson, are near perfect in their roles, with all of the supporting cast darn wonderful, too. Watch for cameos from Buster Keaton, Cecil B. DeMille, and others. Then, the story starts at the end and back-ups, an intriguing arrangement. Filled with memorable lines, stunning costumes, great sets, and a fantastic direction, one could hardly ask more from two hours of entertainment. Don't let the sunsets keep coming very many times before you sit down to watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing noir achievement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a reason why Sunset Boulevard became a sort of defining movie of the film noir genre. It involves ruthless murder, sexual connotations, deceit and failed romance. However, there is difference between this film and other noir titles, which actually made people more interested in seeing Sunset Boulevard. Mainly, Billy Wilder's depiction of a story of a forgotten movie star seemed so real and believable that everyone wanted to experience it from the side of a passer- by. For ages humans were interested in the lives of the rich and famous. And this film presents one of the saddest and toughest moments in the life of a celebrity ? the sudden and unexpected fall into the nothingness after years of being on top. Additionally, Wilder gave a very strong and gloomy twist to it, making the movie a real directorial masterpiece.The movie sets a very fast pace right from the start, showing a dead man floating in the swimming pool, as the police arrives at the scene of the crime.Then starts the retrospect, presenting the viewer with a tragic tale that centers on an aged woman, Norma Desmond, who was once a huge silent movies' star in Hollywood. However, with the beginning of the sound era she simply became useless. No one wanted to cast her in the new productions. Yet, she still believes that her fans are writing to her and that she will once again rise and be on the posters all around town.Sunset Boulevard, the address of her house, is a great allegory to her position in the film world. She had her time on the pedestal, but know the Sun has inevitably set on her career and she can't do anything about it. Every day she is struggling with thoughts of a comeback (a word, which she actually hates), but it just won't happen. Only her butler (and first husband) Max is aware of this?Somewhere along the road, completely out of the blue, comes her savior, the screenwriter named Joe Gillis. He is desperate for some money to cover his loans. She is desperate for someone to edit her personally written script for a movie, in which she will also play the main role. Her insanity makes her incredibly jealous over him. She doesn't let him leave and meet other women, even though he is just using her and her money without any feelings. That the story ends in great tragedy mustn't be stressed, obviously. Going deeper and deeper into the madness leads to the final outburst, the 'beautiful' crime. Paradoxically, this is the moment when the cameras start rolling again and she is the main object of interest. And she loves it, like she didn't even know what happened a few hours before.Gloria Swanson definitely steals every scene that she's in. She is marvelous as this old star, who still thinks that she is younger, prettier and more talented than all those young Hollywood actresses. Her fantastic style, seriousness, way of speaking ? it all makes for an unforgettable performance. William Holden stressed with this role that he is a marvelous actor and possibly one of the greatest in the 20th century Hollywood. Also, fine use of narration to add to the dark atmosphere of the profoundly calamitous events occurring throughout the movie. All in all, this is definitely one of the movies that are a must see in the history of American cinematography. It shows how thin is a line between fame and obscurity. We don't even know how many of the once-famous characters were suddenly deemed useless and replaced by new generations. It sounds as sad, as it is inevitable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Billy Wilder has gotten away with murder, fabricating a bold, daring picture that shoots arrows at the Dream Factory.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sunset Boulevard is one of the world's most beloved films. Often in just about every critic's personal top twenty films, this Billy Wilder masterpiece sets the benchmark for a movie that depicts things many aren't privileged to witness behind the sunny facade of Hollywood. Nominated for eleven Oscars but only bagging three for art direction, music and screenplay, Sunset Boulevard deserved better in what was a competitive year for movies, with Joseph L. Mankiewicz's All About Eve winning six out of fourteen nominations.Sunset Boulevard is easily Billy Wilder's most impressive entry in his illustrious resume. It was also the motion picture that was responsible for the furore surrounding its release. The film was seen as a scathing attack towards Hollywood and its playmakers, because its depiction of America's entertainment jewel was nothing like what many were deceived into thinking in the 1950s - bright, glorious, and immortal.Accurate and methodical, Sunset Boulevard dissects what's wrong with Hollywood through a fictional but highly original flashback story of a screenwriter whom never made it into the big time. The performance of the film indisputably goes to Gloria Swanson whose character Norma Desmond is perhaps one of the most laudable and complex screen villains ever written. Swanson's distinct facial features (especially her eyes) give a sense of mysticism and disquiet appeal, while her haunting voice is almost hallucinatory, possessing anyone who interacts with her.Unlucky Joe Gillis played by William Holden may be overshadowed by Swanson but his honest display as her love interest is underrated. The other star performer is Eric von Stroheim who plays a butler with a dark and difficult past. His often expressionless scenes dictate a solemn and sympathetic aura well-suited to his character. The black-and-white film stock is a perfect representation of 1950s film noir. The distinct cinematography work complements Billy Wilder's direction, which is further enhanced by richly textured set decors.The last scene is one of the most emotionally perplexed ever - highly analytical viewers will rave about how the scene initiates a whole array of feelings in them, and is a perfect conclusion to a great film. Just like Michael Curtiz's Casablanca, Sunset Boulevard gets better with each subsequent viewing. Billy Wilder has gotten away with murder, fabricating a bold, daring picture that shoots arrows at the Dream Factory. An everlasting classic!

		<shortDescription>Boulevard of broken dreams</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a movie! Boasting one of the best ever opening scenes and most remembered conclusions, with filling to match, "Sunset Boulevard" is a magnificently cynical overview of Hollywood, uncommonly using real names and real people for veracity.Starting with the magnificent conceit of having the whole movie narrated by a dead man, we roll back from the unforgettable shot of William Holden's corpse looking down at us from the bottom of Norma Desmond's pool in what must be the longest ever flashback in movie history taking us up to the moment of his death and its aftermath.The movie works on so many levels, taking in the hollowness of Hollywood, the transience of fame, the fear of rejection, the onset of age, there's all this and more as William Holden's kept man finds in the end he can't escape the gilded cage that faded movie goddess Desmond has built around him. The plotting is sure, the direction masterful and the cinematography at times evocative of the best monochromatic shots from "Citizen Kane" (there can be no higher praise), especially in its handling of perspective shots.It goes without saying that Wilder and Brackett's dialogue is brilliant with so many of the phrases entering movie legend the second they're given breath. Holden is superb as the doomed writer, closely followed by Erich Von Stroheim as Desmond's first husband now reduced to being her lackey, excusing her every erratic action out of love. Gloria Swanson goes over the top to Everest level and occasionally overdoes it, but that may have been the director's point anyway, although I think it was right that she didn't win the Oscar this year, despite being nominated and heavily tipped. It's not every film you'll see boasting Buster Keaton, Hedda Hopper and Cecil B De Mille in a row in the acting credits, but while the first two get the merest of cameos, De Mille is completely natural and sympathetic to his requirement to both indulge and yet brush off Desmond's misplaced ambitions as himself.Add to the broth Franz Waxman's atmospheric score and you have the perfect recipe for a genre - busting film noir from maestro Wilder. I make it a point never to watch films more than once if I can help it but I just know there's so much more here than meets the eye, and that's more than enough for starters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was everything excellent. Both William Holden and Gloria Swanson played strong parts in this film, giving the appearance of realism. The narration in the beginning of the film and throughout helped give a very good feeling to the film, almost as if you were part of it, or reading about it in those newspapers in the film. The filming and story line and a nice flow to it, making it smoothly drift along Joe Gillis's story of his life and the troubles he is going through on the last days of his life. Gloria Swanson almost didn't agree to acting in the film, but personally I am glad she didn't since no one else would probably have been able to play the part of Norma Desmond, the used to be star. There were some over dramatized parts that were played by Gloria Swanson but that only showed us her craziness. All in all I did end up loving this film, it was both dark and romantic. A great 1950's black and white film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This all time classic movie intrigued me, but it sounded too boring to watch. I ended up seeing it anyway, and all the way through to the end.Swanson marvelous. Her RL pix as a young actress were nice to see. Von Stroheim directed her IRL, plus in this movie he was one of her early directors as well as her first husband. As Max, he seemed to have a very proper Teutonic view of the world, only to find out he really cared for Norma. I could see a heart of gold beneath his brusque exterior.Holden luscious at the age he made this movie. He essayed quite well the part of poverty row writer, desperate enough to get snared into the clutches of a wealthy female hermit ex-silent movie star.Swanson did well the gamut from almost sane to quite the dizzy dame to the insane mindless and pathetic dame, all the while trying to seduce Joe Gillis (Holden).Good for Joe wanting to give up the 18 suits (I wonder if he had as many ties as did Richard Gere in "American Gigolo"). In the end of "Sunset Blvd.", Joe had a pathetic exit that repeated the theme of its beginning -- sort of an endless loop.Good to see C.B. De Mille.15/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great inside Hollywood movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are quite a few movies out there are about life inside of Hollywood. These pictures particularly show the dark and downsides of this strange world of its own. This movie is full with references to Hollywood, as it's a story about a fading star from the silent era who meets up with a young struggling script writer.The movie has a quite interesting story, that builds on its great characters. It's a greatly cast movie, that features Gloria Swanson, an actress who more or less gloriously plays herself in this movie. She herself was an actress during the silent movie era and actually hadn't appeared in any movie for 9 years before singing on for this movie. The movie is filled with some casting like this. For instance Erich von Stroheim plays a once great director and Cecil B. DeMille appears as himself in this movie, in a quite big talking role. It's also the movie the well known line 'All right, Mr. DeMille, I'm ready for my close-up' comes from The movie truly benefited from its great and smart casting.It's a real character driven movie, in which more and more becomes obvious about the female lead, who is slowing loosing her mind and sense of reality because she is in full denial about her fading career and glamorous stardom. Its mostly were the movie its drama is coming from, though of course there is a whole lot more going in this movie. The writer William Holden also has his own issues and there are a bunch of more different story-lines and characters that the movie involves.It's really pleasant that this movie is a fast going one. Unlike many other movies from the same time period this movie rarely has slow or dull moment in it. Yes, it's a drama but it's one of those dramatic movies that also still is really pleasant to watch.It's simply a really done well movie. It had a a great story to work with but having a good story is of course one thing, having a great movie is a totally different thing. It's no big wonder that this movie worked out so great, since it had Billy Wilder at the helm of it. He does not only tell the story great and with lots of pace but also makes the movie with a lot of eye for detail. It's also a movie with some good looking sets and costumes for instance, though initially these are not really the things you will notice first.A great movie about Hollywood done by some of Hollywood's biggest.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A chilling, brilliant and iconic piece of cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Billy Wilder's haunting and masterful tale of possession and fallen glory remains one of the most iconic, entertaining and disturbing films ever produced. It's focus on the great lost generation of silent films stars and its unforgiving look at the cut throat and fickle world of Hollywood is chilling and, at its heart, are two magnificent performances from William Holden and, especially, Gloria Swanson as the reclusive, fallen star, Norma Desmond. It is a work of utter genius reflected by its oft quoted lines ("All right, Mr. DeMille. I'm ready for my close up.") and memorable visuals (the body floating in the swimming pool).The story of the chance meeting of down on his luck writer, Joe Gillis, with the former silent movie star, Norma Desmond, is brilliantly written (the film was a deserving recipient of the Oscar for screenplay). Gillis is an unscrupulous and seemingly hopeless dreamer, out of money and out of time. Desmond is similarly hopeless, but tragically so. She is not the architect of her own despair, but has been abandoned by everyone and yet is determined that she is still desired and loved by the "millions of people who have never forgiven me for deserting the screen". She sits in a Kubla Khan as detailed and as haunting as Citizen Kane's, protected by her mysterious butler (an effective Erich von Stroheim, who later dismissed his part in the film as "that butler role").The treatment of Desmond is distressing, and Gillis joins the fun, leading her on and taking her money, before he suddenly realises that he is trapped. Gillis is not as inhuman as he perhaps needs to be to follow the road he has started on and he is, thus, doomed. He cannot leave Desmond, who will undoubtedly kill herself in despair and is unable to write the script that may make him or be with the women he loves. The villain is Hollywood and its cut-throat and unforgiving nature which is brutal on its people and impossible for a man with the smallest slice of conscience.This was a brave film for Wilder to make, not so much biting the hand that fed him but cooking it in butter and serving it to the dogs. However, he got away with it and no wonder why. Even the hardest man had to step back and acknowledge the brilliance of craft, the harshness of wit and power of storytelling in this film. It is brutal, dark and excellent in every way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sunset Blvd is directed by Billy Wilder and written by Charles Brackett and Wilder. The film stars Gloria Swanson, William Holden, Erich Von Stroheim, Nancy Olsen and Cecil B. DeMille.The film begins with a dead man floating in a swimming pool with opening narration from William Holden(we learn that he's the dead man)and so we know from the start that the main character is doomed.However it's his story and why he dies that makes Sunset Blvd a must see.Joe Gillis(William Holden in a role originally earmarked for Montgomery Clift)is a film scriptwriter who is hired to write the comeback film of former silent screen Queen Norma Desmond(Gloria Swanson).He works at her home(a fading luxury mansion.)He finds out more about her and soon realises that she is in love with him. Things get complicated when Gillis falls in love with Betty(Nancy Olsen)a young studio writer and Norma becomes suspicious of them.The film plays out like a romantic horror with Norma almost vampire like in certain scenes, with many of her hand gestures claw like and grotesque.Norma also looks grotesque in as much as she is getting old and still dresses and makes herself up to be young, yet she like her home(and it could be said her acting style), is starting to fade away and crumble into non existence.It's also a look at two different acting styles the silent era(telling the story through expressions,emotion and gestures)and the sound era and Holden and Swanson give great performances of opposite styles.With great performances from Swanson,Holden and film director Eric Von Stronheim as Norma's butler (who was one of her ex husbands)Von Stronheim also directed Gloria in one of the films that Norma watches on her private cinema screen called Queen Kelly. This was the film that finished his directing career .Filled with cameos from people like Cecil.B DeMille and Buster Keaton this is an inside look at the glamour,pain,passion and madness of Hollywood and gives us glimpses of the different people involved in the film making process the writers,directors,actors,designers etc and how awful it must be when a big star for whatever reason just fades away and out of public interest.Highlights include the creepy ending. The New Year Eve party for just Joe and Norma and that unforgettable shot of Holden floating in the swimming pool at the beginning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thankfully, despite the concerns of some studio chiefs, Billy Wilder went down that road.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It may have been a bitter pill for the big dogs in Hollywood to swallow (notably an incensed Louis B. Mayer), but this striking, captivating film was and is a tremendous indictment of ageism and the disposability of stars. Holden plays a down on his luck writer whose main objective is to stay ahead of two repo men who want his car. When he turns into the driveway of a weathered mansion off the title street, he steps into a nearly surreal world of decaying grandeur, led by former silent film goddess Swanson, aided by her terse butler von Stroheim. She hires him to help flesh out her self-written return to the screen, but, before long, he finds that he's been employed to cater to other needs of hers, emotional and physical. Meanwhile, pert, dedicated Olson, an aspiring writer herself, wants Holden to assist her in bringing one of his unsold works to life. This, however, doesn't sit well with Swanson, who by now requires virtually all of his attention as she prepares to take the cinematic world by storm again. Holden, handsome and in shape (and sporting the thatch of chest hair which Hollywood frequently required him to remove!) does a terrific job in the film. His casual, understated approach is in great contrast with his co-star's, but it works well. He was a late stage replacement for Montgomery Clift. Swanson, who had herself been away from the screen for an extended period of time, is stunning. Practically every line she has is delivered with passion (and many of the lines have since become oft-quoted staples.) Her presence and her claw-like gestures combine to create a desperate, grasping, tragic woman. Von Stroheim is even more understated than Holden, but, again, it works beautifully with his stern visage at odds with the ever-emoting Swanson. The only really normal person in the film is Olson and her fresh, optimistic personality fills out the star quartet nicely. (All four stars received Oscar noms, though none took home the statuette.) Several silent film veterans appear briefly as bridge partners of Swansons including Nilsson, Keaton and Warner. Legendary director de Mille appears to great effect as himself. Director Wilder was known for his watertight, set-in-stone scripts and this is one of his best. The storyline and dialogue are fascinating and have remained so over many years, making this a solid classic. He utilized top people in every area from composer Franz Waxman to costume designer Edith Head. There were plenty of connections between the cast and Swanson. For example, von Stroheim had been one of Swanson's directors in her earlier career, as had de Mille. Swanson and Olson, however, shared no scenes in this film, nor did they when they appeared many years later in "Airport 1975." It's an arresting, darkly funny, but also sad view of life in a spotlight that has dimmed almost completely. A very successful stage musical came several decades later, which gave a passel of divas (including Glenn Close and Diahann Carroll) a chance to play the role Swanson created. TV star Carol Burnett milked a parody of the movie into several very amusing and beloved skits with Harvey Korman playing her beleaguered manservant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Psycho Sunset</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When trying to deconstruct something as complex as SUNSET BLVD., sometimes less is more as in the case of Lee Server's quip from "The Big Book Of Noir": 'Wilder's staggering Hollywood Gothic. A kind of melding of Raymond Chandler and the Brothers Grimm.' Whether SUNSET BLVD. is "noir" or not has divided aficionados for years for some strange reason. It is, of course -it's one of the darkest- but much more so when one considers that Alfred Hitchcock's PSYCHO (1960) is a slyly distorted doppelganger of the Wilder. Consider this: Both Norma &amp; Norman are delusional recluses hiding from the outside world in crumbling old mansions. The two tarnished heroes, Joe Gillis &amp; Marion Crane, are both outside convention (a gigolo &amp; a thief), both are on the run (the law &amp; the repo men), both have unforeseen events happen on the road (a rainstorm &amp; a blow-out) which lead them to the spider- webs of demented couples (Norma &amp; Max, Norman &amp; Mother) and neither of them make it out alive. Their watery death connection is also unmistakable: Joe in a pool, Marion in a shower tub. The two final close-up mad scenes mirror each other as well -the skull superimposed over Norman's face is very similar to the demented rictus grin of Norma's fade-out. There's more, of course. In addition to the dark vs. light between the spider webs and the outside world, I noticed: 1) Joe Gillis is put up in a guest-room over the garage just outside the mansion. Marion Crane is put up in Cabin #1 in the no-tell motel just outside the mansion. 2) It was money that had Joe &amp; Marion on the run and running into the spider's webs. It was their sexuality (Norma &amp; Norman were attracted to them) that got them killed. 3) Norman &amp; Max are volunteers for their own private traps and act as caretakers to their obsessions. 4) Dead, stuffed birds hover on the periphery during Marion's introduction to Norman and a dead, stuffed monkey introduces Joe to Norma. 5) The first we see of the living Joe Gillis is the voyeuristic camera going through the window of the Alto Nido apartments. The first we see of Marion Crane is the voyeuristic camera going through the window of a downtown Phoenix hotel. 6) Just moments before their violent end, both Joe Gillis &amp; Marion Crane took a good look at themselves and made the final decision to "come clean" (in Marion's case, literally, in the shower): Joe was leaving Hollywood/Norma and going back to the mid-West and Marion was returning to Phoenix to make amends. ***This aspect makes these two film the blackest of noir! 7) Betty Schafer &amp; Lila Crane went into the spider's web to investigate and got the shock of their lives. Lila's sister was dead and Joe Gillis was gone from Betty's life forever. Alfred Hitchcock always insisted that PSYCHO was his "little black joke" and now I have to wonder if the "joke" wasn't a clever SUNSET BLVD. redux. Hmmm...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really want to applaud this movie for being courageous and far, far ahead of its time. It shows the result of how a "lovely girl at the age of seventeen" is being turned into the most hideous monster one can imagine. And how does this come about? Simply by being a star and thereby becoming delusional about her own importance. It can probably be a very hard lesson to learn that you can be adored by the crowds and the next minute forgotten. And if you have build your identity up around being a star what do you have left if and when this happens? Absolutely nothing except your memories and the hope of returning to the screen. In the case of Norma Desmond you immediately sense how unrealistic the hope of returning to the screen is and you are horrified by her appearance which suggests to you that she is still playing one of her silent movies roles where it was important to "overplay" since there was no dialogue. Gloria Swanson is gruesome to watch in this role ? this is acting on a level that you rarely see.Then she adds an incredible depth to her part as she shows us how vulnerable she feels towards Joe Gillis who in return is torn between contempt and some sort of affection towards her. Her servant helps her building up a world of illusion and he finally succeeds in giving her what she wants; to play a part in front of the rolling cameras; It doesn't get more "noir" than this.Recommend this without any hesitation.Regards Simon</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A recurring theme in Billy Wilder's work is the price we pay for opportunism. It haunts Jack Lemmon's C.C. Baxter in The Apartment; it is life's blood to Kirk Douglas' Chuck Tatum in Ace in the Hole; it is ironic in Stalag 17, in which William Holden's Sefton, the most opportunistic of the prisoners, ends up as the most heroic. Before all these comes Holden's Joe Gillis, whose nemesis is one of the most terrifying and glorious of all screen goddesses - Norma Desmond, incarnated by Gloria Swanson in one of the greatest ever movie performances.Swanson obviously was, to some extent, the character she portrayed: she had been one of the biggest of Hollywood names, had faded from public view, and was, in this very film, returning, as her alter-ego was attempting to do. But there the resemblance ends. With every step that Norma takes to the madhouse, Swanson moves further towards greatness. They can make the story over all they want - add songs, reshoot it frame-by-frame (someone'll undoubtedly try one day). It won't matter. Swanson will never be outrun. She knew the prototypical Norma Desmonds first hand. If things had worked out differently she might have even turned into something like one. But in the end she poured her knowledge and experience of a unique moment in artistic history into a character that could only have been created then (when sound in movies had been around for only a generation) but, through the imagination of Wilder and Brackett, became something bigger, more powerful, absorbing the weak in her wake. And that brings us back to Holden's superb turn as the spineless Gillis who, through the intercession of the splendid Nancy Olsen, finally sees the light, and dies for his insight.Writing about it, it becomes clear that this is a piece of work that transcends its time and place to join the real classics of drama. Totally brilliant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is fantastic writing, great story folding, and very successful in the way it uses the "form" to provide us, the audience, with a meaning. It may not be the first self-referential movies in history but it is for sure one of the first intelligent ones.Possible spoilers herein. So, what we get is films within the film. The film is what we, the audience, see. In order to really make it look like afilm, we hear the off-voice of the corpse (narrator), even when the corpse is being shown to us. A dead man describing himself as dead (the original intention was to place the speaking corpse in a morgue). Inside this clearly constructed film we find some others. To know:. -the projection of Queen Kelly, the film directed by Stroheim (who plays the projector in our film) and starred by Swanson, our actress playing an retired actress.- Demille's picture, real event, it was happening at the time. DeMille plays himself. i'll get here ahead. - Salome. The picture about a mad woman, the leitmotif of our film is the development of this film. The very awareness of the history of Salome will lead us to the events of our Sunset Boulevard.This is what we see. Films within films. What do they mean?: Practically every character in the film plays in the picture his status in real life:. Holden, playing the broke writer was himself having a down moment in his career. Olson, playing the ambitious potential writer was herself a struggling actress at this moment. The "wax figures" appear as themselves as retired "used to be" stars. The best comes with Stroheim and Swanson. Queen Kelly represented, at the time of its making, a huge polemic film that was no good for Swanson's career, and eventually ruined Stroheim's Its projection, by Stroheim, and the pantomime in our sunset boulevard, by Swanson, adds to its decadence feeling. DeMille also worked with Swanson, in Sunset Boulevard he is not talking to any character, he is talking to her. Obviously she was not in real life the character she portrays, but deMille talks to the real people, not the character.This is a highly intelligent and complex construction, that strikes us as a simple one. Chabrol starts his "how to make a picture" book by saying that if you're about to make a film, you've got to have a reason. In here it's crystal clear, the reasons. The critics to Hollywood decadent society, through drawing the turning line between two worlds. Wilder uses the relations with real true (outside films) and delivers us something that may be faced as an ambiguous world, inside and outside our real world. Films, and our lives are made of those things.The criticism it depicts are useless, dated, and a mere curiosity today, but this stands as a very clever construction and, therefor, a worth seeing picture.My evaluation: 4/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's nothing I can say to praise this movie enough. This movie is simply the most excellent, perfect movie ever. To give it a 10 is an insult.I've lost track of how many times I've seen this film ... close to 50 would be my guess. How many movies can you watch that many times and the movie remains just as perfect, just as entertaining, just as enthralling and fascinating each time you watch it? Very few, that's for sure! Gloria Swanson was simply perfection in this movie. What a brilliant casting move on Billy Wilder's part! And what a performance Swanson gave. Her theatrics and eye movements were so dead-on ... but then what else could we expect from a genuine mega-star from the silent screen era, playing a faded mega-star from the silent screen era? What a totally unself-conscious portrayal. One of the best screen portrayals ever, in my opinion.Von Stroheim as the butler / former silent director ... again, genius. Erich von Stroheim made some GREAT pictures in his day, I mean VERY GREAT (can you say "Greed"?), but ended up on the outs in Hollywood thanks to his legendary ego and his battles with Thalberg. How perfect to get a dethroned former major silent director to play a has-been silent director! Remember, it may be de rigeur nowadays for actors to play characters that mock their former selves (a la William Shatner and his newfound popularity), but this was half a century ago when Billy Wilder and Gloria Swanson and von Stroheim pioneered this type of tongue-in-cheek, knowing self-referentialism.And William Holden ... handsome, sarcastic, jaded, sexy-voiced William Holden as the down-and-out writer who turns gigolo. His character is only about 30 years old, but already the Hollywood system has chewed him up and spit him out. He can't even pay his rent or his car loan. His dry, witty, noir-esquire narration of the story adds yet another layer of perfection to this 11-out-of-10 movie.What else is there to say? How does one adequately describe perfection? One does not.</fullReview>

Screenplay Charles Brackett, D.M. Marshman Jr."This is my life. There's nothing else. Just the lights and the camera and you wonderful people sitting out there in the dark.Alright, Mr. De Mille, I'm ready for my close-up"..............Director Billy Wilder achieved Hollywood recognition with "Sunset Boulevard" and despite later successes with films like "Sabrina" (1954) and "Some Like It Hot" (1959), it is this film that will forever be his masterpiece. "Sunset" has remained an American movie classic more than 50 years later and has stood the test of time. At the time of its release, it was somewhat of a controversial and modern film, ahead of its time. Billy Wilder got away with essentially criticizing and satirizing the Hollywood film industry with the cynical and darkly comical "film noir" story of the tragic silent film diva Norma Desmond, magnificently portrayed by Gloria Swanson, herself a former silent film star. Not the least bit worried that she was basically parodying herself, Swanson and other silent film era stars- Swanson's former director Erich Von Stroheim, Buster Keaton, Ray Evans, Anna Q. Nilsson, even Cecil B. De Mille himself- take part in this unforgettable classic. Set in 1950's Hollywood/LA, struggling, down-on-his luck screenwriter Joe Gillis (William Holden) avoids the car impound guys by hiding in a secluded mansion, the owner who is none other than Norma Desmond, once a big silent film star. Now she lives in a creepy, deteriorating mansion with the sinister-looking butler Max (Erich Von Stroheim). When Norma offers Joe the chance to make money writing her film script for "Salome" which she hopes will be her come-back movie, he accepts without knowing what he is getting himself into. Before long, Norma falls for him and becomes possessive of him, keeping him in her mad world where time has not passed her by. But Joe manages to sneak off in order to work on a script, with the equally intelligent screenwriter Betty Schaefer (Nancy Olson) who was formerly engaged to studio hand Artie Green (Jack Webb) but who eventually falls for Joe. When Norma discovers the relationship, jealousy gets the best of her, with tragic results for Joe. Both William Holden and Gloria Swanson have terrific chemistry and their performances earned them an Oscar nomination. This is actually Bill Holden's first important film and he would make one great film after another following this. So much to admire. The witty script full of great lines- "I'm still big, it's the pictures that got smaller", "I'm ready for my close-up Mr. De Mille", the cameo by Hollywood gossip writer Hedda Hopper and De Mille's own presence, the superb music by Franz Waxman and the subtle symbolism to be found everywhere, with one theme alone- death. Norma's career is dead and she wishes to revive it, Joe is in a state of death as a screenwriter and hopes to somehow to rekindle his writing prowess, Norma's dead monkey early in the film is a stand-in for Joe himself, who figuratively becomes her monkey and one who dies at the end of the film. The film is absolutely wonderful and this is the type of film that can never get old, despite the melodramatic quality, which, fortunately, is countered by solid dialog and a powerful attack on Hollywood society. Was the fate of silent film stars or older stars to fade away into obscurity and madness when a new wave of films and actors comes along ? The story of Norma Desmond may in fact be the real life story of silent film star Mary Pickford is truthfully a bit tragic. She tried to transition into talkies but was unsuccessful (like Norma Desmond) and in her old age she isolated herself in her big mansion and faded away. There are very little films like this nowadays. Of interesting note, this film inspired the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical and this musical will be made into a movie starring Glenn Close set to be released in 2008.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>..Masterful glimpse of early Hollywood..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am 82-years-old. I have lived through the entire "movie" experience. I am always amused at "reviews" by people who weren't alive when the films were released. They can't imagine how many millions of hopeless people discovered, for a few pennies, the magical medium to help lift them from the drudgery of life. Nor are they aware that the earliest films were photographed in pure light. However, not only were the viewers entranced with pictures that "moved", those who were pioneering all this magic were also fascinated that their industry was growing so quickly and ingeniously. The "silent" period didn't last too long. Once it was discovered voices could be recorded as the actors-actresses played their roles, the technologies were developed very quickly. "Sunset Boulevard" is a graphic display of how big stars fell by the wayside, because they didn't have good voices. HOWEVER, there is no mention in this movie if Norma Desmond had been tested for speaking roles. By Gloria Swanson's performance, I would say Norma would have remained a great star, because the addition of a "voice" would have become a tremendous asset. As proof, although so many people don't realize it, it certainly didn't hurt Ms. Swanson - she was much more active in theatrical presentations than most of the "reviewers" for IMDb knew of. Always read the "trivia" feature - you can learn so much. Some "reviewers" said she was the natural choice for the role, when actually she had to do an audition to be considered. This is shocking in itself, because Ms. Swanson was close friends with all of these studio-people who were looking for a star."The Star" had truly always been one - many "reviewers" commented that 50 years-old was being ancient. Ms Swanson was well-past that age when she made this film. What few younger people know is, she ALWAYS insisted on everything she ate was organically grown. The youthfulness of her skin was one of her characteristics which made her famous. The scene in the movie where "an army of beauticians descended" was the only scene you saw her naked skin - her make-up for the film purposely aged her. Having been a silent screen-star, she had the advantage of over-the-top expressions, which the script by Marcus Brackette called-for. Billy wilder knew exactly what he was getting in Ms. Swanson and cashed-in on it.By 1950, many amazing technologies had been developed for movie-making. Can you imagine how out-of-place color would be here? This script called for stark whites and grey shadows and blacks, as you saw. Not many of today's stars will be filmed in pure light. Also heavily lambasted was the "mansion" Desmond lived in - guess what: it's still lived-in and is gorgeous. With a little "age-ing", it was perfect for THIS dark story and others.As all recognize, Ms. Swanson was the ultimate Desmond. Her performance was steel, as was von Stroheim's as the director-husband-butler. They knew exactly what they were doing. William Holden (Joe Gillis) was practically unknown until this career-making role came his way, and how fortunate he was to be surrounded by so much talent. His bland treatment of the role made it plausible - not much room for emotion there. His opening scene in the pool grabs your attention from the beginning - other actors could have done that role, but not as effectively nor successfully as he did. Nancy Olson (Betty Schafer) was just right for the ambitious writer; how delightful to remember Jack Webb (Artie Green) was a normal man, rather than that robot-talking cop on "Dragnet". Who could have done DeMille but DeMille (he had also been an actor)? Doesn't anyone remember that Hedda Hopper was an actress before she became a columnist? "Sunset Boulevard" was without fault, taking its place with so many classics from that era. Norma Desmond wasn't much different than almost everyone - who wants to give-up that high-paying CEO-job, or lose an election? Although movies like "Sunset Boulevard" don't come too often in this day and age, some of the "starlets" are much more outrageous - to stay in the public eye - than Ms. Desmond was. Except for the hype, I'd take this movie over "Citizen Kane" any ole day. All those people "out there in the dark" should stay in it to watch this masterpiece. Surely rates a 50 -</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Artistically Captivating Masterpiece on the Perilous Power of the Limelight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Few filmmakers dare to open the curtains to the public on what really takes place beyond Hollywood's glitter and glamor as Billy Wilder did with SUNSET BLVD. Unforgettable performances, effective visuals, faultless, inventive direction and a biting, comical and melodramatic screenplay make this a legendary film on filmdom.Joe Gills' (William Holden) corpse is seen floating in a swimming pool while his off-screen narration recalls his dangerous professional and personal involvement with Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) and the events leading to his demise. Joe, a B-movie screenwriter, inadvertently winds up at a decaying mansion, where faded silent film-star Norma takes residence with her faithful butler Max Von Mayerling (Erich Von Stroheim). The insane Norma has certainly past her prime but she mistakenly believes she can achieve a "return" as an actress again. Joe wishes to leave but when Norma insists that there will be serious cash involved, he takes on a job offered to him as an editor of her defective, self-indulgent screenplay. At first, Joe, who is now obliged to live with Norma, is treated like a gigolo, having every one of his needs catered. However, when Joe secretly co-writes a script with the attractive level-headed Betty Schaefer (Nancy Olson), Norma takes extreme measures to assure herself that she is a star who will not be abandoned.Wilder productively creates the eerie, dreamlike and surreal atmosphere in the beautiful black-and-white images of the crumbling mansion and the wicked, wraith-like characters. Nevertheless, not a single characteristic of the film seems fabricated or fictitious. Its sense of realism is undeniable. Many can relate to Desmond - rejected by Hollywood after years in front of the camera. Another unusual yet valuable aspect is its sense of humor and ability to laugh at itself. Even the most famous lines in the movie are both heartbreaking and amusing, intensifying the illusion that Norma has forever been a superstar.Gloria Swanson is exceptional in her magnum opus and most memorable role as the purely malevolent, manipulative Norma Desmond, a woman stuck in the past. Gloria, herself, was a silent movie queen of her time and had been missing from the silver screen for 16 years. Now, it is unimaginable to picture anyone else as Norma. Though less remarkable, William Holden is excellent as a skeptical screenwriter knowing Norma won't be able to attain the star-status she once had. He has moral flaws of anyone walking down the street but he slowly becomes the likable protagonist. Just as competent is Erich Von Stroheim who plays the silently sadistic butler, who guarantees Norma that she has always been the celebrity that she thinks she is. The final major character is ingénue Betty Schaefer played by Nancy Olson. Her composure and calmness is a pleasing contrast to Norma's irrationality.SUNSET BLVD. is really a black comedy-satire with a sardonic, derisive screenplay, film-noir with perfect direction and character-driven drama with terrific acting all together. Though most significantly, it is a painfully captivating work of art and a candid peek on the fickle world of showbiz and its devastating effects.</fullReview>

And to think it came out in the 50s.....It is the story of a lonesome actress of the Silent movie era, Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), who cannot come to terms with the fact that her days of glory are long gone....In such a scenario, a series of events lead to her meeting a young screen-writer by the name of Joe Gillis (William Holden). What follows is a tragic tale of madness....a tale which will show that Hollywood is not always the rosy picture it is made out to be! The film is brilliantly directed by Billy Wilder. Hats off to Gloria Swanson for her extraordinary performance as Norma Desmond. She totally rules the screen throughout the movie! William Holden is great as Joe Gillis. Also, equally good is Erich Von Stroheim in a supporting role.Most people may just ignore this film on face value, since it is Black and White and was released in 1950. But I would like to state here, that just this once, at least for this film, make an exception. Rent this movie or just buy the DVD. It's very well worth it.10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest movies ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As someone who works in this industry, I know what it does to a person, and also what people will do to make it. That is the story of Norma Desmond and Joe Gillis, one who has reached the pinnacle of success in Hollywood, only to have to have lost her youth and beauty and forgotten; and another who is struggling at the bottom to make it and will do just about anything to achieve that.That parallel is what makes this movie so genius. Norma Desmond is one of the great characters in cinematic history, and Gloria Swanson does a phenomenal job portraying her. I had only seen Gloria in silent films previous to this, and was doubtful of her "speaking" abilities, but she just absolutely nails this role. I cannot imagine anyone who could have done this better than her. Especially that end scene, where she does that eerie dance down the stairs and raises her eyebrows and walks into the camera. Absolutely Fantastic!Although William Holden was amazing, I kinda would have liked to have seen how Montgomery Clift would have pulled it off. I think what was appealing about Monty was that sensitivity and vulnerability he portrayed, and I think that would have worked very well in this role.Other than that, the casting was perfect. Erich von Stronheim was excellent, and what is scary is that he used to be a up and coming director in the 20s. Nancy Olson had that innocent, wholesome look that was perfect for Betty, the only character in this movie that gives this industry any redemption. For that reason alone, I would have given her the oscar over Josephine Hull.I know that Billy Wilder was one of the people who wrote this script, and if he came up with that line, "I'm still big, it's the pictures that got small," on top of his direction of this movie, he is absolute genius.One of the ten greatest movies ever made.</fullReview>

The fact she kills Holden in the final scene adds up to what the movie is all about. Everybody knows she's excentric and a fallen idol. The part I liked the most is Holden knocking at her door, and he's being mistaken by Von Stroheim, the butler, for a funeral aranger. Swanson's chimp died. A perfect beginning to a perfect film. A great classic, and although not very fast, it is still breathtaking and very realistic. An absolute A, one of the best films ever made, with an excellent performance by Holden and Von Stroheim.On a cold winter day, staring out of the window, I often think about this masterpiece, and wonder if Swanson plays a role or plays herself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sunset Boulevard is a TRUE classic. Holden, Von Strohem and Olsen are very good but it is Gloria Swanson who is astonishing. SHE was another who was robbed of a deserved Best Actress Oscar. She completely submerges into the character of Norma Desmond. Her Chaplin is wonderful, her mannerism are just perfect and the finale is a true classic. GLOIA IS WONDERFUL!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strange how I'd misremembered the opening.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The corpse floating in the pool, was, so far as I could recall, the very first thing we saw; and the first thing we heard was the narrator casually mentioning that HE was the dead man in the pool, and this was his story...Not so. There's a little bit of scene-setting before we even see the corpse, with the narrator chatting away, seemingly with no particular aim; and by the time he gets around to using the word "I", which lets us know that this is HIS story, we've already cut to a flashback, which makes it quite easy for the viewer to miss the implied point (which is not, in the end, all that important) that we're listening to the words of a dead man.According to Otto Friedrich's "City of Nets", the original script's opening scene would have left us in no doubt. Wilder had planned to show us bodies lying around in a morgue, with tags on their toes; suddenly, a few of the bodies would sit up, and start swapping stories about how they died. Then Joe would get around to telling how HE died, etc., etc. Apparently nobody liked this gruesome prologue, and Friedrich himself professes relief that Wilder's associates managed to talk him out of it. I think the original prologue was a WONDERFUL idea: its brash insolence could only have helped the film. Oh, well. The more muted, inexplicit opening Wilder went with in the end is still a remarkably strong one.The film that follows is an enigma. You've got to love the haunted mansion (haunted by a star of the silent era who is very much alive, even if her career is dead), and the sharp chromatic ditty that forms the basis of Franz Waxman's score, which worms its way into our heads and then NAGS us about something, although it's hard to say what; you've got to love seeing Wilder at his most visually eloquent (he may have been better with words than images, but he still had a better grasp of what to do with the camera than most directors), working with a script that manages to convey heavy fatalism while leaving us in constant doubt as to where it's going to go next. Perhaps the only reason I feel this falls JUST short of being Wilder at his best is that I can't even tell where it got to in the end. Is there a moral? It FEELS as though there is - but what is it?Don't believe anyone who says that this is some kind of Hollywood exposé. We know how dull THEY are... The exposé element turns out to be a trivial part of the overall picture, anyway. A brief, almost casually included conversation with Cecil B. DeMille reveals that Norma was driven mad not by anything that happened recently, not even by the years of neglect, but just over twenty years earlier, at the height of her success - and it was the excesses of the silent-era star system that did it. The more muted Hollywood of 1950 Wilder depicts may actually be a healthier place.Or it may not be. It's not the film's concern either way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For me this is Billy Wilder's [and likely Holden's] finest work, which is saying something on both counts. And Bill was robbed of the Oscar for this remarkable performance.The only flaw in the entire film is one which echoes "Citizen Kane's" sole error ~Sunset: How can a dead man narrate a film?Kane: How can a dying man utter a word ["Rosebud"] in an empty room, and yet have the entire film revolve around friend and fellow newsman Cotten's search for the word's meaning? I mean, no one actually could have heard him say the word. Don't believe me? Watch the beginning again ~ the nurse walks in after Kane falls down he stairs.Immaterial.Read everyone else's review of this film, because it's all been said here.It's a tour de force on every level, and not just for the [now cliched] line: "I'm ready for my close~up, Mr. DeMille," nor for the fact that the past~her~prime Gloria Swanson agreed to play a has~been [unheard of at the time. even though Swanson was never really an extraordinary Hollywood figure].The kicker for me is that the extremely important early German expressionist filmmaker Erich Von Stroheim actually lowered himself to play Swanson's [Garbo~based?] character's butler/assistant, helping to keep her legend alive.This is akin to Martin Scorsese playing butler to average actress Kelly Preston 20 years from now.Holden, as the penultimate gold~digger/gigolo [albeit unwittingly at first], is simply brilliant. As is the forever underrated Nancy Olson as his wannabe screenwriter mentee. Despite her first~rate work here, she never appeared in another masterpiece again.Our loss.William Holden did, of course, and a case can be made for his performances in "Bridge On The River Kwai," "Stalag 17" [Wilder again], "Picnic," "Network" etc.But for me this was his career's defining role.10 of 10 [and #6 in my US Top Ten Films]</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not too many films could personify all that is Hollywood quite like this film. This film speaks Hollywood, shows Hollywood, cries Hollywood and dies Hollywood. Billy Wilder tried harder than any of his other film while making this one and it sure shows.The story of the aging film star that still lives in the past was something like a tribute to an era that even in the 50's had long lost its luster. Gloria Swanson in the best role of her career plays Norma Desmond, the silent screen star who is in the process of writing a script for a film to be directed by Cecil B DeMille, or at least she believes so. Norma entails the help of a younger man named Joe Gillis (played by William Holden), who in a bit of desparation of his own, decides to alter her script for her in return for money and a place to live.The haunting mansion that Desmond lives in with only her butler Max (Erich von Stronheim) shows only pictures of her, has a screen onto which her films are shown to her weekly and plays host to other former silent film stars (notably Buster Keaton in a surprise cameo), is a reminder of how time passed Norma by. Norma tries, though in vain to make Joe love her as she loves him. She even goes through the trouble of having a small orchestra play all night on New Year's Eve just for the two of them. When Joe asks when all of the other people are going to arrive, Norma responds "this is a special evening, this is our evening." From here on we see to what lengths Norma will go to show Joe how much she loves him, regardless of the fact that he does not love her.Joe is eventually approached by a script reader, Betty, (Nancy Olsen) that finds some potential in one of his older scripts and offers to work with him to bring it up to par. The only problem is the close grip that Norma has around him. Joe knows that he can only sneak away at night since Norma doesn't want him to be away from her for any amount of time. Joe leaves frequently to work with Betty, all the while falling in love with her.The tragic ending in this film reminded me of the one in "The Great Gadsby." It is another example of love gone wrong when a man should have been with the girl he loved, however, the circumstances he is in simply won't let him.I fully enjoyed this film and would recommend it to all. This film is truly one of the all time greats.8/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Sunset Blvd" unfortunately wasn't as exciting for me as I thought it would be after hearing all the hype. Perhaps it is because the premise is either too dated or too cliché. Nowadays, sixty years after the movie was released, we all know the dark side of Hollywood. We know how it eats people up and spits them out. There is something very real about this film noir, but today it is not something new or particularly interesting. However, sixty years ago, this film was probably more intriguing and 'groundbreaking'.I am generally a fan of more character driven movies so I did enjoy that aspect of "Sunset Blvd". The movie is well cast and the female lead, Gloria Swanson as Norma Desmond, is a particularly interesting character is sad to watch because she is a fallen star who fails to grasp reality. The costumes in this movie are notable if you pay attention to them. The sets are also a strong suit.This movie accurately shows just how cruel Hollywood can be. However, this is no revelation to people who watch it for the first time nowadays. You will either greatly applaud it or it will be unappreciated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Up To Date, Disturbing And Powerful, Despite A Few Dated Elements</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Do you want to be disturbed?Are you ready for a clammy, ice-cold classic that's relentlessly sad, chilling and upsetting? Try SUNSET BOULEVARD.Where else can you find a movie that starts -- actually starts -- with the main character being dragged out of a swimming pool dead? And then, the poor dope spends two hours telling you how he lost his job, his career, his girl friend, his self respect, and his life. But he got that swimming pool he always wanted.It's horrible to watch Joe Gillis lose everything. William Holden gives his character so much smarts and charm, you just can't believe he can be snuffed out so easily. But that's what Hollywood does -- and the message is that if it can happen to Joe, it can happen to anyone.On the other hand, Norma Desmond is truly a fiend out of hell. Gloria Swanson will never be equaled in her courage, playing a woman who is more repulsive and hateful than any modern serial killer or hatchet wielding maniac. And yet all she wants is to go on being young and beautiful forever, sharing the magic of her stardom with "those wonderful people out there in the dark!" And the message is, if this monster is what's in front of the camera, who knows how many other monsters are out there -- in the dark? At the heart of this movie is an intriguing contradiction. On the one hand, the chilling madness of Norma Desmond is as real and modern as the ghastly antics of the late Michael Jackson. (Funeral for a chimpanzee, anyone?) On the other hand, the anguish of Joe Gillis at being "kept" by an older woman is almost (and I do mean almost) too sexist and out of date to keep the viewer involved in the story.Consider how this story would play if the gender roles were reversed. What if Norma Desmond were a tough, male Western star of the silents -- someone like legendary stuntman/cowpoke Tom Mix. And what if the young screenwriter were a pretty young woman with a cheerful, irreverent, upbeat personality, sort of like Carole Lombard or Katherine Hepburn? If the two of them got together it would seem sweet, romantic, not repulsive and chilling. Particularly if the eager young female helped him to get over the death of a beloved wife, or maybe his horse.The point is, no one would be horrified if a 50 something male star seduced a bright young woman in her late twenties or thirties. In fact it would be regarded as rather romantic by a lot of people.A lot of the "horror" of SUNSET BOULEVARD comes from an unthinking assumption -- that women with money and power are unnatural creatures and that they can only attract younger men through evil and manipulation. And there's also the double standard that a woman over 50 is no damned good to a man, but a man over 50 is still in his prime.One final thought: William Holden had a wonderful career well into his seventies, and deservedly so. One of his last great performances was in THE WILD BUNCH, where he plays an aging outlaw named Pike Bishop. Note that Pike has the same basic concerns as Norma Desmond. Have I outlived my era? Can I still command respect? What was my life worth? Yet Pike's struggles to pull off one last job are not only not laughed at -- they're rendered as poignant, admirable, and unbelievably heroic. Pike plays the kind of noble, courageous life-giving elder whose wisdom and humanity -- and even his violent tragic death -- simply serve to rejuvenate an entire community.That's the kind of part a mature actress should be able to play as well!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a big fan of Film Noir Genre and also love Billy Wilder movies especially 'Double Indemnity', 'Witness for the Prosecution' and 'Apartment'.No one can keep you more glued to the seat than him but when I watched 'Sunset Blvd', in 20 minutes I was already aware I was watching his masterpiece, The best film noir ever.The tension created by Wilder to the mystery of Norma Desmond character acts as duel progress to show a lonely woman and also the changing trends of Hollywood and the impact on stars that fade.It also tells the story and struggle of nascent writers in Hollywood.Well throughout the movie I didn't stop saying WOW!! The lighting, the camera angles, the sets, the screenplay all add to the noir atmosphere but it is all topped by wonderful Direction which is really flawless.Also, realistic acting performances by both William Holden and Gloria Swanson are 10/10.You can't really chose which one has done his/her part better.I never put spoilers in my reviews so I would highly recommend to watch this movie.Even if you are a Noir fan,you will love it.If you want to start watching this genre,start with the best,the crown jewel of film noir and that's undoubtedly 'Sunset Blvd' .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>arguably Wilder at his very best; Swanson, Holden, and von Stroheim are about perfect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was a little speechless after I first finished watching Sunset Blvd. I had an idea of what to expect, but I didn't expect that a film made over half a century ago would be so sharp, so artistically compelling, and so tragic while still containing a blistering sense of humor. In some ways it was ahead of its time with its satire, ironically in a film that looks to the past with a sense of sad, but honest nostalgia. Gloria Swanson, the star of the film, plays a woman who is a star still in her old mind, Norma Desmond. There are a handful (how big the hand is depends on the particular viewer) of films where you have a character or characters that are not only unforgettable, but become so trenched in the public consciousness its hard to think of mistaking it for anything else. Even as a kid and knew that line "I'm ready for my close-up, Mr. DeMille" was a basic, but dead-on swipe at ego, or at least stardom. That it was in this context makes it all the more comic/tragic. That Sunset Boulevard also has the distinction of being in the film-noir tradition along with having some satirical grounding solidifies it one of the really unique films of the Golden Age of post World War 2 America.The story starts with our protagonist and past-tense narrator, Joe Gillis, who is a struggling B movie screenwriter in Hollywood. Fate, or maybe just odd luck, pits him into the driveway of a big, almost archaic estate that almost looks haunted to him on first sight. He meets Norma Desmond, whom he doesn't recognize as once being a big silent movie star. "I am big," she says in one of her trademark lines, "it's the pictures that have gotten small." She confides in Gillis, after he tells her who he is and why he's there (hiding out as it were), that she has a screenplay she wants DeMille to direct as her 'comeback'. He very reluctantly agrees to do it, and very soon gets sucked up into her world, becoming disconnected to his small circle of Hollywood friends. But he still has one, as a kind of secret almost, Betty Schaefer (the beautiful Nancy Olson), who is an aspiring screenwriter. One can maybe guess what might happen as this goes on, but like with Wilder's other great films, the unexpected moments and keen revelations/coincidences are the best parts; Erich von Stroheim as Max, Norma's 'butler', is surprisingly good.I've seen Sunset Blvd. several times now, but I can't forget how much I laughed the first time around; I wondered why it was even considered in the 'film-noir' tradition (not that it didn't have its stylistic or character bearings, but compared to Double Indemnity it didn't seem as pumped up). I really took it as a kind of pioneering black comedy, with Norma Desmond as the delusional, self-fulfilling has-been. For example, when Gillis first arrives and Max and Norma bury her pet monkey- it's not just the image of the dead monkey and the reverence paid to it, but also as they bury it Gillis' wry narration. The narration in this film is another great trademark, with that kind of snappy later 40's/early 50's wit that helped move from the kind of wit that was in earlier Hollywood films. And of course there are some other absurdities that bring out a few good laughs, in particular when Norma visits DeMille in the studio, and gets suddenly by some surreal miracle all the attention she's been having in her head.In repeated viewings, the film does show itself as darker, with a lot more thought put into the themes and real problems in the characters. Not just Norma, but also Joe, who little by little becomes more like the sneaky son of an overbearing mother than a real collaborator. The final scenes, which link up to the "end scene at the beginning", and then the sort of crazy, classic epilogue of Norma on the staircase, more of the film-noir elements come through. The 'average Joe', so to speak, in over his head; the sinister elements that are around him (more so here psychological than criminal); and of course the 'black widow' in Norma Desmong. Swanson, in what should've been her Oscar winning role, never misses a beat. Through her delusions of grandeur and overwhelming nostalgia for the old days (another great scene is when she makes him watch all her old silent films), there is also a vulnerability that doesn't make her a totally hateful character. And through all of this is one of the best screenplays that's ever come out of the Golden Age of Hollywood. As I mentioned the narration is sharp and observant, as in a sort of Pulp-noir novel, and the dialog for the time isn't very unconvincing. The relationships, like the one between Joe and Betty, is handled gently, so that the punch that's given to the viewer at the end has more of an impact. Max, as well, is maybe even more a complex character than Norma; why stay as a butler for a woman who is almost in a time warp? Perhaps he is too. Maybe that's one, perhaps subtle, message to the film- as much as it is fascinating to look to the past, to get locked into it is something very detrimental. But the film may not have a very clear-cut message, as it is a dense film with different appeals to different people (like a Kubrick film)- it's funny, it's romantic, it's sly, and at times very weird. I can't wait to see it again.</fullReview>

Towering performances by Gloria Swanson, William Holden and Erich von Stroheim along with a perfect music score by Franz Waxman and a witty, biting script by Billy Wilder. Swanson's performance may be the single best performance by an actress in any American film--bar none. It certainly ranks with the best work of Katharine Hepburn, Bette Davis, or Meryl Streep. Swanson's vocal subtleties, ranging from imperious to coy to crazy are amazing. Because of its performances (Holden was never better), wit and bitingly honest look at Hollywood as a microcosm for the American Dream, this film is Number 1.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sunset Boulevard represents everything that is unsaid about Hollywood. It cruelly, yet accurately represents Hollywood in the same way that Citizen Kane so cruelly and accurately represents the world of business. Sunset waste no time. It throws us straight into the middle of what appears to be a mystery, but soon becomes a tragedy, and perhaps even an allegory of Old Hollywood meeting New Hollywood and not liking it one bit, a story of unwelcome but necessary progression. We meet Joe Gillis (William Holden) within seconds of the opening credits. The twist? He's a dead. Shot and floating in a swimming pool - a pool that he has always wanted (perhaps even more than to be a writer). Joe then starts to narrate, telling us how he came to be in the pool. He was a down and out writer, living in a small flat with debts to pay. One day the debts catch up and he finds himself making a run for it. He winds up taking a wrong turn into the grounds of an old house. That house is owned by Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), a middle aged actress who is past her prime but refuses to accept it and move on with her life. This is where Joe's nightmare begins, as he is effectively held captive, desperate for money, by a woman who is desperate for admiration and love and who will give anything for it, and in the end do anything to prevent the illusion from collapsing on front of her. This is where we see for the first time, that Norma could represent Old Hollywood (the past), whilst Joe could represent New Hollywood (the future). Norma and Old Hollywood are stuck in their ways. They hate the idea of progression, hate new talent, hate anything that changes the status quo and could go on to destroy them. So they becomes desperate, they take more and more desperate measures, they lure Joe and us with false promises of greatness, they bribes us. They will even take cruel punishment if it means that we and Joe will still sit there and pay attention. Norma begs Joe to hit her, rather than to hate her, and will bribe him with everything - just like Hollywood will take the remarks of critics if it means that audiences will keep going back, or it will gives us the likes of Transformers 3, a Spiderman reboot or anything that can give the illusion that it still has the answers, the talent.Because nothing scares Norma more than a lack of audience, and the same can be said for Hollywood. Of course, Joe and New Hollywood, they want progression. They, like us, hate the lack of progression, hate the repetitiveness, hate the way they and we are left in the cold when we know that we can do better. Norma thinks she still has it - but Joe knows the truth. She has had her day and needs to bow out gracefully to allow progression. At the moment, Hollywood still thinks it has it. But we know the truth - cinema numbers have fallen, and Hollywood is relying too heavily on reboots, comebacks, sequels and prequels. There is nothing original. There is little to no progression. In Sunset, the desperation in Norma turns to a jealous, uncontrollable rage that results in her essentially going mad and, SPOILER, shooting Joe dead to keep him hers and maintain her illusion that she is great. Hollywood, in desperation, doesn't shoot us dead, but does bombard us with explosions, special effects, promising adverts and violence that mask the fact that most films are no longer great, but just routine and are in desperate need of new, refreshed talent. Of course, even after all the trouble Norma causes, Joe tries hard to like her, to understand her, to make excuses, to protect her from the truth. He knows that she was a star, and at first even thinks there is a chance she could be again. And again, that can be said of us with Hollywood. We love Hollywood, not because of what it is, but because of what it once was and could be again in the right hands. We don't want to let a bright start fade. We want it to be great, so we put up with Michael Bay's Transformers, with a Spiderman reboot, with a poor remake of classics, because we hope that Hollywood will get its act together and make something bigger and better. Perhaps that final shot, where Norma reaches towards the camera, is Hollywood reaching for us in desperation?I'm not sure whether Wilder wanted to make this a film about failed stardom, or a metaphor for Hollywood. But it is a true testament to he and the cast that we can take the film literally or metaphorically, and still still be touched by it. Easily one of the best films of all time, right there with The Godfather or Chinatown. 10/10</fullReview>

I have always enjoyed film noir, but never really respected it as much as I would have for other movie genres, but Sunset Blvd. changed my mind. I could not find a single thing wrong with this movie. The acting, writing, and plot were all wonderful. The writing, of course, was the snazzy film noir type dialog that can be easily noticeable. The movie included famous lines such as: "I'm still big, it's the picture that got smaller" and "Mr. Demille, I'm ready for my close-up" The movie was still scary, even now, 55 years later! Overall, this is one of the greatest movies of all time and the best movie of the 50s.I highly recommend this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dripping with Edgy Cynicism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Film Noir, as it was filmed in black and white in the late 40's, early 50's is divided into three distinct categories. For the lowbrow, there is the brilliant Detour, so primitive and shot so cheaply, yet delivering a massive result. Then there is The Big Heat with Glenn Ford, a middlebrow film with the dark shadows, tragedy, and cynicism of Noir. Finally, for the highbrows, we have Billy Wilder's finest film, a true landmark dripping with edgy cynicism by a man that lost his parents to the Holocaust.In Sunset Boulevard, William Holden gives his finest performance. Holden is a very likable man and that comes through on the screen no matter which role he performs, but always that All-American persona, that likability leaks to the screen. Part of this quality is his obvious intelligence. As Norma Desmond's kept man, he knows it's wrong, at times it's downright creepy, but he works with Billy Wilder's vision and melds a bizarre group of Hollywood types into an indictment of the industry up to 1950.Are exploitation, money grubbing, and the status quest pertaining only to the early era of Hollywood? I don't think so. Ha, ha, ask Jessica Simpson, Jana Jamison, Michael Jackson, adnauseam.Gloria Swanson is a great actress. She lures Joe Gillis like a black widow spider. Her delirium is a cross between silent movie actress and Betty Davis in What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? Perhaps Davis got the idea from Gloria's earlier film. Curiously, Betty's 1950 picture All About Eve won the Oscar. It is a fine film, but SB scared the studio heads, indeed horrified them, and the picture was passed over. Anyhow, this was a comeback for Swanson and she went for it. I don't know if she did a lot of work after this film, but it solidified her reputation as a Prima-Donna film actress. Her performance is unforgettable.Also kudos for Erich Von Stroheim as Max, Nora's butler, ex-husband, and first director. Stroheim indeed was a fine silent film director and remarkable in Renoir's Grand Illusion. This fellow looks like he was born to wear the Kaiser's helmet.Finally, Nancy Olsen, pulled from obscurity, a college girl from Wisconsin, she is lovely as Holden's inspiration, and love interest. Her wholesomeness certainly contrasted with all the other grubby Hollywood types in the film.I have seen thousand's of films; many are of very high quality. I can't rattle them all off for you, but SB is in the top 25. Think about that!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have no problem with the acclaim Billy Wilder has received for this movie but I would like to call attention to Charles Brackett, probably the main writer. In particular I would like to see his "To Each His Own" a very fine tear jerker, made into a DVD. Brackett had a deep sensitivity to the older women he wrote about. He should be rediscoveredAll the usual kudos about this movie are well deserved. I don't personally enjoy it that much because I find it hard to react to creepy characters even when I can understand them and my head tells me this is true and well done. But as a character Norma Desmond is unforgettable, powerfully executed if unappreciated by me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I felt sorry for Norma and her sad, twisted fantasy with Holden trapped in that world to make a buck. Obviously, a time before depression meds, otherwise there may have been hope for old Norma, or at least something to keep her chilled out. Sunset Blvd. reminded me of a long twilight zone episode, but with better direction, sets, and more drama. Can't help but think the picture is overrated though. So what, the film talks about the "true Hollywood", but is that such a revelation? One need not go to Hollywood to see people getting screwed over, forgotten, passed on and otherwise exploited. Picture quality on DVD looked stunning even in black and white.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is it "The Player" were movie people come up with ideas for films like Rosemary's Baby meets Amadeus? Everyone loved these lines, and the cameos, but it had all been done before in Wilder's opening scene, and done better!I saw this in 1951, eight years old and living in an oil camp with my parents in Venezuela. Twenty years passed before I saw it again, but all those years it stuck with me. There was the man floating dead in the pool, but telling me this story, the mysterious funeral for the dead monkey, the old people sitting around playing bridge, von Stroheim flitting in and out, menacing to a boy my age, and bug-eyed Norma descending the stairs.It is a movie obsessed with death, but aren't most of our great films? Joe Gillis is like the female lead in a Gothic novel. 'Don't go in that house, Joe' but he does, and he meets the wicked witch, except she is dressed like Charlie Chaplin and she has real talent, while Gillis is no more than an interloper, an uninvited guest who does not come out the other side in the end.It was the first film I remember seeing, and will always remain my favorite.And of Wilder, the Viennese cynic? Who else can combine Sunset with Double Indemnity and Some Like It Hot, and have The Apartment etc etc etc hiding in the background.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark Side Tinseltown. A compelling and self-concerned Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By 1950 television was beginning to curtail the industry's power. Was it so palpable yet as to arouse nostalgia in some scripts? Sunset Blvd., All about Eve then The Bad and the Beautiful head that trend which reaches a peak with the far more buoyant Singing in the Rain.Someone noticed that at last Hollywood was having a self-critical look after years of light-in/light-out entertainment. I am usually quite tough on people who just find some deep thought movies -such as Kubrick's- too distressing. With Sunset Blvd it's different: it's a Noir movie about Hollywood, Stardom, aging. In fact aging is the dominant theme here compared with the rest and it's a pity. Aging is a very serious and rich theme but it's more a philosophical one than a cinematographical one. Among the many movies about aging I saw each had a very interesting and creative viewpoint (I would recommend La Fin du Jour for instance) but they can't go higher than the down-to-earth tragedy of old people. Still Lives are for painters and no great painter ever devoted too many frames to Vanity. Perhaps when you're getting older, losing your hair -many years from now you'd say- those touching frames become a little more intimate with you.Sunset Blvd. aims to be a typical Noir movie: it was very much fashionable by then. The script is very well written this way but with the benefit of hindsight I found at least one thing is too much. The voice over from beyond the grave: just to think of what was previously planned (see trivia: the deleted morgue scene) makes me nostalgic about that all too thriving creativity Hollywood still had. All things considered I don't hold it to be a masterpiece since the aging theme -that is great Gloria Swanson- takes too much attention as compared with the noir hero. Poor script writer! Always at a loss for words in the industry of moving pictures!</fullReview>

DeMille, the spotlight operator trains the spotlight upon her as the curious younger generation gathers around.Norma is eating up the attention, and the viewer may even begin to hope beyond hope that her plan might get off the ground when DeMille--old, weary, and pitying--calls up to the man and says,"Okay, put that spotlight back where it belongs."And the crowd melts away.

		<shortDescription>SUNSET BLVD - Possibly THE great American film....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Billy Wilder's SUNSET BLVD is possibly THE greatest American film yet made. This is a powerful statement (or assumption) to make, considering there are other outstanding American films which could vie, perhaps, for such stature. Yet SUNSET is in the rare position of being among a handful of films that are achievements of cinema perfection, and these works have in common one very important quality that secures their artistic status - sublime momentum. SUNSET is a mesmerizing experience from beginning to end, its continuity a seamless triumph of cinematic construction. With a cynically incisive script which never once falters, and an exquisite style and look that is visually breathtaking throughout, SUNSET BLVD is a spellbinding and unforgetable piece of filmmaking from one of the world's great 20th Century artists, Billy Wilder, who is arguably the best of the best in American cinema. True, he's contributed his share of mediocrity, and worse; but, then, there isn't an artist dead or alive who hasn't failed aesthetically at one time or another. What Billy Wilder has given us with SUNSET BLVD and his other great films are treasures to cherish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Films really have got smaller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From it's opening shot we know that we are not in the Hollywood of dreams. A writer floats dead in a swimming poll, he stares straight at us, perhaps accusingly. The narator begins to tell us the story, and what a story.Wilder would always be on the outside as far as mainstream Hollywood was concerned, and here you can see why. Sunset Boulevard is merciless in it's dissection of the film capital. By turns acerbic, nostalgic, vicious and hauntingly tragic, Sunset Boulevard is a ghost story. It features some of the greats from the movie capitals early years, now dusty and forgotten like Norma Desmond's mansion; the card game is like watching a seance.Gloria Swanson was, as the cliche has it, born to play Norma Desmond. Aided by William Holden and Victor Von Stroheim with cameos from some other silent era greats, she towers above the film. When she says: "I'm still big, it's the films that got small." she is speaking the literal truth.Wilder led the way for other Hollywood talents to dissect the Dream Factory. None did so as bitingly or with such obvious love for his subject. For although he may be scathing about the system, he treats his characters lovingly. Ultimately they are tragic men and women who bought into the dream and discovered, too late, how superficial it is.The final "Ready for my close up, Mr DeMille" scene is painful, capturing acturately the beauty, sadness, tragedy and pointlessness of Hollywood's dream.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1950 witnessed two of the greatest films of all time, as well as two of the greatest films about "show business",Sunset Boulevard and All About Eve.Both films were magnificent, but Sunset Boulevard was that rarity, an "Eleven". Readers of this commentators previous reviews will know that he has a special system of film ranking in which a handful of films-films for the ages -are given an "11". Sunset Boulevard is one such film.It is interesting that David Lynch studied this film very carefully before making "Eraser Head", and that he made the cast and crew of that delightfully bizarre, misunderstood "love story with a happy ending" watch Sunset Boulevard as well.One can also see the influence of this film on American Beauty, whose director, Sam Mendes,praised Wilder when making his Oscar acceptance speech.Both films are narrated by ghosts_Joe Gillis in Sunset, and Lester Burnham in American Beauty.Both films deal with obsession, illusion, and memory.Both films urge us to "look closer". Sunset Boulevard urges us to look at the horrific, tragic realities underlying the comic, melodramatic, surface of tinseltown, while American Beauty asks us to discover the traces of beauty-perhaps even the footprints Of God-hidden behind the banality of everyday existence. In short, a wonderfully written, acted, and filmed movie, full of unforgettable, touching, moments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredible movie that truly defines Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you ever wondered what happens to those faded screen stars, this movie gives you a pretty good idea. Wonderful film has Gloria Swanson basically playing herself (minus the insanity of course) as a former darling of the silent screen, Norma Desmond, who couldn't make the transition to talking pictures. She is joined by her butler and Joe, an out of luck writer, who becomes her pet in a sense. Norma's major problem is that she cannot accept that her time has passed and she is convinced that she can make a comeback. Joe realizes that Norma is a has been, and sets out to find new things but as the movie progresses we see just how vindictive and clinging she can be. I will not spoil the climax but it leads to one of the most unforgettable scenes in Hollywood history as Norma slowly descends the stairs, preparing for her "close up" with a possessed look on her face. Simply incredible film with amazing performances on everyone's part along with some notable cameos from former silent film stars and Cecille Demille. A movie not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Hollywood Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always been a movie fan. As a small child, I preferred a vintage movie over a cartoon any day. At age 12, during a visit with my family to the famous "Farmer's Market" in Los Angeles, I found myself standing next to screen legend Gloria Swanson, and to her astonishment I not only knew who she was, but informed her that she was "robbed" when she was not given an Oscar for her performance in "Sunset Boulevard." That was 34 years ago, and I still believe Gloria should have taken home the golden man. Her brilliant performance has not been dimmed by the passage of time and the film is still an unchanged masterpiece. Brilliantly directed by Billy Wilder, who wrote the script with Charles Brackett, it was a side of Hollywood that was totally unseen before. (The Hollywood of 1950 still believed their own publicity.) But this story, so biting in its reality left many shocked and angry. Wilder held the mirror up, and few were pleased with the reflection. (Legend has it that MGM boss, Louis B. Mayer, stormed out of a screening and had to be subdued before he could punch the nose of very amused Billy Wilder.) I have seen the film countless times and never tire of seeing it again, so recently when I noticed that American Movie Classics was showing it one afternoon, I tuned in. But this time, I made a promise to myself to keep my eyes off Gloria Swanson. Her charactor of Norma Desmond so dominates the story that even when she is off screen, she is all you can think about. So the film began and I watched everybody but her and was amazed that I saw the film in a totally different light. At first, I was extremely sympathetic to Joe Gillis, played by William Holden. After all, he was struggling writer who just wanted his shot at success. Circumstances, not by his choice, threw him into the world of Norma Desmond, a world where her star had shone bright above all the others, but dimmed, as he described, "10,000 midnights ago." It was here that my feelings for Joe changed for the first time. As I said, the film is so dominated by the presence of Gloria Swanson that I had failed to see something that was very plain for all to see. Joe Gillis, as played by Holden, was not a victim at all, he was the guy in the black hat. He was the bad guy. The original choice of to play Joe was 29 year-old Montgomery Clift. This casting would have validated the supposed age difference between Norma and Joe. Clift, who had been in a similar liaison in the early stages of his career with singer Libby Holman, got cold feet and backed out of the project. Holden was the replacement for two reasons, he was under contract with Paramount and he was available. So despite his initial reservations, William Holden accepted the role. Gloria Swanson looked the same age as the 31 year-old Holden, a fact that did not go unnoticed by Gloria herself. Wilder had requested the make up department to age the youthful looking 49 year-old actress during pre-production test shots until a frustrated Swanson snapped back; "Why don't you try and make him (Holden) look younger?"Holden plays Joe with a hard edge, a self-loathing for everyone including himself. He feels compelled to take from Norma, feel pity for her, but hate her nonetheless. His preference for Betty Schaefer (played by 21 year-old Nancy Olson) now seems a mystery. Why this plain Jane over the glamorous Norma? The ending of the film also changed for me. Joe really murdered Norma, not the other way around. He knew how unbalanced she was, yet he pushed her over the edge with glee. When Norma takes the gun and aims it at Joe, I found myself feeling that the bastard got his "just deserts," and felt satisfaction when he plunged into the pool riddled with bullets. Billy Wilder's first draft of the this story was a comedy that he wrote with Mae West in mind. This Norma Desmond did in fact return to Paramount and would make "Salome" as her "return to the people out there in the dark," which was so "over the top" the public assumed it was a comedy, becoming a huge hit, making Norma a star all over again. (This concept was used seventeen years later by Mel Brooks in "The Producers.") Apparently, Mae was not amused about playing a "has-been," and Wilder re-wrote the treatment as a drama. In a way, I'm sorry he changed the ending. I would have loved to have seen Norma have the last laugh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best. Period. (after 1939, anyway)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sunset Boulevard is one of the few movies that diehard silent movie fans will watch over and over because it rides very close to the border of reality. How many great silent actresses became forgotten as they aged? And actors too, for that matter? A couple of silent screen superstars were asked if they wanted the role of Norma Desmond before Gloria Swanson snatched it up, but none were as good actresses to fit Norma's mad and wild personality. The film was shot in black and white in an era where Technicolor was taking over, but such a movie wouldn't be the same in color. Color is so bright and cheery, and Sunset Boulevard is a dark, even slightly frightening story.The story is as follows: down-and-out screenwriter Joe Gillis (William Holden) can't pay up debt on his car, so he hides it in a garage. The garage turns out to be part of an elephantine mansion belonging to aging silent screen star Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson). She wants him to work on a long and tedious script she's been working on for her screen "return." But when her beloved Paramount studios calls her up, they don't want her to be in one of their movies-they want to rent her car for a few weeks for a movie. And when Norma finds that out, the insanity is indescribable. The mentions of real-life silent stars makes you shiver: Wallace Reid, Pearl White, Mabel Normand, John Gilbert, Rudolph Valentino, Vilma Banky, Rod la Rocque. It makes you think how far 1950 really is from 1929 and the years prior to it. Everyone should see this film, especially fans of silent movies. Also to anyone who wants to return to a job when you want them to stay home.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is really a great movie. And it's amazing how no one wanted the parts of Norma Desmond or Joe Gillis. Gloria Swanson accepted her part after many actresses, including Mary Pickford and Mae West turned it down. And William Holden wasn't a big enough star to refuse a role, so he was forced to accept after people like Montgomery Clift and Fred MacMurray turned down the part. So it's funny that both Holden and Swanson received Oscar nominations for their parts.If you've never seen this movie, it's become a Hollywood classic, and you really need to see it.

		<shortDescription>The Dark Side of Hollywood (abridged class paper)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The narrator, Joe Gillis, is the most well-rounded character and experiences the most change by the end of the film. He begins as a struggling writer trying his best to escape paying his debts, then capitalizes on Desmond's offer to live with her and supporting him financially and acts as her lover, then eventually repents from feeding lies to her to start anew with Betty, which leads to his eventual death, arching back to the film's opening. The stand-out character is that of Norma Desmond, a faded silent film star who is drowned within her own delusions and narcissism. She does not change much at all throughout the film's duration, but her levels of pride, manipulation, and insanity come to surface the more Joe Gillis, as well as the audience, gets to know her as a person. While maintaining a great fortune, she still seeks work in the film industry to gain none other than attention from fans and moviegoers alike. She does not seem so much interested in playing a good role as much as she obsesses for attention she once had. It isn't just global attention she desperately seeks for, but also romantic attention from Gillis. Desmond is a wreck, and as the movie progresses, the more her craziness shines through, eventually reaching a point of no return. When the film comes to a close, so does her sanity. The monster she truly is comes to surface clear as day when the film closes with her posing in front of the camera with a clawing hand and a wide open mouth like a roaring lion. The film approaches its 1950 LA setting with a darkly bleak tone as it features the realities of how Hollywood can affect its own people, most notably, Desmond and narcissistic and delusional characteristics. A large majority of the film takes place within the mansion of Norma Desmond, which seems to change to match the moods of the character. For example, the mansion first appears dark, messy, yet seemingly empty and abandoned, much like that of Desmond's persona. As the film progresses and she begins to believe she is make a "return" to the screen, the mansion becomes more cleaned and lightened, as Desmond believing her dreams are soon to come true. The set design itself is rather engaging as the crew behind the picture blended with the film's main direction and cinematography really brings viewers into the foreboding world the film portrays. The small attention to detail includes the up-close shot of an empty pool full of dirt while the expensive Hollywood locations certainly expand the scope. When the characters of focus feel small, they are often in smaller environments then the larger- than-life characters inside large sets. The pool and house of Desmond looks glamorous the end of the film, as does the studio of Paramount Pictures. One could also question what is taking place solely for the viewer and what takes place within the world of the film. An example of a transition from diegetic to non-diegetic elements includes that of the opening title "SUNSET BLVD." stenciled on the curb of an L.A. street within the films world transitioned to the opening credits in the same font on the road, not within the film's reality. The film utilizes music, both diegetic and non-diegetic to convey subtle emotions of the characters. In one scene, Joe Gillis awakens from a dream stating he can still hear the organ song from the dream in his head, the audience hears this song transition briefly into non- diegetic score and then transition once more into diegetic piano playing by the character of Max. An example of music being excellently played, that can be questioned as to whether or not is diegetic, is the scene in which Joe Gillis quietly judges Desmond after her self- mutilation and contemplates his position with her, as the quiet music matches the feelings of the situation. The narration is arguably diegetic as the dead protagonist occasionally speaks directly to the audience using the word "you" such as in the closing narration. This narration throughout the film often contrasts the character's thoughts that are not being verbally expressed, such as his disdain towards the quality of Desmond's script. The film does not contain narration in every scene featuring Joe Gillis, but he is present in every scene leading up to his death with the odd exception of the scene in which Norma Desmond visits a studio and gains brief attention from fans. The narration aids in allowing the viewer to skip through time and back to tell the unique narrative structure. Before explaining the events that unfolded which led to his death, the character's body is shown floating lifelessly in a private pool. This beginning gives the audience something to anticipate and keep themselves guessing for throughout the run time. After hooking the viewer in with its opening, the narrative kicks off by establishing characters and leads into the inciting incident in which Joe Gillis hides his car at Desmond's mansion, agrees to work for her, and then move in. As the film progresses, he begins to feel disgusted by choosing that lifestyle, but makes the mistake of essentially becoming Desmond's lover. He breaks through this by sneaking out at night to write a script with Betty, which changes his arc, he begins to want nothing to do with Norma Desmond and threatens to leave which leads to the climax in which he is murdered. As Joe Gillis' character evolves, more is revealed about how strangely Norma and Max live and how delusional she truly is. There is foreshadowing throughout the film, including Norma's dead monkey hinting that Joe will be made a monkey out of himself, as well as the two main characters getting what they wanted, but not in the way that would be expected, for Joe, a pool, and for Norma, being in front of the cameras and becoming relevant once again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Movie About Hollywood Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, read that name a few times. Then a few more. 'Sunset Boulevard.' Does that not just send shivers up your spine? Yes, I am well aware that it is the title of the famous street in Los Angeles in which the film takes place. But it seems more... invocative than just that. If such is pure coincidence, then it is a coincidence that makes a great film even better. But i don't think it was. Knowing the quality of this film, I think that it was meant to invoke deeper feelings in the viewer than just 'oh, that's the name of a street in Los Angeles.' When the film begins, we are greeted with a flash-forward to the end of the movie. I always love it when films or books do this. Surprise is sometimes good, but it is often overrated. Once enough time is out, everyone knows your secret. So there is certainly something to be said for just revealing what happens at the end of the film and launching into an elucidation of how such came to be.We are also greeted with an opening narration. From that moment onwards, this film had me. Not because I am just a sucker for opening narrations (though I am). But because it is just so good. And I say that as a novelist. Truly, it is one of the best openings narrations I've seen or heard, in literature or film or any other medium. With one fell swoop, it sets the tone of film, establishes intrigue and tension, and messages your brain and heart.The style of this film is excellent. Every decision is conscious and It also establishes the fact that this film takes heavily from film noirs. I don't think I would quite consider it a noir on its own night. But it certainly was made by someone who not only loves film noir, but knows how to make use of it, and what it adds to a film. As a lover of noir myself, I will always support that.purposeful, advancing the fabric of the tightly woven story. But style isn't everything. Which makes it a good thing that this film succeeds on grounds of substance as well. It should tell you something that the first work that came to mind as I watched this was The Great Gatsby. It's not a perfect comparison, of course, but it does manage to invoke some of the same complex feelings.There are so many themes at play here that I could be up here until midnight three days from now and still not have covered everything. But you don't need to fully unravel them; for mood and story's sake, it is enough to know that they are there, that they are present and will keep being so. It's like you're a kid watching a complex work for the first time; you may not know every intricacy that is on display, but you nonetheless are comforted by their presences.At its core, this film is about a young, out of work, broke scriptwriter who is just ready to give up on the Hollywood Dream and head back to Ohio when he is confronted with a grand mansion that is owned by an Old Hollywood fading star who invites him in. She sends him to work on her overblown, worthlessly-written screenplay that she thinks will make her a star once more. For this and above all else, for comfort, she persuades him to stay with her. Having no other place to go, the young writer agrees. For a while, he lives the high life. he even gets an expensive suit. But when he wants to leave, she gets clingy and... things get interesting.It gives off the feeling that he is being pulled deeper and deeper into a spider's web. But, in a bit of a twist, the spider does not want to kill him. Yes, she is delusional and insane and dangerous to herself and others. But she has no vile or inherently malicious bones in her body. She is just, at her heart, a lonely and insecure person who is caught up in yearning for past glories, who makes herself feel far older than she really is. The young man has a great quote about this that is both fitting in context and translatable out of it. It goes like this: There's nothing tragic about being 50, not unless you try to be 25. Simple. Concise. And flush with enough resonance to fill up a twenty-mile long crater.If you could take away only thing from this film, let it be that realism is not always needed to make a movie pierce on a real and scathing level. This film is heightened and almost reminiscent of a nightmare. But it is the best Hollywood does Hollywood movie ever and the most definitive.See you on Sunset Boulevard.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing, simply one of the very best motion pictures ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings from Lithuania."Sunset Blvd." (1950) is simply one of the best movies i have ever saw. That is a brave statement after watching more that 3.000 movies in my life, but after first time seeing "Sunset Blvd." only today in 2015, i was blown away by it in every sense. This is a movie making at its very best. The real star of this movie in my opinion was the script. Every sentence in this movie is great, it's lead up to something, and it fully engages you in this movie. The story itself is very simple, yet the script makes it astonishing. There is not one boring or uninteresting line in this movie - this has to be of the most polished scripts in the history of cinema. Acting is superb by all involved, but the best comes from Gloria Swanson. Maybe it is a bit overplayed here and there, but this is how aging and narcissistic movie star from ~ 1930 was interpreted in 1950 - this is superb performance. Music, cinematography, directing - they are first rate here.Overall, "Sunset Blvd." is a movie must be seen by all movie lovers. The movie itself is like a love letter to a movies itself and those who loves watching them. All in all, this an amazing motion picture, were everything works and at the running time 1 h 50 min you just want it to continue - it perfectly paced and not overlong. If you haven't seen this gem yet, do your self a favor and see it, don't afraid that it was made in 1950 and it's black and white - this a spellbinding motion picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is about an aspiring screenwriter who falls for a faded ageing former Hollywood star. The film really explores the dark side of Hollywood. How heartless and mean the town can be. The film is beautifully shot in black and white. The music is very dark and interesting. The screenplay is very well crafted as well. I have to talk about the performances. Gloria Swanson as the ageing former silent film star is basically playing a version of herself. She is amazing in this role, desperate to get back on top, and being on the big screen again. William Holden playing the aspiring screenwriter is an opportunist who thinks he can make the big time in Hollywood by bringing back this ageing star. The film is beautifully directed by the great Billy Wilder. This is truly one of the great films of Hollywood, showing the dark side of the town. A true classic. I highly recommend this film</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Those wonderful people out there in the dark......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Obscure screenplay writer Joe Gillis isn't able to sell his work to the studios, full of debt and thinking of returning to his hometown to live a mundane life. While trying to evade his creditors, he gets a flat tire and parks in a decadent mansion in Sunset Boulevard. He meets the owner and former silent-movie star Norma Desmond, who lives alone wit her butler and driver Max. Norma appears slightly deluded and believes she will return to the silver screen, and is isolated from the world by Max, who was her director and husband for a while. Norma proposes Joe to move to the mansion and help her write a screenplay for her comeback and inadvertently becomes her lover. When Joe falls in love with up and coming writer Betty Schaefer, Norma becomes jealous and and her madness leads to an underlying meltdown.....When the term 'they don't make them like this anymore' this is one of those films that easily fits into that paraphrase. The film has two narrative structures throughout, and they fall into two genres, Film Noir, and Psychological thriller.To be once the biggest star, and then to fall into obscurity must be every celebrities nightmare, so this film must be the perfect horror film for all stars who grace the titular location. For Norma, her wealth and her belongings are her prison, because no matter hoe delusional she appears to be, she knows that outside in the real world, she is long forgotten in Hollywood, and age is definitely one on her side.So Joe is like a breath if fresh air to her, and reignites her obsession for stardom, and in many respects, her obsession with Joe, which leads to the Film Noir element of the story.Swanson and Holden are spectacular, but Swanson, her on screen breakdown is a revelation, and the final third of the movie is as haunting and as harrowing as to what is going on in Norma's head when she is alone.It's a landmark movie, deserved of all its plaudits and fans, and it's a stern warning to anyone who is thinking about a career in Hollywood, the paves maybe paved with gold, but you are risking rats in your pool.Essential cinema in every way possible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whenever I hear Beethoven's 9th Symphony, I am always knocked out by it - twice. First when I just hear it as it is: one of the most wonderful pieces of music ever created? and second when I remember that LvB was deaf when he wrote it. It's a similar thing with this film. On one level, it's an absolute classic of Film-Noir drama. Snappy script, bitter-sweet storyline, characters you love to hate and a plucky young girl whom you root for (and really care about)? and on the other level there's the wonderful blurring of real life and fantasy. Gloria Swanson (and her friends who come to play bridge) really were (for want of a better phrase) washed-up silent film stars; Erich von Stroheim really did direct Gloria Swanson before the Talkies came and ruined everything; William Holden really was a Hollywood golden boy who'd fallen out of box-office favour; even Cecil B. DeMille makes an appearance as himself?It's just gripping. The way the melodramatic style of "old-fashioned" Hollywood clashes with the more "realistic" new Hollywood. The way we want the flawed characters to be better people - even though they let us down over and over again? Great drama, and a great slice of cinema history.Verdict: A must for any fan of cinema, romance, drama and humanityyetanotherfilmreviewblog.tumblr.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a Scene Right Down on Sunset Boulevard</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite Louis B. Mayer's comments to Billy Wilder that "You have disgraced the industry that made and fed you!", I feel Sunset Boulevard enhanced the Hollywood mythos. Who knows what Norma Demonds may have existed; crazed celebrity lunatics living in their run down ghostly mansions in the Hollywood area, not just back then but in the decades which have followed. However the film also makes you feel sentimental for the silent era, that something really was lost when Hollywood made the transition to sound.Gloria Swanson's role as Norma Desmond is my favourite female performance of all time. Over blown, over the top, flamboyant, fantastic! A performance which could have been unintentionally comical (ala John Barrymore's Oscar Jaffe), but her insanity can be taken completely seriously; same goes for her butler Maxilillian played by Erich von Stroheim. In many ways she is that character, as Gloria Swanson has even said so herself; just looks at her reactions to watching her own pictures. Desmond is a character whose relevance for the modern world has not been lost, in an age when people are obsessed with celebrity, youth and beauty more than ever. Likewise Cecil B. deMille's performance feels entirely genuine, as if two old friends have just met for them first time in years. I also find the dynamic shared between William Holden and Gloria Swanson to be of fascination; an older woman seducing a much younger man who eventually gives into her, when in classic Hollywood films it was often the other way around. It's clear from their actions as the film progresses the two characters are likely sleeping with each other, such as Joe happily flaunting his shirtless body in front of Norma by the pool side, and she even starts drying him with a towel. There is a bit of Mrs Robinson to her.Sunset Boulevard is possibly the most quotable film of its genre, although none its lines have become as famous in the pop culture lexicon as a film like say Casablanca, in which everyone knows its famous quotes weather or not they've seen the film or are even interested in classic cinema. Yet among circles of classic Hollywood fans, Sunset Boulevard is one of the most widely quoted films in discussions. Joe Gillis (William Holden) narrates the film despite his character being dead, but it still works in an other worldly way, like he's narrating from the afterlife. Holden hold an ideal narration voice to showcase Billy Wilder's ability to turn exposition into poetry. Likewise Buster Keaton's appearance may be my favourite celebrity film cameo ever; there's something about his reaction when playing poker ("pass!").For as cynical a film as Sunset Boulevard is, ultimately it is a movie for movie lovers. Particularly the scene in which Betty Schaefer (Nancy Olson) tells Joe Gillis of how there is no shame working behind the camera, while walking through the empty back stages of Paramount Studios at night as she tells him about her childhood spending time on studio back lots, is very life affirming. It's such a beautiful and romantic scene; it's easy why these two were paired in several films together. Olson's character is the opposite of Norma Desmond, humble and down to Earth, not concerned with her looks or fame and fortune; and unlike Norma she can actually write movie scripts.Say goodbye to Hollywood, say goodbye my baby.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Joe Gillis (Holden), a Hollywood screenwriter, is in a difficult period of his professional career. While he is escaping from the debtors he finds an old house that looks abandoned, but it is not. Norma Desmond (Swanson), old glory of the silent movies era lives there. Joe agrees to review a terrible script that the diva is writing, dreaming of a sensational return to the set. The atmosphere of the house is black, dark, almost deadly. The diva projects continually her old movies, guests are mummies, this fact proves that she is obsessed with herself and her career. Relevant figure is the domestic Von Mayerling (Stroheim), he is also the first husband of Norma. She ends up falling in love of the young man, but Joe is in love with his colleague Olson. Gillis for a while accepts the situation but then he starts to be worried and afraid. But Norma, now mad and out of her mind, shoots him while he is leaving. Man falls into the pool, a symbol of the things he had so desired. Norma became mad because she doesn't want to accept the fact that she is not a star anymore, she doesn't want to accept that she is old and not anymore young and beautiful: during the film she tries to look younger thanks to clamorous long beauty treatments; she doesn't want to open her eyes and she doesn't want to see the truth. The story is told by Gillis, who is already dead, in the third person in a long flashback. Everything in the film is dusty, old, broken and decadent. The tragic music and the colors of the pictures help raising the effectiveness of the story. Everything is specifically about the world of the cinema: the dialogs, the life of the cinema studies, even the legendary gate of Paramount. This film is not traditionally dramatic, it is a unique film noir.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Sunset Boulevard" truly is a must-watch film. Not only is it a classic but it is a genuinely great film. It may be hard for some to understand as it was released in 1950 but it is great nevertheless. It perfectly melds the noir genre with the general populous' interest in the stars. Unlike other movies at the time this film truly showed the dark side of Hollywood. The side filled with murder, affairs, and shady actions. It showcased how fame can mess with a person. Considering it was shot when it was it had some amazing angles. One of my favourites was the classic scene of Joe Gillis floating in the pool. This film also showcased a tremendous amount of symbolism. In almost every scene it was there it seemed. From Joe's chain getting caught on the gate to Norma Desmond getting hit by a boom microphone. It added a whole new layer. This was a very enjoyable film and although it was not one of my favourites, I am glad that I have seen it as it is referenced a lot in film today. It truly is a must-watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sunset Boulevard is a really good film given the fact that it was made almost 70 years ago. And the commentary on Hollywood is still right on. Sunset Boulevard is a timeless classic and a prime example of Noir films. It's well written and on par with any other film that's made now. The only thing wrong with this film is that at some points due to the amazing writing it seems scripted. At some points the things that the characters are saying just seem so impossible to make on the spot. Gloria Swansons acting in the film was really the heart of it and was outstanding. One of the reasons possibly her portrayal of the character Norma Desmond was so good was because the fictional character and her own life were in fact very similar.</fullReview>

The cinematography through the film was good. The slow montage that was used to show the title of the film was suspenseful and dramatic. There are many uses of scenes fading in and out of the bedroom scene as the screenwriter is alone writing the actress' screenplay. The acting in this film was played out well, although sometimes overreacted.The movie kept up its suspense and drama through its great acting, lighting, mood, narration, and music that made the movie good.

		<shortDescription>The Darker and Sadder Noir Version of Singing in the Rain</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a perfect example of a great noir film, opening on a dead narrator unraveling the tale of his stay at Norma Desmond's estate after fleeing men trying to repossess his car. He didn't know the madness he was getting himself involved in, and neither did the audience.There are so many examples of great cinematic storytelling in this film, and we can even see this at the very beginning of the film. There are transitions that follow the on-screen movement to give these transitions a sense of continuity in how the story progresses. The many dissolves at the start of the film convey this same idea. Once we get to Norma Desmond's estate there is a tracking shot following Gillis along the hedges and then backing up to get a good view of the entire estate, and it is a glorious shot.Gillis' reflection on Desmond and her lifestyle create the sense of an unreliable narrator, though we can believe some of it. He says she is introverted, and we see this without difficulty by the mise-en- scene: she surrounds herself with pictures of herself, she refuses to hear criticism for her awful scripts, and she even watches her own silent films. She simply cannot move on from the days of silent cinema in which she was still relevant, and the inclusion of sound has not treated this decaying actress well; there is even an instance when she is in a studio and gets hit by a microphone, and it is clear by her face that this device is alien to her.The first time I viewed this film I was 16 and did not like the fact that Desmond gets away with murder at the end (I didn't realize she would probably be sent to a mental institution). Though I still don't like this fact, this film is a great tragedy combined with the best of film-noir, and it is a very eerie feeling at the film's conclusion since Desmond is completely out of her mind - she has lost herself in unreality. This film intrigues me with questions I still ask myself which makes me want to keep coming back to this masterpiece filled with so much content underneath its form.</fullReview>

The fast-paced delivery of the lines really has the feel of an old classic movie. Symbolism was another good aspect in the way his gold chain gets caught on the door showing how Joe is trapped in Norma's life, as well as when Norma is bumped in the head with a microphone reminding her that her days of silent movie fame are over.

		<shortDescription>The very definition of a classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In an age when cinema generally succumbed to the tropes and clichés to which audiences were mechanically accustomed as a means for quicker cash, what better way to set the precedent of new and original storytelling as an art form than Billy Wilder's introduction to the 1950s, Sunset Boulevard - a film that explores excitingly unfamiliar territory while simultaneously presenting itself as a meta commentary of such transformation in the motion picture industry. A master of genre versatility, Wilder makes significant alterations to film noir with the addition of a light comedic backdrop, still managing to close on a note of poignancy that lingers in the mind, cementing the film as a landmark in movie history.We know immediately that we are in for something unusual for the era as the protagonist, Joe Gillis (William Holden), appears to be narrating from beyond the grave, the accompanying image containing the silhouette of Joe's floating corpse in a swimming pool. As police arrive on the scene, the rest unfolds through flashback explaining the events that led to our hero's demise. Going back to the start, we learn that Joe is a Hollywood screenwriter struggling to succeed in the dying business. After establishing his desperation as he is unable to sell his most recent script or persuade his friends to loan him money, matters get worse as he is chased by repossession men. One of his tires blows out, and he makes the quickest turn into the garage of a deserted mansion on Sunset Blvd. There he meets Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), a long-forgotten silent film star who is determined to make a triumphant return to the screen with a project she has written herself. When made aware of his experience, she hires Joe as an editor. Her butler, Max (Erich von Stroheim), puts him up in the guest room for the duration of his stay, ultimately extending much longer than he had anticipated. Thus begins a gradual obsession that deteriorates Norma's sanity, and Joe may be in too deep to find a way out.Wilder, along with Charles Brackett and D.M. Marshman Jr., provides the film's most extraordinary facet in his ingeniously crafted screenplay, earning a well-deserved Academy Award. It achieves thorough effect in blending tones, revealing twists and building conflict of all sorts. Even more impressive is the sharp wit and humor of the dialogue, giving the material infinitely more enjoyment than generic Hollywood output lacking any personality. It also fascinatingly utilizes subtle hints of symbolism and movie references, further improving the experience for film buffs in more way than one. His direction is also expectedly very good, bringing the content to life with skillfully constructed imagery and smooth editing work that flows sufficiently. A detractor from the impact, however, is the conventional use of music that hits every note one would expect at every moment they'd expect it. This is a technical aspect that is vital in evoking the right viewer reaction and unfortunately it does not always do so, making it the main attribute in which Sunset Boulevard resembles the majority of other works of its time. Even still, the positive certainly outweighs the negative as the great ensemble helps to carry the film, and is one of the very few to garner Oscar nominations in each acting category. Holden is a slick and likable leading man as always, while making Joe a sympathetic man with an internal battle as he must decide between rational logic and his heart. The love interest whom Joe desires is played by Nancy Olson, who does an adequate job of creating natural chemistry with Holden, though it may be slightly rushed and lacking emotional investment. Also intriguing is von Stroheim as the mysterious butler whose past with Norma may consist of more than meets the eye. This leads us to the one creation that drove the film beyond mere acclaim and is primarily responsible for the reason Sunset Boulevard is regarded as an all-time classic.The characterization of the deliciously psychotic Norma Desmond is absolutely brilliant, as Swanson's Oscar-nominated portrayal seamlessly conveys a woman who believably achieved fame long ago and is now stuck in denial that it ever disappeared. Joe recalls that she "used to be big", to which she replies with a disdaining tone, "I am big. It's the pictures that got small." If ever there was a performance that should truly feel like a performance, it is this one. Norma is a forever doomed actress who cannot escape the theatrics of a lively, expression-based movie star, and therefore her delivery of each line and movement is pervaded by a larger-than-life air of grandiose. Not only does this make for a highly interesting character to observe, but also often infuses her presence with hilarity and delight as she permeates every situation with unnecessary dramatics that come to be rather predictable. That is, until her mental instability spirals into a maniacal state, leading to a drastic climax followed by the iconic ending scene in which she deliriously makes her way into the spotlight for the cameras one last time, telling the hallucinatory director: "All right, Mr. DeMille, I'm ready for my close-up." The film is not quite the masterpiece it is hailed to be, but it deserves immense appreciation for its sheer braveness and creativity. It indeed holds all the essential ingredients of a classic, with memorable moments that now inarguably contribute to defining the medium as a whole. A sense of freshness also separates it from the pack, and it is both entertaining and thought-provoking enough to warrant multiple revisits. Most importantly, the character of Norma Desmond and the conclusion to which her story comes is unforgettable, the finale inducing a sensation that deceives the softness of the film's earlier atmosphere and instead leaves us on a note that is all at once tragic, disturbing and darkly funny. Overall, Sunset Boulevard is a crucial part of cinema that is essential viewing for any film-goer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the most beautiful movies that I've ever seen is "Sunset Boulevard". It is a 1950 Billy Wilder's masterpiece with an all-star cast. This movie is about a silent-screen star, Norma Desmond, who lives in a mansion with her butter. Living in her own world, Norma cannot come to the term with the fact that she is not famous anymore. Her butter, who used to be her husband and director in the years of her reputation, also helps her to be in the illusion that she is still a famous actress by showing her photos that are asked to be signed by her. The stage of being self-absorbed and losing touch with reality is to the extent that even after being charged by the police because of murdering her beloved screenwriter, she still sees everything the way she likes as she makes a speech in front of the police about how happy she is to be in a film again, ending with "All right, Mr. DeMille, I'm ready for my close-up"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Sunset Blvd." is a classy film noir that threw me for a loop at first. It features excellent performances and is paced well, building up the tension as we see the madness of the strange Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) unfold. Swanson's performance at first seems very silly and over the top, until you realize that due to her silent film career, her speech patterns have become as broad as the expressions she used to convey emotions in her films. She's become this kind of otherworldly figure that doesn't fit in with normal people at all. I guess you could argue that she's the villain of the film and appropriately steals the show, but I also really like the more... sympathetic characters. William Holden and Nancy Olson have great chemistry and it's refreshing to see them on the screen together while the rest of the movie keeps showing off this weird relationship that develops between Holden and Swanson. If you don't know what the film is about, at first you may find it a little slow. As the story develops you will get sucked in and you won't even mind the fact that the story is told in flashback because you will either forget all about it or really want to know how the story you're seeing ends up the way it does.

		<fullReview>SUNSET BLVD ? 1950This film noir is hands down one of the best films I have ever seen. The entire cast and crew shine here, from the set people, the actors, the writers, the director, and so on. William Holden headlines as a down on his luck screenwriter who stumbles onto an old time Hollywood silent film star, Gloria Swanson. The slightly mad Swanson sets him up in her massive rundown house. She wants him to write a screenplay that will put her back in the limelight. Erich Von Stroheim plays the butler and man Friday to Swanson and the estate. He is the former first husband of Swanson. Holden is plied with expensive gifts, fine clothes, watches and gold cigar cases etc. It puts a roof over his head so he stays on. It all gets a bit creepy for Holden when Swanson swears that she loves him. Needless to say this is going nowhere good for Mister Holden. I will say no more about the story, but if you are a Holden fan, you need to treat yourself to this masterpiece. The film was nominated for eleven Academy Awards including nods to Swanson, Holden, Von Stroheim and Director Billy Wilder. The film did win three Oscars. Gloria Swanson has to be one of the best examples of perfect casting I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wilder's best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Billy Wilder's paramount triumph of film-noir melodrama, piercing through the Hollywood industry's utter callousness and an over-the-hill silent era actress' poignant illusion of a comeback to garner the spotlight. The film begins like DOUBLE INDEMNITY (1944, 8/10), our ill-fated protagonist Joe Gills (Holden), a 30 something hack writer for the Hollywood studio, narrates beyond his grave to reveal the tragedy ending - as shown in a majestic shot from the angle of the bottom of a swimming pool (a trick done by putting a mirror in the bottom and shot from its reflection), a man's body is floating on the water, facing down, and for sharp eyes, it is obviously Joe himself. So while the voice-over gravely chronicles his story of the last months of his life, on screen, audience is gravitated by the parallel presence of the unwitting Joe, from his down-and-out predicament, till he accidentally runs into Norma Desmond's (Swanson) dilapidated mansion on Sunset Boulevard, on the day of her pet chimp's funeral. The metaphor of Joe's destiny is too apparent to overlook, being a substitute of the lonely but opulent has-been's companion, until his own doom. Wilder and his co-writers cook up a perfect match for the duo, Norma has penned her own script of Salome and is desirous of launching her comeback with Cecil B. DeMille in the Paramount lot. So she is in urgent need of a writer to revise her dilettantish work, and Joe, just reaches the end of his tether to survive in the showbiz, it realistically starts off as a win-win deal for both, until when Joe realizes what Norma needs is more than just a writer and what is more satirically, he is not a competent ghost writer, the output of Salome's script is a dud, Paramount has no intention to produce the picture at all, although indulging a 50-year-old to star as Salome is too idiosyncratic to begin with. So Joe caves in as a reluctant gigolo for Norma and she falls for him inevitably, her suffocating dominance is normally compensated by her gratification of material luxury. Naturally Joe is struggling, the reality is too hard to refuse, but internally he despises of his degeneration. It is a moral dilemma, so there must be a vent somewhere, when he meets Betty Schaefer (Olson), a young and inspiring fellow writer, age 22, the time with her becomes his safe haven, even his writer's block is dismantled, they contribute wonderful ideas for a new script of a romance. Unfortunately Norma will never let him go, the tricky part is, Joe is never completely heartless to her, on the first notice of her suicidal attempt at the New Year's Eve, he rushes back to her bed immediately and they reconcile romantically. We can tell Joe loves her, but with the condition of sympathy, guilt and shame, and it is all because of the 20-year-old age difference and the huge gap in their social status, the film is bold tirade aiming at the hypocritical showbiz of its ageism and male chauvinism. For Norma, Joe represents the last straw of her life, her mirage of being an eternal star which is timeless and beloved. Swanson gives a show-stopping tour-de-force as Norma, exaggerates her condescending mannerism with dramatic grandeur and empress mien, the trademark popped eyes and protruding jaw perfectly render a thrilling pathos as someone who is ridiculously ill-fitted in the present world thanks to her own background which is painfully similar to Norma. The film gifts Swanson the only opportunity to shine in the talkie era and she accomplishes it with impeccability, this is one of the most powerful performance ever (I give her an edge over the equally iconic performance from Betty Davis in ALL ABOUT EVE 1950, 9/10), and its indelible impact is caustically mind-blowing, not to mention her final descending from the stairs to the cameramen, and her iconic last line. Swanson is not the only one carry an autobiographic curve in the story, so is Erich von Stroheim, as Max, her dour but loyal butler-cum-chauffeur, the only one takes care of her in the decadent manor, more shockingly is later he reveals to be Norma's first husband and the director who has brought her to stardom and accompanies her into obsolescence. In real life Mr. von Stroheim and Ms. Swanson both suffered a career debacle after their collaboration in QUEEN KELLY (1929).SUNSET BLVD. is also a breakthrough for Holden, not entirely overshadowed by Swanson's supremacy, his Joe is a tale of woe himself, his final severance from Betty by willfully divulging his toy boy identity is handled equally with weighty melancholy and beautiful delivery; as for Olson, she bespeaks the common guidance as a young man's pursuit, all four main actors acquire Oscar nominations, but only hers is lingering on unworthiness.In a nutshell, the film deserves its iconic prestige and is deservingly one of Wilder's most accomplished films among his cannon (alongside SOME LIKE IT HOT 1959, 9/10).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can a man touch pitch and not be defiled?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hollywood has been making films about itself almost as long as there has been a Hollywood to make films about, but there were three very fine examples in the early fifties, "Sunset Boulevard" from 1950 and "The Bad and the Beautiful" and "Singin' in the Rain" from two years later. It has been suggested that both "Singin' in the Rain" and "Sunset Boulevard" were based upon the career of Norma Talmadge, a major star of the silent era in the twenties who (like Lina Lamont in "Singin' in the Rain") found it difficult to adapt to the coming of sound because of a strong working-class accent. Talmadge was still alive in the early fifties, and I often wonder what she must have made of these two films. Unlike "Singin' in the Rain", a Technicolor period piece set in the twenties, "Sunset Boulevard" has a contemporary setting and was shot in an expressionistic black-and-white reminiscent of film noir. (Director Billy Wilder had earlier made one of the great classic noirs, "Double Indemnity"). During the early fifties many of the stars of the silent era were still alive and living in the Hollywood and Beverly Hills area, and were still fondly remembered by the older generation, but were no longer the celebrities they had been at the height of their fame and were little-known to younger people. The film deals with one of these, Norma Desmond, a faded silent diva whose career, like Talmadge's, came to an abrupt end with the coming of the "talkies". Norma has retained considerable wealth from her days as a star but has become a lonely recluse, living in her vast mansion with no company but her German servant Max. She still receives quantities of fan mail, and harbours dreams of making a triumphant comeback; she is writing a screenplay based upon the story of Salome and John the Baptist and hopes that it will be made into a film by her old friend Cecil B. DeMille with herself as the star. The other main character in the film is Joe Gillis, an aspiring Hollywood screenwriter. When we first meet Joe he is floating face down, quite dead, in Norma's swimming pool. We then discover in an extended flashback how he met Norma by chance, was recruited to assist with her "Salome" screenplay, became her lover and eventually ended up in that swimming pool. A subplot deals with Joe's relationship with his friend Artie Green and Artie's girlfriend Betty Schaefer, a studio script reader with ambitions to become a script writer. The script for "Sunset Boulevard" was co-written by Wilder and his producer Charles Brackett, and it is a fine one. There is a streak of sardonic humour running through it, although it is not really a comedy (unless, perhaps, a very black one). The main themes are self-delusion and the traps of fame. Norma, in the teeth of all the evidence, persuades herself that she is still a star, that the "talkies" are just a passing fad and that the public are longing for the great Norma Desmond to make her comeback in a silent film. She also convinces herself that Joe is in love with her, while it is clear that he is just using her for her money. Although Joe sees the truth about Norma all too clearly, he has fallen prey to a delusion of a different kind, namely that he can touch pitch and not be defiled. He thinks that he can exploit Norma shamelessly, that he can carry on an underhand affair with Betty while remaining friends with Artie, and that in spite of everything he can still retain his spiritual and artistic integrity. He thinks that he can succeed in the Hollywood system without needing to make the necessary compromises with reality. Norma never wakes from her dreams, eventually spiralling downhill into madness, but Joe eventually realises that he cannot have it all, that he cannot have Norma, and Betty, and his writing career. Shortly before his death he resolves to renounce them all and to return to his old job as a journalist in Ohio. His moment of lucidity costs him his life, but it enables him to regain his self-respect. This was an ambitious theme for a movie, but Wilder found two actors equal to the task in Gloria Swanson and William Holden. Swanson herself had been a major silent star whose career had waned with the coming of sound and who saw in "Sunset Boulevard" her chance of making a return to the screen. (Her last feature film had been nine years earlier). Today this is probably the role for which she is best remembered. As for the much younger Holden, this was the film which made him a major star. There is another good performance from Erich von Stroheim as Max, who at first seems a sinister figure but is later shown to be a devoted servant with a secret of his own. When the film came out, it was popular with the public and acclaimed by the critics, but Louis B Mayer publicly berated Wilder for biting the hand that fed him by satirising the industry that had made him famous. These sentiments were by no means universal in the film world; several figures from the industry, notably DeMille, agreed to appear in cameos as themselves. I do wonder, however, if feelings similar to Meyer's were responsible for the film's relatively poor showing at the Oscars compared to its main rival, "All about Eve". That film, of course, is also about an ageing actress, but is set in the world of the theatre, not the cinema. Far safer to satirise Broadway than Hollywood. Today, however, both films have taken their rightful place among the classics of the cinema. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark face of Hollywood. Greatest depiction. One of the best ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the first film noir and one i ever saw. At first i was hoping for something very dark and mysterious, and it was at the beginning. Death of a man in a swimming pool and how he got there is pretty much the outline of the film. But this is not a mystery solving movie too. The movie portrays the life of an aging lonely yesterdays star, who is waiting to make a comeback or in her words "a return". Added to this is a not so successful writer who gets stuck with her and her wild fantasies of making a movie with her own script which shows nothing more than her face. She lives a life where she fails to realize that she is long forgotten and so are silent films. The movie basically explores how fame and deception can change the life of any person and how hard it can be to realize the truth. It also depicts how charming hiding from troubles of real life for luxuries can get until it takes away freedom. Also it features the dark face of Hollywood.The performance by the actors are terrific. The screenplay is brilliant, and the score makes the seemingly slow movie a wonderful experience.If it wasn't for All About Eve, the movie would definitely won the Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Director. Do not miss one of the greatest Hollywood Black Cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tragic story as a work of art.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sunset Boulevard is a great movie because it contains a tragic story which makes the movie a compelling work of drama. Gloria Swanson and William Holden portray complex characters, one a washed up actress and the other a failed screen writer, with personal needs that conflict. One needs love and the other one money. This simple formula provides the basis for a great movie.We know from the start that the principal male character, Joe Gillis, is dead and that the story is a flash back. This flash back hooks the audience's attention. We know that Joe has a story to tell, one that is worth listening to because something bad happened to him, and the question now is: why? The movie explains why. Joe, by chance, gets involved with a wealthy but emotionally unstable woman, Norma, who is in a position to cater to Joe's material needs. All Norma wants in return is Joe's love, a love that Joe does not feel for Norma. Now, Joe has a conflict: stay with Norma, whom he does not love, although he loves her money, or leave Norma and go back to where he came from, which is poverty row. Either way, Joe loses. How Joe goes about trying to resolve this conflict is what drives this story. The needier Norma gets, the more frantic Joe becomes. Joe describes himself as a heel. That's because he feels guilty over the way he is treating Norma. Joe's guilt feelings show that fundamentally he is a decent guy who does not know how to extricate himself from an impossible situation. If we did not know what happens to Joe from the start, his situation would seem comical: an eccentric middle-aged woman lavishing gifts on a younger man who is too much of a wimp to say no. Joe Gillis could be played by Adam Sandler or a younger Dustin Hoffman. Indeed, The Graduate reprises the older woman-younger man motif. But unlike The Graduate, where feathers are ruffled but nobody dies, in Sunset Boulevard the story is far from amusing; it is tragic. Joe dies and Norma loses what is left of her sanity. No one wins. Norma makes a grand exit to the police and Joe makes an exit too: to the morgue. That this happens in Hollywood gives the story a sardonic twist. Norma and Joe finally achieve the notoriety that they craved, but at a price.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Billy Wilder's Best and a total Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's uncanny how modern so many of Billy Wilder's movies are. That's one of the things that makes him one of the greatest directors in history. His films almost never seem dated. And this masterpiece is still a wonderful example, about a struggling, broke Hollywood screen writing wannabe who jumps at the chance of making money shacking up with a washed-up and aging silent-movie actress and writing her terrible comeback script. The story goes into bizarre and sexually-uncomfortable territory when he realizes that he has become her kept sugar baby and boy-toy.There is one element that feels VERY dated, and that is the spectacular performance by Gloria Swanson as Norma Desmond, but it's supposed to feel dated! In one of the greatest performances of all time, here's a woman completely stuck in the past and in her now fading stardom, struggling to reclaim her past glory. It's fascinating the similarities between Norma and the Gloria, who at the time was also a silent movie actress who lost popularity. Even the silent movie Norma watches near the beginning is a real one starring Gloria Swanson!This movie works in every way and is a timeless classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This might be the greatest performance I've ever seen from an actress. Gloria Swanson is simply magnificent here and I kept getting mixed feelings from her character throughout the story as she can be vulnerable, manipulative, caring and obsessive, always imposing a strong screen presence. Sunset Boulevard is a masterful work on all fronts. From the technical stand point, there are some very creative and stylish shots as seen in the initial sequences and in the majestic closing scene. There's also strong character development as you notice how one's preconceptions towards the other can easily change as the story progresses. Even the secondary characters are memorable and lead to interesting turn of events. Another aspect I really enjoyed was the meticulous narration by Joe Gills. He gives a detailed description of his thinking process and the presence of witty humor constantly made the film a very entertaining as well as absorbing watch. Sunset Boulevard works brilliantly as a metaphor to the end of an era in Hollywood and is certainly deserving of its cult status.</fullReview>

Demille,and wants Joe to write it, but in reality has become a delusional, even insane woman who lives in a self-contained world in her Hollywood home with her butler,and former director &amp; husband, Max(played by Erich Von Stroheim) who remains steadfastly loyal. Joe and Norma start a relationship(she is still wealthy) but her jealousies grow out of hand leading to the inevitable outcome... Nancy Olsen and Jack Webb play Joe's concerned friends. Legendary film has many interesting and accurate things to say about that self-contained world called Hollywood, though only quibble is that this film is a little too out there, to the point it affects credibility by becoming a self-parody. Still, a witty and memorable film regardless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Cynical and Unfortunately Honest Look at the Industry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since I'm one of the biggest "movie buffs" and have written several screenplays already, I always enjoy the films that focus on the industry itself, covering the events that transpire behind the scenes. Surprisingly, I went into Sunset Blvd. blindly. I wasn't quite sure what the true premise of the film was nor was I aware of its genre. The film and title, of course, is especially famous- another timeless classic. So, as the picture commences with a character who's dying to make it "big" in Hollywood, I was already hooked right from the start. Suddenly, he's being chased by repossession men and desperately attempting to escape the eerie atmosphere of Norma Desmond's gigantic home. May I say just how substantially creepy I found Norma Desmond and the depressing, desolate environment she surrounded Joe with? From the hair-raising music to the sinister look on Norma's face all the way to the overall mystery of Joe's situation forced me to strongly grip the handles of my office chair, hoping Joe returns to the city, that's filled with excited and friendly faces, as soon as possible. Then again, with the setting comes the movie's presentation of this interesting juxtaposition between Norma's more optimistic perspective on her Hollywood career versus Joe's more sardonic and restrained outlook on the industry's patterns. So, knowing full well that Joe will eventually meet his demise near the pool- that foreshadowing scene near the beginning obviously locks in Joe's fate once the conclusion hits- created a much darker tone within the place he was staying but not exactly knowing how it'll occur whether it'll be done by the hands of Max (for an unknown reason), Norma Desmond, or the return of the repossession men. On the note of Joe's unfortunate death, I applaud Billy Wilder and his efforts to convince the studio in killing off the protagonist of the story. It was certainly rare during its time, and I'm sure Wilder went through great lengths in order to see it done as can be seen by the sheer dictator- like control these studios and producers have over the productions in Hollywood, ultimately limiting artistic freedom. It's also difficult to imagine how the film was able to paint such a cynical view of the movie industry, clearly portraying Paramount Studios in the process, without wide objection and protest. Essentially, in my opinion, that is exactly what makes a classic and its sustaining memory in moviegoers' minds for decades to come: a daring work of its time where we look back and wonder how the project was successfully finished whether it's concerning its technological/technical aspect, its subject matter, or the structure of its story. In that regard, Sunset Blvd. definitely amazed me, and in knowing I wasn't viewing a generic Hollywood movie that played along all the tropes and included all of the studio mandates, that edge of unpredictability was immediately inserted into my intense viewing. I have to question, though, the necessity of the sub-plot with Joe and Betty's romantically-developing relationship. Let's not also forget about that corny kiss (with the stereotypical love music in the background) before Joe made his permanent return to the mansion. That entire arc felt more like a studio mandate than anything for me, but otherwise, the story's whole progression and execution was unquestionably memorable and remarkable. In addition, the unexpected shift in Joe's personality and attitude towards the end felt slightly unnatural and odd. In a matter of minutes, he changed from a worried and charming fellow to a reserved and aggressive one. Anyways, it had its fair amount of twists and turns and entertained all the way until its finish. There could be much discussion about the film's treatment and view of the celebrity status and the terribly unfair standards that Hollywood persistently follows, but as Joe mentioned in an earlier scene, a motion picture doesn't always have to overwhelmingly and blatantly boast its themes. Sunset Blvd. will undoubtedly stick in my mind for years to come due to its absolutely frightening ambiance and fascinating storyline.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece of a character study</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sunset Boulevard is a 1950 film about Joe Gillis (William Holden), an unsuccessful screenwriter, and his time with Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), an old silent film star who is still completely obsessed with herself. The film begins in a peculiar way. It is narrated by the character of Joe Gillis and starts off by showing his body in a pool, we know he dies from the start. This is actually my only flaw with the entire film, although it is very minor. I thought it would have made for an interesting twist if we didn't know, but I could be wrong and the fact that we know the entire time may have helped the film rather than hindered it. Gloria Swanson is the true star of this film. As William Holden's character has no real money left, he eventually stumbles upon Norma Desmond's home. He stays with her for the duration of the film as she gradually delves into disillusionments, self-obsession, shallowness, and pure insanity about her previous film career.This film is truly a strong character study. Quite possibly the best around. We really get into the psychology of Gloria Swanson's character and her performance does an unbelievable job of portraying it. Right from the start, we can tell something is off. She is clearly obsessed with herself but at first, it just seems like a typical stuck-up film star who only cares about herself. It gives the perception of being normal at first glance. But, as the film proceeds, we realize she isn't normal. She will go to any lengths to proceed with her disillusionment as much as possible, she wants her glory days back, not realizing she never will. Max (Erich von Stroheim) is Norma Desmond's butler and only helps with her disillusionment. He keeps it up and allows it to happen. We don't know why until towards the end, but it makes sense as it reaches the point. Joe Gillis stays with Norma to fix a script she wrote. He knows it's horrible, but he has a comfortable place to stay and basically infinite amounts of money. He's satisfied. We don't really get extremely in depth with his character, but I'm okay with that. It needed to stay focused on Norma as it did. The movie is masterfully directed by Billy Wilder, as he usually does. John F. Seitz provides the film's cinematography that gives it the distinct film noir look. I don't have a whole lot more to say about this film but it truly is a masterpiece filled with multiple haunting and memorable moments.</fullReview>

Billy Wilder shows a mirror to Hollywood and all the old stars who refuse to accept the reality and still try to live on their past deeds. All the people associated with the entertainment industry are guilty of this thing at some or the other point in their life. The performances of most of the actors in this movie are quite convincing. It has got an authentic feel that certainly adds to the appeal of the movie.

		<fullReview>Sunset Blvd (1950) is considered a classic film noire, direct by Billy Wilder. Starring William Holden as an unemployed script writer, Joe, and Gloria Swanson as the aging actress, Norma, the films depicts the cutthroat side of Hollywood during the Golden Era. The film opens with a narration voice-over by Joe, showing his dead body floating in a pool. Through the use of flashback the viewer is quickly drawn into the story to understand why Joe met an untimely death. Norma is an aging actress, no longer demanded by the big movie studios. Her stardom soared during the silent era, but now, younger actresses have replaced her. As Norma cannot accept her fate, the audience is drawn into her enclosed world, living with her butler in an aged, decaying mansion. Joe serendipitously enters Norma's life. With Joe as a new resident of her home, Norma becomes rejuvenated and begins to plan her acting comeback. But what will be Joe's commitment? While the public praised the movie upon release, many of the Hollywood tycoons felt that the movie disgraced the film industry. The dialog by Joe is often cynical and sarcastic, while Norma is portrayed as slowly losing her touch with reality. The lighting ideally reflects the mood of the characters, and film editing is flawless.With a run time of 110 minutes, the movie was completely engrossing; many of the lines from Sunset Blvd are well remembered. The film received 11 academy award nominations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had bought this DVD some time ago but only watched it recently. What a treat it is as the movie certainly lives up to its billing as a classic.Though made in 1950 the movie is years ahead of its time as director Billy Wilder looks at the very dark side of Hollywood. William Holden plays a down at heel Hollywood scriptwriter who accidentally becomes first the script editor and later a lot more for a reclusive silent movie star, Norma Desmond, played by Gloria Swanson. Due to his dire financial straits he is unable to escape fro her clutches and, despite himself, he starts to tolerate the bizarre life he has made for himself. However a chance meeting with a young female scriptwriter reawakens his love of writing and makes him realise what he has become. However Desmond will not let him leave her life easily.The script was co-written by Wilder and is full of black humour and has some great lines. The voice-over by Holden is occasionally annoying, as it tends to say aloud what the viewer can see on screen anyway.The acting is brilliant. Holden and Swanson make a great couple, in a peculiar way. Swanson's silent movie acting style is perfect for the deluded character of Desmond. The final scene as she descends the staircase of her mansion to face the cameras is unforgettable. Holden is very good as the brash self-confident writer who has gone as low as he can go.There are appearances from great directors Erich Von Stroheim, as Desmond's faithful butler and Cecil B. De Mille, as himself. Von Stroheim is unexpectedly touching as the man who does the most to keep Desmonds fantasy alive. The extras are well worth watching, particularly the very informative making of feature.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great look at Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wealthy, silent film superstar "Norma Desmond"(Swanson), 50, was cast aside by Hollywood when she neared 30. She revels in her superstar status, delusional that it still exists; she's maintained in her mansion and these delusions of returning to public adulation and screen glory by her former film director (&amp; former husband), now her butler-chauffeur (von Stroheim). The path of a broke, struggling B-film screenwriter "Joe Gillis" (Holden) enters Norma's territory and he becomes, for a time, her kept man, helping maintain her obsession of recapturing her superstardom. When he attempts to leave, this unhinges Norma more and she kills him. (NOTE: this is NOT a "spoiler" since the movie opens with Joe's dead body and his narrative voice-over.)This, one of the greatest of all Billy Wilder great films, was made only 22 years after the advent of "talkies" replacing silent films. It was THE first film to take a critical look at how Hollywood operated, especially in treating its former stars--&amp; most especially young women--who were typically cast aside when they they lost their late teens/early twenties aura and glow. Film buffs will love the many inner details of this film: e.g., von Stroheim was actually Swanson's director in making the film which he (as butler) runs for the 2 leads to see. Swanson's imitation of Chaplin's Tramp is precious. With the later "Singing in the Rain" and now with "The Artist," this was the first of (IMO) the 3 most significant films dealing with the drastic effects on so many people of the transition from silents to talkies. (Wilder's less than glowing look at then traditional Hollywood has been hailed as a breakthrough and a first, because--before that--Hollywood had to be glorified in films.)My rating: is 10 of 10 bearing in mind film history and 8.5/10 without that mindset; compromised at 9.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've heard about this movie since before I was even a teenager, and have seen little snip-its of the film, and have always wanted to see it, but I hadn't actually seen it until tonight - at age 46.It's one of those movies that you hear so much about - you hear the praises and glorification, but when you know you'll finally be seeing it, you wonder if you're going to be disappointed, like I certainly was with 'Gone With The Wind'. The only thing I was disappointed with Sunset Boulevard, is I wish it was in full color. Other then that, THIS MOVIE WAS FANTASTIC!!It was really a gutsy move to make this back at that time, with Hollywood trying to hang on to all the glamor and glitz (behind their mask), because I do not believe that Swanson's character, Norma Desmond, only represented one woman. I believe her character was symbolic of sooooooo many actors and actresses (but mainly actresses, because of the main value placed with actresses are youth and beauty. An aging male actor is still more marketable then a middle aged actress.) There seems to be certain professions that draw certain types of people. Acting seems to draw an ENORMOUS amount of hyper-insecure, overly dramatic, and overly sensitive people - those that just thrive on gaining attention from others. The insecurity very quickly becomes egomania, snobbishness, and false pride when they gain a bit of fame, and then they become professional victims who claim childhood abuse or other when they don't get their way, or when the public knows they've done something very wrong. To show certain aspects of this in a movie made back then is TRULY GUTSY!! KUDOS!! It made way for other like movies to come about, like, "Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?", "Play Misty For Me", "Fatal Attraction" (Where the emotionally disturbed woman was played by Glenn Close, who later played Norma Desmond in the Broadway version of Sunset Blvd.), and so many others.I would highly recommend seeing this flick. Now that I have finally seen this, it is now time to own it!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hollywood's Self-Iconoclast Masterpiece ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Sunset Blvd."' left such an impression on me I sincerely doubt on the usefulness of this review. Everything has already been said about Billy Wilder's masterpiece, and I would only be paraphrasing the obvious. But I guess, such dilemmas are sterile ... so let's talk about one of the greatest American films ever, and my gut-feeling on that matter is that the success of "Sunset Blvd." is particularly ironical.The principal irony is that one of the greatest American classics is precisely the one that deconstructed the myth of Hollywood. "Sunset Blvd." resonates as a cinematic pamphlet against the corruption of minds that governs a quite decadent business. Billy Wilder, was a respected and admired artist, and yet he did the epitome of iconoclast films. Some may say it cost the movie its ticket for the Best Picture winner, which went to the eternal rival "All About Eve", another great classic that had the good taste to attack the less glamorous stage world. "Sunset Blvd." kills the myth in the pinnacle of its Golden Age, denouncing the way silent stars are treated like old relics, how young starlets are exploited, and how for one or two chosen, many contenders will end up working for B-movies or in peripheral jobs. Hollywood studios are sure a ruthless universe. The word "iconoclast" holds also a double meaning since it really kills the icons within the Icon. The film had probably shocked, but by deliberately choosing the cynical approach, it was ahead of its time and never lost its relevance ever since, no sir.The second irony is that by deconstructing the same myth, it has prevented it from sinking into oblivion. Let's face it, many movies glorified the Golden Age of Hollywood, yet the only one that had the guts to criticize it, indirectly reminds of how great and irreplaceable these days were. Hollywood couldn't have had a better homage than a movie like "Sunset Blvd", as cynical and detached as Joe Gillis' narration sounds, it still speaks Hollywood's true language. And I'd go further, I'm sure Gloria Swanson would have been totally forgotten had this role not been given to her. Through Norma Desmond, Gloria Swanson was immortalized and forever remembered as that actress with the unforgettable look and who portrayed one of the greatest cinematic characters ever. Yes, we know there was Mary Pickford, Lillian Gish, but I'm sure these actresses are more names and faces for movie fans while Gloria Swanson immediately reminds of "Sunset Blvd.".And this is the third ironic aspect of the film, the movie is believable because almost everyone is playing his own role. Gloria Swanson was indeed a has-been star forgotten by her peers, Erich Von Stroheim a has-been director whose disastrous "Queen Kelly", starring ?guess who- Gloria Swanson, derailed both careers. It was that film she was screening to William Holden. The self-reflexive aspect is so well-constructed you need to watch the film a second time, to realize that the characters within the actors were also playing a game. Joe, the struggling screenwriter exploiting Norma's love to have time to get back on the business, and Norma exploiting Joe's need to make her comeback and be with him, and as the band leader of a grotesque masquerade, the butler, Max, Erich Von Strohem who maintains Norma in total denial, literally directing her life. It's all about living in illusions, like the doomed love between a woman alienated by her own image and a man totally disillusioned. "Sunset Blvd." Is simply fascinating.But I must add that the story is only one of the many fascinating elements that make the film a classic among the classics. Never had a movie combined such a close to perfect writing with an incredible direction, it's Wilder at the top of his game. When you think of any of the most iconic lines of the film, and it sure is full of them, you immediately associate an atmosphere, a darkness, a face. The cinematography, the direction perfectly convey the creepiness and moral ambiguities of film-noir. "Sunset Blvd" is a masterpiece for totally objective reasons, one of the rare films, it is impossible to find any flaw in it. From the beginning till the end, the impression, the film leaves on you is its indecent closeness to perfection.And I can't end without mentioning the title "Sunset Boulevard" which works as a beautiful metaphor of the end of an era. An end forever incarnated by the creepy mansion of Gloria Swanson, this lady with hands and arms that wave as the tentacles that tried in private to take the poor Joe Gillis as a sentimental hostage. And despite all his suaveness, and manly confidence, Joe is just a ghost writer, when Norma is an actress absorbed by her own image, and one man, Max who directs her life, or does he? Who controls these people anyway, they are all guided by their own love for their business ... and the genre, the opening, the setting of the film will respect your intelligence enough not to get you expecting a happy ending. Or was it? In a certain way, Joe was still the ghost writer in the real sense of the word, Norma was still acting, being the heroine of her twisted imagination, facing the cameras, and under the direction of Max who knew the only language that could make Norma Desmond receptive.And this is the beauty of the film, beyond the darkness, it's just an incredible and unforgettable introspection into the world of cinema. I could speak longer about the film, but I think I made my point now, but this is the beauty. It's just me, and the laptop, and those beautiful people out there behind their screens. All right, IMDb, I'm ready to submit ...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>425th Review: The Greatest Film Noir of them all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sunset Boulevard is simply one of the great films; with a stunning script by Billy Wilder, a star in Gloria Swanson who makes melodrama and bathos into something deeply sincere and maudlin, all the parts come together in a way that hypnotizes and astounds the viewer.Fiercely and doggedly anti-Hollywood, but at the same time, all about Tinseltown this film is everything that Film Noir aspired to be and more: cool, dark, full of characters, and a sense of mystery, desire, and danger.This is one of those films that they will be watching in two or three hundred years time, now nearly 65 years old the plot and story are as fresh today as the day it was released. It still enthralls and shocks, and this reviewer can see no chance that it will fade away and be forgotten.Sunset Boulevard is one of the greatest movies ever. Full stop. One of the truly great films and one to see again and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>William Holden in a Scathing Satire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And, no, it's not "Network'. But the films do have some interesting parallels between the characters of Joe Gillis and Max Schumacher. Both involve love triangles, both involve an intelligent man going along with a system he knows is full of manure. There is even a scene where Holden packs a suitcase and walks out on female lead. All very well done.This is a devastating view of Hollywood and its cynicism, and the participation of some key real people like Cecil B. DeMille and Hedda Hopper playing themselves, is quite fascinating. Gloria Swanson and Eric Von Stroheim playing washed up relics of the Silent Era was perfect.There is never a sex scene between Swanson and Holden, something that modern producers would probably have insisted on (tastefully shot, of course). In here, his status as a gigolo is only implied, as his self loathing is.This movie holds up really well, compared to the CGI vomit we see on screens today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must say that I have always thought that most older movies simply couldn't portray the same level of depth as the best movies of today. Hollywood was younger, acting was less "developed", and there were not nearly as many movies back then as there were now.But, this movie...wow. It was so bizarre, so unpredictable, so full of emotion and tension, so well acted.....so enjoyable. It's hard to believe that it was made 60 years ago.The movie kept my attention the whole time...I felt that the twists in the plot (even though you know the end game from the start) and the dialogue were superb.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>God what a movie. I finally watched this movie after years of only vaguely hearing about and not really looking forward to seeing it. Let me just say I wish I had watched it sooner. This has to rank as one of the greatest films ever made. EVERYTHING is perfect. The dialog, the direction, and the actors. Joe Gillis (The amazing William Holden) is a down on his luck Hollywood screenwriter, about to give up his dreams of glory to move back home, when he stumbles upon the mansion of long 'retired' screen legend Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) while eluding some collection me who've come to repossess his car. A star from another time, Desmond desperately awaits the return of the limelight which has passed over her many years before. As Gillis meets her, she is a recluse in a decaying Hollywood mansion "The type of place crazy Hollywood people built in the crazy 20's" Her only companion her butler Max, and a recently deceased chimpanzee. After meeting Norma, Gillis is offered the chance to rewrite a script that Norma believes will be her big comeback. Seeing an opportunity to make some easy money from an obviously delusional (and very rich) woman he takes the job, but before long he is ensnared in his own prison, a kept man in every sense of the word. The script by Billy Wilder is not to be missed. The dialog is so sharp, and full of great lines that have been quoted for the last 60 years you will be amazed. The film is also chock full of symbolism, and clever plays that a second viewing is definitely in order. Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Hollywood's Best Films Ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sunset Boulevard is truly a masterpiece with an all-star cast like Gloria Swanson as aging beauty silent film star, Norma Desmond, who lives in a castle with her butler, Max, on Sunset Boulevard. Until Joe Gillis, a washed-up screenwriter, accidentally stumbles upon the scene mistaken for an undertaker. There are some humorous moments like who the coffin was for in the beginning. William Holden played the Joe Gillis role. Erich Von Stroheim played butler, Max and sweet Nancy Olson played Betty Schaefer. The story begins with Joe's death and he narrates his story about six months before his death about when things were collapsing around him financially. He was desperate just like Norma Desmond. Gloria Swanson's Norma Desmond is legendary role up there with Vivien Leigh's Scarlett O'Hara and Blanche DuBois. The film is a sweeping black and white classic with unforgettable moments of desperation and acting performances. I think this is one of Billy Wilder's best films of his career.</fullReview>

It is a landmark film in terms of its subject matter. Bill Wilder is one of the first directors to take on the problems that can come with living in the spotlight. For it's time, the film is an original idea. I can't think of any other film from that time that explores the idea of being a "has been" in terms of Hollywood society. The acting is superb all around, with special recognition deserved by the two leads. Gloria Swanson a fantastic job playing, well herself...but crazy. William Holden does a wonderful job keeping Norma's fantasy world intact as Joe Gillis.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was crazy! It's an actresses nightmare. The story was beautiful because it had taken just an innocent man in financial troubles and put him in a situation were basically he sold himself to the devil in exchange for nice things to surround himself with. It's quite a mouth full. Poor Norma didn't know what to do with herself; old and out of work. Although, she was snobby and completely into her non existent career I couldn't help, but feel bad for her. There was an odd balance in the movie because it felt realistic and really unreal at the same time. The camera portrayed Norma's zanny, needy qualities very well. The lighting in the end particularly symbolized the star she once was that may always last through her movies, but it also enlightened what her stardom had made her became. It's just crazy what fame and money can do to people. The movie was very enjoyable to watch never a dull moment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sunset Blvd. is a excellent murder mystery thats leaves you guessing until the end. There is a great shot right in the beginning where the camera is underwater looking up at the dead body directly above face down in the water and the detectives looking down upon him. This scene is actually the end of the movie. Then the movie starts from the beginning and shows you how the body got there. The film starts off fast with a great car chasing scene. There great sound effects off tire's screeching around turns and eventually one of the tires even pops. The main character Joe soon arrives at a mysterious,creepy,and what seems to be abandon Maison. This mansion gives the perfect creepy vibe to the movie. Right away there's a very scary shot of Norma looking down at him through an upstairs window, a very classic shot to warn the audience something just not right with the house. The inside of the house is even creepier with tons of weird directions and organ music playing in the background. One of my favorite parts of the film is when Norma is standing in front of the projector light and it looks as though smoke is coming off her head really signaling to the audience of her evil mysterious ways.Norma's character overall is great she did a very wonderful Job of play the crazy old actress from Hollywood with priceless facial expressions. I think without her strong acting it definitely would not have been such a good film. I didn't enjoy how Joe and the younger Women fell for each other so fast and didn't really understand the scene where they looked like they were going to make out in the bathroom of her boyfriends party. It was very awkward and strange, as well as the rest of the film but I just didn't think it made sense to put in. Overall its a good film and would recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sunset Boulevard was a film directed in 1950 by Billy Wilder. It was a dramatic Hollywood story in black and white film. It was nominated for 11 Oscars, including Best Actor and Actress for Lead and Supporting Roles, Best Cinematography. It took home the Oscars for Best Art Direction, Best Music and Best Writing. The film starred William Holden as Joseph "Joe" Gillis and Gloria Swanson as Norma Desmond. Gillis is a washed-up screenwriter and Desmond is a washed-up actress who wants to make a Hollywood comeback. The film opens with a very dark scene and storyline of Gillis ending up face down in the pool. Gillis gives a voice over narrative saying he will explain, and we transfer to six months early at the beginning of this story. In the quest to find/have a script to come back to the Hollywood glamour and never aging brings about greed and tragedy. Norma Desmond cannot accept the fact that she is not young anymore, and that she is no longer a star.The film was dark and shadowy. The lighting through the film was dramatic, sometimes catching a silhouette of the characters. The opening scene of a dead Joe Gillis laying face down in the water, but the shot was from the bottom of the pool, looking up to see the police standing over the pool was eerie. The scene was created by placing mirrors at the bottom of the pool and filming from above the pool. Swanson's performance of an aged- washed up actress was great. In many of the shots and scenes, she is shown trying to portray a younger, in style actress, but in reality, she is someone who no longer has what it takes to succeed in Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Voice from beyond the grave... Or swimming pool</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Some Spoilers) As the sun rises over Sunset Blvd. we see the bullet riddled body of Hollywood screenwriter Joseph Gillis, William Holden, flouting face down in one of the streets multi-million dollar exclusive mansions swimming pool. We get the story from Gillis himself, in an emotionless and disembodied voice, as he recounts the series of events that happened to him that eventually put him there.Gillis had hit hard times and was about to lose his car, a 1946 Plymouth Convertible, to his creditors. Trying like hell to get the $290.00 to keep the car Gillis came up short and decided to skip town ,with the car, until the heat blows over or he somehow got the cash to pay off the car loan. It's then almost by accident that Gillis got involved with legendary silent film star Norma Desmond, Gloria Swanson, in who's mansion garage he ditched his disabled, from a flat tire, Plymouth. Norma together with her loyal butler Max (Erich Von Stroheim), whom we later finds out was her first husband, mistakes Gillis for the man form the City Health Department or ASPCA guy who was called to take her dear departed pet chimpanzee away for burial. It's when Norma finds out that Gillis is a Hollywood screenwriter she dreams up plans in her delusional mind for him to write her a role that she can make her long awaited comeback, or return as Norma calls it, to the silver screen.Grateful at first to Norma for giving him a place to stay Gillis works night and day in coming up with a screenplay worthy of her long awaited return to the movies. As things soon turn out it's only Norma, not her many millions of adoring fans, who's the only one who's enthusiastic about her long awaited return to films and no one else! It soon gets to Gillis to just how unstable Norma is in that he tries to keep the truth from her that's she's, at 50, too old and over the hill to play the parts that made her the Hollywood legend that she's become. While all this is going on Norma becomes very attached to Gillis in him feeding her all this hogwash, just to keep her from cracking up, in how great her forthcoming movie, that's if any studio is willing to finance it, is going to be with her in the staring role of "Salome the Dancing Temptress."As things soon turn out it's Norma who becomes desperately dependent on Gillis not the other way around in needing him to keep her company in her spacious mansion, that has eight master bedrooms, and even become her lover! That with ex-husband Max making sure that Norma's living in the fantasy world that she conjured up for herself over the years! Gillis just about had enough of Norma's antics when his new found girlfriend Betty, Nancy Olsen, who just happens to be his best friend's Artie, Jack Webb, fiancée found out about his strange relationship with her and walked out on him. Packing his bags and leaving Norma for good Gillis never realized how far Norma would go to keep him until it was too late! It was that fatal decision on Gillis' part that landed him in Norma's swimming pool where we first saw him at the beginning of he movie!Unforgettable climax with Norma now completely out of her mind acting as if she's doing her big scene, close-up and all, in her favorite director C.B DeMile's latest motion picture. That was the only way that Norma's now distraught butler and ex-husband Max could coax her into turning herself over to the police for the murder of her good friend and house-mate the luckless and now gone forever Joseph Gillis!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wilder's finest noir pulls the curtain back on Hollywood and induces shivers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>More than a half century after "Sunset Blvd.," audiences are well aware that Hollywood is not all glitz and glamor -- that there's a stark reality. Yet despite that knowledge, "Sunset Blvd." is still an eye-opening and deeply affecting motion picture today as it was in the 1950s. Because even though our "access" to Hollywood is greater than that of yesteryear, great film-making and chilling performances are timeless and that's what this classic delivers.Billy Wilder was already famous for his string of films in the mid-late '40s, but "Sunset Blvd." is in a category of its own. There's something shockingly real about this noir drama. Maybe it's the fact that actress Gloria Swanson, who plays faded silent film star Norma Desmond, was in need of a comeback herself, or that famous director Cecil B. DeMille plays a big role as himself, or that several old silent film stars such as Hedda Hopper and Buster Keaton appear in the movie as Norma's friends. It's kind of enchanting really, but doubly so because of the suspenseful tone of the film."Sunset Blvd." is about a work-starved screenwriter named Joe Gillis (William Holden) who by coincidence ends up in the mansion of an old silent film star, Norma Desmond. Desmond has written herself a comeback (or return, as she prefers) role and convinces Gillis to redraft it. Oddly, however, she insists on him staying at her mansion, where he inevitably becomes her plaything.The script by Wilder and longtime collaborator Charles Brackett (along with D.M. Marshman Jr.) creates some awkward but powerful moments, such as a New Years Eve party where Gillis discovers he's the only guest. Although the beginning scene was a last-minute addition, the excellent shot of him floating in the pool is the first of many affecting images and scenes that Wilder has crafted with a touch of horror and creepiness to be truthful. Franz Waxman accentuates this tone with his suspenseful score.But it's way Gloria Swanson carries herself as the iconic Norma Desmond that generates the creepy effect. Head tilted back, she stares at you with those 1930s movie star eyes and moves her hands in such a manner that will terrify everyone just slightly. Not getting an Oscar win just goes to show what a great year for film 1950 was, though speculation is the film's mildly negative portrayal of the industry could have been partly responsible. All the main characters in this film got nods but lost out on the prize in fact -- and truth is all were deserving of being there.It's hard to see now, but Hollywood was all about reputation in those days. It was about the image and deceiving the public with glamorization of the business. "Sunset Blvd." was a classic of its time for getting beneath the veil that Norma oh so cleverly has on when she goes to visit the great Mr. DeMille, but it's a classic for all-time because of the subtle haunting quality of Wilder's work and bewitching performance of Swanson.~Steven CVisit my site moviemusereviews.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gloria Swanson shines in yet another Wilder classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Billy Wilder is widely considered as one of the most decorated directors of the golden black and white era with movies such as Some Like It Hot, The Apartment, Double Indemnity etc. But Sunset Blvd may be his best creation. The movie starts with a man lying dead in a swimming pool of a huge villa located in Sunset Boulevard, a prime location in Hollywood where movie stars dwell. The viewers are then taken into flashback explaining the events that led to his death. The flashback takes the viewer into a roller-coaster ride into the insides of Hollywood and the sad condition of yesteryear's silent actors who have been long forgotten and live the life of a recluse. The movie ends in such a manner that the viewer is forced to have sympathy on the person who killed that man.William Holden as a struggling writer portrays the 'Will do anything for success' part excellently. Erich Stroheim as the Butler cum Yesteryear Director Cum First Husband of a Matinée Idol lives his part. But Gloria Swanson takes the cake as far as the performance is concerned. Her portrayal as a yesteryear silent movie super-star who fans have forgotten makes us feel for her. Her struggle to convince herself that she is still (At 50) the biggest superstar around with millions of fans wanting her to comeback leads her to live the life of a recluse which finally makes her mentally unstable. Overall, a classic not to be missed.Rating : 9/10</fullReview>

Swanson is flamboyant as Norma Desmond, a role that was a reflection of her own career. von Stroheim also plays a variation of his true self. While both are superb, it is Holden's comparatively understated performance that holds the film together, as he brilliantly conveys the desperation and self-loathing of a hack writer. Olson is also excellent. De Mille and other Hollywood legends are ingeniously integrated into the script as themselves. Wilder made some of Hollywood's greatest films but this is his masterpiece. Waxman adds a haunting, atmospheric score. Unforgettable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Along with Double Indemnity, Sunset Blvd is one of the best films ever made. In my opinion however ? because I'm amazed to find there are comments on the IMDb actually trashing it, but surely by people who also would regard a random pile of bricks as more arty than the Mona Lisa. Director Billy Wilder churned out some remarkable groundbreaking films, some being works of Art that have and will obviously outlast everything made over the last 50 years. I feel I know it off by heart having seen it so many times over the decades, but still come away impressed.Young and penniless film script writer (Holden) falls into the clutches of ageing ex-silent movie star (Swanson), takes the job of producing a worthwhile script for her and gradually becomes her toyboy to boot. Being red blooded he chafes at his position but feels he has no other option but to play ball. The plot moves smoothly and logically from A to Z, paying so much attention to detail it's no wonder a few tiny goofs crept in, like the film crew visible in Swanson's sunglasses. I don't count the unrealistic lack of blood on display from gunshots when after all the dead man is narrating the entire film. The production values were sky-high, the nitrate photography impeccable, the acting and the plot topnotch and believable. Favourite bits: Holden's expression upon seeing the dead monkey; Holden pegging butler Stroheim as slightly cuckoo; Holden and Swanson watching her and Stroheim's Queen Kelly on the big screen in her living room; buying the vicu?a overcoat (and how good he looked in it too!); on the Paramount lot with DeMille; so many more.If Wilder was still young and making films nowadays no doubt they'd be full of mindless cgi cartoonery, sex and violence because it's required now discipline's dead, but Sunset Blvd was almost perfect, intelligent film making at its best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film Noir at it's darkest in a true film legend.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sunset Boulevard marks the most famous film noir and it's fitting that its Billy Wilder's. I for one prefer his early effort Double Indemnity but I think any fan of film should have an admiration for Wilder' here. I like what he does but not how he does it. Sunset Boulevard alludes the perfect rating from me. I can see why it is beloved and have a great admiration for it but I simply think it isn't the strongest film noir.Joe Gillis turns in his broken car into her driveway to hide it from creditors as he fights his writer's block. Silent Screen diva Norma thinks he is the undertaker providing him with a casket for her departed chimp. She offers him a job doing a rewrite of her dream project. He agrees to the job but he doesn't understand what the job really is.Norma's understanding of the job is that he will serve as her companion and lover. Joe thinks he will touch up her writing and that alone. Joe never expressly agrees to live with Norma, but soon becomes her prisoner. Max the servant and Norma overwhelm him by bringing his belongings to the house. He doesn't have enough gumption to refuse because he needs money and because Norma intrigues him.The classic mansion represents time standing still. It is an impressive house but it looks as if it hasn't been touched since Norma's era of stardom. It serves as Norma's shrine to herself full of pictures to herself. It acts as her place of solace from the real world which has long since forgotten her. Her butler Max encourages this and is the one responsible for Norma not coming out of her comfort zone.I think the fact that the Academy wasn't kind to the film could have been more to the sexual abnormality of the relationship but the film is highly critical of the social aspects of the industry. We do feel some pity for Norma because the idea of stardom has driven her to hell. The public ate her up and spit her out. It depicts Hollywood and its audience as fickle, loving a star but also loving to see that star fail. Only through murder is Norma able to get back into the spotlight. The character of Betty has to mutilate her face with a nose job to get that screen test which doesn't result in a job. The main criticism though is the fact that it portrays Norma as being anyone within the business. Joe remarks that he knew that many stars lived in the extravagant mansions . Norma's biography follows matches that of so many stars of yesteryear and today, multiple marriages,inability to accept criticism, living in extravagances, and yet all ways yearning for more rather than being content with the fame and fortune they have been given.The film noir elements within "Sunset Boulevard" are very obvious throughout the film to the point where they scream at you. The most striking is the relationship between the predatory femme fatale and the man who can't quite grasp the full scenario until it's too late. It was an easy choice for Billy Wilder to shoot the picture in black and white. The atmosphere of the picture simply wouldn't be as effective if it was shot in color. It is a film noir picture as well and you can't get the same shadowy and dark effect in color. I think as an audience member it captures the finest of the visual style of film noir particularly with the setting of Norma's mansion. I think it might have had more camp if it were filmed in Technicolor. Throughout the picture Gloria Swanson skates so close to being campy and over the top that it takes time to fully let the performance sink in and make an assessment of it. There were times I felt like laughing and there were times I was genuinely impressed by her ability. Shooting Norma in color I think would take away. She is all ways in lavish clothing and is said to look gaudy under layers of make-up and I just think Wilder and Swanson would get the wrong reaction in color. She is scarier in the black dresses and the make-up highlighting her wrinkles and I think she would appear campy if she had color, even darker colors in her face and wardrobe. Seeing her in color well just would make the character not as effective.Here is my main gripe with the picture, the ending/beginning, I think it drastically hinders the narrative. In "Double Indemnity" we have a viable reason for our character to be telling his story of murder , but how is it plausible for a dead man to tell a story? It just stretches the realm of believability too far. The shot of William Holden's floating corpse makes for a very powerful visual but it is over the top for him to talk from beyond the grave. Wilder took a leap of faith here and I didn't buy it. Another factor that makes this ending/beginning not work is the fact that it ruins the surprise. We all ready know the pinnacle of how mad Norma is. The picture becomes a matter of us waiting for her to reach her breaking point rather than having us wonder what that breaking point is. William Holden's character could have told the story before his final confrontation with Norma.In the famous ending the police convince Norma to come down by convincing her that production has finally begun on her dream project. Norma thinks the cameras are for her picture but they are just the newsreels out to exploit her at her lowest. We as the audience get a certain satisfaction in seeing her in this pathetic state. We really haven't changed much since Sunset Blvd., the only thing we love more than a star is to see the star crash and burn.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent representation of the film industry with sharp Swanson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Down on his luck, screenwriter Joe Gillis (Holden) reluctantly takes a job writing for once famous actress Norma Desmond (Swanson) who is planning her comeback.Made almost 60 years ago Sunset Boulevard was a marvel at the time of release. Winning 3 Oscars and scooping plenty of other nominations, the story of the struggling screenwriter and failed actress has a level of humanity and realism to maintain its timeless classic tag.Oscar nominated William Holden (The Wild Bunch) opens the story by taking viewers back 6 months before a tragic event recalling how he ended up working for the neurotic Norma Desmond, cinemas once finest star. Holden's reflection on society and his desperation to work is charismatic, ensnaring and occasionally funny. The obsession with the car is witty and when he first appears on screen in dealing with the finance agents is cool and collected deceitful, establishing the character's core exceptionally well. But this charming on screen presence is overshadowed by an obsessive and starry-eyed portrayal of fame by Gloria Swanson as the unforgivably self obsessed actress.With the film world growing bigger each year we see more actors come and go and get lost in a whirlwind of controversy off camera. Gossip magazines are more concerned with the battles with diet and appearance and frankly it's amazing to see this depicted in a film made in the 1950's. Swanson is the symbol of today's modern stereotype. Once the star she descends into a world of obscurity and absentmindedness, lost in past glory before seeing the light and preparing herself for her comeback. "I'm ready for my close up Mr DeMille" is an unforgettable line and still remains powerful, with the performance stealing the scenes.The story itself representing the struggle of writing and surviving for the film industry is consistently accurate and interesting. The power of the bosses, the struggle of independent writers and penning the greatest novel ever reveal the desire and controversy of the industry.The inclusion of issues such as desire, lust, suicide and money add to the realism of Billy Wilder's acclaimed picture.Wilder chooses scenes carefully, maintain enough realism to make an almost fantasy about the story. The swimming pool scene and Norma's last scene are testament to the concept of madness of the film industry. This, from all the films I have seen, has one of the finest rounded off endings ever screened, perfectly pitched, entertaining and justification to the film's preaching morals of madness and the powers of film.The inclusion of an affair and a secret long lost crush add to the depth and drama of the film, which makes Sunset Boulevard packed with fine preaching issues, stunning acting and enough drama and interest to keep you hooked right until a stunning end</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pools the very best of Hollywood.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quite simply, one of the sharpest screenplays ever written and luckily it has performances to match. This movie, and if you haven't seen it then you really should rush out to grab it IMMEDIATELY, tells of a symbiotically parasitic relationship that develops between an aged film star and a struggling writer.William Holden (the writer) is the coolest narrator ever and his character, although often unlikeable, just about keeps us onside for the duration of the movie. Even if writer/director Billy Wilder doesn't manage to keep our sympathies with the right character for most of the movie he produces some scenes in the second half that give Holden's character a twisted redemption and reason to finally make a completely clean breast of things and an escape route from Norma.As for Norma Desmond herself (THE star who has definitely faded), she may well be the single greatest human character ever to be thrown onto celluloid. Half Quasimodo, half Bride Of Frankenstein and . . . . . . ummmm . . . . half Dracula's Daughter. Gloria Swanson bravely plays the faded movie star with a perfect mix of sadness, fiery anger, intense narcissism and pride, all mixed up with some mild overacting and permanent melodrama.Max, the butler, IS the avid fan taken to the extreme. Devoted, adoring, ever-present, he's the perfect audience member and just what Norma Desmond needs to keep her sanity for as long as she does. Does he actually help her or is he ultimately responsible for her fall over the edge ? Max or Joe, who is the bigger culprit ? An interesting question that I'm not sure I could easily answer.Of course, many other people also help to keep Norma from the truth. Cecil B DeMille, her card-playing buddies, even security guards still working at the studio. If more people had reacted the same way as Joe did initially (dismissing Norma and prompting her reply of "I AM big, it's the pictures that got small") then maybe she would have eased back down to earth. If her ego and vanity would have EVER allowed it.The only real innocent character in the movie, the only one who doesn't help to perpetuate any fantasy and who doesn't act for purely personal gain, is Betty Schaffer. It is poor Betty who is quickly drawn in, chewed up and spat out by Holden's character (hmmmm . . . a writer responsible for breaking the heart of a young, up and coming lady . . . . surely not).Some people have points they argue about this movie. Why did Joe stick around for so long ? He was a shallow guy, he wanted the meal ticket that he was being offered and, yes, despite his disgust at the offerings he always ended up taking them. Why did he end up back with Norma on that fateful night after her suicide attempt ? Because he was too scared, he didn't want to feel responsible for anyone else's pain. If he'd never actually heard of Norma's fate then he would have been long gone but once it was relayed to him, and still with the fresh memory of the part he played, then he had to make sure that he hadn't done any long-term damage. Joe enjoyed making a buck but he wasn't a completely uncaring man.I love this movie with all my being. I love the faded, preserved shrine that is Norma Desmond's house. The car and the swimming pool being returned to working order, just as Norma herself is, for the benefit of Joe. Are we watching Gloria Swanson playing Norma Desmond throughout this film or are we watching an older actress play every idol that we've ever discarded ? Is the movie disturbing because of the interplay of the characters or because we, as an audience, do not want to venture into this world of forgotten stars and empty theatres ? Am I reading too much into this film ? Maybe I am and maybe I don't care. Just see it and love it.See this if you like: Billy Wilder, The Player, Singin' In The Rain.NB, this review was adapted from the original written under my old RockySchlockyRobot ID that I have long forgotten how to access.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You are all out of your minds if you gave this movie less than an eight. And if you hated Some Like It Hot, I'm convinced that you have no soul. If you hated something as masterful as The Apartment, then you have a hole where your heart should be. If you hate everything Billy Wilder ever did, you have no soul, heart, or brain-- you're just a retarded stick with opposable thumbs. In other words, I hate you if you hate Billy Wilder.Wilder was and always will be one of the greatest writer-directors that Hollywood has ever known. Some of you are forgetting the purpose of film-- to take you away to a world that you didn't know and entertain you. That's what Billy did, only he made it funny, satirical, or both. Sunset Boulevard did get dull at points, but that's life. If you don't want movies to be somewhat real, go delude yourself and watch Teletubbies. Personally, I wish that someone would bring Billy back from the dead to make another movie and make all of the people who probably enjoyed Disaster Movie appreciate his brilliance.So God, please send your son down here so that he can do that Lazarus thing and bring back Billy. We need him down here. With a new generation of Hannah Montana's that will marry Jonas Brother look-a-likes, I need Sunset Boulevard. Because it reminds me that Hollywood isn't perfect. It's real and imperfect just like the rest of life.I Heart Billy Wilder!</fullReview>

Before he knows it, he is caught in her obsession of reviving her long gone-career, moving into her mansion... and more than meets the eye unfolds!

		<shortDescription>A Classic That Engraves Itself On the Doorstep of the World In Which It Is Set</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Billy Wilder's Sunset Boulevard is the blackly funny, often pitifully sad portrayal of a has-been silent star, alive as if against the knowledge of the outside world, in her misshapen manor, screening her old films, imagining unstoppably, relentlessly, of a return, that she is under the illusion will vindicate her fans, who all feel robbed of her. But it's also a disfigured love story, which while it keeps it from becoming simply a waxworks or a freak show, causes it to drag a little tiny bit.Gloria Swanson gives an unforgettable performance as the silent star Norma Desmond, with her covetous, melodramatic fingers, her theatrical gestures, her high-flying delusions of grandeur. William Holden considerately plays the role of the writer half her age, who lets himself be kept by her. But the performance that gives Swanson matching reverberation, relishing the film's Gothic grandiosity, is by Erich von Stroheim, as Norma's mysterious, devoted butler.The movie engraves itself on the doorstep of the world in which it is set, extracting so candidly from life in pictures that we can smell, lick, penetrate the special minutiae, the unequivocal parallels between the story and the actual actors themselves. What makes it so pitch perfect is how Wilder skates on thin ice flanked by black comedy and tragedy. Swanson's Norma Desmond slithers within millimeters of lampooning herself, taking huge chances with over-the-top sneers, affected lunges, theatrical posturings, and world-record- breaking narcissism, dangling Norma at the brink of psychosis for the vast majority of the movie, then creeping over. Norma obviously is not a wrinkly mummy. She is younger than stars such as Jane Fonda and Frances McDormand. She has aged only in her mind's eye, having grown obsessed obsessed obsessed with her moment of eminence in the past.What is most fun about Sunset Boulevard is how genuine Wilder had the wonderful nerve to be. He uses real names and shows real people, sometimes extensively. Sunset Boulevard gets to the bottom of the false impressions between audience and insider, and does not allow Norma Desmond to. The plot provides Holden with many reasons to agree to Norma's proposal of a job as her personal, hush-hush script doctor. He's bust, the rent is overdue, he is a fugitive from repo men, and he would hate to return to his job as a columnist in Ohio (It's always got to be Ohio! Why? What did we ever do to anybody?). He is as well not wholeheartedly reluctant to prostitute himself. Holden pitches faint fragility and internal struggle into his character. He goes through the forms of saying he doesn't want Norma's gifts, but he takes them, claims to be surprised on New Year's Eve when she throws a party just for the two of them, but surely he has known from the first that she wants not only a writer, but a young man to reassure her that she is still attractive. What is brilliantly satirical about all this is that in Hollywood, a screenwriter is so oppressed and low on the food chain that he will do anything to keep working. And what is furthermore brilliantly satirical is that Norma's life is not so bad. She's really her own worst enemy, which is what makes her story so pitiful.There is sure enough the young blonde studio writer with the highly predictable name of Betty, who is engaged to Jack Webb, but as Holden begins sneaking out of the house to work together on a script with her, she falls for him. He'd do her in a heartbeat, but he backs off, to a certain extent because he doesn't want her to find out the truth, but what's more because he shamefully likes the way of life with Norma. Wilder creates an exceedingly absorbing effect here, because when he escapes to see his old pal Jack Webb, and tension grows between him and Betty, Norma's world sure has gotten stuffy by that time and we feel a great deal of solace from her twisted realm.Of all the great directors of Hollywood's old days---Wyler, Stevens, Lang, Hitchcock---Billy Wilder was the biggest breath of fresh air. He knew how to blast a fun-loving sense of humor at you even in the face of knowingly pathetic subjects and characters. And he could go straight to the other extreme in the same film, outright disturbing you more than you ever thought a film from the old days ever could. Double Indemnity, Ace in the Hole, Some Like It Hot, The Seven Year Itch, The Apartment, The Lost Weekend, Stalag 17, Witness for the Prosecution, Sabrina and Sunset Boulevard all have a great comforting quality at the same time they are helmed by the silent man behind the camera who you never think about, the sublime master of mood swings, not to mention he consistently shows his strong sense of the importance of a memorable closing line, closing shot.</fullReview>

The men are coming to repossess his car but he escapes and parks it into a garage next to a house that he believes is abandoned. Inside lives a former aging silent film actress and her butler. Her name is Norma and she is going to help Joe write her script so that she can make a comeback. The problem is that Norma is a little pulled away from reality. She takes over Joe's life.What a great movie with perfect acting and a great story. It's a little sad in a way too. I really liked Norma's eyes. They looked like the eyes of a crazy lady. Only a crazy lady would buy a coffin for her monkey and have a funeral.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A haunting, eerie and amazingly true look at Hollywood! One of the best films ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps the best film ever made, 'Sunset Blvd' follows the story of lonely and struggling writer Joe Gillis (William Holden) who is thrown into a web of romance and feuds with aging silent actress Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) and her creepy butler Max Von Mayerling (Erich Von Stroheim) when he accidentally stumbles across Norma's mansion when he uses her garage for his car so it doesn't get taken. Norma will do anything for him, and she also truly believes she is still famous even though people barely remember her and she can make a comeback to Hollywood. But Joe knows all to better and wants to escape her odd, aging and treacherous ways. He meets Betty Schaefer (Nancy Olson) and begins writing a script with her-and perhaps even falling in love. This sets off Norma who will stop at nothing to be in the limelight, get Joe and make pictures again...even if it means murder. An intelligent look at Hollywood with amazing performances and one of the best scripts. The use of the black and white color makes a grim and eerie look of the film, which helps pull the viewer in. A fascinating thing about the film is that while the story is fictional it somewhat holds true to Gloria Swanson, even at one point viewing a film of hers that ruined her career! A truly haunting and memorable look at the desperate and true side of Hollywood. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hollywood Gothic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie that takes a look at the dark side of Hollywood, focusing on the fringe-dwellers frantically trying to capture (or retain) a minute scrap of success by whatever means necessary.Gloria Swanson is easily the best thing about this picture. Her performance is riddled with theatrics but that's exactly what the character calls for. The fact that she didn't win the Best Actress Oscar for this role beggars belief. Swanson, Holden, Stroheim &amp; Olson all received acting nominations but none took home any hardware, despite fine performances all around.There are a couple of likely reasons for the film's relatively small haul on Oscar night. First of all, the film was up against another classic, "All About Eve", which had garnered a record 14 nominations. Then, there was the scathing screenplay authored by Wilder, Brackett &amp; Marshman. In particular, the story does a fine job of reflecting the amoral quest for success and the narcissism of the famous, hardly the image that Hollywood wanted to convey.Billy Wilder's direction here is well-handled and there are several moments of greatness, such as the famous ending. In that scene Wilder's direction, Swanson's acting and Waxman's score combine to produce what is surely one of the most memorable endings to any film ever.There's a reason (several, actually) why this film is considered among the greatest of all time. See for yourself and you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In browsing the comments for "Sunset Blvd.," I see that virtually all of them tend to understand that this happens to be one of the best pictures ever made. Don't just ask me, ... or the majority of the other posters here..., consult with The National Film Registry and the American Film Institute.Atmospheric, well acted and shot, an intelligent and slightly offbeat script, and a host of themes explored. What more could you want from a film? For those of you who cavil about this one, I find myself remembering how in the early 90's I would have sworn that "Old Style," or "Michelob" were the epitome of beers. It is only after I'd experienced a host of better potables that I become an adequate judge of real quality. For those of you who dismiss "Sunset Blvd.," I have to wonder just what IS a quality film in your estimation? While I don't particularly care for Led Zeppelin or Jimi Hendrix, I can appreciate that they are above average talents, just not my cup of tea. So, maybe it's NOT the movie, perhaps it's you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Billy Wilder pushed the envelope yet again with this bitter, cynical, and yet so true story of the aging, forgotten era of Hollywood that he claimed was still in love with itself. You can see that completely in the character of Norma Desmond, played to perfection by Gloria Swanson. She believes that due to the sound era coming into effect, all the great silent stars that are far superior are being ruined into obscurity. Basically, she blames sound for brainwashing the public. Yet, as we watch, we realize more and more that she is brainwashed into thinking she is still the star she once was. Wilder and Brackett have tremendous fun in this tremendous script that has to be one of the best ever written. It is so cleverly written, with touches of comedy, romance, and drama that it is hard to understand what type of film this is. To put it bluntly, this is revenge on Hollywood. And it continues to hold up today with all that is happening in films. See it once for its quality film-making, but see it again for the smacks Wilder puts on Hollywood. He has some good points, maybe too many.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The professional drama queen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most admirable thing about this Billy Wilder masterpiece is the courage it took to make this film. 1950 is exactly in the middle between the self-imposed production code and the anti-American pogroms. In that narrow window comes this scathing satire of Hollywood glam in the same year as All About Eve. Both 1950s are an indictment of the soulless packaging of the movie business. Both take the point of view of the ambitions and the frustrations of leading ladies that lived long enough to witness their fading. Both were nominated for best film. All About Eve, perhaps because it was more direct and less metaphorical about its subject manner, won the day. It is no doubt a good film but today we recognise Sunset as the superior work.Many people play themselves in this film. Buster Keaton leads a team of vaguely recognisable 'wax works' whose wrinkling bodies are dying monuments to their glamorous silent movie pasts. C.B. de Mille plays himself as a survivor that transcended the transformation of the movie business.But Gloria Swanson and Erich von Stroheim are also playing themselves in this roman-a-clef where all their change about this autobiographical performance is their names.Gloria Swanson was Norma Desmond: in shared historical experience if not in personality traits. She had been a great star of the silent movies, her face known and admired world-wide. A 17 year old girl 'discovered' by Hollywood, placed on the front row of a joy ride into fame and fortune, only to be discarded when the pictures 'became too small' for her to fit in. That phrase is how she is introduced to us. William Holden's Joe Gillis vaguely recognises the dark dame in her desolate temple. 'You're Norma Desmond. You used to be big.' 'I'm still big,' comes to retort, 'it's the pictures that become small.' The butler in this palace of regret and memory is Max played by von Stroheim. Half way through the film, when in an exposition scene the history of the relationship between butler and dame becomes clearer to us, Max tells us there were three young directors in the early days of Hollywood that showed much promise: D.W. Griffith, C.B. de Mille and himself, the butler. If he said the third man was the actor who played the butler he'd have been perfectly accurate.Have-beens are a fact of life in every industry but there is, or at least should be an inherent sadness, in the cynicms of an E! special about one-hit-wonders or what ever happened to that forgotten child-star. Gloria Swanson and Better Davies (in the other 1950 Hollywood-themed movie) are representative of what must happen all the time. That in itself is no bad news. I suppose cabin crew, athletes or whoever else relies on their appearance for their living all have the inevitably early sunset ahead of them in their minds.What is particular about the movies is that persons - their appearance and more importantly their capacity to incarnate in their acting the emotions and ambitions of those who watch them - are packaged as a product that is valuable only while it waits for the next best thing.That's the theme of the film. Consider now its quality. The movie uses the device of a narrator but with the knowledge, revealed very early in the film, that our narrator has died a few hours ago and he only exists because we need to be put in the picture of understanding why he is dead.We also need to understand how he came about to meet this one particular end. He's floating, face down, in the swimming pool of a huge mansion on Sunset Boulevard. And the curiosity is awakened by the odd perspective with which we see the corpse, looking up at its face from the bottom of the pool.This is the particularity of the cinema, which allow us to look and see from corners and angles impossible in the physical world. But cinema is the subject of this film. Consider now therefore the concluding scene as Norma walks down the staircase of what is physically her house from which she is to be taken away but in his mind is the set of C.B. de Mille's great new production starring her.First we see the cameras. They are newsreels hungrily shooting this new juicy scandal. But Norma wants to believe they are C.B. de Mille's cameras. 'I'm ready for my close-up now Mr. de Mille.' And she looks straight in our eyes as she addresses us who are guilty of her tragic existence. It was our hunger for glamour and success that thrust upon her the role of a star. As our boredom as an audience sets in and we switch to younger stars she is left knowing nothing better but her need for attention.It is that odd relationship between stars and audiences that Billy Wilder sets up for us in Sunset Blvd. This is not a one-way affair and when we abandon our stars, they have a right to feel betrayed. We should not be surprised that artists whose function is to magnify several times over human emotions (this is especially true of the silent pictures) deal with this betrayal with this sort of drama. Who has a better right to be a drama queen than a professional drama queen?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Billy Wilder's 'Sunset Boulevard' is a film about Hollywood. It is not concerned with the happy, idealised version of Hollywood that we would usually expect, but rather it offers a darker, more cynical outlook on the subject, a potent mixture of drama, romance and black comedy. Joe Gillis (William Holden) is a failed hack screenwriter whose car is about to be repossessed. When he stumbles upon a broken-down mansion, he comes to meet silent screen star Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), whose career floundered with the arrival of talkies, but who still maintains delusions of her own fame and grandeur. When Norma offers Joe money to edit the script for her big comeback, he simply can't resist the opportunity, completely oblivious to the fact that, by the time the events of the film are over, he will be dead.Very curiously, the film is shown in flashback form, narrated by Joe Gillis from beyond the grave. We first come across him floating lifelessly in Norma Desmond's pool, surrounded by detectives and photographers. The original edit of the film opened in a morgue, with the assembled corpses ? Joe included ? discussing how they came to be here. However, audiences considered the scene so ludicrous that they were unsure whether to approach the rest of the film as a drama or a comedy. After the removal of this opening scene, audiences reacted more favourably, and Joe Gillis' post-death voice-over adds a darkly humorous touch to the film, also successfully evoking the feel of a classic film-noir, of which Billy Wilder was a veteran (see 'Double Indemnity (1944)' for an archetypal classic of the genre).'Sunset Boulevard' really is a surprisingly contemptuous anti-tribute to Hollywood. Aside from casting Gloria Swanson as the long-forgotten silent star (who, herself, had struggled to adapt to the introduction of sound films), Wilder also makes somewhat sadistic use of Buster Keaton, Anna Q. Nilsson and H.B. Warner. In a brief cameo appearance (credited as themselves), and described by Joe as "waxworks," the three silent stars play similarly "has-been" actors who attend a bridge game at Norma's mansion. Furthermore, Erich von Stroheim ? who plays Norma's sinister servant, former-director and first husband, Max ? is forced to sit through a screening of 'Queen Kelly,' a disastrous unfinished 1929 film in which he directed a younger Gloria Swanson.Re-enforcing the theme that a certain level of corruption has seeped into new Hollywood, many of the characters are portrayed as being deceitful or manipulative. In a futile bid for self-validation and intimacy, Norma manipulates Joe into staying at her mansion, even threatening suicide on numerous occasions to prevent him from leaving her. Joe, on the other hand, exploits Norma's misguided delusions of success to provide him with financial security. Nonetheless, it is to Wilder's credit that he makes both of these characters appear somewhat sympathetic to the audience. By the end of the film, Joe partly compensates for his devious past behaviour, coming clean with Norma and convincing young budding writer, Betty Schaefer (Nancy Olson), that she would be happier with her fiancé (Jack Webb) than with him. However, in typical Wilder fashion, having finally learned an important lesson about life, Joe is promptly rewarded with his own murder.By showing the decline of many of old Hollywood's finest stars, Wilder hints at the corruptive, devastating influences of new Hollywood, and of the modern studio system. This view was not accepted kindly by some in the industry; producer Louis B. Mayer famously confronted the director in public, declaring that "you have disgraced the industry that made and fed you. You should be tarred and feathered and run out of Hollywood." Fortunately, most in Hollywood disagreed, and 'Sunset Boulevard' was honoured with eleven Academy Award nominations, including three wins (Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Music and Best Writing). Paradoxically, whilst the film explores the tragic degradation of Hollywood at the turn of the 1950s, this Billy Wilder masterpiece proves beyond doubt that, in that era, Hollywood film-making was in a golden age.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ultimate has-been in the ultimate Hollywood story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>William Holden is Joe Gillis, a down and out screenwriter trying to keep his car from being repossessed in "Sunset Boulevard," a 1950 film written and directed by Billy Wilder. The film stars Gloria Swanson, Max von Stroheim, Nancy Olson, Jack Webb, and Cecil B. Demille. Gillis hides his car in a garage, not realizing it is the home of the great silent film star, the delusional Norma Desmond (Swanson), who lives in this enormous mansion, cared for by her butler (von Stroheim). Finding out he is a screenwriter, Norma solicits his help in editing her script of "Salome," her comeback film. Feeling somewhat trapped at first, Joe eventually enjoys the good life. When he slips away to be with his friends on New Year's Eve, his friend's fiancée, Betty Schaefer (Olson) suggests a screenplay based on a story written by Joe. (The story actually was a script by Wilder, filmed in Germany.) He returns to the Sunset Boulevard mansion to learn that Norma, distraught over his leaving, has attempted suicide. Taking pity on her, Joe becomes her lover and moves from the garage into the big house. Meanwhile, he's falling for Betty and slipping away to work with her at night.This is perhaps the greatest Hollywood story, and yet it didn't get off to a very good start. The first scene took place in a morgue, where the dead bodies talked to one another. At the first screening, the audience laughed, which they weren't supposed to be doing. As Wilder sat on the steps outside, a woman walked out and, unaware of who he was, said, "Have you ever seen such ?x@//*&amp;?" "And we had worked on it for a year," Wilder told an interviewer. So the opening was cut.Wilder captures the ego and delusional aspects of Desmond perfectly, a woman caught in the past who has lost all sense of reality. This role provided silent film star Gloria Swanson with her great comeback. With her royal demeanor, sharp voice and gorgeous eyes, Swanson actually plays the role like a silent star, in a very overt way. The truth is, Norma never left not only her stardom, but her film roles. At the time of the filming, Swanson was 52 playing a has-been of 50. By today's standards, it's somewhat amusing, and you'd probably add 20 years if you were doing it today. In fact, in the Broadway show, the line "There's nothing wrong with being 50" was cut. Wilder approached Mae West, Pola Negri and Mary Pickford for Norma before Swanson."Sunset Boulevard" may have given Swanson her comeback, but it made William Holden a superstar. After his starring role in "Golden Boy," Holden disappeared into light films and basically went nowhere until Joe Gillis. He is remembered today as one of the great stars of the '50s, yet he was of the same generation as many of the stars of the '30s and '40s. He is glorious looking - you wouldn't have to be a loony tune to lock him up in your house. He plays the role with the right touch of cynicism and self-hatred. Montgomery Clift was set to play this role but dropped out. He, too, would have been excellent but probably not as hard-hitting. von Stroheim, as Norma's protector and butler Max, is perfection. In real life, he couldn't drive, so the car needed to be towed; in the scene where he drives up to Paramount, he actually crashed through the gates.In the film, Norma, thinking that Demille wants her for a role, goes to Paramount and visits him on the set of "Samson and Delilah," and "Sunset Boulevard" uses the real filming of that movie and its cast.As a Broadway show, "Sunset Boulevard" was opulent but much less effective. There wasn't enough music (the second act had one new song) but provided a tremendous showcase and two great numbers for the various women who played Norma. Stephen Sondheim had at one time entertained doing this as a musical; in his hands, it would have captured the dark atmosphere of the film much better.Billy Wilder gives us a biting portrait of actors who live for nothing but their stardom, their hangers-on for whom they are just a meal ticket, and the sadness of being aged and forgotten in Hollywood. A great classic starring the greats, written and directed by one. It doesn't get any better than this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Classic tale of attrition, the collapse of greatness, the slime and sickness which infects the minds of those who love themselves too much. A man on his last leg, a film writer joins himself by faustian pact with the macabre shadow of a once great actress. Her lack of control as regards reality is compensated by the ever tightening grip she has on the impoverished writer who meets her. After meeting, the woman's charity ensnares the young writer, who is charged with raising this poor smoking corpse from the dustbin of history to the glare and flourish of success. The comeback will ride on the young writers script, until the end when the failed actress descends into delusion, and makes her own stage to act upon. Sunset Boulevard is a strange and destructive film certainly, it also has the rare distinction of being brilliant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Released the same year that I was, this magnificent film (#16 on AFI's 2007 Top-100 Movies) was the greatest of Billy Wilder's many achievements.Wilder enraged the big-wigs in Hollywood with his film. It would probably won many more Oscars had the voters been honest and not let their hurt feelings get in the way.Gloria Swanson was magnificent as a silent film star wanting to return to movies. The fact that she was a real silent film star made it all the more incredible. She dominated the screen every time she appeared.Her co-star, William Holden (Stalag 17, Network), was equally brilliant as a hack screenwriter who allowed himself to be kept by Swanson.The sets and music were beyond compare. The cinematography was brilliant.Actor/Director Erich von Stroheim played the butler flawlessly. This was only Nancy Olsen's third film, and she played Betty like a veteran.There have been so many great things written about this film, that I can only sound like a parrot, but to see Wilder at his best and some of Hollywood's greats from the silent and contract period, this film is a must.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The city of Hollywood, California, as the historical center of the American movie industry, has been a place of fantasies and fascinations since the first film producers decided to move there in 1913. Most of this almost supernatural mystique that has impregnated the city since those days was a direct result of the economic bonanza of the "Roaring Twenties" and the creation of the "star system", imposed by the major film studios in the early years Hollywood's Golden Age. The myths and legends of classic Hollywood would soon be exported to the world, and became an enormous influence for an Austrian young writer named Samuel "Billy" Wilder. Wilder would later move to America after the rise of the Nazi regime, and started a promising career at Hollywood, the very place of his dreams of youth. The opulence and decadence of the city inspired Wilder to write and direct a legendary movie in 1950: "Sunset Boulevard"."Sunset Boulevard" is the story of two persons, writer Joe Gillis (William Holden) and former silent-film star Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), whose lives will coincide on Sunset Blvd. and will never be the same again. As a scriptwriter, Gillis has not been lucky for a while, and finally finds himself hunted by two repossession agents who expect him to pay for his car. In his attempt to flee, Gillis hides his car in an apparently abandoned mansion on Sunset Boulevard. However, the mansion is not deserted, and inside he mets the owner, the legendary film star Norma Desmond, who has faded into obscurity after the arrival of sound movies. After she discovers Gillis is a writer, she offers to hire him so he can help her with a script she has been writing for her comeback to cinema. Gillis accepts, thinking it's an easy way to earn fast money, but soon he'll discover that nothing comes off that easily, specially on Sunset Blvd.While the movie is definitely Wilder's brainchild, the script was written with the help of his usual collaborator, Charles Brackett; and former film critic D.M. Marshman Jr., who was hired by Wilder and Brackett to help them develop the plot. The story follows the classic film noir pattern, but soon it is obvious that this movie goes beyond any genre conventions as it adds touches of horror, drama and black comedy in the most unmerciful critique to the decadence of Hollywood's Golden Age. The way the writers develop the characters is simply perfect in all its cynic realism, as while the characters are not without a touch of grotesque, they still look and feel so real that just enhance the horror and tragedy of this twisted tale about the dark side of Hollywood. Filled with fascinating characters, carefully placed details and a wonderful tale of madness, the script for "Sunset Blvd." is definitely one of the finest ever written.As if writing a monumental screenplay wasn't enough, Wilder also excels as a director in this masterpiece, bringing his script to life in a haunting and beautiful way. Just like he did 6 years before with "Double Indemnity", once again Wilder reinvents the film noir genre thanks to the amazing cinematography by John F. Seitz, who captures the darkness of Norma Desmond's life with his heavily atmospheric film noir photography. His care for details and references to old Hollywood extend beyond his screenplay and populate the film in more than one way (the inspired use of cameos by real former silent-film stars for example), adding a great amount of authenticity and realism to the movie. Finally, the performances he managed to get from his main cast are simply some of the best done in an American movie.Many has already been said about the outstanding performance done by Gloria Swanson as Norma Desmond, but I can't help but commenting on the extraordinary level of perfection she achieved on her role. In her eerily autobiographical character (Desmond's past resembled Swanson's career in some ways), Swanson transforms herself in the vivid incarnation of the twisted mirror image of Hollywood's life, creating a larger than life character that gave her a much deserved praise. In his breakthrough role, William Holden makes an excellent subtle and witty counterpart to Swanson's over-the-top character, and despite facing extraordinary actors in this wild ride through Hollywood, he never disappoints and proves to be up to the challenge. Finally, legendary director Erich Von Stroheim appears as Norma's stoic butler, and adds a haunting aura of dignity to the movie with the powerful presence of his acting.Despite being a powerful criticism to the studio system and a brutal deconstruction of the Hollywood myths, "Sunset Blvd." is also a fond love letter to the movies that resulted from it, and specially to the artists behind them (The cameos by director Cecil B. DeMille, Buster Keaton, H. B. Warner and Anna Q. Nilsson are a testament of this); as while tragic and pathetic, there is a certain sweetness and humanity in the characters that makes this set of old Hollywood ghouls to be so charming despite their madness. While not without flaws (Nancy Olson's performance feels uninspired when compared to the rest of the cast), "Sunset Blvd." is one of those movies that truly deserves its status as "classic", as thanks to Wilder's direction and the cast's performances, it reaches the closest a film can be to perfection.Time magazine described the film as the story of "Hollywood at its worst told by Hollywood at its best", and that's probably the best way to describe the haunting story of Norma Desmond in "Sunset Blvd.". Like the famous street that gives the movie its name, Billy Wilder's "Sunset Blvd." has developed a powerful mystique around it, but that's just because in the course of its destruction of Hollywood's illusions, the movie made them even more real. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Sunset Boulevard" is, without a doubt, one of the greatest American movies of all time. Superbly acted, directed, written, photographed, and scored, there are few pictures that come close in matching this landmark film. Thus, the film itself is worthy repeat viewings.The special features on this DVD are equal in quality to the film. "The Making of Sunset Boulevard" provides marvelous insides to director/writer Billy Wilder, stars Holden, Swanson, and Stroheim while co-star Nancy Olson (looking fabulous in her seventies) gives delightful anecdotes as one that participated in the filming of this classic. The featurette on costume designer Edith Head is just as engaging, as is the script for the deleted monologue sequence.Also integral to the success of the movie was Franz Waxman's score. An informative featurette on the composer is included.The highlight, however, is the commentary by Ed Sikov (author of "On Sunset Boulevard: The Life and Times of Billy Wilder). It is obvious that the writer did his job well and lovingly pays tribute to the director and its stars with his enlightening comments, a treat for fans of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"No one ever leaves the Star, that's what makes one a Star."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching the film I felt a little bit like William Holden, a bit out of place but fascinated by the intrigue and insanity of it all. There can be no doubt that the movie is one of the best of all time, it's stars feed off each other in a macabre dance, best exemplified by the makeshift New Year's Eve Party. Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) spins an artful web for Joe Gillis (Holden), the spider and the fly in this case need each other in a symbiotic relationship that will ultimately lead to doom for both.The characters themselves almost seem larger than life, a particular line by Desmond confirms it. When Gillis first recognizes her as a former silent film star who used to be big, she replies - "I am big, it's the pictures that got small". That line lingers over the entire story the rest of the way, for a faded film queen with delusions of grandeur who can't recognize that her time is past. The card scene with Buster Keaton present adds further resonance to the masquerade, that was a great touch.Perhaps in a different way, Max von Mayerling's (Erich von Stroheim) story is just as compelling, the former husband turned butler who desperately trades loyalty for individuality. His time has also passed, but he manages to ride it out as nobly as he can. The finale when he takes over the direction of 'The Great Norma Desmond's' return is brilliantly conceived and movingly portrayed. Lights, camera, action, fade out - all smoke and mirrors where a fire once burned.It's interesting that "Sunset Boulevard" and "All About Eve" came out the same year, each casting a wary eye at their respective venues, Hollywood and Broadway. Following recent viewings of both, I would have awarded the Best Film Oscar to 'Sunset', a much darker film at heart with greater irony. Though not totally overlooked, the film failed to capture any of the 'big' awards, having to settle for recognition in writing, scoring and art direction. A thought came to me as I watched Holden's character packing his bags in an attempt to flee the madness. Can you picture the film a quarter century later with the benefit of an Eagles soundtrack - "You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave". Yes I know, it wouldn't have worked with the tone of the story, but the line fits. Oddly, this is so far the only movie I've seen with Gloria Swanson, and she was terrific. One couldn't imagine anyone else in the role, except perhaps Bette Davis, though she wouldn't have been in her fifties yet at the time of the picture. For his part, Holden displays just the right amount of angst in his role as the kept man, balancing an out of work career with the momentary hope of redemption that a successful screen play might bring. Both sizzle on screen, lending credibility to characters who can only arrive at disastrous outcomes, sort of long term contracts with no options.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sunset Boulevard: where dreams are made and where dreams also fade...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Introspection is good for the soul, at least some of the time: we all need to look at ourselves, from time to time, just to see where we're at. Unhappily, sometimes, we don't like what we see in ourselves ? and maybe that's what Billy Wider was thinking of when he decided to make this movie, arguably one of the finest Hollywood movies about Hollywood ever made and still listed high in the Top Hundred Films.But, Billy Wilder and the cast didn't know that when shooting the film, nor did they know it would win three Academy Awards. But there's no doubt that Wilder knew that he was breaking new ground. According to Gloria Swanson, Wilder knew "full well that such a script, about Hollywood's excesses and neuroses, was bound to give the Hollywood people acting in it healthy doubts, about the material or about themselves, depending on their individual security" (1) Incidentally, Bill Holden wasn't the first choice to play Joe Gillis, the cynical script-writer: that part was supposed to go to a young Montgomery Clift, but he didn't like the idea of playing opposite a much older woman!In one of the most imaginative openings in cinema, the film begins with the dead Joe Gillis telling the story as he lay floating, face down, in the swimming pool at Norma Desmond's (Gloria Swanson) decrepit mansion on Sunset Boulevard; the camera angle from below, showing his gaping eyes and mouth, is unsurpassed to this day, in my opinion. How does Joe Gillis get there? Would you believe it all starts with his need to get a few hundred dollars to keep the skip-tracers away from his automobile, seeing as how Joe is way behind in his payments?Leaving them in a tangle of lies ? something that Joe, we learn, is very good at ? he accidentally finds himself in the grounds of a mansion owned by a silent-screen star, now living as a virtual recluse on Sunset Boulevard. Ever the opportunist, Joe finagles himself into a job ? another thing that he desperately needs ? conning the old bag into believing that he can rework her come-back script into the next Hollywood blockbuster, and all for five hundred dollars a week. In Hollywood, money can buy anything and everything, and Joe proved he was no slouch, pounding his typewriter to try and salvage something from Norma's overblown epic.But, after a few weeks of work, a funny thing happens on the way to see the director, in this case, the very famous and very real Cecil B. de Mille: Joe gets an attack of conscience, sort of, after finding out that the studio doesn't want her script ? they just want to hire her old Isotta Fraschini open touring car with leopard-skin upholstery for some B movie! So Joe has to string her along, let her believe that her script just needs a bit more work and keep her happy. Well, the money's great and Norma just wants to keep buying presents for him, so why should Joe complain? Why indeed?But all good things come to an end, in the end. Just when Joe thinks he doing great on a new script that he's writing with his best friend's girl friend, Nancy Olson (Betty Schaeffer), Norma decides that she's fallen in love with Joe and won't let him go. That's big trouble for Joe, because he's fallen in love with Nancy and knows that he can't have either of them: Norma's just a meal ticket to him, and Nancy, well... she's his best friend's girl. And you never steal your best friend's girl, do you? Especially in Hollywood! Such irony...So, what does any heel do when up against the wall? Kiss the girls and run, of course. Only, he doesn't know where to crawl to, except away, maybe back to Ohio ? his Hollywood dreams shattered ? back to that lousy desk job at the local newspaper, and suffer the snickers and sneers from the creeps he thought he'd left forever...Anyway, Joe thinks he doing them both a favor as he packs his bags and tells Norma she's better off without him. Such chivalry! Only, he didn't realize, the schmuck, that there's nothing worse than a woman scorned ? and one that has a gun. And it's pointed at his back, as he walks away, dejected, disheartened and disgusted, finally, with himself. Such is death, and for Joe, mercifully, it comes quickly as Norma shoots him down in crazed despair. Not for nothing is Hollywood called The Dream Factory.Ably supported by a bevy of real Hollywood players and producers, I still rate this as the definitive story about tinsel town and how it corrupts and destroys. Oh, it's been done again, sort of, with The Player (1992; directed by Robert Altman) and by David Lynch with his psychological masterpiece, Mulholland Drive (2001), but it all started with this one.You owe it to yourself to see it. Really.Notes: 1. Bedside Hollywood: Great scenes from movie memoirs (1985), Robert Atwan &amp; Bruce Forer (eds), Moyer Bell, New York, p. 267.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A collision of two eras</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen this many times. From the moment it was made it was destined to be a classic. William Holden plays a B-movie screenwriter struggling in Hollywood and about to get his car repossessed when he pulls into a driveway of an old mansion owned by a silent screen star, played by Gloria Swanson, who has long faded from the public's and Hollywood's memory and lives as a recluse. Her butler, played by Eric Von Stroheim, is the first of her three husbands and who as former director discovered her. Holden grabs an opportunity to live in the mansion and write a screenplay for the Norma Desmond character's comeback to films. She falls in love with him with designs on him being her fourth husband and things start unraveling. Also in the cast are Nancy Olson, Fred Clark, Jack Webb and in wonderfully scripted cameo roles are a cast of stars from the silent movie era, director Cecil B. DeMille, actor-comedian Buster Keaton, actress Ann Q. Nilsson, actress-turned present day gossip columnist Hedda Hopper and actor H.B Warren. Stroheim is also from the silent era as is Swanson herself. She made 58 silent films in just 16 years between 1914 and 1930 and was one of Hollywood's biggest names but only made five films in the 30's and by 1934 with the film Music in the Air at age 37 her career ended. She returned in 1941 to make a comeback film but disappeared again until she got the role in Sunset Boulevard at the age of 53. A role she played so convincingly that it would typecast her as Norma Desmond and she only made one other film before disappearing from the big screen once again. She would show up occasionally on television and made a couple more screen roles late in her life. John Seitz is the film's cinematographer who himself got his start photographing silent films in a long 45 year career where he was never out of work. He had been the cinematographer on such silent film classics as The Prisoner of Zenda, The Arab, and Scarmouche to name a few so he was an ideal choice to photographer this film. His career also would go on to include The Lost Weekend, The Big Clock, Double Indemnity and Sullivan's Travels. Famed writer director Billy Wilder was making a name for himself and had already directed such pictures as The Lost Weekend, A Foreign Affair and Double Indemnity. Wilder wrote the screenplay with Charles Brackett and D.M. Marshman Jr. The film was nominated for 11 Academy Awards and won three for Best Art Direction, Best Music Score and Best Screenplay. among it's 11 nominations were Best Picture, Best Director, Best Cinematography, Best Editing and a heavily nominated cast in Holden for Best Actor, Swanson for Best Actress, Olson for Best Supporting Actress and Von Stroheim for Best Supporting Actor. The Academy Awards for 1950 were All About Eve vs. Sunset Boulevard with the two films nominated for a total of 25 awards with nine nominations between the two casts alone. Sunset Boulevard also won four Golden Globe Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actress and Best Score and received an additional three Globe nominations. It's film noir, drama, satire, dark comedy and comes close to a horror story too. If you like any or all of those genre categories you'll like this film. If you have an appreciation for the silent era films as I do you'll like this even more. I give it a 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Sunset Blvd/Scared To Death connection!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I would certainly agree that this is one of "Hollywood's finest", a true classic, etc., I have to take issue with people who comment on the uniqueness of the script, particularly in having the film being narrated by a corpse. One comment on this site even claims that this may be the first time such a device was used in films.NOT SO! In 1947, three years before this film's release, a low-budget independent film called "Scared To Death" beat Wilder to it. The film is narrated by the corpse of a young woman lying in a morgue who has been literally "Scared to Death" (hence the title). The picture stars Bela Lugosi &amp; George Zucco (not to mention Nat Pendleton!) This is even more interesting when one considers that Wilder originally wanted SB to open with a scene of recently deceased corpses gathered in a morgue discussing their deaths! I must confess that I have a little suspicion, or fantasy if you will, as to how Wilder arrived at his vision for the opening sequence. After indulging in his little known (until now!) fetish for low-budget horror films (possibly the result of associating with his brother, W. Lee), I believe Wilder was on his way home from the theater musing on what he had just seen when the thought came to him: "Nobody who sees my movies is likely to see THIS! If these guys think opening the movie with narration by one corpse is something, I'll open one with a whole roomful!" Only the killjoys at Paramount Studios prevented Wilder's vision from reaching the screen as he originally intended. Admittedly the scene which ultimately did open the movie is at least equally bizarre and imaginative, as well as being breathtakingly shot.Is there something to the Scared To Death/Sunset Blvd connection? The world may never know! But I have my suspicions...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sunset Blvd. is one of those film that grabs you (by the neck) from the first frame and doesn't let go until the screen goes black at the end. Billy Wilder directs this film with utter brilliance. More Hitchcockian than Hitchcock would have ever had made. The music score of Waxman remains in the ear long after a viewing. The cinematography of Seitz is beautifully crisp and sharp it puts many color films to shame. And it would be impossible to disassociate the film with the lead actress Swanson. So many classic lines but who could forget the greatest last line ever for a movie. It is the greatest Hollywood film about Hollywood ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Billy Wilder's memorable dramatic film, "Sunset Boulevard," was made in 1950.The lead role of Norma Desmond, a washed-up actress, had first been offered to actresses Pola Negri and Norma Shearer before landing in the capable hands of Gloria Swanson. This film heralded the return to the screen by Miss Swanson after many years. It was well worth the wait.Swanson, as Desmond, evokes fear and emotion-complex but yet believable to the audience. A has been actress, who dreams of a comeback, she is mystified by the appearance of William Holden, an apparent gigolo, who made a wrong turn with his car and entered the Desmond world.Norma is needy and emotionally ill. Her butler, played by the excellent Erich Von Stroheim, admits to Holden, that he had been married to Desmond years before. Though the marriage had faltered, he remained to tend to her needs. He even sends her cards with the names of her adoring public-in reality long since gone.Like a magnet, Desmond is attracted and immediately attached to the Holden character. When he ultimately attempts to leave her, she shoots him dead and acts as if this was part of a scene in one of her films. Completely off by film's end, she tells Cecil B. De Mille that she is ready for her take.Be ready for a tale of misfortune, of great acting performances and an attempt to understand the human psyche.</fullReview>

First, Gloria Swanson, a famous silent movie actress, was picked to play the insane and creepy Norma. While Swason herself wasn't like the character herself, she understood her situation so completely that despite the character's hugeness. Even though everything is overexaturated, you see that it is done because of the character's background, a silent movie actor had to act larger than life so that there emotions were conveyed, Norma can't distinguish anything in her life anymore. Swason was able to make the character real. William Holden was having a slump at the time after Golden Boy. He mixed the right amount of sex appeal and cynicism in the role to make it perfect. Erik Von Stroheim, the failed director, was basically playing himself in many ways. His career went down the drain after a failed movie with Gloria Swanson called Queen Kelly. He was the perfect pick for the role and made the character. Nancy Olsen is exactly what she is supposed to be, a fresh face that brings the only heart to the movie. The basic story is a failed writer named Joe hides his car from the repo men in what he thinks is an abandoned house. Norma, a formerly famous actress from the twenties, brings him in because she thinks he is there is bring the coffin for her dead chimp. She keeps him there to rewrite her putrid script called Salome and gradually turns him into her new chimp all the time abetted by her exhusaband, discoverer, butler named max. He becomes a kept man a sexual plaything. He trys to leave, but she attempts suicide and he stays. As her starts to hate himself more, he starts to sneak away to write a screenplay with young Betty Schaefer and falls in love with her. Norma then finds the screenplay, Untitled Love Story and starts to call Betty. Joe overhears and tells Betty to come to the house, tells her what he is and then sends her away. Joe then tries to leave Norma, but she shoots him and he falls into the pool. At this point Norma has completely gone off the deep end and goes down the stairs when police are there thinking that the newsreel cameras are movie cameras filming Salome. As much as this film is about how Hollywood is an awful place, you can still see that there is a love for film in it. Betty and her work with Joe on the screenplay is all sweet, careful and done with love. Norma herself shows love for film, despite how demented she is the final monologue shows a genuine appreciation for film. It shows how the business destroys the film making, but still appreciates it as an art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fast and nasty noir.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Call it noir, call it a thriller, you could even go as far as classing it as a horror. Whatever, it has pretty much everything.From the classic narration to a gripping storyline to a wonderful cast, the viewer is is invited to take a look at the underbelly of Hollywood, a seedier side to the hopes and dreams that the machine feeds off. A down-on-his-luck-writer falls under the guidance of an old female silent movie star, then things start going wrong.You almost feel like a voyeur as you watch the plot unfold, and I cant rate the script higher, Billy Wilder truly was untouchable in his prime.It's a classic, I'd definitely recommend this to anyone with an interest in films about films, hell, I'd recommend it to just about anyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, brilliant score by Franz Waxman - that alone is worth a viewing. Second, this film defies that idea about narration as a crutch to carry a movie which can't resolve itself otherwise. Narration covers almost every inch of this movie, yet works so well you can't wait to hear more of it. The key of course, it the script. Now on to my subject. I'm convinced that the trick to getting the most out of SUNSET BLVD, is not to let it be the first classic movie that you watch. After recently viewing the restored edition on DVD, I realized how much more I understood about this film than I did the first time I'd seen it many years ago. It wasn't because I'd seen it before. It was because I'd seen many early and silent films since. It's within the context of early cinema that SUNSET BLVD really takes on a horrific and realistic tone. Even the casting reflects this, although it's best if I don't comment on that for those who haven't viewed the movie yet. And if you haven't, by all means wait. Watch some major silent films if you can find them. Then watch some early classics from the '30s and '40s. I'm not saying you can't watch SUNSET and think it's great all by itself. But you're really missing much of the bite of the film, I believe, in not getting a bit of an early cinema education beforehand. Once you 'get it', this one really stays with you. For me, that's the best kind of film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So many symbols!! Brilliant!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>****SPOILERS****I had heard about this movie for many years, but never picked it up because I wasn't a William Holden fan. (Needless to say, I AM NOW!!!) My mother and I both love Billy Wilder, so we finally just decided to watch it! After taking a film class this past school year, I had learned how to recognize symbolizism in films, and this film is FULL of symbols- everything from the dead monkey in the beginning, representing Joe of course, to the monkey in Joe's dream, representing him again, to the screenplay he and Betty write-"UNTITLED LOVE STORY" naturally mirrors their's, to the house in comparison to Norma Desmond herself. This is a great film noir, and a must see for film students. All performances were incredible- no one can claw the air like Gloria Swanson, and no one can be sarcastic, confused Joe Gillis like William Holden. Billy Wilder is amazing as usual! This is a haunting film that must be seen more than once! Nobody will be dissapointed after watching this film! 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sunset Blvd's 'narration from the dead' lends a great deal of strength to this Wilder Classic. William Holden (Joe Gillis) leaves us with an answer for a question we haven't asked yet. This type of approach makes understanding the motivation of the characters the prominent goal, rather than guessing the 'ending' as in many other traditional Hollywood films.Joe Gillis is an unemployed writer with seemingly nothing to lose, who becomes involved with the narcissistic and fading silent movie star Norma Desmond. He is cajoled and somewhat spinelessly agrees to work with her on a script to stage her comeback, and later to an increasingly less professional and more male gigolo type of role. The statement of Joe's death at the beginning of the film is explained near the end, though at that point, he has become much less of an important and likable character than he was to begin with.In addition to the unusual narrative, is the choice of casting, as just about all of the characters reflect their own roles in cinematic history. Gloria Swanson (Norma Desmond) was a silent movie era actress who's own life (in some respects) mirrored that of her character's. Erich von Stroheim (Max Von Mayerling) was a brilliant silent move director and actor. Cecil D. Demill played himself, a director that moved on from silent film to talkies and remained prominent.I think that, although this movie was great in many respects, it hasn't aged well because the context in which it was shown originally was lost. In the 1950's names and faces like Cecil Demill, Erich Von Stroheim and Gloria Swanson were much better known, and seeing these people in roles which so mirrored their own would have made for a much more powerful viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy - Contains Spoilers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joe (William Holden) is a young screenwriter down on his luck and is struggling in Hollywood to make ends meet after leaving a news reporting job in Dayton, Ohio to pursue a screenwriting career in Hollywood. While avoiding the repo man Jo make a left turn into a situation he will never forget. The driveway he turns into is none other than the famous silent screen diva Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) who lives in an amazing decrepit Hollywood mansion. Norma Desmond is a once famous movie star who is having problems facing the reality that stardom is no longer part of her life. Norma has been working on a script for a movie that would star her as the lead character propelling her back into her superstar status. Norma hires Jo to refine the script housing him conveniently above the garage. Jo being broke cannot refuse the offer. When water damage forces Jo to move into the main house Jo becomes more tangled in the web of the temptress Norma. Jo becomes a kept man receiving expensive clothes and trinkets from Norma and loses touch with his life as a budding screenwriter. Opportunities for romance are faltered by the meldding Norma with Jo getting fed up with it all wanting to return to Ohio but he does not make it. Norma gets her final close-up from the news reporters who engulf her mansion to capture footage of the once famous movie star turned murderer.The film begins with Jo doing a dead mans float literally, reflecting on what went wrong with his interactions with Norma Desmond. This film is classified as a Film Noir and Gloria Swanson's performance creates an eerie feeling anywhere in or around her mansion that complements her creepy character. The audience can tell Gloria's character has a few screws loose and the anticipation for something bad to happen is apparent throughout the film especially because you know Jo is killed at one point in the film.One of the things I liked the most about this film is the gaudy limo that Norma and Jo are driven around in by Max (Erich Von Stroheim) the butler. The limo is an imported hand made monstrosity that has leopard skin seats. Norma and Jo are driven around like royalty in this limo while people are pointing and laughing at the sheer site of the limo. The funny thing about Max the butler is that he is the director that found Norma as an actress and has accepted a menial job just to be around her. Max is really creepy and seems to being always lurking around the mansion observing what is going on. Some significant facts about this film are for one the film deviated from the classical Hollywood mold of film making while pointing out what happens to stars that are no longer wanted by film makers and the movie viewing public exemplifying the myth of the Hollywood life. Norma Desmond is a delusional actress that has been used up and no longer needed by the Hollywood film makers. Hollywood did not like the way this idea was portrayed and only time could give the credit due for this film. Gloria Swanson was actually a silent movie start in the 20's and was making a comeback starring in Sunset Blvd. The friends that come to play bridge with Gloria's character were also silent film stars. The butler Max Von Mayerling (Erich Von Stroheim) was actually a prominent silent film director.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great, great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a Wilder classic, and that's saying a lot. One of the first movies to really skewer the business end of Hollywood, this film was not popular with the studios or with the "rank and file" in the business. It was nominated for Best Picture but lost to All About Eve, which played on similar themes but with a Broadway setting (safer for a movie to criticise!). The performances are all first rate, especially the leads but also the innocent script-reader, played by ... well, I've forgotten her name. Nancy Olsen? Something wholesome lime that. She was excellent, and this film, if popular, should have made her a Star, but since I can't recall her name, it's somewhat obvious it didn't.Even the supporting cast was great -- C.B. DeMille, as himself, brought a truth to his role, and great sympathy for Norma Desmond, the forgotten diva, probably based on his real-life working relationship with Gloria Swanson, who did indeed do some of her finest work with him, in his pre-Biblical-spectacular days.Any who haven't seen this film HAVE TO, NOW! It's entertaining, suspenseful (even though you know Holden's fate from the first minutes), funny, eerie, and wonderful. The exteriors used for Desmond's mansion have fallen just into the right stage of decay ... the pool looks unkempt and decrepit (even though it was built specifically for the film!) ... the huge 1926 limosine, though gorgeous, is perfectly cast as the kind of limo -- with the leopard skin seats and flower vases -- that Norma Desmond *would* have bought in 1926, when $28,000 was at least ten times harder to earn than it is today.Highly recommended. The DVD Special Edition has lots of nifty gimmicks that add to your appreciation and understanding of this film and its era.</fullReview>

William Holden was decent, if not excellent, as Norma Desmond's young lover/kept man. As Desmond, Gloria Swanson gives her best performance and chews up the scenery as the fading star who lives on past memories and bleak hopes for the future. Nancy Olson, Jack Webb (TV's "Dragnet"), and Erich von Stroheim (as Max, Norma's chauffeur and former husband) round out the excellent cast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lasting classic, with beautiful children</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much has been made of Robert Altman's use of Billy Wilder's masterpiece Sunset Blvd. in his important film The Player. But the film's stylistic inheritors include a host of other pictures, least conspicuous of which is this year's underseen gem Gods and Monsters. It borrows plenty of tricks and tropes from the 1950 film noir tale of obsession and deceit: a body floating in a pool at the end; a fussy and doting servant (with a European accent no less!); and, most importantly, an ageing, narcissistic movie personality, subtly contrasted to a younger, somewhat lost character in need of a change.That these techniques can retain their evocativeness and mystery fifty years after the fact says much not only about Wilder as a director (and of course the film's fabulous cast), but also about the power of films that question the magical but transitory feel of classic American cinema and its personalities. As the Hollywood illusion factory leads its audience further into the nebulous unreal, the need for plays-within-plays, for self-reflective movies-about-movies, is sure to increase.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An audacious look into Hollywood film making and its victims</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An audacious look into Hollywood film making and its victims "Sunset Blvd." is a film about obsession, opportunism and the rise and fall of stars and writers as cogs in the remorseless movie making machine of the Hollywood dream factory. The great Billy Wilder as the director, William Holden, Gloria Swanson and Erich von Stroheim as the principal actors, get their point across so brilliantly in a movie about movie making that it hurts. One of the reasons why it works so well is that "Sunset Blvd." is fiction placed in the real Hollywood, where references are explicitly sought, not hidden: Star director Cecil B. DeMille plays himself, "movie zombies" of times past like Buster Keaton, H.B. Warner and Anna Q. Nilsson have roles equivalent to their importance as movie stars at the time the film was shot, even former celebrated actor/director Erich von Stroheim pretty much plays himself. This lends the film authenticity and weight, sometimes a comedic or an unabashedly cynical touch, but more often revealing shockingly tragic insights in an all too common parallel universe celebrities use to live in - insights that have not lost any relevance to this day: Once caught in a dream world it's difficult to see through the haze of glory and notice that impending doom is just a step away...It was an audacious concept of Billy Wilder to target the film industry within its own medium, right there at those very sound stages where usually the blockbusters were made to rake in the big money and produce celebrities on conveyor belts. The direct assault that "Sunset Blvd." represents for sure did NOT get Wilder the Oscar for Best Picture of 1951. Well, this one has survived them all nevertheless and turned into a timeless classic. It's a film that transcended the Hollywood machinery - well informed, impeccably written by Charles Brackett and Wilder himself, full of verve, innuendo and dark humor, directed with technical proficiency and sense of great storytelling. An ultimate film-experience in the literal sense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Essential Wilder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Billy Wilder had a long and much-honored career as a director. He made some of the best light comedies of his or any other era, but his best and most essential films pushed the boundaries of Hollywood at the time. From The Long Weekend's devastating look at the reality of alcoholism, to the frank discussion of changing societal norms in The Apartment, to making Holmes and Watson homosexual lovers in The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes, Wilder was always breaking new ground in what could be shown on the big screen.Sunset Blvd. may be his crowning achievement in boundary pushing, just because it is one of the most savage attacks on the mythos of Hollywood ever created. He spares no expense to bite the hands that feeds him, digging way deep beyond the glamor and into the reality of stars, former stars, and wannabes. The casting is dead-on, with Gloria Swanson and Ericj von Stroheim in particular--they had both been eaten up by the Hollywood system some time before 1950.Sunset Blvd's self-reflexive deconstruction of Hollywood myth would be enough by itself, but it's actually just one layer of many in a truly great film. It's also a fairly gripping detective story, downright funny in moments, and absolutely horrific in others--Swanson's famous "I'm ready for my closeup, Mr. Demille" in particular can still send shivers down your spine. Besides being one of the all-time great directors, Wilder was a hell of a writer who collaborated with some of the best screenwriters in the business; his long partnership with I.A.L. Diamond is legendary, but this is the last of 13 collaborations with Charles Brackett, who brought just the right amount of pathos and tragedy to the script, no doubt aided by his experience working behind the camera in Hollywood for years.If you are a film buff or a student of Golden Age Hollywood, you will likely add Sunset Blvd. to your list of all-time greatest movies, but you don't have to be a film student to enjoy it either. It's dramatic, funny, chilling, and really just a joy to watch unfold. Many great films of the late 1940s and early 1950s are still enjoyable to this day, but even the best of them can seem somewhat dated today. Not so with Sunset Blvd., which is as potent and stunning as it was in 1950. One of the all-time best films, Sunset Blvd. is highly recommended viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tends towards the melodramatic but is still a cutting and surprisingly fresh judgement on Hollywood and fame</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joe Gillis is a writer with a couple of b movies to his name; he is looking for his break in Hollywood while also avoiding the trouble that comes with the lifestyle he is trying to live. Pulling in off the street into the driveway of one of the fancy old houses on Sunset Boulevard, Joe finds himself called into the home of faded film star Norma Desmond. Joe only enters to get help with his car but ends up staying the night in a spare room only to find all his stuff brought inside the next morning. When the benefit of Norma's wealth sinks in, Joe decides to hang around while still pursuing other options. However Norman's constant delusions of her own fame and importance put strain on their strange relationship.I was not sure what to expect from Sunset Blvd because, as much as I would like to pretend that I have a well-rounded cinematic knowledge, I had not only never seen this film but also didn't know what it was about. I had it in my head that it was some sort of film noir and this was only reinforced with the famous opening with our main character floating dead face down in a pool. With this in my head I was a little disappointed where this "classic film noir" in my head did not materialise. However while I was watching it waiting for my perceptions to be satisfied, I started to take notice of what the film actually was. To my surprise I found a film that cuttingly destroys the myth of Hollywood fame within a dramatic plot. We have both extremes here: Joe frantically trying to get fame and Norma driven mad by her insulated grip on her delusional sense of fame. The ugly nature of both is exposed and used to good effect in a story that isn't as dramatic or tense as I hoped, but still easily held my attention.Wilder's direction is solid as he throws in constant digs at the façade of the famous lifestyles in the movie industry of the day and even by today's standards it is pretty sharp in its tone. Interesting to wonder how it must have been received within the industry itself back in the day because it is not flattering to say the least. The central relationship is the focal point of the film and Wilder never allows us to see even a hint of reality about it ? both are in it for a neediness and longing for something out of reach that can be smelt in the air anytime sufficient quantities of wannabes are gathered together in one place. The cast get this well, although their ability to totally translate it isn't totally successful in my opinion. Holden is perhaps a bit too restrained and I would have liked to see more self-disgust rise uncontrollably to the surface across his performance. That said he does provide a reasonably balanced focus to the film and his performance is solid. Swanson hams it up like an old pro and, although at times I had my doubts, it mostly works really well because she is convincingly deluded and isolated by her wealth and by the inflated idea of who she is based on a perception of herself not shared by anyone. It is an interesting character piece and, from my understanding, very relevant in a business where the next big star is always round the corner with fickle audiences and studios. The only reservation I have is how much her performance towers over the film but this is only a minor problem and it is telling how many lines and scenes I already know second-hand before I even watched it. Von Stroheim is good value in a supporting role, while Olson is also pretty good. Surprising but very relevant to see Keaton, DeMille, Warner and others in cameos as themselves.Overall this was not what I expected but, once I settled into watching it for what it was rather than what I thought it was going to be, I found a surprisingly sharp and fresh film. Wilder directs scenes with style and flair but it is the cutting judgement on fame and the nature of Hollywood that sticks in the memory. It does tend towards the melodramatic and perhaps it is one of those films (like The Player) that will mean the most to those who can relate to the world it is set in, but it is still an engaging and enjoyable film to those of us lucky enough to watch from the outside.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whole exceeds parts - but still to be recommended</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like many things, some movies can be described as a "whole which exceeds the sum of its parts." This film is one of those - and "parts" can reference both the general description as in the term, as well as those "parts" played by the cast members. Gloria Swanson overplays her character (nothing new for Ms. Swanson), as one would expect from the faded, silent-screen, delusional actress she portrays - and in view of the fact that overacting was more prevalent in the era during which this picture was filmed, especially those in the film noir genre. However, Gloria not only chews the scenery like an avid beaver, but like a whole colony of them. Erich Von Stroheim looks as though at any moment he will be joined by Dr. Frankenstein and Igor. William Holden (outstanding in so many roles, from "The Moon is Blue" and "Stalag 17" onward), and Nancy Olson, make June and Ward Cleaver, or the Bradys, look like deep, mysterious couples. But in spite of all of this, the movie is, as a whole, interesting and fascinating, not just when viewed as it would have been contemporaneously, but as a true relic of a film now over a half-century old. Whether this is because of - or in spite of - the performances is the question to be answered. I believe it is the latter, but whichever, it is well worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent satire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hollywood doesn't produce many effective satires, much less an effective satire about itself. This movie is very effective. I would rank this with "Dr. Strangelove" and "The Manchurian Candidate" as one of the greatest satires. Wilder is able to keep a balance between absurd parody and intelligent commentary. He very evocatively portrays the corrupting influence of the Hollywood establishment.All the actors are perfectly suited for their roles. Holden is great as the desperate and ultimately lonely writer Joe Gillis. He is willing to do most anything to keep alive his hopes of becoming a great screenwriter. He remains sympathetic of Norma (as I do), and yet disgusted by her (as I do). Swanson is almost perfect as Norma Desmond. She is grandiose, grotesque, and pitiful. She is able to disguise her true emotion with over-exaggerated melodrama.Several times on the DVD it is noted that Wilder is not considered a great visual director. I think his visuals are above par, and very effective. The scene in which Norma and Joe are watching her silent picture is a good example. She stands up into the projector light with a Gothic, almost surreal appearance. It is as though she exists merely as a two-dimensional projection. In her mind, there is no world outside of the silver screen. The New Year's Eve party is another. There is an overhead shot of Norma and Joe dancing on the tiled floor. You see Norma and Joe all alone amongst the opulence of the house. They really only have each other. As we see, they cannot exist without each other. It is just them and no one else. This is one great movie</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wilder's best, Holden's best, one of the best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Billy Wilder's classic SUNSET BLVD. is probably Hollywood's best self-loathing look at itself. William Holden is great as a struggling screenwriter running from his creditors who encounters has-been silent film star Gloria Swanson (who is pretty much playing herself in the guise of Norma Desmond). Her tragic character and her decaying palace of a home are very heavy and very dark, the kind of thing that only a great comedy directer like Billy Wilder could give us. Erich Von Strohiem appears as Swanson's butler who was a silent film director (as the actor was in real life). The truth of these performances is part of what makes the film's statement about Hollywood so delightfully bitter. Watching this film will prove to anyone that the hype and reputation are entirely justified. The film viewer of today can appreciate the connection to David Lynch's supposed homage MULHOLLAND DR. about another dark tale associated with another L.A. street. See both films, but see this one first.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best Hollywood movie about Hollywood.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had two friends in college whose movie opinions I took seriously. I asked them both which movie they thought was most ahead of its time. One said Citizen Kane (predictable) and the other said Sneakers (laudable but borderline dubious). My vote goes to Sunset Blvd. This movie would eventually have been made, in another era of Hollywood -- even Altman was praised for The Player, but it was pretty much a metaphysical takeoff of Sunset Blvd. And, honestly, who doesn't want to be William Holden?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>IMDb Top 250: 32I'm going to get this out of the way: it's hard for me to formulate coherent thoughts about Sunset Blvd. If you haven't yet seen the score, I loved it. LOVED it, like one of the few 10's I award love it. But it's a difficult film to describe, you simply have to experience this one-of- a-kind masterpiece.Sunset Blvd. follows hack (love that description) writer Joe Gilles, in the gutter, as he finds himself in the lap of eccentric silent star Norma Desmond, who is planning a comeback ("It's a RETURN! I hate that word") and wants Joe's aid. In a sentence, the film shows that relationship. But it's so much more than that. You see right from the start, beginning with very cool credits, it's also a murder mystery to constantly think about. It's also famously a look at Hollywood, post- sound transition. Where to start? The acting. Our narrator and protagonist(?) Joe is the cool, straight man in this odd tale, but like everything, he isn't a perfect person. His performance is however. We're never sure what side of the game he's playing, but he sure looks like he does.Joe may be the protagonist but Norma Desmond is the star. Up until today, if someone asked me to name an amazing female performance, I couldn't. But Gloria Swanson, in a role much like her life (minus the crazy) fully realized this intriguing character. She's a woman who can't let go of the past, someone unable to look forwards. we all know someone like that. And her "development"- she's a silent star alright.The whole thing has a creepiness to it, and I can draw several connections between this and 'Psycho'. Creepy isn't quite the word, 'queer' is a little more fitting. But it's unsettling, and a large chunk of that is Max, Norma's butler. His constant presence is freaky, his loyalty scary. Erich von Stroheim, a silent director, is perfectly cast in this role, even if he didn't like it much himself.It's remarkable how this echoed real life. Gloria Swanson plays a character who mirrors her own life, and is accompanied by one of her former directors. Cecil B DeMille, famed director, plays himself. Numerous other cameos happen as well, include one of my favourite scenes, where Norma plays bridge with other silent stars, namely Buster Keaton, who actually speaks. It's as though this really could've happened, these people really lived among the stars of the day. A film about writers has to have good writing, and Sunset Blvd. delivers in script, cinematography, and all technical aspects of film. The mansion is extravagant, a worthy choice for the Set Design Oscar. Also the music, while not iconic or even having a main theme, wonderfully plays along with the film,adding the extra level to a magnificent film.The plot wraps up eventually, and if you didn't know it was coming from the start then it would be a very strange finale indeed. All I'll say is it puts the narration in a different perspective, and the film scene (and line) are strange, creepy, and just excellent.There you have it, my glowing response to Sunset Blvd.There's only one thing: I can't identify a genre. A drama is too broad, a noir would be a little off, and it doesn't quite fit the bill to be a thriller. But maybe that's the spark that makes the film so great- there's nothing quite like it, and while it's timeless, there probably never will be anything like it again. 9.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the first films to truly shed light on the true nature of world behind cinema was Sunset Boulevard (Billy Wilder, 1950). It was already the tendency of film noir to be rather bleak in its portrayal of human nature, but this movie almost seemed to point the gun at itself. Despite a few critics, the movie is hailed for its uncompromising tale that of which concerns the two leads, William Holden as the out-of-luck screenwriter Joe Gillis and the fallen star Norma Desmond, played by Gloria Swanson. The grisly story that follows is one of desperation, deceit and of course twisted love. The film achieves this thru its ominous film noir style-cinematography and well done characterization.As the story progresses, it crushes and grinds her dreams without a second glance. The real side of the Hollywood Star System is that actors and actresses all have specific niches, and once that role has been completed and used up, their use usually comes to an end. After a certain extent of glamour, no matter how beautiful the reign, it can never really last forever. The film also displays the cold reality of the world, through the natural tendency of human beings to forsake others. Only in madness, did anyone turn their cameras back on Norma Desmond, and only in death did anyone truly miss the one-shot writer Joe Gillis. Not only that, but the love story between him and Betty Schaefer (played by Nancy Olson) ends rather sadly, before he even meets his own more pressing tragedy. As always in film noir, fate is cruel and seemingly random. It is thru the beautiful cinematography and shadowy characters that Billy Wilder uncovers the truth of a world that before had seemed purely idealistic and welcoming.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>10 Stars Well Earned</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are many films which have such high praise and rating. All I can find myself doing is wondering- why? 'Sunset Blvd.' is not one of them. In fact, it earns every star on the meter and beyond.The female lead is screen legend Gloria Swanson. She was one of the few who made the transition from silent to sound with success. From working with Rudolph Valentino to classic director Billy Wilder, no one knows the business better than Swanson. It's no wonder why she was perfect for the role. She is chilling, even when she doesn't move a finger. She portrays the typical has-been of Hollywood attempting a comeback, despite not being a has-been herself."I AM big. It's the pictures that got small."Many narrators often ruin a film, but the narration by lead actor William Holden meshes perfectly within the storyline. His character is a screenwriter waiting for a big break. An ironic pairing from both ends of showbusiness. Swanson's role wants him to help edit her latest script in order to help her return to the silver screen. She is disturbed, going so far as a suicide attempt to manipulate him to stay with her.Cecil B. DeMille also makes a cameo. For any of you too young or not familiar with classic cinema, he is known for directing eighty films, such as 'The Ten Commandments', 'Samson &amp; Delilah', and did many silent films earlier in his career with Gloria Swanson herself.'Sunset Blvd.' is timeless. Even though years change, showbusiness doesn't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gloria Swanson Is Creepy...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS AHEADBeautiful!Sunset Blvd. is a fantastic movie about madness, obsession, living in a world of illusions, and getting away with it...Swanson is superb in her role of the bitter Norma Desmond; a true disturbing character - that gesture she makes with her hand when she's seeing old silent pictures with Joe Gillis is creepy. She's crazy, there's no other word to describe a reclusive forgotten star who thinks she's still adored by millions of fans, although the only fan mail she receives comes secretly from her butler, Max - played by silent pictures director Eric Von Stronheim - who's very essential to keeping poor Norma in her locked world of illusions.Usually, in this type of stories, the character living in the world of illusions is being set up for a day of reckoning; such does not happen - nothing ever shatters her fabricated world, whether thanks to Max's efforts, or because Norma has been so immersed in it she can't see past the lies and into reality. The victim of this is Joe Gillis, the gigolo mediocre screenwriter who takes advantage of her plans to make a 'comeback,' yet becomes the most determined character in bringing Norma back to reality. Brilliantly played by William Holden, Gillis is a fascinating character in himself; he's very arrogant and hot-headed at the beginning, yet he grows a lot in the movie, thanks especially to his relationship with Betty (Nancy Olson) he's really a tragic character: he's torn between his love for Betty and Norma's obsession for him - surprisingly he shows a great humanity in resisting his love towards Betty because she's engaged with his friend, and in abandoning Norma when he could be using her fortune for his luxury. This is where the tragedy in his is revealed: such goodness is not rewarded, instead he's murdered by the crazed Norma, nothing surprising since he tells that much in the first three minutes of the movie.Which reminds me - the use of flashback is outstanding: Gillis telling the story from his dead point of view leading up to the point where he's murdered and a bit beyond after that, is simply original: Billy Wilder had a great idea here, which would later be borrowed in American Beauty.Some things about this movie don't make sense to me though - I can't understand why everyone says this is such a biting satire at Hollywood. All I see is people with lots of common sense and seedy characters in the most unexpected places. So there's a producer who rejects a script because it's mediocre - showing producers do care about quality and not just profit - an unscrupulous mediocre screenwriter - strange to see this figure being the 'villain' - and a crazed retired actress. Some say Norma Dresmond is the image of a Hollywood that treats people like trash - it loves them when they're great, hates them when they're not necessary anymore. I don't know, but you don't let a blind man drive a bus, do you? Why should you let a silent picture actress work for talking pictures?Watching any of the pre-1927 productions, one can see how bad the actors were back then - all the exaggerated gestures and the overacting; talkies required a different, better type of acting that apparently Norma didn't have or understand, and I can't really blame Hollywood for wanting the best actors in their movies. I'd also want the best pilot in charge of an airplane I was flying on.I also can't see how Gillis' opportunism couldn't be told in any other context other than Hollywood - people taking advantage of others is a story that can be told anywhere. To me, it's just Wilder writing about what he knows, and that's Hollywood, and it's an interesting look at the city of dreams.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was the best of Gloria Swanson ever. Sunset Blvd was the best dark comedy meets real life picture I have ever seen bar none. Norma Desmond aging has been actress long lost from the modern stage sits going ever so quietly insane in a huge mansion that serves as here self imposed creaking prison complex. Surrounded by lavish furnishings in a one time architecturally masterful home that while still unique and beautiful are now aged crumbling threadbare relics of a bygone era much as is their mistress. Poor dear Norma has but one fan left an equally pathetic hanger on. A man in name only who clings to aging film star Norma Desmond hoping his acting career gets a much needed jump start. They both use each other much the way a Remora clings near the mouth of a shark in hopes of enjoying bits of food that steam past as the shark feeds. Norma whose star has long ago cooled into a pile of solid iron covering an even colder neutronium core has no life giving food to share with her mercenary paramour. So both Norma Desmond and, her toy boy do what all parasites in co-dependant relationships do eventually.... They feed off each other and, last one left standing in this case gets an imaginary close up taken by non-existent camera's as crowds of adoring fans cheer if only between Norma's ears. Her savvy bo has taken a dip in the pool which he entered as he did the relationship with Norma eyes wide open blinded by his lust to what she was.This was an awesome story quite ahead of its time. Brutally funny but real and eerie. This one makes you think even when you do not want to. There is a little Norma Desmond in us all. The want of things out of reach that lust to have just a little more time in the sun before our inevitable twilight engulfs us. Life for Norma Desmond is a shroud that only she does not see she is wearing it.This is a must own DVD or video get the DVD when it becomes available.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm ready for my review, Mr. Wilder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We've seen many movies about Hollywood's emptiness, unseemliness, and other undesirable qualities. "Sunset Boulevard" is one of the best. Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) is a faded movie star in a relationship with reporter Joe Gillis (William Holden). Through his relationship with her, Joe not only sees Hollywood for what it really is, but he also comes to understand Norma for who she is.Billy Wilder always has a great story to tell, and this is no exception. The light/dark contrast in Norma's mansion could be a metaphor: Norma is an old movie star living in modern Hollywood. But as Norma reminds Joe: "I'm still big. It's the pictures that got small." Outstanding.Erich Von Stroheim also turns in an ample performance as Norma's servant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest American Film of All Time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SUNSET BOULEVARD, this writer's favorite American film and an ageless, deathless and eternal classic about Hollywood and the victims of fame and unrequited love. Gloria Swanson's bravura moment, the bravest role of her career, is positively mesmerizing. The script crackles with brilliance in every line (so many unforgettable statements and remarks about the star system) that it packs a whallop as no other film can or ever has. William Holden is perfectly cast as the definitive writer-turned-gigolo (the role was originally meant for Montgomery Clift) and Erich Von Stroheim gives yet another star turn as her manservant, Max. There simply are not enough superlatives in the English language to convey the power and dark poetry of this quintessential cinematic classic. Franz Waxman provides one of his greatest scores here. The injustice of the time was that ALL ABOUT EVE stole nearly every Oscar this film deserved to have, but clearly illustrates what sour grapes Hollywood's elite felt after this movie hit the screens!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A screenwriter who seems to have lost his knack and fallen into money problems winds up in an old movie star's home while running from debt collectors. She then gets him to write what is to be her tour-de-force comeback into the Hollywood spotlight. But things are not quite so simple...This is really one of those films that has aged. Meaning, some people will appreciate it, but others will find it hell to sit through. Painfully slow at times and just plain old aged it really takes a good understanding that this is an older film to appreciate it. The central message - a look at the Hollywood film making system, which caused loads of controversy at the time of initial release - remains interesting, especially for movie enthusiasts and film makers, but if you are just looking for a good classic thriller from director Billy Wilder, "Double Indemnity" would be a safer choice.After the intriguing opening, many of the scenes in the center film drag on and the atmosphere is much less than desired from what you'd expect from such a film. And that overall makes it not very engaging, though in parts, it remains poignant and is overall daring for a studio produced picture. 6/10Not Rated - has a scene of violence (not graphic) and some mature themes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At a Sunset Boulevard mansion, the body of Joe Gillis floats in the swimming pool. In a flashback, Joe relates the events leading to his death.Six months earlier, down-on-his-luck screenwriter Joe tries selling Paramount Pictures producer Sheldrake on a story he submitted. Script reader Betty Schaefer harshly critiques it in Joe's presence, unaware that he is the author. Later, while fleeing from repossession men seeking his car, Joe turns into the driveway of a seemingly deserted mansion. After concealing the car, he hears a woman calling him, apparently mistaking him for someone else. Ushered in by Max, her butler, Joe recognizes the woman as long-forgotten silent film star Norma Desmond. Learning he is a writer, she asks his opinion of a script she has written for a film about Salome. She plans to play the role herself in a comeback. Joe finds her script abysmal, but flatters her into hiring him as a script doctor.Moved into Norma's mansion at her insistence, Joe resents but gradually accepts his dependent situation. He sees that Norma refuses to face the fact that her fame has evaporated and learns the fan letters she still receives are secretly written by Max, who tells him Norma is subject to depression and has made suicide attempts.Norma lavishes attention on Joe and buys him expensive clothes. At her New Year's Eve party, he discovers he is the only guest and realizes she has fallen in love with him. He tries to let her down gently, but she slaps him and retreats to her room. Joe visits his friend Artie Green to ask about staying at his place. At Artie's party, he again meets Betty, who he learns is Artie's girl. Betty thinks a scene in one of Joe's scripts has potential, but Joe is uninterested. When Joe phones Max to have him pack his things, Max tells him Norma cut her wrists with his razor. Joe returns to Norma.</fullReview>

Hollywood Boulevard brilliantly portrays the harsh and brutal nature of Hollywood. It is pathetic seeing Norma Desmond, sitting in the dark watching her old films, but it is also poignant and sad too. She was once a massive Hollywood star, but now everybody has even forgotten that she existed. To be launched into fame and then to have this fame taken away from you would be difficult to deal with for anyone let alone a has-been actress like Norma Desmond.Read my full review here: http://goo.gl/GpaqvS</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Stars are ageless, aren't they?" The glitz and glamor of old Hollywood. The Lights, the Sounds, the Cameras- what happens when they've dissipated as the Stars of yesteryear before them? Sunset Boulevard tells a darkly satirical, yet poignant story of the once-great Norma Desmond- a washed up actress of the silent film era. A woman so consumed with delusion and narcissism that nothing in this world, nor any other could convince her of anything but her own self importance. She's a star, after all. Ironic as it may seem, Norma herself is not the fulcrum of the film, but rather one side of a dichotomy- the conflict between a bygone age, and the modern. In this place of the middle, torn between the two is our protagonist Joe Gillis- a struggling screenwriter trying to strike it big, who happens upon our old Hollywood queen. What comes next is a story that may ring true of many stars who have faded into obscurity- the paralyzing stigma of being a has been, the endless planning of an ever-just-out-of-reach comeback, and the whispers and rumors of days gone by- that yearning for the spotlight, the power, and the attention they once commanded. With a fantastic twist and slick direction, Billy Wilder delivers a hit in this timeless classic. It remains relevant and applicable still, even in today's world, sixty years removed from the original premiere. Sunset Boulevard is a narrative in how fleeting fame can be, but how the effects of it may be everlasting- in both the public eye, and in private. After all, the stars are ageless.</fullReview>

Slowly but surely, he becomes her kept man.Gloria Swanson gives an iconic performance for the ages. Her scenes on the Paramount lot are riveting. William Holden is great. It's a fascinating dissection of Hollywood and the fame obsession. There are a few moments of over-acting by some of the other actors which is weird since the movie is about the passing of the silent era acting.

		<fullReview>This movie is a great character study and serves as an insightful look at the aftermath of the monumental transition between silent and sound in the film-making industry. The only major hang up to be found is an issue of presentation which, to me at least, doesn't do too much to tarnish the film.The acting is great across the board, with the standout of course being Gloria Swanson. Somewhat overshadowed by her is William Holden in the lead who, despite Gloria's powerful presence, gives a very watchable and nuanced performance. His role is one which is easily related to by the viewer and acts as a perfect catalyst for the feelings of the audience. The decisions made and the actions taken by Joe seem very true to life for just about anyone and the bridge that the character creates between the absurdness of the story and the audience is invaluable. Gloria Swanson does a spectacular job acting completely insane. Hers is a performance equally as invaluable as Holden's and is equally as layered. Given that the story is centered around her it is only appropriate that Norma Desmond's character is the most fascinating and is made more engrossing as the film progresses as the unraveling story of her past adds more and more depth.The rest of the actors do very well with Erich Von Stroheim providing a performance nearly as engrossing as Gloria Swanson's. The movie is impressively shot and the story well written/acted. The only issue I found was the narration by Holden as Joe. The remarks that he makes often seem redundant and the visuals within the film are frequently sufficient in getting the message across. That is not to say that the narration is entirely damaging, as it effectively expresses thoughts which the main character often cannot voice given the context of the story. A little less may have served the presentation though.Overall, a great film and entirely enjoyable to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have always had a soft spot for films about filming, and another for Hollywood satires, so is it any wonder I thoroughly enjoyed Sunset Blvd.?Other than the personally-compelling story, there were some great shots in the film, most notably the shot of the body from inside the pool (in 'Sunset Blvd.: A Look Back you can learn that is was shot with a mirror while keeping the temperature of the water at 40° to keep the distortion to a minimum). The sets are great and really shine in the deep-focus cinematography that reminded me of Citizen Kane.Gloria Swanson plays her role with authenticity, it was a version of herself she played, as her last great role stemmed from the thirties. The fragment shown in the film is Queen Kelly, directed by Erich Von Stroheim, another actor whose role was close to reality. Above all Wilder showed a cynicism far ahead of its time, sure it was already present in films such as The Life and Death of 9413: a Hollywood Extra in the late twenties, but such films were not made by the great directors of Hollywood itself. This sharp depiction of the darker sides of Hollywood, i.e. the corruption, the exploitation of people, the Machiavellian attitude towards personal gain, is a big part why this film did not win the Oscar for best film in 1950. The reasons why the academy disliked it are the same reasons why I love it.I can finally see why David Lynch referenced this film in the beginning of Mulholland Dr..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From a writing standpoint, this movie is phenomenal. I can understand why this film would be called one of the greatest films ever. It has a lot going for it. However, its slow pacing can often effect my enjoyment of it.After a young screenwriter gets a flat tire, he winds up in the home of a once famous silent actor named Norma Desmond and she ensnares him to have him bring one of her scripts to the big screen and to make her famous again.Old film stars are an interesting topic. Its plot provokes sort of a haunting nightmare for everyone who wants to become a star. Its characters are memorable because of their execution. Norma Desmond is a character who slowly loses her insanity as it is slowly proved that reviving a silent film star isn't exactly the easiest thing to do. The ending shows you just how far she will go and it leaves some haunting thoughts in your head after you watch it. On the other hand though, I did feel that it was a little bit unneeded at first. I didn't feel like it was too necessary but that thought died off quickly.Joe Gillis is a character that we kind of feel sorry for. He stumbles upon her house on accident and he starts to feel that he's stuck at her house. You really can't spoil the ending since it is revealed to us how the film ends at the beginning but it makes us feel sad for what happens to Joe because he was almost able to go back to his old life. However, I can understand why the movie would choose to end like that because it makes it more clear what its message is and it explains to us more about the meaning behind the movie.The film's instrumental soundtrack is neither amazing nor bad. It just serves as a catchy soundtrack and it doesn't expand too much more than that. It isn't that impressive but I didn't notice it to be a distraction so I can't say that it diminished the movie's quality in any way.The acting is great on all parts. Gloria Swanson plays a once popular silent film star who suffers from depression and has made several suicide attempts in the past. Her acting doesn't get too amazing until the final few minutes where she is able to convey several mods at once. However, she does a thoroughly convincing role throughout the movie. William Holden's acting remains above average throughout the film. I can't say that he had a moment which truly stood out from the rest but he is still able to convey an ensnared man who is trying to keep the reality of her fame a secret pretty well. He did a good job also.For some reason, the most common complaint I seem to have about a movie is that it will have slow pacing which can bring me out of a movie to a varying degree and it can play a part in whether I'd want to watch it again. The issue I have with this movie is its talk-heavy dialogue. Some may not mind this but I grew eager for the movie to pick up its pace several times in the movie. Some movies are able to get around this issue though like "Russian Ark". Although it had slow pacing, it interested me because I love history and art. Also, it had superb cinematography and lighting. Some movies are successfully able to get around this problem. However, I lost much of my attention near the middle of the film because it did not provide a way to make me not mind its slow pace.Despite the slow pacing though, this movie provides a great look on Hollywood and it can be surprisingly pretty upsetting at the ending (in a good way). I can understand why many consider this to be a masterpiece and I can see why it would be considered to be one of the greatest movies ever. It is a great movie, but it could have been much better if the pacing made it an easier film to watch and enjoy. Despite this though, it's still a great movie which has a lot going for it and it is a must-see if you're trying to catch up on classic works of cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Swanson's Closeup.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sunset Boulevard (1950): Dir: Billy Wilder / Cast: William Holden, Gloria Swanson, Erich von Stroheim, Nancy Olson, Cecil B. DeMille: Absolute masterpiece representing a place where dreams happened for one Gloria Swanson who was a big silent star but now her fame is fading and she dreams her life away with private screenings of her own films. Narrated by William Holden who is sheltered at her mansion in return for a screenplay that will resurrect her. Intriguing setup rich in dialogue and plot turns that result in the ultimate revelation in the conclusion. Billy Wilder does an excellent job at presenting ill fate Hollywood careers due to technology. Wilder previously made an entirely different film called Double Indemnity and both share a common theme of dominating femme figure. Swanson delivers a riveting performance of a woman illusion to total madness. Holden feels his talent trapped and seeks escape through an outside project. Erich von Stroheim is the ex-husband who lives to revive her past. He will be instrumental in assisting her concluding performance and famous last words. Nancy Olson plays a screenwriter unable to unlock Holden's thoughts. She is engaged yet will face Holden's forced lifestyle in blunt terms. Great cameo performances by film personalities portraying themselves, including famed director Cecil B. DeMille. It is the dark side of show business where stars flicker no more.

		<fullReview>Before I watched Sunset Blvd I knew it was an old 1950's classic in black and white, and I was slightly reluctant to put it on only because I was feeling a bit tired and wasn't sure if I was in the mood for something that required deep attention. But I was wrong, Sunset Blvd was actually a very easy to watch movie, it did not have an overly complicated plot. As soon as the movie began my eyes were glued to the television and my brain easily absorbed every single detail of the plot. What I also liked about it was that they kept it to a nice length, only 1 hour 50 minutes long. A similar film that I recently watched is All About Eve, which ran for 2 hours and 20 minutes, I felt that was a bit too long and they dragged out much longer than they should have. Sunset Blvd went by at a much more pleasant pace. In other words there was never a moment in which I zoned out. The characters in it were unique and intriguing. But what I liked most of all about the film was the screenplay, which is slightly ironic given that the film is from the point of view of a screenwriter. The one liners that the characters come out with are so artistically, smooth and poetic. This type of film writing is an art that has been lost in todays making of pictures. The acting performances was some of the best I've witnessed in a while, especially from Gloria Swanson. How she didn't win an Oscar for it I do not know. One thing I will say is that if you're not a fan of old fashioned films in general then you may not enjoy it because after all the film is in black and white and was made in the early 1950's. But you never know Sunset Blvd could be the exception.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An exquisitely creepy, and alluring portrayal of '50s Hollywood. Must see.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sunset Blvd.'s appeal lies in its exquisitely creepy and alluring portrayal of '50s Hollywood. Its timelessness and ability to retain relevance more than sixty years after its release is especially ironic considering the plight of its lead, the eccentric faded silent-film star, Norma who despite her desperate and obsessive attempts to cling to her former stardom, remains obsolete. The unique ambiguity between reality and fiction achieved via the casting choices adds depth and allows for audiences to look past the illusion of the glitz and magic of the industry and witness a story of failure that was, at the time, uncharacteristic to the typical film climate of Hollywood escapist pictures. The mordant wit and lavish, Gothic set design are aspects that add to the overall tone of this gorgeously grotesque classic. Both Norma and Gillis are outsiders, teetering on the edge of obscurity, caught in the claw-like grip of hopeless need and desire to make it in the industry. Wilder's film captures the callous nature of the studio system, through the narrative of Gillis and the investigation surrounding his mysterious murder. MGM executive, Louis B. Mayer's reported disgust at this film had much to do with the belief that the movie was a disgrace to Hollywood. Sunset Blvd.'s portrayal of Norma was terribly offensive to the industry, which "relied heavily on the power of illusion" (Culbertson 2006). Mayer's revulsion must only have been magnified as the film went on to win three Oscars and an enduring place in Hollywood history.</fullReview>

This is a well-written movie about the dark side of Hollywood; a failed screenwriter down to his last dime and a movie queen has-been in denial, both pinning their hopes on each other. It's a hard movie, extremely cynical and very sad. But also sincerely gripping until the very end (even though the ending is shown in the opening shots. It's not a spoiler in the vein of Rosebud or Keyser Söze - the real lure is to see how it happened. And it's a knock-out story.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two lost epochs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sunset Boulevard is a beautiful film about a lost time. Two lost times actually. One, the silent movies' Hollywood, the years of glamour in which Norma Desmond lives. The second lost time is for us that 50s Hollywood, the violins playing behind the actors' old American accent, the complete lack of computer effects, the movies that try to catch you not with eye-filling visuals, but with moving stories, even if self-referencing to Hollywood's industry.Gloria Swanson deserves special reference. Her performance is quite amazing, with that accent that reminds me of Cruella de Vil when she says "Anita, daaahrling..." in 101 Dalmats. So much glamour, so delicate moves, all mixed up with terrible psychological distress, craziness, spotlights overdose. The final scene, with Norma Desmond walking down the stairs, is simply one of the most memorable final scenes I've seen in quite a while.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a film. Written and directed by Billy Wilder, this film encapsulates the mania of Hollywood through three characters. This film is fantastic for how well it has aged, not at all like Norma Desmond - still true to it's themes of obsession and self-image. Time for my close-up, DeMill!In this story we're introduced to hack screenwriter Joe Gillis. With only a few B movies to his name, he struggles to put out scripts from his Hollywood apartment. Being chased down by the insurance company for late car payments, he decides to hide his car in the worst possible house he could've found in the hills, the house of Norma Desmond.A great film about film-making, this is one of Billy Wilder's best. It makes satire of the business of Hollywood tying an intriguing plot, bittersweet, funny, and reminiscent of an era. Dealing with many intra-personal problems, you will find either great comedy withing this film or great drama. This film is fantastic, and if you haven't seen it, you're doing yourself a great disservice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought that Sunset Blvd. was very intriguing the way it was filmed and the was it was scripted. Personally, "film noir style" doesn't appeal to me very much but the character development and plot made it worth the while. Norma's crazy, huge ego minded personality set in the rustic mansion contrasted with Joe's low income, easily persuaded (by money) character along with his romance with Betty sustained my interest for sure. The film makers really hyperbolized each of the characters most prominent traits, such as Normas batty behavior and Betty's soft, aspiring personality. I think this type of scripting brought the film to life and made up for the lack of colour. (of course, colour wasn't possible at the time) What added to the film was the symbolism throughout, and the irony of Norma being played by Gloria Swanson, previous silent film star. Overall, I found the film was very well rounded in the sense that it wasn't just a love story, but a clever, witty, dark, and emotionally touching piece made in a time where this was very hard to find.</fullReview>

It used symbolic representation to the limit, and the characters all seemed original- I liked how all of these characters had individuality and how these characters kind of changed over time as the movie went on, as a result of inner and outer conflict. I also liked the complex plot of the movie, as well as how the story untied over time. The introduction had a pretty strong impression, and getting to know the behind story of it was very interesting for me. I thought using the imagery of old and young throughout the plot had a great influence in the progress of the story, both in the characters and the plot. Overall, I was very satisfied with this film.

Gloria Swanson is at the top of her career as one of the bigger-than-life characters of the movies. Usually, when I watch classics from the early part of the century, I can usually appreciate the historical values and innovations in those movies, but they don't usually blow me away like Sunset Boulevard did. I was speechless for most of the movie and the ending, although I knew about it, still amazed me. There are some humorous moments like who the coffin was for in the beginning. William Holden played the Joe Gillis role. Erich Von Stroheim played butler, Max and sweet Nancy Olson played Betty Schaefer.Overall I liked this movie and considering the age it is a timeless classic</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh what a tragedy that was not supposed to be there.It's a kind of movie that you can call cult because there were many such kind of movies later. Where, a man or woman wants to redeem their career or try hard to look younger or anything like that. To name a few, I get "American Beauty" and that woman in "Requiem for a Dream" in my mind. Where people want to go back to their younger days and just want to start again. Now, this not just the story of a woman trying to get young, it's also about a man who wants to make his career. It begins with this man, accidentally driving into this woman's mansion and just trying to act as a busy man. Now, as many other Billy Wilder movies, it starts as an accident that happens between two people, here it's between this writer and a middle aged woman. Now, that is where the film takes on, and that is the what gets us interested. This movie has a fine performance by Joe (William Holden) and other actors but it is Norma Desmond (played by Gloria Swanson) that this film belongs to and wow, she has made it her own by bringing a certain kind of wicked insanity that is rare even in today. Yes, many have tried to emulate this kind of wicked emotion as done by Swanson, but I believe she was just great at it. And hey, Gloria Swanson played out an near autobiographical role here as she had worked with Cecil DeMille in those silent pictures in true life and played that very character who just wants to get back to cameras. Wow, Billy Wilder has got the right woman as Norma Desmond.You have to watch this movie for more than one reason, it is believable, intriguing and yes it has a kind of suspense that will make us sit and see who is that man and what he is up to?. The protagonist here is not that lady though, it's the man and this is his story. The writing is simple yet great and each scene is lit well and shot well so cinematography is good in here. The audio, yes it's mostly dialogue with the big background suspenseful score filling a few gaps, music is good too. Having said all that, it's not my kind of drama and it is not my favourite yet. Though, I give it 4/5, I am not sure if I am going to sit through this movie one more time.</fullReview>

However, until the audience gets to the end, they are given some clues to what kind of a woman this "Madame" is. She is a worn out star who is 50 and lives alone in a house which reminds us of Ms.Havisham from Charles Dickens' "Great Expectations". This bit of comparison is actually made by the narrator of the movie who is also one of the main characters, who is also Madame's platonic crush.The movie actually starts off with a death scene and then is narrated by the victim himself. Then goes back 6 months and is oddly narrated by the dead character. Joe is a writer in Hollywood who is after his Hollywood dream. However, he has realized that it is just a dream for him unlike Betty who is a script reader who has a passion for her job and later for Joe. They start working on a script together while Joe is in a complicated relationship with Madame. Things get tragic in the end because the movie ends in a traumatic way for Betty and Joe. Madame on the other hand, is just starting her own movie which Max is directing for her.This movie does the justice of putting a few smiles on the viewers face. In fact, in the end when you feel like you should be crying, you end up smiling because of the ridiculous feelings Madame and Max make you go through.So if you would like to see a fake movie within a real movie then this 1950s wonder is the right "picture" for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sunset Boulevard, twisting boulevard, every turn a little scary....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So sings the Joe Gillis character in the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical version of this classic Billy Wilder film where every twisting turn of the boulevard and Norma Desmond's mind is felt banging in the viewer's stomach. William Holden is a starving writer who doesn't want to return the rented car and finds a twisting turn on his own destiny as he hides inside the mysteriously overgrown driveway off the twisted Bel Air area of the Los Angeles suburbs in order to hide from the men after him. He's in for more than he bargained for when he rings the doorbell of the dilapidated estate (shades of Grey Gardens) and finds a funeral for a chimpanzee going on. If the sight of dour butler Erich Von Stroheim isn't enough to get him to turn around and rush out of there, the sun-glassed older lady who mistakes him for an undertaker should be. But Gillis, an obvious expert in Hollywood History 101, instantly recognizes her. She's Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), a silent movie star whose career ended years before, lost in memories of Valentino and Chaplin, and certainly not in tuned with 1950 Hollywood.As Joe will find out, you can't mess around with the emotions or ego of a Hollywood legend, even if she hasn't made a film in 20 years, because actors were commodities trained by the studios to make grand entrances at premieres and be oh-so-perfect, larger than life and like Kleenex, disposable when they are no longer needed. Today's headlines prove this still to be true as stars rise and fall with amazing speed even if they have less than 1 percent of the veteran star's magnetism.This movie was a sensation in 1950, not only because of Swanson's return to films after almost a 10 year absence, but because of its stark observation about how Hollywood cast out their former money makers just because they weren't as popular anymore. Studio heads were furious, but veteran actresses recognized the truth in it and praised Swanson for her guts. Even though the film got nominated for a ton of Oscars (including four of its actors) and is considered one of the greatest movies ever made, let alone greatest movie ever made on the madness of Hollywood, it took only one major award (writing) and two technical awards.Ripe for parody, drag queen impressions and rip-offs which had little in common quality wise with the original, this did make a very good, if not excellent musical, where such divas like Patti LuPone, Glenn Close, Betty Buckley, Elaine Page, Diahann Carroll and Leslie Uggams assumed Norma's turban. But in the annals of film history, there is only one Norma Desmond, and that is Gloria Swanson, who proved that she was not making a come-back here, simply a "return".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Sunset Blvd ..........Timeless Classic"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gloria Swanson's performance is one that is over-the-top and melodramatic, but in the best possible sense. It's the way Desmond knew how to live. She gained fame by working her hands and face. She was an expert in conveying emotion strictly through body language. The lack of sound in her films demanded it. The result in Sunset Boulevard is a sympathetic character that is also one of the best villains of all-time.Sunset Boulevard also shows that our obsession with fame and maintaining it aren't new. Although much can be said and written about the hyper-invasive tabloid times in which we currently live, it's really a dream that's been around for a very long time. Desmond needs the spotlight to survive. Outside of it, she struggles to survive. The need to be remembered and, in a sense, worshiped, is what drives her and her passions. But like every film, it's all an act and one that ultimately cannot be maintained while still remaining sane.Arturo Montenora</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, Gloria Swanson's acting is slightly over the top in this drama however, for this movie it works! The reason why it works is because her character "Norma Desmond" a once famous silent screen actress from yester-year is stuck in the days gone by when actresses didn't need words because they had (what she refers to as)"Faces" and every expression was over dramatized on film to get the story across to the viewer. However, these over theatrics and acts of grandeur is something she carried into her real life... which seems fitting when you take into account this is a woman who thinks of herself as larger than life.Not only has Norma refused to accept that the now popular "Talkies" has taken over the movie industry but, she also still has it in her head that she was and still is the greatest actress that ever was...... In her mind,time hasn't really passed by or, passed her by because she's "Still big. It's the movies that got small".Swanson is marvelous as a woman who is obviously delusional and to make matters worst... mentally unstable. William Holden is perfect as the down-on-his luck Hollywood writer who had the misfortune to form a bond with the great Norma Desmond and Erich Von Stroheim is wonderful as Norma's faithful servant. If I have wish about this movie..... It would be to learn more on how his character "Max" became her servant.This is a classic movie that I never tire of watching every couple of years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Falling Stardom</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***Jonny_Numb ("A somewhat savage, somewhat sick peek behind the Hollywood curtain", Jonny_Numb from Hellfudge, Pennsylvania, 21 August 2006) has a well-written, witty summary. Also, SpaceComics ("Classic character drama", SpaceComics from Colorado, 24 September 2005) also has interesting points to make, mentioning the parodies put on by Carol Burnett.***"Sunset Boulevard," (1950, Billy Wilder&#xfeff;), a tale of falling stardom narrated by a dead guy&#xfeff;, is poignant. To understand it today we have to recall that silent movie actors in the 1920s were living legends in the eyes of adoring film fans around the world. Also, at the half-way mark of the twentieth century there were still film studios that employed full-time labor (paying living wages) in a variety of supporting positions, allowing undiscovered talent the opportunity to climb the ranks. There was so much general excitement about Hollywood's contribution to world culture in 1950 that Billy Wilder's depiction of a mentally disturbed, former movie star undoubtedly rankled some of his peers.When Joe Gillis (William Holden) meets Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), both aspire a higher station in Hollywood. Gillis, a hack screenwriter experiencing tough times, is being chased by repo men who want his car. Gillis arrives at Norma's decaying, seemingly unoccupied mansion out of sheer desperation. Gillis is fairly likable, but when given the opportunity he takes what he needs from others. Norma, who surrounds herself with photographs from her youth (i.e., early publicity pics of comely Gloria Swanson&#xfeff;), is not well. She spends her days obsessed with the adulation she used to receive and cannot accept the reality that her film career is kaput. (BTW, for six years Gloria Swanson was the leading attraction at Paramount Pictures&#xfeff;.) Gillis becomes a kept man, accepting Norma's gifts and eventually becoming her lover. As Gillis rises in stature, it is inevitable that he will want more than he has. Temptation arrives in the form of Betty Schaefer (Nancy Olson), the youthful script girl and fiancé of Joe's close friend Artie (Jack Webb). Betty aspires to be a screenwriter, wants to team up professionally with Joe, and her eyes light up like firecrackers when she states her intention to do the hard work needed to break through. It is very likely that (director and second-listed screenwriter) Billy Wilder created Betty to represent his dream love. She sure is mine.A very memorable character is Norma's butler, Max (Erich von Stroheim&#xfeff;). Max faithfully serves the decaying Norma, maintaining her illusion of aristocracy (that silent film stars knew for real). Max suffers almost unendurably, but never receives any attention for doing so. Regarding that Stroheim had some great success as an actor and a director, this role perfectly submerges him. This is also seen with the cameos by Buster Keaton&#xfeff;, Hedda Hopper, H. B. Warner and Anna Q. Nilsson. Considering Keaton's real-life stature as a silent-era superstar, watching the legendary comedian in advanced years quietly playing Bridge in that decrepit room reminds us that Time never plays favorites.This is arguably Billy Wilder's best effort as a director. He does a very good job with the mansion interiors, creating a mysterious and suspenseful feeling. (One quibble with the writing is the name-dropping, particularly early on.) Gloria Swanson should have won an Academy Award for her fearless, often-imitated performance of Norma. William Holden&#xfeff; plays the opportunistic Joe Gillis with complexity. Nancy Olson as Betty is simply adorable. While the cast is very strong overall, I do have some disagreement with the multiple scenes with Cecil B. DeMille&#xfeff; portraying himself which serve to make him appear thoughtful and sensitive to Norma's problems. (Was Billy Wilder trying to kiss DeMille's rear end?) Overall, "Sunset Boulevard" is a very rich experience for audience members who still daydream about working in peak Hollywood. Cinephiles should have their chauffeur steer their Isotta-Fraschini over to the next revival theater that shows it.</fullReview>

Swanson is spot-on as the deranged former star, and Holden plays the quick-witted and fast-talking yet jaded Joe Gillis perfectly. Fantastic support from Erich von Stroheim and Nancy Olson. All four main actors deserved their Oscar nominations, and Swanson was particularly unlucky to miss out.Only slight negative is that the movie does drag a bit in the middle section, possibly over-detailing the web that Gillis has been drawn into.

		<fullReview>Billy Wilder's Sunset Boulevard is the very suspenseful look at a screenwriter who doesn't have enough money (played by William Holden)and a silent star named Norma Desmond (played by Gloria Swanson) who has been waiting to get into the motion picture business for a long time wanting to make a film that she wanted Cecil B. DeMille to direct but had a terrible script. The film was suspenseful because we want to know why she was really that crazy, but her performance was still well done thanks to memorable lines, for example the most selfish line in the movie in the beginning where she says to Joe Gillis in her bedroom "I am big, it's the pictures that got small, and the last line in the movie which is the most memorable line in the movie when she was filming in her house and the last line "All right Mr. DeMille I'm ready for my closeup.". When Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett wrote the screenplay they wanted a frightening look at Hollywood like no other film director has done before. Not only do William Holden and Gloria Swanson have good performances but so does Eric Von Stroheim as her first husband and Desmond's butler. This is one o those movies that really deserved best picture but didn't win. I had no problems at all with this film, but I personally don't get why Alfred Hitchcock didn't direct this movie in the first place?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was absolutely amazing. I used to think that Casablanca was one of the best movies ever created, but now this one takes top spot. The acting is sensational, and the story is extremely riveting, making you sit up and watch. Gloria Swanson really gives her best performance in this role playing the actress who lives everyday just waiting for one more chance to be in front of the cameras again and to feel young. William Holden delivers a stellar performance, worthy of an academy award. If this movie was ever to be remade by Hollywood, which like Casablanca I hope it never does, there are only two actors who can play the titular roles, Helena Bonham Carter as Norma &amp; Leonardo DiCaprio as Gillis, the rest will unfold as a movie so great it would be the movie of the century.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly superb work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd heard quite a lot of things about this particular film, for years. Oh yes, Gloria Swanson is amazing (since that's where most of the conversation originates from) but there are so many good performances in this, and the film itself is stellar. It's odd to think that both this and All About Eve came out in the same year, both stories about Hollywood to great degrees. Also odd because both feature two female performances considered among the greatest of all time, and yet neither of them won. The final scene of this is really haunting stuff, stuff of nightmares, possibly one of the greatest final scenes ever. Basically, it lived up to its reputation, and then some.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A new appreciation of a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sunset Boulevard 10/10When I couldn't sleep the other night, I watched the Special Collector's Edition of Sunset Boulevard. I saw this movie years ago. After seeing the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical in Johannesburg recently, I fell in love with it all over again. I know there's nothing new to say about Billy Wilder's classic ? its camp sharpness, its haunting Gothic melancholy, its rich, dark comedy, its insidiously fascinating characters ? so I won't try. What struck me was recognising Wilder as a genius director. Often seen as a writer who favoured the screenplay more than visual elements, in this movie he really showed some innovative insight into framing his masterpiece. Two, in particular, stand out ? the fish eye view of the body in the swimming pool and use of powder on the edges of the camera lenses. I also enjoyed the commentary into the music of the film. When I watched the film again, I had a new appreciation for Franz Waxman's score.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good Hollywood Picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A very good picture showing how much the movie business can take away your sanity, especially when cinema turned to sound from silent. It's not like Singin' in the Rain, but you know what I mean. And very interesting that Cecil B. DeMille starred as himself. And his line "it would be an expensive picture" is very funny, because DeMille would direct The Ten Commandments in 1956, costing $12 million dollars, the most expensive movie ever made at the time. And I think its very hard to believe that William Holden would play Shears in The Bridge on the River Kwai, seven years later. An incredibly awesome performance by Gloria Swanson, she should have taken home the Oscar. Excellent performances by William Holden and all the others. I haven't seen All About Eve yet, so I think that Sunset Blvd. should have won the Oscar gold for Best Picture. Maybe someone should try on a remake. Maybe not the worlds greatest idea, but it might work. I recommend it to anyone interested in the movie business. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Sunset Boulevard" or if you will "Sunset Blvd." is a classic Billy Wilder noir-ish tale of a forgotten silent film star Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) and a down on his luck screen writer Joe Gillis (William Holden and their May-December relationship.Gillis turns into a driveway while running from finance company representatives who are trying to repossess his car. On the grounds Gillis discovers an old mausoleum of a mansion that has fallen into disrepair. Mistaken for an undertaker, Gillis is invited inside where he discovers that the owner of the house is none other than Norma Desmond and her servant Max (Eric von Stroheim).At first Gillis wants to flee but then sees an opportunity to make some money off the lonely Desmond. The opportunity becomes reality when Norma invites Joe to move in where she showers him with money and gifts in return for his affection. All goes well until Joe becomes involved with studio employee Betty Schaefer (Nancy Olsen) with whom he falls in love. This leads to tragic consequences for both Norma and Joe.Gloria Swanson was anything but the lonely forgotten silent film star she portrays in this film. There were however, some interesting parallels to her own life. She did actually work for Cecil B. De Mille (who has a cameo in this film) and was directed by Stroheim in "Queen Kelly" (1928). She had faded from films in the 30s but kept working on the stage and in the occasional film. "Queen Kelly" is the film that Norma screens for Joe where she vows to return to past glory.For Holden, this was the film that made him a super star rather than just another contract leading man. He plays a totally self-serving character who uses Norma to his own ends.Stroheim who was best known for his extravagant direction of silent films, was actually a pretty good actor as well. His performance as Max, Norma's faithful former husband/director/protector stands up with those of Swanson and Holden.Also in the cast are Fred Clark as Sheldrake the movie producer, Jack Webb as Joe's friend Artie Green, Hedda Hopper as herself and as the "wax works" playing bridge, former silent stars Anna Q. Nilsson, Buster Keaton and H.B. Warner. Nilsson is shown puffing away on a cigarette, Warner looks asleep but Keaton (misused again) manages to get in one of his signature dead pan expressions in his brief appearance.A marvelous film and another Billy Wilder classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie would never see a sunset.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yet another movie and yet another magical sweep by Mr. Wilder. Sunset Blvd. like most of Billy Wilder movies starts with an enticing sequence. A beautiful shot where all the aspirations and expectations of a man lay dead, floating in a pool he always wanted. Like most Wilder movies Sunset Blvd. too can be characterized by witty dialogues and in depth characterization. Here again Mr. Wilder shows his impeccable control over direction. Together with the art directors, musicians and actors frame by frame he manages to portray such a haunting world as can ever be. To begin with, the story of Sunset Bolvd. still has an aroma of freshness. Some stories never become old and this is one of them. It's as relevant today as it was 50 years ago. Billy Wilder had this brilliant ability of striking a balance between the demands of a character and those of the story. For the sake of one the other was never compromised. Sunset Bolvd. demands such strong character presence that even without a proper plot the movie would have carried itself with ease but the fact that Billy Wilder paid such intricate attention to the plot line made this movie an all time great. Moving on to the art direction and cinematography, to categorize it as a film noir is an understatement. It has the typical film noir elements but it transgresses that definition. The old house, the boat like bed, the ornaments and every other thing contributes to the over all persona of the characters and specially to that of Norma Desmond. It's Gothic and haunting. The decadence prevails. The same follows for the music, it's there to scare and it accomplishes that with ease. Floating like a ghastly fog over a turbulent river.The music, script and art direction won an Oscar each but Gloria Swanson did not. In my eyes she is every inch the winner. She was larger than life, she was femme fatale epitomized. The fact that she was performing the character of an actor makes her performance all the more convincing. Her over the top gestures and that rhythmic dialogue delivery personifies her glorified past and her current predicament. The other leads too play their roles to perfection but she simply steals the show hands down. Over the decades this movie has gone on to become a classic and to sum it all up, this movie is indeed a class apart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie starts with a case of murder in a mansion located in Sunset Boulevard. The victim, Joe Gillis was an unsuccessful playwright. He was hired by a descended great actress, Norma Desmond and lived with Norma and her butler, Max. Joe begins to tell everything of this tragedy?At that time of this movie, the movies changed from silents to voiced. Norma could not adapt the change and she dreams to return to the brilliant show business, believing that she is still a beautiful movie star. In the story, Norma and her old friends who were succeeded in movies play cards in her mansion. One of her friends is Buster Keaton who was an actor in silent films. I like his film originally. Including Keaton, their appearances and expressions are very sorrowful and Joe thinks that they are as if wax dolls. I can't stop feeling the rise and fall of life. In this movie, the character of Max produces a mysterious atmosphere. I was really surprised at the reason why he serves Norma?</fullReview>

Swanson's performance is unforgettable here as she seamlessly immerses into her given role &amp; plays Norma with such flawless finesse that it overshadowed almost every other aspect of this film.Nicely directed &amp; brilliantly written by Wilder with many moments of sadness &amp; wit cleverly glued together, Sunset Boulevard paints a remarkable yet pitiful portrait of a bygone actress living in a world of her own and is an immensely entertaining &amp; hugely rewarding cinema about Hollywood that culminates with a much more tragic finish than expected by etching Norma Desmond's final shot into our minds for it to haunt us forever.

		<shortDescription>Writers must always confront Hollywood's past so they can determine the future.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sunset Boulevard is like a job-shadow for youngsters with some interest or talent for screen writing, without having connections to people in the industry. It depicts the highs, but mostly lows of screen writing in Hollywood: work and pay is inconsistent, inspiration hits only at certain times, and if personal matters become entangled in work, say goodbye to any semblance of the quality in your writing. Though Hollywood's changed since the times of Sunset Boulevard, the studio-dominated world back then, some things never change. It doesn't discourage screenwriters from tapping into their full potential, rather gives them a look at the back dealings of Hollywood, and no matter when the time, writers must always confront Hollywood's past so they can determine the future. The staggering success of Sunset Boulevard's production is the screenplay; it's a clever script showing a vision of Hollywood. While it's obviously overdrawn and exaggerated with its realism, it's a semi-believable look at a new face of Hollywood rising above the old. Sunset Boulevard is especially fun for people who enthusiastically get involved in the world of movies because of the added "industry humor". It's the things that film critics and movie lovers say to our friends or think in our minds about movies. Maybe Sunset Boulevard was made for the people behind the guilds in the film business. It can be viewed as a reflection and lead to psychological mysteries of people vs. things . That concept differs from the average American and movie affiliated professionals. But through all the finger-pointing Sunset Boulevard does at Hollywood, it celebrates how important it is.A lot of ideas float around in Sunset Boulevard, as well as a lot of artistic pride being boasted on the screen. The most overwhelming and fairly obvious positive trait of the film is the extravagant art direction; the monumental sets make the story already interesting even before we know what's going on in the first scene at the mansion. The costumes are gaudy, too. The film is quite funny in places making the ride a joyous one at times, and an eerie at others. It's well balanced and never bores its viewer with one point that it's working towards. Sunset Boulevard's use of narration works effectively, here, and is a crucial part of the film. The two leads work supporting the film to make it stand on its two feet. William Holden's smooth, realistic view of a screenwriter actually is superior to Glory Swanson's approach to her unique character. In a role that reminded me of ironic characters, Swanson didn't quite hit the perfect levels of intensity that have been established in other films such as All About Eve or Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?Sunset Boulevard doesn't try to be Atlantic deep, but it successfully comments on "Old Hollywood" and led me to think about things that never crossed my mind before. I think we as a society underestimate celebrity levels of loneliness. The media is always buzzing for something new, well what happens to the person behind the star who has built their lives on something, just to be discarded for something "new"? It's almost tragic, shown through a tragic character. Hollywood is a disillusionment, though they may be more financially stable than some, the occupants are still people with complex feelings and triggers. I was unsure how much I actually liked Sunset Boulevard, even up to the final scene, I couldn't decide whether it exceeded its reputation or finished below it. Then that final shot came. It all hit me with Gloria Swanson fading into darkness just what this film accomplished and how it touched me. My favorite thing about Sunset Boulevard is the irony that its characters are talking about the disgust they feel towards dialogue. Little do they know, the dialogue and writing is the thing that separates it from the crowd. Rating: 9/10Grade: A</fullReview>

Gloria Swanson is super creepy, yet tragic as she tells William Holden her tales of woe while falling in love (or is it infatuation) with him. She is tragically cut off from the world and in his role he is drawn to her for reasons that seem to not even known to him. Watch for a tour d France delicious romp into Hollywood history both woven into the story of tragedy, hope, and strange mystery. Watch for a great performance by Max, Nora Desmonds butler. This movie is a classic that has uncommon staying power even by todays standards. William Holden is fun and OH SO YOUNG!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I believe this was pretty good for an old film. Personally, I am not too enchanted by "classics", but this one was good.I think the theme of the past aging and not being relevant anymore was a strong one in this film. Times change and if you become hung up on the past, you cannot progress to the present and future. I liked this theme in the movie.I also enjoyed the twist in that the main character was the one who was killed at the end of the movie. This was something that I didn't think was coming, as he was narrating in the beginning of the movie. Having seen many movies from many eras, I haven't seen something like this, and thus was unable to accurately predict the ending like I usually do.</fullReview>

The part of Norma Desmond was played brilliantly, and really drove home the part of a woman who is trapped by her own former glory, unable to move on and grasp reality. The final scene in this movie is absolutely amazing, with the camera crews and newsmen all crowding around her, while she indulges in her own fantasy that she has finally returned to the set and is making a picture once again. I first came across this movie as the number one spot in a lost of the top film noirs, and now I can easily see why.

		<shortDescription>A Classic Movie About Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sunset Boulevard,also known as Sunset Blvd., is a film noir directed and co-written by Billy Wilder, and produced and co-written by Charles Brackett. It was named after the boulevard that runs through Los Angeles and Beverly Hills, California.The film stars William Holden as Joe Gillis, an unsuccessful screenwriter, Gloria Swanson as Norma Desmond, a faded silent movie star who draws him into her fantasy world where she dreams of making a triumphant return to the screen with Erich von Stroheim as Max Von Mayerling, her butler and ex-husband. Nancy Olson, Fred Clark, Lloyd Gough and Jack Webb play supporting roles. Director Cecil B. DeMille and gossip columnist Hedda Hopper play themselves, and the film includes cameo appearances by leading silent film actors Buster Keaton, H. B. Warner and Anna Q. Nilsson.The story begins at the end as the body of Joe Gillis is fished out of a Hollywood swimming pool. From The Great Beyond, Joe details the circumstances of his untimely demise. Hotly pursued by repo men, impoverished, indebted "boy wonder" screenwriter Gillis ducks into the garage of an apparently abandoned Sunset Boulevard mansion. Wandering into the spooky place, Joe encounters its owner, imperious silent star Norma Desmond. Upon learning Joe's profession, Norma inveigles him into helping her with a comeback script that she's been working on for years. Joe realizes that the script is hopeless, but the money is good and he has nowhere else to go. Soon the cynical and opportunistic Joe becomes Norma's kept man. While they continue collaborating, Norma's loyal and protective chauffeur Max Von Mayerling contemptuously watches from a distance. More melodramatic than funny, the screenplay by Wilder and Charles Brackett began life as a comedy about a has-been silent movie actress and the ambitious screenwriter who leeches off her. Sunset Boulevard ranks among the most scathing satires of Hollywood and the cruel fickleness of movie fandom for it is a tremendously entertaining combination of noir, black comedy, and character study.Aside from that,it tears away at the curtain that keeps reality away from fiction.Indeed,it is classic movie that tries to portray what Hollywood is all about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A proper, timeless classic but much darker than the title suggests - 93%</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Given that I've been busy holidaying at another famous boulevard (Las Vegas Boulevard, if you must know), I'm afraid that it's taken me a couple of weeks to get round to writing this. In truth, the extra weeks haven't deadened or weakened my extremely high opinion of this certified classic. I confess that black-and-whites aren't my normal area of preference but Film 4 has a habit of showing amazing and largely forgotten films during the day so when I spotted this, I took the plunge and enjoyed this dark, twisted fable on the perils of fame and the fickle nature of the Hollywood machine.Washed-up screenwriter Joe Gillis (William Holden) is struggling to survive in Hollywood, outwitting the various loan-sharks after him. During one such escape, he finds himself stranded at the tumbledown mansion of former silent movie star Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) and her loyal butler Max (Erich von Stroheim). After befriending Joe and convincing him to work on a rewrite of her own script, Joe senses the opportunity to use the situation to his advantage. But as Joe falls ever deeper under Norma's influence, he begins to find himself alienated from his own friends until he starts to fall for is friend's fiancé Betty (Nancy Olson)...Being both ground-breaking in its portrayal of Hollywood's film making process as well as its subject matter, "Sunset Boulevard" is such an accessible film in ways that most modern films aren't. On one hand, it is a classic film noir but it's also a biting satire on movie-making in general, the first film showing audiences the action beneath the scenes. At other times, it becomes a disturbing horror film especially when the tyrannical Norma Desmond is tipped over the edge, leering at the camera like a vampire in make-up. This is largely down to Swanson's performance, being both suitably melodramatic and dominating the film as she should. Not to say that the others don't perform as well or any of the cameos which fans of early movies will delight in. Most films, when they try to be many things at once, struggle to fit their brief but such is the feeling of "Sunset Boulevard" that you never get the feeling that anything was missed. This is one of the most complete films I have ever seen - even my favourite films have something I could criticise if I was being picky. But there is very little not to like about this movie - like most film noirs, you need to stick with it and pay attention but the rewards are quite remarkable.It's difficult to imagine how much of an impact this would have made in 1950 but even today, "Sunset Boulevard" is a film that everyone should watch. It's chilling and amusing in equal measures, being a powerful fable about the effects of fame and power which I felt was still relevant today. It truly is a timeless piece of movie-making, one which is actually deserving of the praise heaped upon it back then and today. It's bold, brave and utterly magnificent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A ruthless film about the flip side of the Hollywood glamor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Billy Wilder, born in Austria-Hungary built himself a huge reputation during 1940's-60's in Hollywood. He's is best known for his comedies with Marilyn Monroe (Some Like It Hot, The Seven Year Itch), but his other films haven't remained in the shadows either. In 1944 he directed his film-noir masterpiece Double Indemnity, which became a big inspiration for many directors. In addition to these films Billy Wilder's trade mark is probably his own unique satire, best seen in One Two Three!, A Foreign Affair and of course in Sunset Blvd. In 1950 Billy Wilder was already at the top of his career, he produced his films himself and therefore had much more artistic freedom. This freedom allowed him to make a different kind of film with the screenwriter, Charles Brackett. Sunset Blvd. was no one night wonder, it took two years to finish it and the most time went to the writing. Brackett has told that someone suggested that they should make a film about a forgotten silent-era actress, who meets a desperate writer. They casted Gloria Swanson (who actually was one of the biggest silent-era starts) to play the role of Norma Desmond, a forgotten star.Sunset Boulevard is the second longest highway in Los Angeles, it reaches from the central station to the shore of the ocean. The boulevard entails more different modes of life than any other street in the world, the life around it is temporary; small stores, singles without families and motels. It's the street full of television and radio studios. The sunset is also the boulevard of cinema fame. This milieu of the film is very important to understand while watching Sunset Blvd.Sunset Boulevard, the film and the actual boulevard, mean traveling back in both time and place. It passes by the historical Hollywood, but the new modern Hollywood is also built around it. It's a historical journey to cinema. One could easily call Sunset Blvd. the best film ever made in Hollywood, it is a true "Hollywood Story." It's a modern tragedy, that follows the genre film-noir. It is very interesting from many perspectives, it's a cruel film about a cruel industry. It's a satirical description of Hollywood.Joe Gillis (William Holden) is a desperate writer trying to get a job, the films he has written the stories for have never been that successful. One day people from the debt collection agency come to take his car. While hiding away from them Joe randomly parks his car next to an old mansion, which seems deserted. It doesn't take long for him to realize that it's actually the home of Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), a forgotten silent film actress. Norma hasn't been acting in 20 years and thinks that it is the time for her big 'comeback', so with the help of Joe she decides to write a screenplay for herself. The more Joe gets to know Norma the more he becomes aware that she is still living in the past.This is a story about two desperate people; Joe is desperately trying to get work, he has one sad relationship with a girl, which of course leads nowhere. Norma still thinks she is the biggest star in Hollywood, she still gets hundreds of fan letter each day - actually sent by her butler. The mansion is full of memories, full of her photos and there's even a film theater for her, which only shows films she acted in. Once a week Norma goes to play bridge with her friends, who all are old silent-film actors - also played by themselves; Buster Keaton, Anna Q. Nilsson and H.B. Warner. Joe operatively names this group, the wax museum. When Norma falls in love with Joe, troubles start to occur. Norma seems to be a very suicidal person, she is very depressed, yearning for attention and admiration. This she can get from Joe, buy giving him everything he wants.There's something mystical with Norman's butler too he's her ex-husband and her director, played by Erich von Stroheim. What makes this film so unique is that it is designed very carefully to the smallest detail. It's full of intelligence, observations, mastery, ruthlessness, it's an agonizing film about the flip side of Hollywood. The American critics, the media, the producers and the people working in the commercial film industry saw a reflection of themselves in Sunset Blvd. The people working with cinema far away praised it for its ruthless way of dealing with actual issues below the surface. No one had actually brought these things up, so it was a very intellect idea for Wilder to do it. In addition to its main theme, the flip side of Hollywood glamor, it criticizes the way media deals with people. The disregard of human life, so many people don't care about each other, they just want to sell their stories. "Then they got a couple of pruning hooks from the garden and fished me out... ever so gently. Funny, how gentle people get with you once you're dead."I had seen Sunset Blvd. on television already, but now I got the chance to see it on the screen in its original format. It was a very interesting experience and I must say that this must be seen on screen, don't miss your chance if you come across with one. Sunset Boulevard is a gorgeous film about cinema and the media. It shows us the bad sides of this industry. It's also a beautiful tale of humanity and love, obsession and lust, oblivion and memory. The flip side of Hollywood glamor has now been shown to us.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was right up my alley with the psychology of it, the feel of insanity. This is a film-noir that caused a stir in the Hollywood world. This was due to it portrayal of Hollywood; not old the actors and actresses but of what goes on behind the scenes. The scandals and things that get swept under the rug. It was a real slap in the face for the many that think of Hollywood as glamorous and ideal. These days it's not that hard to believe that Hollywood is so scandalous because their "dirty laundry" is made public all the time in tabloids and such. I also find it ironic that all Norma wants is to make a comeback and never does, when in real life Gloria Swanson did just that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sunset Boulevard</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sunset Boulevard from 1950 is a magnificently twisted Film Noir. Norma Desmond was a once extremely famous Hollywood Actress. Everyone knew who she was, loved her films and her mind absolutely adored her. What Norma doesn't realize is that she has been out of the spotlight for a longtime. She has been hiding away in her once gorgeous home, holding on to what she once was. Her house is very reflective of what she herself had become over the years. The house hadn't received much attention and in turn has become dull and un-groomed; Norma Desmond did the same. Joe Gillis is a screenwriter that has also been struggling with his career. He manages to fall in to Norma's world, and in the end shatters it. Joe agrees to help Norma with her comeback film, but in the process realizes that nobody is waiting to see it. Norma's mental state isn't always logical, but her character makes you feel for her. She was once this beautiful actress that was on top of the film world; now she's lucky if she is a distant memory. This is a dark film that shows what fame can do to a person. Norma seems as though she is stuck in the spotlight and doesn't know how to live life otherwise. The script was great, but Gloria Swanson was perfect at pulling everything together.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a very strange film noir film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I Thought that overall sunset blvd was a good movie. I did find it very hard to deal with Gloria Swanson even though she played a magnificent role and casting her was perfect for the role she had. You could tell she was a silence film actress because you could see how she used expressions and looks to portray just how she was feeling or dealing with things. This is what made it very hard for me to deal with this women. I felt the director did appropriate job of selecting a cast that met the demands of the movie including Nancy Olsen who plays the woman who gets William Holdens mojo for writing back. The score and dark ominous lighting did a amazing job of portraying just how dark a road William holden's character was moving down the line and just how far and extreme it might get to escape it. This is why the beginning scene which happens to be the last scene sets off a great example of what can happen in life if you just accept things and let people start to run your life. Wiliam Holden knew there was no escaping the dark, scary tones of what Gloria Swanson's life had become because without her he truly had nothing. Overall, this movie was brilliant and strange while keeping you on the edge of your seat to see what will happen to "Joe Gillis" next.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this movie was pretty good. I like how it shows how Hollywood can affect a person and how being in the spotlight can consume their life. Norma Desmond played by Gloria Swanson is a perfect example. In this movie she is living in the past to when she was really famous. A man by the name of Joe Gillis ends up at her house and gets forced to look at her screen play. Norma seems like she has some kind of mental problem and that shes not all there. If Joe tries and goes somewhere and shes not with him she acts like she is gonna kill herself. At the end of the movie he tries and leaves but as he walks out she shoots him. It doesn't even phase her. When the cops come she thinks that they are their to shoot her movie. So we see the camera focus on her as she is coming down the stairs. She doesn't even know that they are their to take her away that's how messed up she is. She is to focused on being in the spotlight.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Norma Desmend, played by Gloria Swanson did an amazing job at portraying a mentally imbalanced person who dreams of returning to her previous life as a silent movie star. Joe gills, played by William Holden seems to be disconnected to Norma in that he lives with her and pretends to be there to write a movie script in which she is the star. The themes in this movie are still relevant issues today and that's one of the reasons I believe that this movie is considered timeless. Norma still yearns for the attention that being a movie star brings. She is holding onto her past life and therefore cannot move forward in any other aspect of her being. The movie did make me laugh in parts, at times because of Norma's disillusionment however at the end I just felt sorry for her. Like many people in Hollywood today, their acting careers fizzle out at a certain age unless they reinvent themselves significantly. This often is the case with child stars that then turn to acquire psychological issues or addictions to drugs or alcohol. I also think it is quit sad that her butler and ex husband still lives with her because he loves her. It seems like in this each character is not living but existing in their life. I think it would add a greater dimension to the film if the audience knew a bit more about max as her ex husband and the history of them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This extremely dramatic film noir was surprisingly a movie that I liked. Although at first glance, I admit I assumed it to be over the top or annoying perhaps but I was wrong, Gloria Swanson (famous silent film actress) stepped out of her silent film career to play this more well known role of her career. Surprisingly enough, this film is about Hollywood in the 1950's. William Hollden is a somewhat struggling film writer who ends up meeting Norma (Swanson). The pair make for a humorous yet strange pair throughout the entire film. The black and white film itself creates for an even more intense and certainly dramatic mood, it especially helps to atmosphere of the movie when scenes take place in Norma's gloomy old mansion. Narration throughout the film is in first person from Holden's point of view. The entire thing is a sort of- flashback, as most noirs are. Camera tricks such as fading in and out are used quite often in the film to add to dramatic effect as well. Of course the ending was my favorite part where Norma stares blankly at the screen and says " Mr. DeVille- i'm ready for my close up." I really liked this film a lot. It was visually and emotionally enticing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sunset Boulevard was one of those movies that I kept thinking about the next day. The aged actress' character seemed very real to me, although she was eccentric and crazy. She was very sympathetic and I felt as if Joe took advantage of her. I liked the way this movie was made, the body in the pool, the darkness, the isolation of much of the movie. The inclusion of references to other film stars and film makers also brought a realistic feel to it. Their relationship somehow made me uncomfortable, I'm not sure if it was their age difference or because she was so needy and controlling of him. It did seem he had some feeling for her, because he went back after he found out that she tried to kill herself. That last scene was very powerful with the lights and the crowd, like her swansong. A very impressive use of lighting as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sunset Boulevard (1950)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Anthony Mann's T-Men to Jules Dassin's Rififi, my favorite noirs have always focused on crime. Crime and noir go hand in hand, a dark subject for a dark genre. It's not required, but the violence and deception and greed that one associates with crime is such appropriate subject matter.Sunset Boulevard is mostly devoid of it, save a murder at the end, and this left me a little disappointed. In the movie's defense, though, it's got a lot of noir's other common elements? There's the 1950's California setting, the black and white visuals, a femme fatale, and a dark, sometimes eerie atmosphere.William Holden does a solid job as usual, but props especially go to Gloria Swanson for essentially playing herself?a star of Cecil B. DeMille silent era movies whose popularity waned in the 30's. It's always admirable when actors can play caricatures of themselves, especially when it's in a negative light.The movie has stayed with me in the days since watching it, a good sign that it was memorable. Still, I wonder what its point was. Joe Gillis would criticize me for wanting "one of those message pictures," for not being content with a simple story, and maybe he'd be right. After all, it was at least told well.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I give this film a lot of credit for its creativity with respect to the storyline. I felt like it was an episode from the twilight zone because Gloria Swanson was so detached from reality. I liked the narration being from the point of view of the murdered man in flashback style. I thought this was unique. A lot of the story took place in the mansion of Gloria and I thought that the design did a good job of portraying her insanity. She had tons of pictures of herself and it was a good portrayal of her self-absorbed personality with respect to her former acting career. I liked the idea that there were a lot of characters in the film that were played by actual people who worked during the silent film era. It really contributed to the verisimilitude of the film. The last scene was classic and I will never forget it. The only way they could safely get her out of the house was by creating the image that she was acting in a film. Brilliant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was so glad to have seen this film again. It had been many years since I had first watched it, and now seeing it, it was so much more of an important film to me. There are several little tricks that work on such a great level in this film that the next time I watch it I will be excited about this wonderful film. Joe's narration, opening the film with the end of the film, the set design of Norma's house, the superb cinematography and most of all Gloria Swanson. This is the only film I have ever seen of hers and she is so amazing. The character of Norma Desmond is one of a somewhat forgotten actress of the silent era who believes it is time for her great comeback to the silver screen. There is one problem though, she is a loon. Outright over the top whack job who obsesses on her career. Swamson is over the top. Very believable at times and as well, very laughable. There is a movie out there called The Forbidden Zone from early 1980's. The actress Susan Tyrell portrays a character very similar to the Desmond role, even in her facial expressions. I recommend this film to all who enjoy a good drama/thriller. I have a feeling that this film will never get old.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Billy Wilder's "Sunset Blvd" (1950) was a symbolic end of the Golden Age. Norma Desmond's silent film acting was long gone and she was well into her 50's but in her mind she was still a star.Joe Gillis played by William Holden stumbles upon Desmond's (played by Gloria Swanson) eerie mansion and immediately thinks it's been deserted. Little does he know has-been Norma is slowly slipping away into the isolation of insanity. Her mansion is more lair-like than anything with a frightening pipe organ that makes her haunted house even more disturbing. The lair is filled with photographs of the young and famous Norma that decay along with her."No one leaves a star!" Norma says over and over again right before she shoots Joe and he tumbles into the pool he always wanted. This scene was so haunting and terrifying, I couldn't stop thinking about it. It really stuck with me and I loved it.I've really come to love the classic film noir movies! I always find myself hoping that the flash forward at the beginning of the film won't play out in the end, even though it must.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's about time that I watched this movie! It moved. And, considering that it was made over half a century ago, i would say that it worked wonderfully. The story, the dialogue, the acting, the production design and the direction were all superb. William Holden, whom I've seen in other roles (Network and The Wild Bunch) plays a writer who is sort of weary and is muted in his actions and reactions. What may seem to be wooden in his approach is actually a wonderful characterization of a weary, beaten writer by Mr. Holden. In contrast, Gloria Swanson plays a very theatrical aging movie star, "Nora Desmond." Actually a former silent film star who just can not let go of her past and her former popularity. She lives, almost as a recluse, in her mansion - a safety bubble of her old studio days.Desmond hires Holden's character to write a screenplay, so that she can make a major comeback. And he succumbs to her wishes, because he is down on his luck (and on the run from creditors).None of the great elements described would have worked without the absolutely wonderful direction by Billy WIlder. Mr. WIlder knows how to tell a story without letting "direction" or the camera get in the way, and he is wonderful with his actors. Mr. WIlder is helped greatly by a very fine screenplay by Charles Brackett, D. M. Marshman Jr and Wilder, himself.Special mention should be given to the art direction. And also to the solid cinematography (John F. Seitz).All around a great movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SUNSET BLVD. is a wonderful film. Many consider it a masterpiece in the film noir genre, although it's not the typical murder mystery/detective investigation movie. The story still carries an eerie sense of mystery.A down on his luck screenwriter happens upon the decrepit mansion of a reclusive silent film star stuck in the decadent days of Old Hollywood. Living in an insulated world of delusions, the aging actress takes an interest in the writer as both a means to get back into "pictures" and a companion at home. Soon the writer is living in the woman's bizarre world and hoping to make an escape.The writing is superb. The colorful narration by William Holden sounds like it came right out of a novel, perfectly complementing the imagery. The story is told in flashback, with the narration guiding the viewer through the mind of the main character. Real names and faces from the motion picture industry are used to give the story a sense of realism.Just a great movie all around. A classic. Not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bizarre, unique....and an excellent classic film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite its bizarre and tragic nature, I cannot rate "Sunset Boulevard" highly enough. What a unique film, the likes of which we simply do not see anymore. Told in flashback narration by William Holden, it tells the story of how he tried to hide from a couple of mobsters who were chasing him and accidentally stumbled across the home of former silent movie star Norma Desmond (perfectly played by Gloria Swanson). Desmond has a huge ego and believes that everyone is still in love with her films and wants her to make a comeback. As Holden is paid to write a screenplay for her, the film's tragic story begins to unfold. The story doesn't matter to this film's greatness. It's the way everything about this movie was done that makes it a timeless, excellent movie. It's some of the best dialogue you will ever hear. See the film once and you'll remember Norma Desmond forever. She is a perfect character that gives brilliant acting to every scene. For example, when Holden first recognizes her, he exclaims that she is Norma Desmond, the silent movie star who used to be big, to which she responds, in my favorite line of the film, "I am big, it's the pictures that got small!" I don't think there was a more brilliant way she could have said this. Swanson was completely robbed for Best Actress by Judy Holliday for "Born Yesterday." You will not see a film this good anymore. I can't recommend it enough. If it seems too strange, keep watching anyway, and watch a second time if necessary. Absolutely perfect.**** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Hollywood Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story, set in '50s Hollywood, focuses on Norma Desmond, a silent-screen goddess whose pathetic belief in her own indestructibility has turned her into a demented recluse. The crumbling Sunset Boulevard mansion where she lives with only her butler, Max who was once her director and husband has become her self-contained world. Norma dreams of a comeback to pictures and she begins a relationship with Joe Gillis, a small-time writer who becomes her lover, that will soon end with murder and total madness.I'm surprised by this film. I really am. I thought I wouldn't have liked this film but wow, was this a brilliant film. "Sunset Blvd." plays like a satirical film noir, with hints of romance, comedy, thriller, suspense, horror, and surrealism, and yet, these things mix together perfectly on screen. It's kind of similar to "Singin' in the Rain" and "Whatever Happened to Baby Jane" combined, with the whole faded famous actress who wants to come back on screen and the transition of the silent film era to films with audio, which is not a bad thing, really.The script is filled with impeccable and irresistible dialogue but, to no surprise, the one thing that makes this movie great, in the first place, is Gloria Swanson. At first, she may seem a melodramatic drama queen. Well, she is. However, as the movie progresses, you see her character becoming crazier and crazier, to a point, where, she's so crazy that she, herself, can't see that she's crazy. It's excellent! I don't know why she didn't win for an Oscar for Best Actress but she should have. I found her as a sympathetic villain, because we, the audience, know that she's a bit misunderstood. Her character becomes a faded movie star because of Hollywood leaving her behind in the silent film era. She has become stuck in the past that everyone else has moved on.William Holden does a well job, spending along side Swanson for most of the film. Erich von Stroheim, playing Swanson's butler, also does a fine job, and Nancy Olson does a fantastic job with hitting the marks with every scene she's in. The score by Franz Waxman was surprisingly great. I loved it. I should also give a shout out to the production and costume designers too. The black-and-white film noir cinematography, by John F. Seitz, creates some dramatic effects in some scenes.Overall, the film was nothing short of brilliant. Gloria Swanson, as the infamous Norma Desmond, is dazzling, along with the other three actors I've mentioned before. The script is just right for each scene and the end of the film is perfect. If you're a person who just loves watching movies, please add this onto your growing list of movies. You won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Theme through Production Design</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The production design of this film helped convey the stories main theme: When a person refuses to detach from their former and forgotten identity, not only is their progression damned, but the potential to be manipulative, codependent, and obsessive reign supreme in order to keep the illusion alive.Struggling screen writer, Joe Gillis, meets by way of happenstance the former silent-screen goddess, Norma Desmond. Norma is an aged woman who has lived quietly and practically alone for many years in her spacious and what seems like deserted mansion; fooling herself into believing that the world is ready for her "return" (not "comeback") to the millions of fans who have never forgiven her for deserting the screen so many years ago. Norma's refusal to detach from her former and forgotten identity as a big Hollywood star is dramatically heightened through the use of production design.The predominant set used throughout this film is Norma's spacious mansion?an environment that suggests luxury and comfort for a woman who is still living off of the money she waged through a former identity. The illusory and narcissistic life that Norma continues to live is heightened through the heavy use of mise-en-scene. Framed pictures and portraits of Norma's face are displayed all throughout her mansion?most of which capture moments of past films she's acted in. She even has her own movie theater where she shows Joe the old films that she starred in. As she romanticizes and woos over her past, Joe, as well as the viewer, becomes aware of her inability to divorce herself from her former identity.Her bedroom also expresses the illusion she is under through elegancy. From a throne-like bed with silk draped from corner to corner, to fluffy and intricate pillows, exotic plants and decorative mirrors, all of these props are used to help convey to the viewer Norma's obsession with her past. In short, she is living a lie. Her stylish material possessions are what keep her from progressing onward with her life. She seems content with living in the past and will object to anyone that tries to disturb her comfort zone (as seen when she kills Joe in the end?a man she fell in love with and had difficulty detaching herself from after he walked out on her, thus disturbing her comfort zone).Along with the props, her striking wardrobe is also effectively contrasted with the rest of the characters in the film. While she is clothed in expensive and fancy attire, Joe is dressed in rugged slacks and tattered buttoned shirts. There is a scene where Norma merges her own identity crisis onto Joe when she takes him shopping for new clothes. This was her way of subconsciously manipulating her own ideologies of her forgotten identity onto someone else?the intended purpose, of course, was for her to perpetuate her narcissistic influence into those that would succumb to her manipulation. The use of make-up is also exploited to dramatize the main theme. In order for Norma to retain her old self, she undergoes extensive beauty treatments in preparation for her "return". Extreme close-ups reveal an ageless and beautiful woman, yet ironically throughout the rest of the film she is exposed as she really is?an old and wrinkled woman who is attempting to hold onto something that has past.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We just returned from Europe and "Sunset Blvd" was playing on the airline's Classic Movie Channel. I watched the whole thing twice, after having watched it dozens of times over the years. I was struck again by just how timeless this film is, in every way. Every aspect is perfect--the dialogue, the casting, the cinematography, the costumes &amp; set, the soundtrack, and of course the brilliant acting &amp; directing.Others in this comment section have written wonderful plot summaries and spoken to technical features so I won't repeat. I will point out just two things that I noticed: 1) When Swanson visits DeMille at Paramount, and he tells her to sit in his chair and watch for a bit, she is almost hit in the head by, of all things, a microphone on a boom. Annoyed, she pushes it firmly out of the way and out of the screen. Just priceless! What an inspired bit of symbolic "business"; it so beautifully, almost subliminally, underlines her feelings about how the movies have disintegrated into "talk, talk, talk". 2) In the final scene, when Swanson is descending the staircase, the figures of the spectators are arranged just as carefully as those on a bas-relief frieze over a Roman temple. The composition is stunning! Even as the camera follows Swanson down the stairs, she passes people in poses just as static and stylized as statues. Another example of inspired juxtaposition of old and new--true genius at work. I wonder how many arrangements of people Wilder considered, and discarded, before he came up with this very specific one.An incredible achievement in every way, even more amazing considering the year it was made. God bless everyone who labored to preserve this film for the rest of us. Thank you, Billy Wilder.</fullReview>

The story of an aging actress and a young struggling writer has timeless appeal. This movie should be noted for the importance of its various settings - Norma Desmond's house, the Hollywood film studios, the writer's office - which play a very important role in the story. The choice of narrator is a particularly innovative one and makes the plot even more compelling. The acting is superb; Gloria Swanson perfectly portrays Norma Desmond's increasing narcissism and vulnerability and the inclusion of various older Hollywood stars who play a bridge game with Norma was a nice reminder of the silent era.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film to strangle the genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sunset Boulevard set the style for epic Film-Noir movies everywhere. It inspired graphic novel writer/artist Frank Miller the creator of Sin City. It inspired the writing and screenplays of Christopher and Jonathan Nolan the brothers behind the movies The Prestiege, Memento, Batman Begins and the Following. It inspired most of the film-noir/ comic book crime genre that has evolved from it. This movie was the beginning of a beautiful friendship.It was a great story told threw the narration of Joe Gillis as William Holden whom was the main star of the film. It was basically him a washed up B screenwriter trying to make some money running into a famous actress who decides to give him a job Gloria Swanson as Norma Desmond. In end it develops a chain of events that makes Norma obsessed over William.Nothing really surprising about the film everything could be well predicted its just the dialog and acting that would flow to that point would tie you up to your seat handcuff your hands to the back and open up your eyes with clips Clockwork Orange style. It was a amazing film for semi-dark/mystery lovers who don't care for twists but rather just have a nice flowing plot with a satisfiable ending.The ending was decent but since you knew what was going to happen from the start of the movie it took away from it a tad. It was still a bit surprising however to the turn of events afterward but the lunacy of the acting from Gloria Swanson at the end took away from the flick in my opinion. Some may argue it was perfect others may say it was terrible, it was really a love it or hate it scene that I believe could have been done better. I just believe that she had better moments threw out the film.It was definitely a classic tale with near perfect dialog that inspired some of our industry greats. In end if your even remotely interested in the genre of Film-noir then don't keep strangling yourself with garbage and watch this film.</fullReview>

In fact the film in general shows a real black comic streak, right from its famous opening shot of screenwriter-turned gigolo Joe Gillis (William Holden) floating face-down in Desmond's swimming pool.One thing that stands out in the film is that it manages to be at the same time a very caustic fable about the allure and corruption of Hollywood while paying tribute to the classic era of silent films. Now that the film itself is older than the films it was then paying tribute to, it seems if anything more poignant then ever. It's true that Desmond eventually becomes a ridiculous person, but if anything the pathetic nature of her later years accentuates the marvel and the dignity of her earlier stardom and the era when she ruled the box-office. I'd actually be surprised if many people have not been introduced to the romance and majesty of silent cinema through this film ? a film which ironically mocks the "talk, talk, talk" of the sound era while including some of its very best dialog. Although in many ways more grotesque than the average Lon Chaney or Boris Karloff character, Norma Desmond also captures the sympathy of the audience like all great movie monsters. It's possible to see Norma as a "femme fatale", but I think her situation too pitiful for that designation ? I would liken her instead to Frankenstein's misunderstood and abandoned Monster (created as she was by Max, after all) or to the regal Dracula, hiding from the modern world in his ancient castle while he waits for new blood to devour and corrupt.There's a great deal of sadness and mystery, too, in this concept of 1920s Hollywood as a kind of lost and unlamented world. This is of course heightened by the presence of supporting actors like Buster Keaton, Ana Q. Nilsson, and especially director Erich Von Stroheim ? like Swanson playing a thinly-disguised grotesque version of himself. Von Stroheim's Max is, like the troubled artist himself, a former director; his present-day role as a butler is fitting also because Von Stroheim had to play a number of such menial roles in his later years. "Sunset Boulevard" provided a once-in-a-lifetime chance for Von Stroheim and Swanson to show their powers once again; it's hard to believe either of them could really have thought of it as a "comeback" (the film's dialogue even mocks such pretensions), and they both give the kind of impassioned performances that leave no doubt that these brilliant performers have held absolutely nothing back, giving us two of the most honest and nakedly human performances of the era.My only complaint about the film is relatively minor ? I've always felt that Joe Gillis is just too observant, world-wise, and engaging to really fall so completely into Norma Desmond's desperate clutches. The build-up is superbly handled, with the (often un-necessary and occasionally obtrusive) narration clueing us in to the fact that he thinks he can con Desmond initially but gradually becomes entangled in her life. I've just never completely believed the scene where Gillis leaves his friend's part to run home to Norma because of her suicide attempt. It's an effective scene, no doubt ? Von Stroheim's manner and his announcement are so startling in the context of the revelry surrounding Gillis that the audience probably doesn't pause much to wonder why he is so upset or if he really would go back there right away. Frankly it seems to me like it should have confirmed his feeling that he needed to escape that place. Are we to believe Gillis' pronouncement that Norma was the only person in Hollywood who was good to him? And is his guilt enough to motivate him to return and become her lover, or is he primarily just a scared and bitter man seeking some asylum from the world? Certainly his character is intriguing but I've just never believed such a likable, interesting guy who really knows better and has good friends (especially frisky Betty Schaefer, played by Nancy Olson, a character which vaguely reminds me of Betty Comden) supporting him would feel the need to shut himself up alive in a metaphorical coffin. Just because I don't want to believe it, though, doesn't mean it might be too close to true for comfort.I'm always fascinated by stories that break down the "fourth wall." This film succeeds in this difficult manoever with incredible style and verve. This is a film about success ? the great prize of huge success which destroys the possibility of joy derived from less grandiose endeavors, and the sad and equally great price of failure when it comes from resignation and fear. These characters touch us deeply because it's impossible not to see their greatness, and through witnessing their tragic downfall we become conscious of our own limitations within a culture that determines the value of a human being through such narrow parameters. "It's amazing how gentle people treat you when you're dead." Our deceased narrator reminds us ? this great film by Billy Wilder urges us to shed some tears for the living as well, trapped as we all are in such an ultimately senseless and uncaring world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The aura and mystery of Old Hollywood...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What is amazing about this film is how it still stands up to the times; still has a theme worthy of exploring; still comments on the disposable stars and tragedy of the old Hollywood system, which still seems romantic and glamorous compared to what we have today.Gloria Swanson is excellent, William Holden the tragic, "down on-his luck" writer from Ohio, trying to survive in Hollywood. Many of us know the story, or have seen parodies of it (for example, on the Carol Burnett show). But if you have any interest in Old Hollywood, you will love this film. It touches on isolation, aging, psychosis, and melodrama in a most unique way.The visuals are Gothic and haunting. The old terrazzo floor on which Valentino danced the tango, the old stars at Norma Desmond's house, discarded, playing cards to pass the time. The omniscient Olympic sized swimming pool, never haunted by guests. A mansion filled with memories and mementos, but not people.Sunset Boulevard today has but a few old buildings, modern life has all but erased the Old Hollywood which existed at that time. Today it is a strange anachronism to see Grauman's Chinese Theatre, and advertisements next to it, for todays movies . This film is worth seeing more than once. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>silent film acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching Gloria Swanson in this movie I have to agree with Norma Desmond; silent movie actors can say more visually than sound actors. The way she used her body was genius; the angles of her fingers, the wild eyes.I'm also glad that it wasn't in color. I think the black and white just added something. My friends and I are in a little debate as to whether or not Norma and Joe actually slept together. I think that it is a little ambiguous. One friend says that she doesn't think that they did. The other says that the whole reason that Joe chased Betty out of the mansion was that he felt that he wasn't good enough for her because he was a man-whore. Any other thoughts?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great, Groundbreaking Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has Hollywood telling on itself. Whereas, that may seem commonplace today, it was probably pretty rare for 1950. If you like old movies, there is a lot to be said for this one. The aging starlet, who watches her own films, on a projection screen hidden behind a painting, in her living room, is something else. About ten years later, The Twilight Zone television program did a great takeoff on this concept, in an episode called, "The Sixteen Millimeter Shrine", starring Ida Lupino. That episode was what persuaded me to someday find "Sunset Boulevard", and give it a looking-at. Turns out, it's a great movie, and I can see why it was often imitated and spoofed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Melodramatic, but good, film noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I watched Sunset Blvd. It was a pretty good movie, a film noir, complete with voice over and shady dealings. But I liked how the movie induced a feeling of claustrophobia. There's a frightening sort of scary neediness exuding from Gloria Swanson's character and it traps you between sympathy and revulsion.The film exudes quality Hollywood film-making, but the high polish of the set, the capable acting, the smart-but-not-over-the-top script. It functions very well together. Furthermore, there are cameos by many studio greats from decades before, and it was fun trying seeing them aged. It was really fun seeing Buster Keaton.It had a couple moments of not-so-momentous revelations and despite its irony, appeared to flip into its own melodramaticism, although it didn't seem too out of place, considering the characters involved. In the end though, the greatest weakness was that, like many screwball comedies and film noirs of the era, it's a little hard to relate sometimes.Nevertheless, pretty solid stuff. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>the reason i find this picture so interesting is the very delicate issue it talks about.an aging x Hollywood star is having a very hard time dealing with the fact she's getting old and still dreams of her big comeback to pictures even though they have changed from the time she used to act.having a hard time getting old is a very common thing its just that this specific woman develops it to some kind of madness or psychotic sickness that is damaging her life more and more as time goes by.she is basically obsessed with herself which naturally is the reason she gets neglected by everyone and ends up being lonely again and again, this loneliness is eventually what will make her suicidal.the only one who is always there and never leaves her is her servant which is her first husband.my opinion on this is that they got married when she was young and healthy with no sicknesses or self obsessions. this is also the reason he stays with her all along, because he knows how she is when she is OK and he's probably waiting for the day she will return to herself.the film is very exciting and even though you know from the start what is about to happen in the end you cant know exactly how it happens.it makes you feel really good watching a movie that is almost 60 years old for the first time and still being satisfied of it i.i have never seen a story like this in film before and even if i did i don't believe it would have been the same as in sunset blvd.i cant finish without saying something about the ending, it really doesn't get better then this.perhaps one of the best endings i have ever seen on screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the REAL Gloria Swanson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just want to clear up a misconception about Gloria Swanson and her performance as Norma Desmond. Gloria Swanson was NOTHING like Norma Desmond in real life. At the time she was offered the role, she was very busy (thank you very much) in New York with, among other things, pioneering early live television. She had a very busy family and social life, and wasn't that keen on returning to California and the silver screen. She was, however, very intrigued with the script, and was talked into it by Wilder. When she got to the coast and began to make contact with some of her old friends from the silent days, she was very disturbed and a little freaked out to discover that there were indeed many "Norma" cases hidden in the Bel Air hills. She was shocked to find many of her old acquaintances were stuck in the past, where as she had moved on and never looked back. She then actively sought out these people and began studying them, incorporating parts of each of them into her portrayal of Norma Desmond.A couple of interesting stories about the making of this movie are worth relating. In 1948, Billy Wilder and his collaborator, Charles Brackett were searching for story ideas. They were lunching at Chasens restaurant in Beverly Hills and Wilder noticed an aged, apparently "homeless" man hovering around C.B. Demille's table. Wilder observed DeMille motioning the old bum over and whispering something to him. The bum shuffled out. Intrigued, Wilder filed the incident away. Several days later he ran into De Mille on the Paramount lot and asked about it. "Oh yes, that was old Griffith asking for work again." Aghast, Wilder asked "Griffith ?WHO?" "D.W. Griffith" Demille simply replied, and walked away. It so shocked Wilder that such a titan of the film industry could become such a severe has?been, could have fallen so low. It gave him and Brackett the germ of the idea that eventually became "Sunset Blvd"-the true, unvarnished look at how Hollywood treats its "living legends".Another interesting story occurred at the films Hollywood premi?re. It was, of course a huge, star-studded affair. Everyone who was anyone was there. After the screening, L.B. Mayer, then recently deposed head of MGM and one of the most powerful of all movie moguls stormed into the lobby. Billy Wilder was there, holding court, and enjoying praise from all. "You muckraking scum! You've ruined this town with this filthy picture! You and your kind are ruining our industry!" Mayer barked in Wilder's face. Wilder, with an ever so faint smirk on his face clucked his tongue and said "Go f@ck yourself"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A simple story about a pool guy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quite simply, one of the sharpest screenplays ever written and luckily it has performances to match.ASome people have points they argue about this movie. Why did Joe stick around for so long ? He was a shallow guy, he wanted the meal ticket that he was being offered and, yes, despite his disgust at the offerings he always ended up taking them. Why did he end up back with Norma on that fateful night after her suicide attempt ? Because he was too scared, he didn't want to feel responsible for anyone else's pain. If he'd never actually heard of Norma's fate then he would have been long gone but once it was relayed to him, and still with the fresh memory of the part he played, then he had to make sure that he hadn't done any long-term damage. Joe enjoyed making a buck but he wasn't a completely uncaring man.As for Norma Desmond herself, she may well be the single greatest human character ever to be thrown onto celluloid. Half Quasimodo, half Bride Of Frankenstein and . . . . . . ummmm . . . . half Dracula's Daughter. Gloria Swanson bravely plays the faded movie star with a perfect mix of sadness, fiery anger, intense narcissism and pride, all mixed up with some mild overacting and permanent melodrama.William Holden is the coolest narrator ever and his character, although often unlikeable, just about keeps us onside for the duration of the movie. Even if writer/director Billy Wilder doesn't manage to keep our sympathies with the right character for most of the movie he produces some scenes in the second half that give Holden's character a twisted redemption and reason to finally make a completely clean breast of things.Max, the butler, IS the avid fan taken to the extreme. Devoted, adoring, ever-present, he's the perfect audience member and just what Norma Desmond needs to keep her sanity for as long as she does. Does he actually help her or is he ultimately responsible for her fall over the edge ? Max or Joe, who is the bigger culprit ? An interesting question that I'm not sure I could easily answer.Of course, many other people also help to keep Norma from the truth. Cecil B DeMille, her card-playing buddies, even security guards still working at the studio. If more people had reacted the same way as Joe did initially (dismissing Norma and prompting her reply of "I AM big, it's the pictures that got small") then maybe she would have eased back down to earth. If her ego and vanity would have EVER allowed it.The only real innocent character in the movie, the only one who doesn't help to perpetuate any fantasy and who doesn't act for purely personal gain, is Betty Schaffer. It is poor Betty who is quickly drawn in, chewed up and spat out by Holden's character (hmmmm . . . a writer responsible for breaking the heart of a young, up and coming lady . . . . surely not).I love this movie with all my being. I love the faded, preserved shrine that is Norma Desmond's house. The car and the swimming pool being returned to working order, just as Norma herself is, for the benefit of Joe. Are we watching Gloria Swanson playing Norma Desmond throughout this film or are we watching an older actress play every idol that we've ever discarded ? Is the movie disturbing because of the interplay of the characters or because we, as an audience, do not want to venture into this world of forgotten stars and empty theatres ? Am I reading too much into this film ? Maybe I am and maybe I don't care. Just see it and love it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stereotypes, famous lines and HollyWeird!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sunset Boulevard (1950) Hollywood is the land of dreams, fame, money, and broken hearts. "Sunset Boulevard" is an almost behind the scenes look at the industry and the type of people in it. Sunset Boulevard is a real road that runs through Los Angeles and Beverly Hills and features real Hollywood landmarks like the movie Mulholland Drive."Sunset Boulevard" opens with a murder scene, murder is always a hot subject in Hollywood, especially if it was someone famous or in the industry, such as Elizabeth Short, an inspiring actress became California's most infamous murder victim in 1947 because of the mystery behind her death and that she was actress and actor River's Phoenix who died from a drug overdose on the actual Sunset Boulevard, outside of the Viper Room. The movie also features a starving struggling writer and his experience with his rotten agent and the movie producer who wants to change his script. There's also the loyal butler, the fresh newbies to the scene writer and the party guy film crew worker. All of these stereotypes work very well to help create the world of Hollywood. They were made so stereotypical to the point of parody to show how crazy it can be to live in Hollywood, or as some people call it, HollyWeird! The bizarreness doesn't stop there, pet monkeys, Directors marring the stars, becoming their butlers, and super ego complexes.At the center of the film is Norman Desmond, as played by Gloria Swanson. Gloria Swanson wasn't by far the first person considered for the film, she wasn't even the sixth. But Gloria Swanson delivers one of the most memorable roles of all time with some of the most famous lines of movie history. Norman Desmond is a former silent movie star the world has seemed to forgotten, living in a huge run down mansion with a faithful butler. With a larger then life ego and in deep denial of her stardom, Norma is a diva that demands a lot of attention and often acts like the world revolves around her. Norma is writing a script when Joe first meets her and after reading it and hearing that it was written from the heart Joe says that it's the best kind of writing, but the script is heavily flawed. Norma longs to return to the limelight, she's had a taste of it and wants it back. She's also looking for someone to love and keep her company. When Joe arrives that fateful day Norma finds a gentleman who could help her with her script, but the relationship slowly grows and changes until Joe has become Norma's show boy. Joe doesn't really like being kept, but soon learns to live with it and enjoy the loveless relationship, well loveless to him. With Joe around Norma becomes more outgoing and ventures outside of her estate and sees more old friends. Much like Norma, Joe's taste of the limelight remains and he also gets caught up back in the industry and starts to enjoy writing once again.Casting is extremely well done for "Sunset Boulevard", it casts a former silent movie star Gloria Swanson who fit the role perfectly, to getting cameo appearances from other silent movie era stars. The casting adds to the world of Hollywood and makes it feel real with a real director playing himself (Cecil B. DeMille) and a director(Erich von Stroheim) playing the butler."Sunset Boulevard" contains everything Hollywood has: romance, power, money, deceit, actors, actresses, new comers, writers, directors, murder, a come back attempt, a studio and scandal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is without a doubt in my mind one of the best films ever made. We start out where our main character Joe is dead in a pool. This is the story of how he met his demise. The plot is that Joe is avoiding having his car repossessed by hiding out in an out of work actresses house, played by Gloria Swansen, who did the best acting job of her career in this film. It's a dark film, and almost seems as though it would have reached a cult status, but it reached a full fledged classic. It is one of the best movies out there, and my favorite movie (tied with Touch of Evil) from the 50's time era.My rating: ****/****. 114 mins. Not Rated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sunset Boulevard: Dead End Street</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sunset Boulevard is a classic. In 1950 when it was released, not everyone was thrilled - especially the head of MGM, Louis B. Mayer. He was upset at its dark portrayal of the inside of Hollywood. But he was in the minority. Luckily for us no one was able to stop the public from seeing the picture. It is one of the best movies made by director Billy Wilder and features former silent film stars, fresh faces, directors in acting roles, Hedda Hopper as herself, Jack Webb years before Dragnet fame, and a young William Holden in the lead. But the most amazing performance, by far, has to be the one given by Gloria Swanson - exceedingly dark and creepy! Funny, but she is playing sort of a version of herself - an aging, and largely forgotten star of silent films making comeback. Together, Swanson and Wilder create a character - Norma Desmond - who is equally bizarre and unforgettable. According to the documentary on the special edition DVD, Mae West and Mary Pickford, among others, were considered for, or offered the role of Norma before George Cukor suggested Swanson to Wilder over a casual lunch. Seeing the movie now, who would ever guess that she wasn't the first choice? There's no way the movie would be the treasure it is today without Swanson.The script is also top-notch with many memorable lines, none more so than the final one when Norma Desmond says: All right Mr. DeMille, I'm ready for my close-up.*SPOILER*After shooting Joe (Holden) as he tries to leave her, Desmond utters another classic: No one ever leaves a star. And my favorite is this exchange: Joe: Hey, you're Norma Desmond. You used to be big. Norma: I'm still big! It's the pictures that got small. *SPOILER*The whole movie is seen through a flashback, narrated by the already-dead-and-floating-face-down-in-the-swimming-pool Joe. Our first view of him is from the bottom of the pool looking up into his face, with the police and photographers gathered at the side of the pool about to fish him out. A shot that could be easily recreated today - but not in 1950. To simulate the view from below, the cinematographer had to place a mirror in the pool and shoot from above the water level to capture the images that Wilder wanted. It's very effective - a creepy way to start a very creepy movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wilder Plot Gets Wilder and Wilder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Billy Wilder's classic is one of my favorite excursions into film noir. Sensual, yet shocking imagery and a brilliant, but meandering plot runs the gamut and lead us to the tragic conclusion. My favorite scene is the bizarre and shocking segment featuring a dead chimp. Its quirkiness is right in line with the Wilder plot that grows ever wilder with each moment.Bill Holden is exceptional as the frustrated screenwriter Joe Gillis, who latches onto washed-up silent movie star Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) in hope of resurrecting both their careers. Along the way, he draws co-writer Betty into his doom. Despite herself, Betty ditches a good, decent lover for the mysterious, secretive Holden.How can this mess get any messier? Such is the talent of Billy Wilder. Check out the special DVD version, which will blow you away again and again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Swanson masterfully plays a has-been from the silent movie era, but you'd never know it to talk to her.She hates words like "comeback" and says "I'm still big, it's the pictures that became small" when Holden says "You were big". She lives in a fantasy world. Erich Von Stroheim plays a very attentive butler; he was previously married to Swanson in days gone by. I really like how the movie starts with the dead body of Holden and backtracks the rest of the way. It's very eerie that Holden is narrating his own murder, as well as the rest of the movie.

		<shortDescription>Like Norma Desmond this film has not aged well but still packs a wallop</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not quite the shocker it was in 1950, "Sunset Blvd." still packs a wallop. For most director/writers "Sunset Blvd." would have been the height of their careers, their masterpiece, but for multi-talented Billy Wilder there were better pictures. "Double indemnity," "The Apartment," "Some Like It Hot," and two highly underrated films "Ace in the Hole" and "One, Two, Three" are better written than "Sunset Blvd." Take off the tinsel and the viewer will find some cracks in "Sunset Blvd." One distraction is the narration by the body floating in the swimming pool. There's a cliché that dead men tell no tales. Well, a dead man tells one hell of a tale in this film. The movie takes forever to get to the essence of the story. It gets better and better as the movie progresses until it explodes at the end. The best scene in the whole film is the last scene when Norma Desmond gives what amounts to a soliloquy for the newsreel cameras. Some critics have labeled this a dark comedy. There is really not much that is funny in the film. Calling it a dark melodrama is more apropos. "Dr. Strangelove" is a dark comedy. Dark comedies make a person laugh at subject matter such as death and weapons of mass destruction that would ordinarily be taken very seriously. A good dark comedy also makes one think. "A Modest Proposal" by Jonathan Swift is an example of dark comedy at its highest level. Though "Sunset Blvd." certainly makes the viewer think, its punch comes from the drama of contradiction and social analysis, not in its humor.The film has a few other weaknesses but let's look at the tinsel. What tinsel! All the actors give magnificent performances. The best among the great is Erich von Stroheim. It's easy to forget what a wonderful actor von Stroheim was until one sees him in action. It is also rewarding to see Jack Webb in a non-tough cop or punk hood role. One forgets that he was a serious actor before "Dragnet" stereotyped him. William Holden gives one of his best screen performances. Gloria Swanson is just whom Wilder needed to pull off the extraordinary acting required for her role, plus she was the real McCoy so one of her silent films could actually be used to intensify the allegory. One of the best lines in the film is delivered by Cecil B. DeMille. He has pampered Norma, telling her what she wants to hear. But as she is leaving and out of earshot, he reverts to his true attitude toward the faded screen goddess. "Tell Gordon Cole to forget about the car. I'll buy him another, or even five if he likes." In the viewer's mind DeMille is talking about Norma, not cars. To my knowledge this is the first Hollywood film to deal seriously with the subject of Narcissism in the industry. Narcissism applies to Thespians but also to any person in a position of power. Narcissistic personalities simply cannot deal with life outside the limelight. They must have mass adoration at any price. If you haven't seen "Sunset Blvd." by all means watch it and form your own conclusion. It is certainly one of Wilder's best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating Tinseltown Expose</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film tells the story of an unsuccessful screen-writer, Joe Gillies (played by William Holden), who stumbles into a decaying Hollywood mansion owned by ageing actress Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), who lives there with her butler (the celebrated director Erich Von Stroheim). Desmond was a huge star in the silent age, but is now forgotten. She has been working on a screenplay which she hopes will make her a massive star again, and she wants the screen-writer to help her. This film is a quite fascinating take on the fleeting nature of Hollywood stardom, and the heartbreak that goes on behind the scenes of the movie industry's "dream factory". The film works also as a fascinating mystery, with one of the most famous openings in movie history. Watch also for cameo appearances by such luminaries as Cecil B DeMille, Buster Keaton and Hedda Hopper.</fullReview>

The needy, poor, commit crimes to get food to eat and lodging for the night because nobody shows any mercy or compassion to give them food and housing, just haul them to jail, because it is considered loitering to roam around the city streets when you are poor, without any money or home address, the police harrass you because its a crime to be poor and you are dangerous to society and need to be a prisoner and watched constantly because you look different, or perhaps you don't follow the crowd, anything the police or mental professionals or some social worker will make up some kind of disease or addiction to keep you in some kind of housing where poor folks who are rejects too, and fed with lies of being sick needed to be taken care of by some professional, in other words, you can't think straight, you live in delusions that you are a human being, we are your gods, and you are the dog to obey us, or else we will dope you so much that you will be zombie.. for the rest of your life or in a coma rotting in a hospital..

		<shortDescription>The point is, they remember.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has an eerie "Citizen Kane" feel to it. Swanson illuminates the screen as only a silent star could. As she puts it, "We didn't need dialogue. We had faces!" And oh what a face. Wildly lunatic and yet undeniably beautiful playing 50 although she was well into her 60's here. Swanson is the faded butterfly who was once so great that a maharajah once came all the way from India to beg one of her silk stockings. Later he strangled himself with it.There's every cliché of dark satire imaginable here. An organ that plays itself as the wind moves through it, a mysterious servant who is more than he seems, the cynical observer drawn into the intoxicating world of a bygone age preserved pitilessly inside a wax museum of a mansion where the ballroom was re-floored to please Valentino. The only difference is that it was the endless stream of imitators that made these things cliché. Sunset Boulevard was a shocking original that caused a scandal as it exposed the house of cards starmaker machinery that cast aside the Norma Desmonds of the world for lesser stars. According to Norma, "They took the idols and smashed them... And who've we got now? Some nobodies!"Of course Swanson's "I'm ready for my closeup, Mr. DeMille!" is what everyone remembers, but the point is, they remember. And they always will.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This seems to be William Holden week on AMC. Last night we saw "Sunset Blvd." and the night before, "The Country Girl." I was struck by the fact that, at the end of "The Country Girl," Grace Kelly (b. 1929) returns to Bing Crosby (b. 1901) &amp; everybody (presumably) cheers her fidelity. While midway thru "Sunset Blvd.," Wm. Holden (b. 1918) forces himself to get in bed with Gloria Swanson (b. 1899 or 1897, depending on whether you believe IMDb or Roger Ebert). So Swanson is an old hag, while Crosby is still a reasonably attractive guy. And the age gap is actually less between Holden &amp; Swanson. Go figure, but to me it looks like the double standard in action. The question is: Have we improved since the '50s in our attitude towards this sort of situation?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Excellent work of noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow... Sunset Blvd. is an amazing piece of film noir that excellently portrays the Hollywood of the 1950s. Gloria Swanson offers what is probably her best performance as she plays Norma Desmond, a silent film queen of the 1920's that wants desperately to be in the spotlight again. In her mind she is a true star, but Hollywood looks at her as a thing of the past. William Holden offers another great performance as the struggling screenwriter who shows up in Norma's life at the wrong time and ends up with much more than he bargained for. The set pieces of this film could not have been done better, especially Norma's mansion that seems like an eerie shadow of a time that Hollywood has forgotten. The excellent score adds to the mood even more. A must see classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but not among the greatest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sunset Boulevard is universally acclaimed. It is one of those films which should you dare suggest it is not among the greatest films ever made people think you're an idiot. Well, at the risk of being labeled an idiot, Sunset Boulevard is not among the greatest films ever made. It is a good film, certainly captivating in its own unique, macabre way. But is a film for which reputation outstrips reality.Most everyone is familiar with the story of Sunset Boulevard, that of faded silent film star Norma Desmond. The faded star lives in an equally faded mansion, plotting a comeback which is far-fetched to say the least. Failing screenwriter Joe Gillis stumbles into Norma's bizarre world and, at the price of his dignity, feeds her delusions. A man's gotta make a living and Joe will make his by brushing up the godawful script Norma has written as her comeback vehicle. Joe will soon realize Norma wants him as more than a script doctor. He is to be her lover, a kept man living in her grotesque mansion, surrounded by the relics of Norma's past, reminders of a life which for her is gone forever. Of course in her deluded mind Norma is just as big a star as she ever was. It's the pictures that got small.Gloria Swanson turns in a performance for the ages. Her portrayal of Norma does match the hype, even if the film as a whole may not. The descent into madness is breathtaking to watch. Yes, Swanson is a little over-the-top at times but that is who Norma is. Especially as Norma begins to lose all touch with reality. William Holden, playing Joe, is not bad but certainly not up to the level of Swanson. Joe is a bit of a dry character, he could use some more personality. Holden doesn't make him into as much of a presence as he really needs to be for the film to truly grab you. Erich von Stroheim, playing Norma's ever-faithful butler Max, does have a presence, a quite ominous one. But as we learn more about the character Max becomes less ominous and more sad. It's a sad world Norma Desmond lives in and that sadness grabs everyone who falls under her sway. Joe knows he has to escape. He tries to find happiness with beautiful young Betty Schaefer, with whom he secretly works on a script. But nobody escapes Norma Desmond easily.All in all Sunset Boulevard tells a very sad tale, centered around the quite pitiable Norma Desmond. Norma longs for a world which is forever gone. She won't accept it and nobody will try to make her do so. Max, her only companion before Joe shows up, allows Norma to live in her fantasy world. She retreats so far into her fantasy there is no way back to reality. Norma cannot be saved. She has lost her mind. And despite the fact she does some truly loathsome things you can't help but feel sorry for her. For you saw those moments where the old Norma Desmond shined through, where you could see her for the great star she once was. But those moments are fleeting and ultimately those moments are gone. Only a sad, pathetic shell of Norma Desmond remains. It's a sad journey the character takes, a journey Swanson captures ever so well. You just wish the rest of the film was up to Swanson's standard. Holden can't quite match her. Nancy Olson brings a desperately needed breath of fresh air to the film in playing Betty but the romance between Betty and Joe never fully sparks to life. von Stroheim is memorable in his own way but his character is ultimately almost as sad as Norma. So much sadness in this film. Sunset Boulevard has a captivating story to tell but in the end maybe there is a little too much sadness. And madness. By the end it veers dangerously close to parody. There is much to appreciate about the film but to label it as one of the greatest films ever is to give it more praise than it deserves. It is a good film to be sure. But perhaps upon close examination Sunset Boulevard is not quite ready for its closeup.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Firm from the starting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film is a true mastery in direction as well as screenplay. It was from Billy wilder, so I was expecting a lot of surprises like The Double Indemnity. He didn't disappoint me at all. The film is one of the best examples of films in which much thought is given for story. The thing which kept me attached was the authoritative narration. The story revolves around a jobless screenwriter who by chance got stuck with a silent film start and she started to love him. And after this started a series of dilemma in the mind of the lead character about the decisions to be made. Entertainment is definitely assured for true cine lovers.PROS:The fascinating stories, the powerful narrative, the character representation, were too good. The director has done a wonderful job. Billy Wilder has made a special place in my heart. CONS:Pardon me for bringing this, but the acting of Norma seemed to me as too much. Sometimes it looked to be as overacted. Now it is a different thing to say that she was acting something else in the film or two layers of acting. But that is not an obstacle.MESSAGE: "You never know what is ahead of you."VERDICT: "A must watch."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As we made our way down the IMDb's top 250, our group had no idea what to expect from this classic. What we got is a film so biting and so incisive it could still impart lessons in today's celebrity world.Gloria Swanson doesn't just steal the scene, she devours it whole as Lorna Desmond, former silent film star left in her rotting abode with her butler Max and a thousand photographs and souvenirs of a bygone era. She crosses paths with Joe Gillis (William Holden), who is escaping insurers in his broken down jalopy and happens to park at Ms. Desmond's place and a strange friendship ensues...Swanson is suitably regal as she delivers line after line to Gillis and the audience ("I'm still big, the pictures are small!" "We didn't NEED to talk, we had faces!") and sinks into melodrama while still keeping the stage presence of a true star. Cecil B. DeMille appears as the overburdened director of The Ten Commandments trying to fend off Desmond's advances and her script for Salomé. the purported capping stone of her career. Meanwhile, Joe is trying to blossom a script with Betty Schaefer whose husband is away filming...it all comes to a head when she meets Joe at Lorna's and Joe walks out on Lorna, sadly for the last time as she shoots him in the back and he falls dead in her pool."I'm ready for my close-up, Mr. DeMille!" are her last words as the mob of photographers and movie makers zoom on the radiant and crazed Lorna as she descends the stairs for one final post, screen queen to the end.A must for historical purposes or just for a look behind the scenes. Truly excellent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My father introduced me to this film when I was quite young and I never forgot it. He was clearly impressed with this film and I always respected his judgment when it came to assessing a good film. This film is beyond good. It is unbelievably good. There are so many reviews of this film there is no point for me to add to the generous accolades given by many reviewers. If you read a positive review accept it! If negative, reject it! This is one of the most amazing films ever made. Gripping to the end, this cinematic experience is one of the most exciting rides you will ever take. Gloria Swanson is strangely, eerily and inexplicably sexual and sexy in her role as Norma Desmond. I wonder if she knew what was going on when they made this film? And Erich Von Stroheim as Max Von Meyerling "You see, I was her first husband"...Wipe your feet"..."Gordon Cole"... is a frightening portrayal of death come to life which is masterfully rendered on screen. William Holden is perfect in his role as a broken down hack with no future who is dependent on the whims of a mentally deranged older woman. A great psychological thriller! Just see the film and buy to own! You will want to see this one more than once. Great for Halloween!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gloria Swanson Brilliant in Wilder Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Billy Wilder who has my vote as the Greatest Director of all Time with a body of work that is stunning: Double Indemnity, Stalag 17, Sabrina, and his comedic masterpiece Some Like It Hot, made his greatest film Sunset Blvd and today when I see it over and over I discover new tidbits of Information. Brilliant. William Holden who would win an Oscar a few years later in Wilder's Stalag and would star in Wilder's great late career masterpiece Fedora is superb as Joe Gillis. The key role in this movie is played to a fare thee well by Gloria Swanson who is magnificent, and gives in my opinion the finest performance by a female star ever; Gloria Swanson became Norma Desmond. As we know Gloria Swanson lost the Oscar to Judy Holiday for her wonderful Born Yesterday, seen today Swanson should have won. From the brilliant opening to the incomparablefending, this movie works on all levels. Masterpiece.Billy Wilder pushed the envelope his films, very daring, for example Some Like It Hot touched upon many themes one of course was Jack Lemmon's character wherein in the end it appears Lemmon and Joe E Brown will end up together.Wilder cast his films brilliantly with stars such as Stanwyck, Holden, Swanson, Monroe reaching new heights under his guidance. Billy Wilder had a bit of a stock company using Holden, Lemmon, and McMurray,over and over. One film that deserves reappraisal is the Kiss Me Stupid with a fine performance by Kim Novak. Other stars that worked for Wilder included a Who's Who of Hollywood: Marlene Dietrich,James Cagney Jean Arthur, James Stewart, Audrey Hepburn, Humphrey Bogart, Walter Matthau, Paula Prentiss, Henry Fonda, Shirley MacLaine et al.Bravo Billy Wilder</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How many times have you seen a story in flashback as narrated by a corpse? A story that tells you ?since the beginning of the first act? that its main character dies, and still keeps you interested until its conclusion? As if this were not enough for originality and commercial cinema value, "Sunset Blvd." is a great motion picture for other reasons: elegant "mise-en-screen", perfect balance between Gloria Swanson's acting style of the old school and William Holden's more naturalistic performance, an excellent score by Franz Waxman, and a story about love, chance, obsession, treason and delusion, far more important than its inside knowledge of the American film industry (which is indeed a bonus). If we still praise it after six decades from its release, just imagine the great impact it must have had in 1950.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sunset Boulevard</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Golden Globe winning, and Oscar nominated director Bill Wilder (The Seven Year Itch, Some Like It Hot, The Apartment), this was a film I had heard about for a few year, and being in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die I definitely wanted to see it. Basically set in the 1950's Hollywood, movie screenplay writer Joe C. Gillis (Oscar nominated William Holden) narrates the story going to flashback that leads up to the murder seen at the beginning. Joe is struggling to get his work sold to any studios and has debts, and one night he ends up with his car getting a flat tyre and at the mansion of a former silent movie star on Sunset Boulevard. Norma Desmond (Golden Globe winning, and Oscar nominated Gloria Swanson) lives alone with butler and driver Max Von Mayerling (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Erich Von Stroheim), and has been doing so for many years since losing her popularity, becoming deluded and demented since, believing that one day she could return to the industry. Max being her ex-husband and former director who still has feelings for her is very protective of Norma, but she wants Joe to move in to the mansion to write a new screenplay for her to make her comeback, and in the process her becomes her lover and gigolo. Even though he is getting paid for doing this, he slowly starts feeling trapped, and seeking friendship he leaves one night to see Artie Green (Jack Webb), and he bumps into studio reader Betty Schaefer (Oscar nominated Nancy Olson). They quickly become attracted to each other, but Joe still returns Norma feeling some very warped sense of loyalty to the old actress, of course he still meets up with Betty to help her with her own script idea. By the time it seems the couple have fallen in love, Norma finds out and feels extremely jealous, she tries to sabotage whatever they have together. In the end Joe makes the hasty decision to threaten to leave the mansion, and that is when Norma really loses her mind and shoots him dead, so he has been narrating from beyond the grave, and with the press showing up about the murder her demented mind of fantasy thinks that she has made her longed after comeback. Also starring Fred Clark as Sheldrake, Lloyd Gough as Morino, The Ten Commandments director Cecil B. DeMille, Hedda Hopper, Anna Q. Nilsson, H.B. Warner, Ray Evans, Jay Livingston and Sherlock Junior silent star Buster Keaton. Mostly all films about Hollywood before this were jolly and often musical, but this was the first to really show the cynicism and darker side, with fantastic acting, a witty script, and all the usual traits and tricks I have come to expect from a great film noir, a brilliant satirical drama. It won the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Music for Franz Waxman and Best Writing, Story and Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing and Best Picture, and it won the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Motion Picture Score, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography and Best Screenplay. "I am big! It's the pictures that got small" was number 24, and "All right, Mr. DeMille, I'm ready for my close-up." Number 7 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes, the film was number 16 on 100 Years of Film Scores, it was 52 on The 100 Greatest Films, it was number 16 on 100 Years, 100 Greatest Movies and it was number 12 on 100 Years, 100 Movies.

		<shortDescription>how the pictures got small</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A cash-strapped screenwriter, aiming to save his car from re-possession, stumbles into the crumbling mansion of an aging diva of the silent film era, Norma Desmond. Financial opportunity opens up, but at the same time personal dignity, a writing career, and more purist romantic opportunities begin to recede. And the workings of the Hollywood machine are laid bare in the process.If Sunset Boulevard were merely an expose of Hollywood machinations, it would occupy a niche nestling next to entertaining, but ultimately navel-gazing celluloid output such as The Player or Bowfinger. The fact that the film is an all-time classic tells you it resonates with universal themes, of identity, fulfillment, ambition, and love and all its compromises. William Holden is the cynic/dreamer writer Joe Gillis, self-assured in his contempt for Dayton, Ohio, but racked with self-doubt about his status in Hollywood. That ambivalence makes him easy prey for Norma, a veteran at 50 of an industry that has moved on without her on board. 'Eccentric' is an adjective reserved for the wealthy who are insane, and it is money, and the adulation of servant-with-a-secret Max, that keeps Norma from the gates of the Funny Farm.Gloria Swanson as Norma is electrifying; terrifying and pitiful, and utterly compelling. The excesses of the performance, seen in isolation, suggest an actress aiming at camp, but synthesized into the overall narrative are a portrait of a bipolar personality veering towards total self-annihilation. The younger lover, like her own movies that she screens constantly, allow her the illusion that time has not ravaged her life. It is an illusion her own ambitious craving for more screen time will destroy. Holden quite simply oozes cynicism and compromise. Erich von Stroheim, as Max, gives a performance of single-mindedness, his own devotion to Norma outstripping even her own egotistical self-delusions. Even Cecil B. DeMille manages to play himself straight, resisting the urge to wink at the audience, so that cameo does not come into it.Wilder directs boldly, setting his stall out from the off with a layered vision of a dead man in a pool, staring into the void, prodded at by police officers and photographers. An awareness of the interconnectivity between the cast, crew, characters and contemporary Hollywood history certainly adds spice to the viewing experience. However, Sunset Boulevard is an epic even when encountered purely in terms of the narrative contained within its 118 minutes running time. Cinematic storytelling at its finest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sunset Boulevard (1950 Paramount) is incredible for it's honesty and candor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sunset Boulevard (1950 Paramount) starring William Holden and Gloria Swanson is wonderful. Screen it often.It's about art, and about the trouble with art, and people part of art.Big egos, big ideas, no results, sad politics and back-stabbing on and on and on. William Holden, the then (1950) star of the movie is shown playing the role of a Hollywood "player" (a writer) who ends up with a lonely, humiliating death. He went on to win a Best Actor Academy Award for Stalag 17 (1953) and was future USA President Ronald Reagan's best man at Reagan's 1952 shot-gun, justice of the peace wedding to his pregnant bride, Nancy Davis (Reagan's daughter, Patty Davis, who went on to pose nude for Playboy Magazine, was born 7 months after the wedding...the bride, Nancy Davis, was later first lady of the USA Nancy Reagan..."good girls go to heaven...bad girls go everywhere!").Holden went on to die alone in a humiliating way in the early 1980's (found dead for days alone in his apt.), and Reagan went on to be USA President....occupied the White house when Holden was found dead.Holden became what he portrayed. This happens a lot in the movies. A word to the wise for movie stars and other actors...be careful what roles you play....you may end up playing these roles in real life.Gloria Swanson plays an old lady in this movie, and still hadn't reached age 50. Compare her with Cher, roughly the same age in Moonstruck (1987) who won a Best Actress Academy Award which included romantic nude sex bedroom scenes with much younger Nicholas Cage (roughly the same age as William Holden when Holden acted in Sunset Blvd. [1950]).Cher stayed gorgeous in her 40's, became the mother of a famous homosexual daughter turned "male" first named "Chastity," then re-named "Chaz," not a bit as pretty as Mom...bad weight problem, among other problems. That's Hollywood! Swanson and Cecil B. DeMille both acted in Sunset Blvd. (1950) and both were very good. Two of the biggest major players in silent era world cinema history....this movie is worth seeing just to look at them, see them talk, see why they were so good at what they did.The final scene shows the hero getting shot in the back....by the other hero in the movie.No epic is big enough for two heroes. Keep that in mind if you're a hero.------------- Written by Tex Allen, SAG Actor.

		<shortDescription>Sunset Boulevard</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was suspenseful but at times did seem to drag on. At the start of the film the viewer is introduced to the main character and the narrator of the film, floating dead in a pool. Right off the bat the audience is waiting for his demise during the whole film. Norma Desmond played by Gloria Swanson is one of those characters that the audience is just waiting to break. The entire film she seems to be on the brink of a meltdown and her obsession with reviving her movie career and her romance with Joe always seem to be pushing her closer and closer to the edge. In a way I found myself loving and hating Joe, at one second I would rooting for him to escape and be with Betty but at the same time he was stringing Norma along. The use of dark and light in the film give a real feel of what life was like for everyone inside Norma's estate. Most of the scenes inside her home are quite dark and gloomy while any of the scenes in which Joe escapes are bright and jovial. This reflects Hitchcocks use of dark and light in his film Notrious. Although the audience knows the whole time that Joe is going to be murdered and the film does not let you forget it, it really draws you in with the acting and camera-work.</fullReview>

While witty, it is savage, dark and original, and is quite simply too good to be missed. The story, while stark, is brilliantly constructed, about a former movie queen haunted by memories of her past greatness, and the script is both canny and knowing, sporting great lines such as "I am big. It is the pictures that got small". Billy Wilder, director of Some Like It Hot and Witness for the Prosecution, both of which are hugely enjoyable, directs briskly, and the black and white cinematography, sets and costumes are fabulous. The music score from maestro Franz Waxman is outstanding, haunting, rich yet beautiful as well.Bringing the screenplay and the story to life is the superb casting. William Holden is excellent as doomed writer Joe Gillis, who narrates in flashback from the scene of his death. Gloria Swanson though is a revelation as Norma, not only wholly convincing but also bringing a desperate and somewhat vampiric glamour to the role. Overall, Sunset Boulevard is a wonderful film, wholly deserving of its masterpiece status. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Different but still a grate film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film Sunset Boulevard was released in 1950. Billy Wilder has a unique directing taste. Gloria Swanson is absolutely amazing. She is perfect in this role. She seems so natural. Who better to play a part of an old silent movie actress than an actual old silent movie actress. William Holden is grate also. These two make a great pair. They have excellent on screen chemistry. I enjoyed the films structure. The story is told from a man who is already dead. Most of the film is told in a flashback of how his death came to be. The film is different. It has a creepy feel to it. Overall it's weird. At first Norma thinks Joe is a man is going to design a coffin for her dead money, How blizzard. In the end you feel bad for Norma. I knew she was mad but when she snaps it leave you wondering how anybody can truly be that far from reality, that far gone. What I enjoyed most about the film was the prop and costumes, the props especially. Norman's house was decorated so nicely, like real movie stars house. I found it to be interesting to watch a film about film writers and an actress. But unlike most of holly wood movie is it far from a happy ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I absolutely loved how the movie was scripted. I loved how the story was told. It's a struggle with Joe's life, and what he really wants from it, and I love how it was described. It seemed to me as a great mystery movie. But not your standard mystery. It more so explains why it's a mystery and that is why I enjoyed it. Full of mystery and some would say a love triangle. It's so devious as well. I could see why this movie was so well enjoyed when it was released. There are so many surprises and quirks in this movie that make it wonderful. I personally fell in love with just about every main character in this film. They are all very well distinguished. I recommend this movie to any age group, and this is a movie would see again!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The main actor voice is narrator to tell story about him, so the movie focuses on the story of the main actor. Besides, his voice sometimes describes what he is thinking. It makes the audience more understand the feeling of the character and makes the movie run more smoothly. Moreover, the background musics are very suitable with the scenes and the feeling; for example, the scene that the main actor came back from the party and went to see the main actress; the background music performed and stopped few seconds after the main actor said happy new year. In addition, the scene that the main actress did a joke to be "Charly" is very enjoyable with performing the background music. Finally, it is very weird to have the main actor voice after he died, and definitely the last scene that the main actress walked down from the stair like princess is very interesting the end scene that I have watched movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All She Wanted Was The Spotlight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Normally, I save these reviews to examine the technical aspects of what goes into a film. However, when a film like Sunset Boulevard plays across my screen, I feel compelled to go into a deep analysis about the story, especially one as self-aware as this.A screenwriter Joseph Gillis (William Holden) escaping from creditors gets a flat tire and parks his car in a seemingly abandoned extravagant mansion. He enters, to find the house very much inhabited by a faded silent film actress Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) and her butler, Max (Erich Von Manstein). This is what sets up the rest of the plot, and it's my personal belief that this entire movie was an allegory for the decline of the movie industry in the 1950s.Gloria Swanson, for one, is best known for her silent films - and she essentially plays a hammed-up crazy version of herself in this film, wanting to relive the vanity and glamor she once had on the silver screen. If she represents the old, Holden's Gillis represents the new - a writer trying to make it using hollow plot techniques (a baseball movie called Bases Loaded? Come on...) There are several industry in-jokes that make this movie a joy, including (but not limited to:) A screenplay that started about the dust bowl being filmed entirely in a torpedo boat, extras only being limited to three drinks of punch per, and the realization that actors make terrible writers.As stated before, though, it's the allegorical content that really makes this movie watchable again and again and again. If Gillis represents the new studio movement and Desmond represents ye olde guard, the story takes on a completely new light. New studios are hamstrung by the old crowd and the old standards (Hays codes, etc.), and they pass up opportunities on new properties and new developments (represented by Nancy Olsen's character Betty Schaefer), standing by fading stars holding onto their last glimpses of vanity, until they are literally bled dry and dying; as seen by Gillis' death. A fantastic movie, and I didn't even get to mention the cameo by Buster Keaton, silent film legend who unsurprisingly has one line of dialog.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could Be, In My Opinion, Wilder's Second Best Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A writer (William Holden) has a car break down and he comes to the home of a silent film star. She is trying to write a script and "hires" him to ghost write it, keeping him a virtual prisoner... yet, she showers him with gifts. Is it love? "Sunset Boulevard" is considered a classic, a bit of romance, some noir, and a drama... it connects to the real world of Hollywood (director Cecil B. DeMille and Buster Keaton make appearances) and adds a seedy side. Not too seedy, mind you... but there is some joking about the lead being a "Black Dahlia suspect". That such a gruesome case gets referenced in a movie taking place on a Paramount lot is a bit risqué, I think.The surprise star, aside from the obvious, is Milwaukee native Nancy Olson, who plays love interest Betty Schaefer (though whose love interest is a matter of dispute). She is quite beautiful, but never really became a big name (though she did make it into some notable Disney films).I suspect this film was an inspiration for Stephen King's "Misery" -- another writer held hostage story. King's has a bit more violence and torture, but the premise is similar. Take a dark plot and run it by King, it's bound to come out even darker... ("Misery" starred James Caan and Kathy Bates, who actually won a Best Actress Oscar for her part!) Take Billy Wilder's film noir masterpiece "Double Indemnity", lighten it up just a notch, make the plot more complex... and out comes "Sunset Boulevard". I daresay I preferred "Double Indemnity", but this may be a close second... though I have much more Wilder to go through before I can be truly sure!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sunset Blvd</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1950 dramatic film, "Sunset Blvd" by Billy Wilder was a very interesting film. I really enjoyed the storyline of this film, and thought the acting was well done, but for some reason i couldn't stand the character of Norma Desmond. I realize that she is supposed to be a crazy worn-out movie actress, but to me it seemed very forced, and fake. I feel like they could have approached her character in a better way, and quite honestly i couldn't get into the movie at all. I actually can say i maintained aesthetic distance the whole time. I did enjoy the usage of light, and how it symbolized fame. For instance when the spot light hit Desmond in the studios, everyone realized who she was and started to gather around her like before, but once the light was taken away from her, everyone started to go about their business again. I thought that this was very clever, and it gave us a glimpse of what she once was, and how the world has past her by. I give, "Sunset Blvd" 5 out of 6 chicken nuggets.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think it is always interesting when a movie presents the ending results first. Sunset Blvd in my opinion was an interesting and well done movie. "Im ready for my closeup Mr. Deville." is one of the more famous quotes in movie history. The one part that i thought was a little weird was the dead monkey scene. its not everyday you see a person with a pet monkey. but the way Norma Desmond acted, was alittle weird and obsessive for my taste. the funeral ceremony of the dead monkey in Norma's courtyard must have been for one important chimp. the lighting and picture of this black and white film noir are captivating and impressive;example, the strange butler playing the creepy organ in the middle of the most deep and dustiest sets ever. For Holden, he has the voice-over of the perfect narrator for this movie. How little did he know that when he pulled his car into a driveway off of the boulevard that it would change his life forever! He is the symbol of the struggle to get notoriety. Swanson as Norma Desmond is the symbol of lost fame and has become the talk of legend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good homage to every important film genre before 1950.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Story wise, it's good. It starts off with a film noir style introduction that feels slightly forced, but the movie has a self-awareness about it that doesn't try to make fun of movies as much as it pokes fun at how silent films had become extinct and how movie making had changed. The movie quickly switches genres like Zombieland. One scene is straight out of film noir; another scene is out of a screwball comedy. It is easy to see how the movie comes together after seeing the first scene, but it gets increasingly interesting and unpredictable until the final moment when you really can see how everything happens. The final scene feels like a glorious send off with lighting present everywhere showing how much technology is necessary for a glossy scene of glamor. Parts of the movie felt like watching someone else in the movie watching a movie. Also I was eating a blueberry muffin while watching it and that made it better for me.The movie was very well cast. All parts were played very well. It was almost creepy because Gloria Swanson's character almost felt like the real her if she were instead insane and experiencing delusions of grandeur. Cameos by famous actors and Cecil B. DeMille as themselves made it feel even more surreal like it was a documentary, but it was far from it.Lighting and sound was good. It matched the scenes very well. I wish I could talk more about it, but I think I have went over this movie enough and there wasn't much I can remember that was revolutionary for the time.</fullReview>

They had a fake background while driving the cars that was really unrealistic. Loved the staircase design in the womens house but the pictures of herself were a bit much and it almost always seemed dark in the house maybe because of her attitude she seemed to be a dark sad woman. music went with everything especially when it was dramatic like when the man finally got mad at the end. There were some things that caught my ears not my eyes like the verbal usage the rainbow was the bathroom, he used the word gilluopie (sp) to refer to his car and the white elephant to describe her house. overall this was a good move I enjoyed it very much.

Much like "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf," one person watches and laughs while another watches and cries. I laugh all the way through. Gloria Swanson lost the Oscar that year to Judy Holiday but it was a tough year. Bette Davis was up for All About Eve as well. They all deserved it. William Holden found his way into two of those movies but his role of Joe Gilles was far superior to what he did in Born Yesterday that year. Joe Gilles lived on and found his way into Robert Altman's fabulous "The Player." This is the movie that I watch once a year just as an homage to Billy Wilder, may he dance in entertainment heaven for ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>William Holden was forced to do this film noir classic? That is hard to believe. Billy Wilder directs Gloria Swanson and a host of players know for other things like Buster Keaton, &amp; Jack Webb in a very well made stab at Hollywood.Swanson is the over the hill silent movie actress still in her mansion years after her star has faded looking for eternity or her next role. Hauntingly, eternity seems much closer as that next role. She screens her old films in her screening room and has little room for the outside world.Holden is a drunken screenwriter who gets involved with Swanson because he has kind of hit bottom. The film starts with a dead body floating in the mansion swimming pool and then goes back to what led to it being there. Wilder made a lot of fine films and this ranks right up with the rest of them.</fullReview>

Demille as himself and without naming a giant Buster Keaton,in a cameo of luxe,so deserved in a sad as real story but to think:How many great old stars may be this way!Or perhaps the inhumane machine of the stardom doesn't matter at all, persons can pass away but the unfair system no,its rules don't know anything about the human cravings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Few Perfect Movies in Existence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the one hand, it seems pointless to add yet one more comment to the numerous comments already here testifying to the greatness of this film, but I love this movie so much that it seems just wrong to not have it included in my index of reviews.There are only a few movies I've seen that I would be tempted to label perfect. "Bonnie and Clyde" is one. "Taxi Driver" is another. These films are unimprovable as far as I'm concerned. Add "Sunset Boulevard" to that list."Boulevard" represents Billy Wilder at his most acidic and ghoulish, but it's a testament to his genius as a film maker that he could create a film as relentlessly bleak and cynical as this one and make it devilishly entertaining (and even quite funny at times) rather than unbearably depressing.There's a big fat heart at the center of Wilder's bitter pill, and it's one that could be easily missed amid the dark, film-noirish exterior. I think that ultimately "Sunset Boulevard" is about the love of movies. You can tell that Wilder loves movies as much as the sad and decaying film star Norma Desmond, played brilliantly (and I don't toss that word around lightly) by Gloria Swanson. But he understands with an insider's point of view that there's a seedy underside to every business, and that's what he sets out to expose in his film. Movies get made and stars are born, but for every birth there's a death.I don't know how much of Swanson's performance is acting or her just being herself. If you allow yourself to think about it too long, Wilder's use of her is almost cruel, as making fun of Norma Desmond the character nearly amounts to making fun of Swanson the actress. The whole movie is uncomfortable in that same way--it's like a bunch of Hollywood used-to-be's got together and decided to let themselves be parodied for a greater cause. But the film stops just short of cruelty, because in many ways Norma is the most sympathetic character in the film, and every so often there's a glimpse of the vulnerable human being underneath that ridiculous getup that begs to be loved, and who can't relate to that? William Holden is perfect in a non-showy role that it would be tempting to pass off as an easy one. But I don't think it is an easy role. Holden has to be responsible for tempering the audience's reaction to Norma--he's the moral conscience of the film, and his steady presence anchors it and keeps it from sailing headlong into camp.There are so many quotable lines in this film, I don't know where to begin. Imagine this film and "All About Eve" coming out in the same year. It's a movie quote fan's wet dream.In an eerie bit of prophetic trivia, apparently Gloria Swanson thought this film would signal such a major comeback for her that she began plans to write a stage musical based on the film, starring herself. (She might even have gotten as far as completing it). Of course nothing ever came of it, and Swanson sunk quickly back into obscurity. But she would be vindicated to know that a stage musical did eventually appear, courtesy of Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber, and it actually does quite a bit of justice to Wilder's film.Grade: A+</fullReview>

So, I decided to reenergize my faith in Hollywood and I'm watching nothing but the classics now. Who hadn't heard of some reference to the line "Mr. DeMille, I'm ready for my close up"? But unfortunately I never knew what film that came from.I purchased the book "1001 movies you must see before you die" and finally the reference was answered and I rented this movie without hesitance. Sunset Blvd. is just an incredible movie and just so amazing. I wish there were movies like this now a days. I loved Norma's character, just how insane she was yet trying to stay so glamorous. You felt so awful for her character despite everything. And not to mention an unforgettable ending to this great story. High recommended! There is hope for Hollywood, there is! 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know why I'm attracted to this film. It is such a sick presentation of greed and pity. William Holden can't face the music in his life and so he latches on to this over the hill, mentally ill, star of silent movies. He does the gigolo thing. We can only imagine. He can't get off the mark and leave, though he has numerous chances to do so. Gloria Swanson as Norma Desmond gives the performance of the century. She is vulnerable and evil; she has the power from her wealth to keep Holden in check. Most people who portray these kinds of characters are hard to believe. She is a bundle of eccentricity and believability. And, like a little boy, he can't leave his mother. We get glimpses of his other life which seems glamorous and exciting, but he cannot give up that financial support and sells himself out; unfortunately to the nth degree. Billy Wilder is a skillful director and what he does with the black and white images (this film has to be in black and white) with the Norma Desmond poses and dreariness of her existence, just works so well. Of course, we all know the final scene. She is not to be dismissed to the very end.</fullReview>

Now that 75 is the new 50, it's hard for us to imagine the sheer moxie -- and the steep risk of career-poisoning mockery -- put into play in 1949 when a 50-year-old actress long past her glamor-drenched prime became Norma Desmond, the only living soul who doesn't know her day is done and her sex appeal is long gone. I can't think of a precedent for a woman taking on such a perilous role in a serious movie, and I doubt that any of today's maturing -- OK, aging -- woman stars would do it on a dare, let alone agree to play side-by-side with film clips from their glory days. There are a few better films and a handful of better performances, but nobody ever undressed her own persona on screen with more daring and to better effect than Miss Swanson.

		<fullReview>Deservedly a classic of American movies. It holds up in spite o the ongoing parodies on the Carol Burnett Show, which sank some lesser movies. (Maybe they were homages as well as parodies.) A very dark movie, with everything right ion place. Holden is excellent, though at times his voice-over narration is a little arch. Swanson is fascinating. (What could this possibly have been like with Wilder's original choices -- Mae West for Norma and Montgomery Clift? Clift would have been good but West, much as I love her, would have sunk it.) Holden's interest in Nancy Olson has never quite made sense to me. She is attractive and appealing but her wholesomeness breaks the mood. That may have been the writer and director's intention. If so, I'd call it misguided. But who am I? Bill Wilder is one of the finest directors this country has ever known and I do not propose to second-guess him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Boyo-2 wrote: "Gloria Swanson must be commended for her bravery in taking a part which may or may not have echoed her own Hollywood career." I completely agree. With many members of the public, real-life and screen can become blurred. Other actresses had turned down the role of Norma Desmond, and Ms Swanson, who was not in any way like the role she played in this film, showed real guts in accepting the role.The arrival of talkies came really quickly. I have read through some of the film magazines at the time. I read letters from the fans displaying undying love for Clara Bow, Norma Talmadge, Jack Gilbert etc. Within the space of a year the fans had dumped them in favour of the new talkie stars. This film is a possible scenario of what might have happened to one of these stars.Like Miss Havisham in Dickens's Great Expectations Norma Desmond still lives in a time warp. She is still a star, and she is planning her big comeback. Her manservant, ex-director and ex husband humours her. But one day reality comes in the shape of her toyboy played by William Holden. She cannot face reality, so she kills it.This is possibly the first time that Hollywood got to grips with the stories of what has happened to people who were spat out by the film industry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Odd But Compelling Masterpiece...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally saw Sunset Boulevard on DVD this week. I had never seen this classic film before. Gloria Swanson made the most of this comeback role by delivering a great performance as silent film legend Norma Desmond. Creepy and self-delusional, Norma has basically imprisoned herself and her manservant Max in a run-down Hollywood mansion. Life at the mansion is disturbed when young script writer Joe Gillis (played by the always excellent William Holden) uses the garage as a hideout running away from his car's repo men.Events begin to unfold which leave Joe questioning his own morality and standards. I won't get any further into the plot details just in case there are any other people out there like myself who haven't seen this film.A few interesting details I have learned about this movie which might interest some folks out there. Both Mae West and Mary Pickford were offered the Norma Desmond role before Gloria Swanson. Mae West didn't get it because she wanted to rewrite much of Norma's dialog. That was not acceptable to director Billy Wilder, who didn't allow any deviation from the script. Mary Pickford always retained ownership rights to her silent films. That wasn't going to happen with Sunset Boulevard so Pickford was out. Montgomery Clift was first offered the pivotal role of writer Joe Gillis and actually accepted the part. Thinking about the role while on vacation in Europe Clift came to the conclusion that the "kept man " aspect of Joe Gillis' relationship with Norma Desmond too closely mirrored his real life relationship with a wealthy New York socialite. Clift turned the role down upon his return to America.Hollywood had very mixed reactions to this film. Famous MGM mogul Louis B. Mayer stormed out after an early screening of Sunset Boulevard and engaged Billy Wilder in a very profane tirade accusing Wilder of stabbing the film industry in the back. Wilder gave as good as he got to the red-faced Mayer. If you haven't seen Sunset Boulevard do yourself a favor and check out this classic. It will stick with you for a while.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic psychological Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently bought this classic on DVD and just last night had a chance to watch it.Being quite young I was amazed to be so impressed by a film from Hollywood's yesteryear. But then again that was the point of the film (Spoilers coming up).The film deals with Hollywood's evolution and taps upon the superficial nature of the industry especially how it treats it's workers!Gillis, superbly portrayed by Holden, is a screen writer down on his luck who accidentally becomes involved with Norma Desmond, Swanson, silent film star of Yesteryear. Wilder uses his key figures to represent the different ages of Hollywood. Norma Desmond "Queen of the silent film" star of Hollywood's Golden era is all but forgotten as Hollywood starts to make films with sound. Gillis whose scripts were popular during the Silver age of Hollywood are suddenly not popular any more as he can not adapt his style fast enough to the demand for riskier story lines. Finally the beautiful Betty Schaefer (Olsen) who represents the future of Hollywood.The film's main point illuminates how as Hollywood changes the people that helped build it are left behind when they cease to become popular. Desmond becomes a hermit - recluse from an industry and fans that deserted her. But in a chance encounter with Gillis she sees an opportunity to come back into the industry by way of a new script she has been working on. The film traces the start, peak and ultimately the demise of the relationship between Desmond &amp; Gillis. A metaphor for the start, peak and ultimate demise of the eras they represented.Very intelligent and well directed film with Stella performances from all key cast &amp; crew.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>for the high quality and the success ,Billy Wilder is to me the greatest director ever.He was probably the first (and only) director to make "smash-hit masterpiece" among all the great directors ever no one as him found so much public glory.Look at his film:none of them is dated,(as capra one's for example).The role of miss swanson was first gave to mae west which refused but gloria accepted and she really made a herself wonderful biography,cause the relationship with von stroehim was(almost)really the one described in the movie.Can you believe the initial scene was actually filmed in the early 50?so innovative,if you think that there were the years of doris day movies too,well.... a scene is always in my hearth:when Holden and the girl are walking down the studios and she starts to tell him about her nose-job.I found it so modern,so true and so acid in a certain way,but everything is to mention in this movie cause every sequence is amazing(the visit at the studio,the card game with buster keaton,the first year eve party...)I don't have so much DVD cause I use to buy DVD of only movies I will love too see over and over again.That's one of it. claudia</fullReview>

I remember being in Spain...But anyway, as much as I love Billy, this is a very good movie, but it's not perfect. The first 30 minutes are, that I admit, but then it slows down. I know that this is intended. The second act is all about being trapped in this bizarro world, but since you do know how it's ending and no other person appears, the end is too obvious. The only thing is to guess who will be pulling that trigger, isn't it?!Btw, I love DVD, and the audio commentary is really useful in this one. There are some hidden jokes, you will not get unless you were living during these days or you have done extend studies of the history of Hollywood, for example the dialogue with the producer. I do agree with everyone here that it's great acting by all the cast.So I will settle for a 8 or maybe 9 out of 10. Macaulay J. Connor</fullReview>

Getting old may be seen as an end, as something people should be afraid of. I it isn't. I think everything depends on the way we seen things. Some people just don`t accept the way things get different as years go by. They find it difficult to understand what is happening around them. That`s the idea of this film. An old actress still live the old years she was successful and doesn`t really see people don`t think of her anymore. She lives alone in an old big house and she is assisted by a loyal man who serves and takes care of her. One day, a young writers gets there by chance and he gets involved with the old lady. That`s when the movie really begins. These two people discuss their points of view, talk about their experiences and make us feel good watching it all. I can`t tell much of the film, cause it talks by itself. I just have to say Billy Wilder is brilliant! He shows again he was one of the best directors ever! I also have to say people should have more respect for the ones who came first. Old people still must be heard and respected, cause they will always have something to say and to teach us.My grade 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had seen this back in 1950 only once, and had forgotten how it started but today having seen it on TCM TV, now I know what all the fuss was about. It was about a silent screen star, Gloria Swanson, who after her career ends obsessively keeps thinking she is always the star; a young reporter lives with her to get her story. But she kills him in the end in a rage of jealousy. What aroused my excitement was all the famous oldtimers who appeared as themselves in Gloria Swanson's career were also in this picture, ie. Director Cecil B. DeMille as director; Eric Von Stroheim as her valet (he was a very strong director in her early years), and many other famous people. William Holden was nominated for his role as the writer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An argument for black and white</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are three reasons why I love this movie: Billy Wilder, Gloria Swanson, and black and white photography. Don't misunderstand me, I love the other actors (Holden is his usual solid self)in this film, but Swanson's performance has to be one of the small handful of all-time great performances by a leading actress (my other favorites are Meryl Streep in Sophie's Choice, Bette Davis in All About Eve, and Katherine Hepburn in The Lion In Winter). Unfortunately for Swanson, All About Eve was released in the same year, so Swanson and Davis cancelled each other out and Judy Holliday stole the Oscar for Born Yesterday, one of the All-time Oscar travesties. Swanson puts it all out there for us in this film, and we all get to just eat it up. She's nothing short of mesmerizing in this film...just try not to pay attention to her and you'll see what an act of futility that is.Wilder? Quite simply, he's my favorite director of all time, and this may well be his best work. Eight Oscar nominations for Best Director! What's even more amazing is that he was nominated twelve (that's right, twelve) times for Best Screenplay! How many contemporary directors also write their own work? I don't mean to disparage modern directors; on the contrary, I don't expect directors to write the story as well as tell it, but that's what made Wilder so special. His works include Some Like It Hot, The Lost Weekend, Stalag 17, Sabrina, The Apartment, Double Indemnity, and Witness For The Prosecution. Counting Sunset Boulevard, Wilder has six films in imdb's Top 250, with none of those lower than 170. That's one hell of a resume folks!Finally, the photography. If anyone ever remakes this film, shame on them. Not only does this film HAVE to be in black and white, but it's just impossible to imagine improving on the way it is filmed. Rarely have I watched a movie and gotten the creeps just from the atmosphere of an old house, but this film does it to me every time, and I've seen it several times! For William Holden, this house becomes something of a prison, and just getting out of it means everything to him. We the audience come to feel the same way.A great, great film, one of the best ever. Check it out and enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sunset Blvd. II: Norma Lives!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a rule, I'm against gratuitous remakes of film classics, but the cynical yet poignant story told in Sunset Blvd. is so timeless that it could easily be redone every ten years or so, like A Christmas Carol, with each version chronicling the slow decent into madness of a different fading movie star and his show business contemporaries due to their abandonment by Hollywood. For example, Sunset Blvd. 2002 could star Jack Nicholson as Norman Desmond and Roman Polanski as Max. They spend their evenings screening Chinatown again and again while complaining bitterly about the "weasles at Paramount" who won't return their calls. Jack sits stooped over his typewriter for days on end, adding yet another scene to his mammoth comeback screenplay, 'Five More Easy Pieces', while Roman pens phony fan letters for his deluded boss, scented with Chanel #5. Jack works tirelessly each day except Wednesday, when Warren Beatty, Peter Fonda and Karen Black come over and, between bong hits and hands of canasta, swap bittersweet stories of the good old days of Hollywood, before "the suits" took over. Jack's downfall is completed when naive young screenwriter Heather Graham rejects his leering attempts at seduction and is found face down in Jack's swimming pool, bludgeoned to death with his best putter.Next week: Nick Nolte and Walter Hill guzzle lukewarm Old Milwaukee and throw darts at a poster of Eddie Murphy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best female performance of 1950</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Words can't describe just how magnificent Gloria Swanson's performance in this movie is. Her performance is absolutely the best female performance of 1950. It's one of the greatest performances ever. She plays a flamboyant former star of silent films, named Norma Desmond, whose career (and sanity) went down the drain when "talkies" came along. Norma has all the money in the world, yet it can't buy her happiness...and that's a lesson she learns the hard way. Swanson plays this character so amazingly--I could not imagine any other actress (not even any of the better known "great" actresses) playing this character. Swanson had a certain presence, an exotic quality, a radiance--something that suits this eccentric character perfectly. She just shines throughout the whole movie. I especially like the chemistry between Swanson and Holden. Plus, Von Stroheim is impressive as Swanson's butler. Their performances are what make this film great....them and the remarkable cinematography. A great film, though it's not the best film of 1950. Still, it's a true classic. Interestingly enough, Swanson herself was a star of silent films whose film career faded away once the silent film era was over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Forget "Citizen Kane"! Forget "Casablanca"! Forget "The Godfathers"! Forget all the John Ford's westerns! Besides, forget all that theory-of-montage-invented-by-Eisenstein stuff. The true genius of cinema has a name: BILLY WILDER. And "Sunset Boulevard" is his best film. Not of him, in fact, but of all time. It's a disgrace that he has lost the Academy Award for "All About Eve" - another great movie - but this became another of the countless injustices of the Oscar's history. There is not any other movie director that can show a filmopgrafhy as the one Billy Wilder. The 40's and specially the 50's was a example of masterpieces, one after another. Of course, I admit that he didn't maintain the same level after this time. "The Apartment" was its last great movie, in spite of him to have made great works after this, as the overlooked "The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes" and "Fedora" - almost a "Sunset Boulevard" re-make. But "Sunset Boulevard", reviews today, it stays with its qualities, witty, intelligence, cynicism. It's the screenplay - perhaps Casablanca also deserves this honor - it is that possesses more brilliant sentences, that until today we know by heart. It's my film number one, in any list of best movies of all the times!</fullReview>

It is a film, that many may not know, inspired future generations. Maybe even actors and directors who have never seen this are using some of the same techniques used in this film.

		<fullReview>The first time I viewed this film in 1950, I was spellbound, even though it was in black and white, just seeing a man floating in a swimming pool face down in a dead man's float, had me wondering just where this picture was going to take me. William Holden(Joe Gillis) "Picnic"'55 I had seen before in other films. Gloria Swanson (Norma Desmond) "Airport"'75 kept me wondering why she was so attracted to Joe Gillis, who could have been her grandson in this picture. After seeing Erich von Stroheim (Max von Mayerling) "The Mask of Dijon" '46 who gave a very strange performance as a butler, housekeeper and who was madly in love with Norma Desmond along with acting like a Nazi and her personal film director. I just wondered how the story was going to turn out in the end. Billy Wilder brought back to the screen in 1950, great Silent film stars with Gloria Swanson and Erich von Stroheim who was an assistant director to D.W. Griffith, "Birth of a Nation". Gloria Swanson was a famous actress and after this film, her career took off once again, with Films, Television and many business ventures. When Billy Wilder made pictures, they all became great CLASSICS for all generations to view and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yet, Another Wrong Turn.Now, here's a real piece of over-rated, vintage rubbish if I've ever seen some.And, Yeah-Yeah - I know that Sunset Boulevard (SB), like Citizen Kane, has been praised, since its initial release back in 1950, to the frickin' high heavens by critics and film-buffs, alike - But, hey, it's now 60 years down the yellow brick road, already, and, sorry, but SB just doesn't pass the mileage test as a 'Classic' of movie-entertainment, at all. No, it doesn't.Of course, I really liked actor William Holden as Joe Gillis, the out-of-work gigolo/screenwriter in SB. Sadly enough, in 10 years time Holden would become a chronic alcoholic, eventually killing himself in a drunken fall. Prior to that fateful moment, Holden was, without question, one of Hollywood's most attractive and likable male actors of the 40's and 50's. His presence here in SB can certainly attest to that appeal.But - On the other hand, I totally hated Actress Gloria Swanson, big time. I thought that she was a thoroughly despicable cow. (Moo. Moo.)Ironically, here was Swanson, the frickin' Hollywood has-been, playing just that on screen as Norma Desmond, the aging, Hollywood has-been. About the only diff between Swanson and her character was that Norma Desmond was a certifiable nut-case - While Swanson, herself, wouldn't reach that stage in her career for another 10 years when Alzheimer's finally sent her flying over the rainbow, for good.Back in her early twenties, Gloria Swanson, had once been the paid mistress of producer/politician, Joseph Kennedy. Joseph Kennedy was the father of sons, John and Robert, through his mousy, little wifey, Rose.Kennedy had actually financed a number of Gloria's starring vehicles early on in her career. With each one being a subsequent flop, one right after the other, this would eventually seal the inevitable fate of Kennedy's little, hush-hush affair with Swanson, who was an utterly awful actress, indeed, even back then.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I long ago taped every Billy Wilder movie off TV I can't resist seeing them again on the Big Screen as part of the Wilder retrospective running at the NFT in November and December. Every movie Wilder wrote and directed was on the Great side of Good but seeing all the titles in print in a brochure reinforces just how many GREAT movies he made. Somehow he contrived to make two back to back just as the forties gave way to the fifties and then damned if he didn't do the very same thing as the fifties in turn became the sixties. The first two were Ace In The Hole and Sunset Boulevard, the second Some Like It Hot and The Apartment and I've yet to mention Double Indemnity (only his THIRD At Bat as a writer-director in America), The Lost Weekend, Stalag 17, Sabrina, A Foreign Affair, One, Two, Three, etc. If ever a film NOT made by Orson Welles had 'masterpiece' written all over it Sunset Boulevard is that movie. Every frame is touched with genius and in this film Wilder elevates Biting The Hand That Feeds You to an Art Form. Everyone and his Uncle Max knows by now the story of how third-rate writer Joe Gillis (William Holden) fetches up in the Gothic manse of has-been Screen Goddess Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) and winds up as a gigolo and ultimately a dead gigolo but over and above the storyline it is the 'touches' that make this so great both in dialogue (Betty: How've you been keeping yourself lately? Joe: Actually I haven't been keeping myself lately) and visuals: Norma Desmond represents a bygone era and ironically it is Cecil B DeMille (playing himself) who tells Norma how far pictures have progressed and is THEN revealed to be directing wearing the riding breeches which were de riguer for movie directors IN THE SILENT ERA, a wonderful, typical and classic Wilder statement. It would be superfluous to merely repeat what other posters have said here but we can never repeat the word Masterpiece too often in connection with this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Historical Document</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clearly a 10 star movie when current, the film today is more a document of times gone past than a gripping drama. The reason is simple - our society today isn't anything at all like it was in 1950 or so. The tension created by the (then) inverted relationship shown between male and female lacks any traction today. So this movie is today enjoyable as a window of what society thought proper over 50 years go. Swanson gives a superb performance which many take as over the top chewing the scenery today. However, you need to keep in mind that the sort of excessive emoting she does in this movie is stylistically in tune with the way silent stars needed to act to get their message across. Yes, I agree with those who've said the plot is silly, outlandish and contrived. So what? The plot only exists as a vehicle so the movie about relationships can exist. I'd suppose the enjoyment of this movie would be proportional to your age. A 75 year old personally remembers those times and would find it personally interesting. A 50 year old would have heard of those times and find it interesting in what he missed. A 15 year old would view the movie as a bizarre bore unless he were a student of history or the movies. A good accompanying movie to this one would be 'Detective Story' with Kirk Douglas - again from the same time period. Like here, the tension generated by the central story is laughable by today's standards, but resonated with audiences way back then.</fullReview>

The thing putting the ending as the starting point of the story kind of reveal everything left in the story once the gun comes to mention. I like Gloria Swanson's acting in depicting the semi schizophrenic old star. Nancy Olson acted out just enough to have the balancing side for the story.

		<fullReview>Crazy experience.A scriptwriter and his crisis. A butcher like master of a quarter and his strange raw material. At final, a touching new Charlot who moves rules and lives.It is a comedy, a game, a joke-film, an experiment. New "Brazil" with others colors, muted blacks and strident off-whites, homage for expressionist art and fears of Mitteleuropa, different Amelie Poulain's tale, slice of surrealism or dreaming trip.The limits are chimera for director and the acting projection of glamors images. Nothing is not real, every nook is shadow of first movies, a drop of French cinema lives in every gesture and the characters are puppets of a hare-brained puppeteer.Briefly, acid sarcasm, mannerism traces , a monkey's funeral and strange characters. At final, the love-story who saves the world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So THIS is where Carol Burnett got it from</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During 2002 and 2003, I had the opportunity to see reruns of Carol Burnett's variety show, which I had seen a few times when I was younger. One of her zany characters was based on Norma Desmond, and she even showed a clip from this movie to explain where the character came from. Gloria Swanson came on the show as a guest and praised Carol's performance. And no wonder. Swanson herself was only slightly less outlandish! This movie may not have been considered a comedy, but Norma Desmond was certainly a funny character, when she wasn't being pathetic. Carol played the character for laughs, of course, but it's easy to see why this, one of her favorites, was a great movie to spoof. Max was a straight character here, but on Carol's show Harvey Korman lampooned the director-turned-servant to the washed-up has-been-star. And this character was just calling out to be spoofed, now that I've seen him. I don't really see what was that great about this movie, but Swanson was wonderful, even when she played the Desmond character straight. You have to feel sorry for a woman who was once a star and can't bear to live life without the limelight--Max even wrote fake fan letters. Erich von Stroheim also came across very well, even though he wasn't funny. Cecil B. DeMille was a pretty good actor, even though he just played himself. William Holden did a good job also. I kept hoping his character would learn to stay out of trouble, but he just couldn't seem to get a break.</fullReview>

In fact, it exceeded my greatest expectations by far. It is so cool. I found it to be fascinating. The character of Norma Desmond is so kind of freaky it's interesting.

		<shortDescription>a disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion Sunset Boulevard was a bland film that left me completely indifferent. The thing I disliked the most about this film was the character development. Joe along with the rest of the characters were two dimensional and flat. The acting by Gloria Swanson was distasteful and overdone which made the film more of a soup opera with an uninteresting story line. I had high expectations after watching Wilder's some like it hot but after watching Sunset Boulevard I was not impressed. In the films defense I am not a big film noir person, I would much rather watch a psychological thriller like Psycho or The Talented Mr Ripley. In conclusion the three words that would best describe this film would be obvious, long, and overdone. I definitely think this film is an acquired taste.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was left with an extremely odd feeling after I watched this film. It left me with this ambiguous and bittersweet feeling and it actually took me quite some time, in which I had to roll it around a bit in my head, before I could figure out whether I enjoyed or detested the movie.The character of Norma Desmond certainly drove me up the wall. I pitied her but at the same time felt an odd disgust. However the huge old mansion that she resided in was spectacular, glamorously decorated and covered with nostalgic photographs of her back in her glory days when she was a silent film star. I think that this more interesting extension of Norma Desmond and her world maybe made her a bit more tolerable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Never has there been a movie made with more passion. It was just made in the wrong year (1950, or it would have won every Oscar and other award. (Too bad All About Eve) William Holden has never been more valiant and Gloria Swanson is beautifully cast as the aging actress. And has there been anyone as creepy as Erich Von Stroheim in a movie since? The answer is no! It is brilliant because it adds suspense, love, hate, allusion, and foreshadowing all together in less than two hours. I just wish that there were still movies made like this gem today. There are, of course, great movies still being made (Mostly by Scorsese and Eastwood), but this classic is will forever be one of the greatest ever filmed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Upheaval of gender roles real subject of Wilder's harrowing masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nineteen-fifty proved a spectacular year for Hollywood. The studios enjoyed maximum power and influence, following a decade of unprecedented numbers of ticket-buyers. Never again would `The Industry' ride so high, with (among other factors) the advent of television. And three movies released that year have attained almost scriptural status, at least among acolytes sharing a rarefied if rigorous cinematic faith: All About Eve; Caged; and Sunset Blvd. All three glitter with brilliant epigrams flashing from the polished facets of their gem-like scripts - lines that have entered the language at large, often quoted in ignorance of their provenance.All About Eve was a theater story but Billy Wilder's Sunset Blvd. was THE Hollywood Story. (Caged was a women's prison story; enough said.) And it is as a myth about movie-making, and the erratic trajectory of stardom, that Sunset Blvd. most frequently merits attention. But of many movies made about Hollywood, none can claim the peculiar potency of this masterpiece, which can still wring from viewers those old Aristotelian emotions of pity and terror (plus a good deal of unholy fun).Its corrosive force springs from the fact that Sunset Blvd. is, first and foremost, about that oldest and deepest of human preoccupations, gender. It tells of catastrophic upheaval in the long-honored `natural' order of affairs between males and females: A virile young man falls prey to an older, more powerful woman. His tragedy is not the watery end into which he plummets but the slow and painful process of emasculation to which he has given tacit consent.Ohio newspaperman Joe Gillis (William Holden) went west to make his fortune writing pictures, but he works in his bathrobe in a one-room apartment three months behind in the rent. His car payments are in arrears, too, so his attempts to elude repo men become the fuse that ignites the plot. A fatal turn takes him into the driveway of 10086 Sunset Boulevard, the Gothic manse where, in wealthy if stifling seclusion, lives legendary queen of the silents Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson). She grants him asylum, in his view a temporary convenience. But she has other ambitions.At first those plans seem to be a rather hopeless pipe-dream about returning to the screen, through the vehicle of her screenplay Salome (another cautionary tale of reversed gender roles). But soon the resourceless Gillis finds himself accepting her largess (a garage apartment, vincuna topcoats, a gold cigarette case inscribed with "Mad about the boy") and her control (from `And must you chew gum?" to `Of course you didn't - I wouldn't let you'). Once Desmond sinks her talons into him - and Swanson's own stint in the silents pay off handsomely, for no one in the sound era ever deployed claws like hers - he finds he cannot leave, even at the cost of his self-esteem and greater happiness.The third character in the movie offers a dress rehearsal of the submissive role Gillis is bound for. Desmond's Teutonic butler Max (Erich von Stroheim) caters to her every whim and guards her castle of illusions. In a role suggestive of the male - and generally gay - assistants, publicists and fans who cluster dotingly around female stars, he fusses over girlish details (`Madam will pardon me, but the shadow over the left eye is not quite balanced").As the movie charts its inexorable course, new humiliations and revelations strip layer after layer from Gillis' own illusions. In a chic haberdashery where Desmond takes him to smarten up his wardrobe, a clerk whispers, "Well, if the lady is paying, why not take the vicuna?" (Holden wordlessly reacts with rage and shame.) And when he sneaks back from what Desmond suspects is a night of tom-catting - he's actually writing a script with a young colleague (Nancy Olson) who's falling for him - the vigilant Max lurks in wait for him. Challenged by the fed-up Gillis, the butler reveals not only that he discovered Desmond when he was the great auteur Max von Mayerling (Stroheim, of course, was a grandiose director of the silent era), but that he was "Madam's first husband" as well. In the hard-as-ice script by Wilder and Charles Brackett, this stands as, hands down, its chilliest moment. (By contrast, its sunniest involves Desmond's return to Paramount studios, when a light swings upon her so a new generation of actors and crew can pay homage to her glory.)Sunset Blvd. catalogues the kept-man's degradation to which Gillis acquiesces. He's moved from chauffeur's quarters to the lavish suite adjoining Desmond's - and from which, owing to Madam's "fits of melancholy," the locks have been removed. He endures the raised eyebrows of Desmond's bridge partners (Anna Q. Nilsson, H.B. Warner and Buster Keaton) when he interrupts their game to ask for money. He finds himself as the sole guest (apart from Max and the orchestra) at her New Year's Eve soiree, tangoing on the tile Valentino told her to install, where she finally confesses her love for him. (As though he never expected this development, he storms out to a raucous party among his young former friends, only to race back after she swipes his razor and succumbs to her melancholia.) He even lets her towel off his bedewed torso after a dip in the pool she has had filled for him.Desmond, in a nutshell, has taken a scalpel to his manhood long before the final denouement - precipitated by one final, doomed bid for freedom. And perhaps he prefers the end that he must know awaits him to taking a bus back to Dayton with his tail tucked between his legs. But fate proves `strangely merciful' to Norma Desmond. In the movie's last, most iconic scene (`I'm ready for my close-up, Mr. DeMille'), she once again triumphs under the harsh lights and in front of the clattering cameras. The full fetch of her looniness at long last unleashed, she gets what she wanted all along: not the boy she was so mad about but the "return," however delusional, she craved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well, I've finally seen it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not really sure what to say about this film. You have to be a little crazy to want into an industry whose motto is "what have you done for me lately", but then again Norma Desmond played by Gloria Swanson is a little touched in the head to begin with.Fame and wealth for being popular with people is a pretty heady thing. Just ask any professional athlete. For the aging actress in Hollywood s golden era it's a death knell. The kind of thing that can drive a person insane. And so it is with Desmond, the kind of actress who wanted nothing but attention, and not the ability to work the inner craftsmanship that goes into a major motion picture. She misses the attention, the glitz, the glamour of being "a star", and nothing more. Like another reviewer stated, this is a pretty cynical film. But it's also over the top, which offsets the imagined cynicism. I guess there's a romanticism there that personal attachments will clash with business practicalities, and that that collision will produce an attention getting dynamic for all to witness. Norma can't see that the latter is what's pushed her aside, and that not matter how much she fawns and desired to be fawned, that her glory days in the eyes of Paramount Studios, are over. It drove her crazy.As for the rest of the film, like I say, it's over the top. The performances are borderline melodrama, the plot is thin but plausible for a woman on the wane, and the characters, like the film, are also a little too much as well.Well, I think of my own film career, and I wonder if I'm not on the Norma Desmond side of things at this point in my life. Eh, like I give a damn.See it once. If you're into the whole "Hollywood" thing (you're a woman or homosexual man with stars in their eyes, and like "glam"), then this might entertain. It's touted as a classic. I can see why, but I wouldn't rank it as one.Just me.p.s. with all of the sugary and happy Hollywood endings of other films, this one was intentionally geared to go against the market trend, and it worked.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Magnifacent Hollywood Satire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sunset Blvd. is, though it is not considered, a satire. It tells a story of madness and corruption that thoroughly describes the way Hollywood was back then. There are three things that make this film great: 1)The Story: the classic tale of a star that has faded into Hollywood obscurity and driven herself mad by obsessing over the glory days of her youth. She finds her way back into the spotlight when she meets a young screenwriter and she thinks she is cured but doesn't realize that she is slowly fading deeper into insanity.2)The Director: Billy Wilder's ingenious direction is what practically makes this film. His intricate eye to detail is one of the things that makes this film a success.3)The Stars: Gloria Swanson, William Holden, Nancy Olsen, and Eric von Stroheim are the people that make this film what is today: a classic. Gloria Swansons stunning performance as Norma Desmond truly deserved the recognition that it received. I think her performance is the greatest of all time and was totally robbed of the Oscar for Best Actress.All in all, this my favorite movie and it is one of greatest films ever made.(P.S. This so should've won Best Picture instead of All About Eve. I mean, All About Eve is a great film but not as great as this one.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Betty!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Man, sure seems like people love to write mini-books on this site about Sunset Blvd. I'll try to keep my opinion concise and to the point. First, don't shoot me, but I think this is a good movie, but not a great one. It could have been a great movie, and it's certainly a classic, but I think it falls short, and here is why. The forgotten movie star living in a dilapidated, spooky mansion off Sunset Blvd. is a terrific setting. Great casting abounds with Gloria Swanson and hottie William Holden, and the strange friends each of them have. But for me, this movie falls apart every time they pull away from Gloria to concentrate on Joe and Betty's budding romance. Why devote so much screen time to a bland character, Betty Schaefer, struggling to write a who cares script called "Dark Windows" or whatever it's called, when we could be spending more time with faded, kooky Norma Desmond in her scary house with Max? Face it, no body writes volumes about Nancy Olson's character do they? We all know who makes this movie great, and it ain't her. The only fun scene with Betty is when Norma (surprise!) is tracking her down on the phone. I know Betty must provide a jealous factor for Norma, but her character could have been so easily pushed into the background, way into the background, and still have a suspicious Norma think that Joe is cheating on her. Same results, same ending, but less Betty!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD !!!Brilliant film, it's true, the actors are amazing, but too many twists and flaws make the whole situation hardly credible in my opinion.So the servant turns out to be the husband who used to direct Norma in her films and he has now become her slob who perfectly accepts the presence of this other man (Joe Gillis) in her life just because he wants his wife to keep living out her fantasy... that's a bit hard to swallow.And why does Joe feel so trapped ? I never quite got that ! So he has people trying to repossess his car ? Big deal. He could hide in a million other places and still work on his script with Norma from there... he doesn't *have* to stay at her place if he feels uncomfortable there (that is before he starts finding advantages in her wealth) ... but somehow he feels he has no alternative... yet he does.Anyway, despite these two major flaws (and other minor flaws), the film remains extremely enjoyable 50 years after its release.After watching this movie, I find funny to notice the growing interest of people for psychiatric cases in movies ("Psycho", "One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest", "Birdy", "Whatever Happened To Baby Jane ?", "Rain Man", ... ).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay, definitely not great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was okay.Gloria Swanson stole every scene she was in, and her expressive slightly overacting perfectly reflected her character, a performer from an age where vivid facial emotion was crucial in the absence of spoken dialogue. Eric von Stroheim plays an understated role and provides a strong, often silent presence. And William Holden is pretty, but not much else.Honestly, the only person who is remotely sympathetic or identifiable is Swanson's character of Norma Desmond, and the rest are fairly awful, aside from Stroheim's Max, who is basically very interesting scenery; I was pretty sad to reach the end and feel that everyone had basically come away with more or less just desserts. Holden's character was especially difficult to like and seemed to choose, at any given time, the worst and most idiotic possible choice of action.Was this Wilder's attempt at self-parody? Some parts of it would seem to be more satirical than serious, and the whole thing was entirely over the top. It could work as a Gothic tongue-in- cheek work, something like the Addams Family meets the silent age of film, which had aged past its prime.Perhaps it's just that the premise and the characters that populate it cannot really be seen the way they might have been in 1951. Desmond and Max's pathos and need for love and companionship juxtaposed with their isolation in a decaying yet still darkly splendid palace cannot fail to draw sympathy and interest. But Holden's Joe is just a stupid schmuck with a pretty face who never does anything right and was a poor choice for a protagonist.Ultimately it's hard to feel anything for him, though part of that may be the truly asinine choice to begin a film knowing your protagonist is...well, see for yourself. Or don't. It's good for a watch. I don't think I'll ever need to see it again.</fullReview>

He would eventually become crazy, too. Now that would be great! Gloria Swanson's 'eager-for-attention' acting is nice, but maybe somewhat overacted. Cinematography is beautiful, though. After all, I find this movie overpriced. 8.7? Come on! Sunset Blvd. is good film-noir, but it's silly to consider it as one of the best movies ever produced.</fullReview>

I liked how it was about a faded movie star. It was something different that you didn't see a lot in the early 1950s, rather then all the glam. I have to say that I did like the soundtrack, it was a mix up which I really don't usually like. The camera work was great and the sounds.

After gradually developing Norma's character, the plot took off and my enthusiasm for the film rose exponentially. The ending was absolutely brilliant; setting Norma up to have her believe that she was being filmed for the picture that she wrote and had been preparing for. if Norma's character had not been so mentally unstable, i don't believe this film would have succeeded as well as it did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>People now a days are coming up with ways of making some hard earned money for themselves, mostly to pay off bills, pay off loans, buy food and clothing for themselves. It's important for people to earn their money the honest way, not by bribery or as an excuse to fall in love with somebody. It's also important not to be too obsessed with yourself and your achievements. Nobody's perfect in the world.The voice narration spoken by the main actor throughout sections of the film was deep and well spoken. The narration helped make the film feel like a crime movie by it's spoken visualizing details and mood the main actor was portraying throughout the film. At times, the narration make the viewers feel like they're in the Twlight Zone. The cinematography throughout the film was good. The slow montage that was used to show the title of the film was suspenseful and dramatic with the musical composition. There are many uses of scenes fading in and out of the bedroom scene as the screenwriter is alone writing the actress' screenplay. The closeups of the screenwriter looking into the bedroom and of the screenwriter talking to another man were well focused in mid-tone greys and well situated in their sense of depth. The use of artificial shone on the actors and their reflections on the wall were well shown in their dark contrast. The acting in this film was played out well.Although at times, the long takes dragged on the plot for a period of time, the movie kept up its suspense and drama through its great acting, lighting, mood, narration, and musical score that made the movie good. I would recommend this movie if you're interested in watching great Film Noir films.</fullReview>

Swanson delivers a very good performance, but it lacks the complete mastery of her craft that Bette Davis delivered as Margo Channing in a much more moving and self-aware performance. Swanson was a great star but she always delivered her lines over the top and frankly I don't think she could have delivered her lines in this movie any other way. She was limited.The direction is excellent and in cinematography alone can this film be said to be superior to All About Eve.I never found William Holden particularly interesting as an actor but he does a credible job here.

		<shortDescription>'The address is 10,086 Sunset Blvd.'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Sunset Blvd.' is widely regarded as the first movie which took a no-holds-barred look at Hollywood itself, and the unflattering side of movie-making. Gloria Swanson, 53, a real silent film star, plays Norma Desmond, a silent film star who used to be 'big' and was now just an almost insane shadow of her former self. Swanson had been in 67 movies before Sunset Blvd., and was in fact near the end of her career. Five years before his role in 'Picnic', William Holden, 32, plays Joe Collins, a 'B'-grade scriptwriter that can't get scripts accepted anymore, and is three months behind in both his rent and his car payments. That these two characters' lives would become intimately tangled resulted from one random event, the car tire's blowout. There is little fiction here, aside from the characters' names. The real studio is featured, as are the great director, CB DeMille, and silent stars like Buster Keaton playing bridge with Norma and others. As a pseudo film-noir, it is shot in B&amp;W, which works for this story. The DVD has a great-looking picture, with several worthwhile extras. A good movie.SPOILERS follow, for my own recollection, quit reading, OK??The movie opens with Joe floating, dead, face-down in a pool, but still able to narrate. Six months earlier, Joe was running from the guys out to repossess his car when the tire blew out. He turned into a driveway and into the garage of an apparently empty and dilapidated mansion. He is invited in, thinking he was the man to embalm and bury the dead pet Chimp. Soon he finds out that a middle-aged lady and her somber butler live there, then surprised to find it was Norma Desmond, who was writing a script for DeMille for her to star in a movie. The script was bad, but Joe needed money so agreed to work for $500 weekly to help her rewrite the script. Not wanting her script to leave, she required him to stay in the room above the garage, and the next morning he awoke to find all his belongings from his apartment now in this room! Plus, Norma had his back rent paid. He became a kept man, showered with new clothes and other gifts, although he knew the script would never be made into a movie. A roof leak over the garage forced him into the main residence and, when Norma dressed him up for an elaborate New Year party, and he found out no other guests were invited, he fully realized her intentions towards him. Angry he left, she slit her wrists, he came back, began working nights on a real script with a young lady, Betty, fiancee of his friend Artie (Jack Webb), who was out of town on a shoot, Joe and Betty appeared to be falling in love, Joe not wanting to wrong his friend, brushed Betty off, headed with his suitcase back to Ohio, Norma shot him, three times, he fell into the pool, when newsreel staff arrived, Max her butler said 'The cameras have arrived', she walked out to them as the movie ended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>sunset boulevard 50 years on remains the best movie ever made about Hollywood. a terrifying movie, all the more terrifying because it is true. everybody talks about Gloria Swanson's's magnificent performance, but it's William holden's cool persona, compared to Swanson's's over the top personality as Norma Desmond, that helps make the striking differences between the two main character more effective.horror is not about vampires or werewolves; it's about seeing the true, terrible reality of the world, and in a place called Hollywood where hypocrisy reigns supreme, stabbing in the back is the best known form of entertainment, there are victims such as Norma Desmond who are given the world and then have it taken away from her for ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Classified as a film noir, or a black comedy it held true through and through. The movie started out with great imaging in the first first few scenes of seeing Joe dead with his eyes wide open basically looking at you in the pool. I noticed this whole movie was based around that one big pool. Then, once the image is set in our mind, the story and plot comes in, and time is reversed back to where it all began. This was the first film that I have seen where the Mis-en-scene was really breath taking. It was the first film where a movie used real names in Hollywood at the time. Wilder showed that the set was at Paramount Pictures. Wilder showed how movies were started and made. Also, this was the first movie of that time where i noticed other references to movies in the film. First film I have seen relevant to todays time period. Great lighting throughout the film. The settings looked expensive. Yet again, I have seen this house before in other films. They use the same houses to film quite often. Gloria Swanson was a great, intense actress. I really felt her character during the whole movie. I loved how she went insane at the end over her fame and not being what she once was. She really pulled this character off and made it believable. It was a good movie, I wouldn't watch it again, but it was worth watching the first time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overrated but memorable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Slightly overrated classic that is really only great at times because of Swanson's performances - the rest of the film doesn't live up. The crazed Norma Desmond has got to be one of the most bizarre and memorable characters in all of cinema, and Swanson really made it all happen. The story leaves something to be desired, even if it is well-written, as there's not a whole lot happening, and the acting, while good, never even comes close to Swanson's performance. That may be more due to Swanson than the others, but no one else really impressed. Certainly not all Oscar-calibre performances, as all of the main four were nominated. The direction is solid but not really impressive - I only got a sense of the bizarre through Swanson's performance, not the direction - and the jabs at Hollywood, while humorous, are pretty tame. Still, a memorable flick, though not one of the best of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tried to watch it again last night with the same result. I just simply don't care about either Norma Desmond or Joe Gillie. Gloria Swanson is just too hideous to look at . All that clenched teeth, bugged out eyes,and spider like movements. It's a great performance I suppose, but not one that in any way gains sympathy.If anything she's repulsive. Holden is Holden. If you like him you probably like the movie. I'm not a Holden fan but I thought the film would be great in spite of him. Like for example Bridge on the River Kwai. However he doesn't help things here and to me he is just too boring of an actor to be of interest. Kind of like Joel McCrea or Van Johnson. Add to that the narration. It's funny at times, nicely cynical as well. But there's too much of it. The movie is over-narrated and by a guy who is dead. Wilder doesn't allow the scenes to breath. Holden's narrator continually interrupts to tell us what is going on. All in all Sunset Blvd. is one classic that doesn't hold up.</fullReview>

It could have been a great one, had there been more dialogue. The scant dialogue and the abundant narration are major flaws. There should never be narration in a movie. Things should explain themselves. The plot is too schematic, too thin to really involve one's emotions. Movies in general contain too much action and too few words. They shun anything that a might be difficult for a 12-year-old.</fullReview>

I think many actresses from that time period, including Joan Crawford, could have done a much better job.Holden, as an actor and narrator, did a great job as usual. I also thought the movie was a little too long. And Erich Von Stroheim, nominated for Best Supporting Actor also did a good job.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dom De Luise once uttered a line I use quite often:"Nice, not thrilling, but nice!" That's exactly how I feel about "Sunset Blvd.", because as much as the first 30 minutes of it were extremely promising the overly long and much less entertaining middle just slowed the pace a gear to many. I somehow hoped that Joe Gillis would get himself mixed up in a murder case or something, when in fact he wound up being a victim of one in the end. Good performance all around, although not really Oscar worthy(maybe the fact that I saw "A Man For All Seasons" just a couple of days ago speaks for itself). I truly hope it wasn't the murder plot or shall I say the final "twist" that impressed so many viewers, because as much as it is unusual (and for that time perhaps almost revolutionary) I saw it coming a mile away, which is the main reason with my disappointment with "Sunset Blvd." Once I knew exactly what was going to happen there just wasn't any fun in watching the lonesome and forgotten old silent-movie actress tormenting herself and others anymore. I can't figure out why this movie stands so tall in the IMDb 250 greatest; a great beginning, a nice ending and some of the best narration(By William Holden) ever put onto the big screen, but the predictability of it all made "Sunset Blvd." overly long and not nearly as pleasing and good as it could have been. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Billy Wilder's "Sunset Blvd." is definitely a classic film with many memorable moments, but I can't help but think that it would have been better without the narration by William Holden's character. I think Gloria Swanson's performance deserves it's place on the list of all-time great ones and Erich Von Stroheim was very good as well. William Holden wasn't bad, he was quite good actually. It was his narration, however, that bothered me throughout the film. I was watching the final scene of Norma Desmond coming down the staircase and I thought to myself, this would be so much creepier if we didn't hear Joe Gillis' voice. Anyway, that's just my thoughts. Despite all that, this is still one of the great ones.10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wilder's Oscar winning noir psychodrama "Sunset Blvd" pales in comparison with many middle tier films of today in spite of being revered as a classic. In keeping with the public's appetite of its time, "Sunset..." is melodramatic, fraught with overacting, and promotes a plot which raises more questions than it answers all in the interest of entertaining a movie going public hungry for escape from the memories of global war and the realities of reconstruction. Telling of a reluctant gigolo and hack screenwriter who is kept by a has-been Hollywood silent screen star on the verge of madness, the film is rendered like a jig-saw puzzle with characters distorted as necessary to make them fit the desired end result. In spite of its shortcomings in light of present day cinematic capability and technology, "Sunset..." is an interesting watch and a durable film. As with another Wilder film, "Sabrina", a contemporary remake could please Hollywood exec's as well as the public at large.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Billy Wilder always liked the obvious and easy things. For instance, Jack Lemon is the "middle American everyman", Marilyn is the dumb girl, Stanwyck is the blonde wicked vamp, Stroheim is "one of the three grands directors of the silent era", Swanson disguised as Chaplin, etc. His films are often overwritten (lines like "next time I'll write "The naked and the dead", "who wants to see a film about the civil war?", etc.). "Sunset Boulevard" is a typical Wilder film, full of obvious and overblown things like that, but is a film that it gets better as the decades pass by, I don't know exactly the reason. It is a film that is "so bad that is very good". Perhaps in ten years, another awful "wilderiana" as "The big carnival" (almost worse than SBoulevard) will be also redeemed by its campy flavor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Somewhat Dated Hollywood movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That's how I felt about the movie overall. Certain aspects of the film seemed dated. But there are many aspects that are quite relevant too.It has an interesting premise. A struggling screenwriter Joe Gillis(William Holden) starts living with an old star of the silent era Norma Desmond(Gloria Swanson) in order to write a screenplay for a movie she wants to act in(which is supposed to be her big comeback). Joe is amused by Norma's behaviour. She still lives in an illusory world in her mansion where she is still a big star. Her faithful servant Max Von Mayerling also feeds her ego and keeps telling her that she is a big star. Norma begins falling in love with Joe and gives him presents in order to keep him. The movie then follows Norma's degeneration and the final over the top conclusion. The situation of old actresses who were stars in the past is very well portrayed in this movie. The dry humour and sarcasm in this movie is also an aspect that raises it above the other classics of the Old Hollywood era. It can also be seen as a satire of the Hollywood system. The scene where the director tells his assistants not to call her again - the same director who had once promoted her heavily - is a sad scene which shows the fleeting nature of showbiz. The portrayal of Norma's obsession with Joe is also excellent. The way Joe gillis uses the opportunity to his own advantage is also quite funny in a sad depressing way.The attitudes of the people reveal a somewhat dated attitude that doesn't quite fit in today. The scene in the shop where the shopkeeper says "Well, as long as the lady's paying for it, why not take the vicu?a?" shows a somewhat derisive attitude towards a woman having a "trophy man"(while the opposite has been accepted). The attitude of Joe Gillis also seems dated. He behaves as if he is embarrassed that an older woman is interested in him. The line "I had to be with people my own age." shows the derisive attitude he has towards Norma's love towards him. I felt that the movie was a bit behind the times in these aspects. The ending was also a bit too over the top for my liking.The performances are top notch. The laidback acting style of William Holden is complemented by the over the top performance of Gloria Swanson. The over the top performance was appropriate in this movie, I guess. In many scenes she even seemed cute when she proclaims that she is one of the biggest stars. There is a likability to her character even though she seems a bit unhinged throughout. Nancy Olson is gorgeous and she is adequate for the role. Erich Von stroheim is very good as the faithful servant Max and it is surprising to note that he wasn't a professional actor while doing this film. Cecil de mille's cameo is actually quite good.I liked the movie but felt that the movie seemed a bit too dated for my taste. It can be taken as a stinging critique of Hollywood that is relevant even now. The dated aspects prevent it from becoming a great movie though.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Insufferable in some respects, although perhaps purposefully so. The story dragged on and on though the ego-trip of a silent actress who is struggling to be revived in the industry. Norma Desmond's infatuation with herself and total reliance on being 'known' is part of why I struggled so much through the film. If anything, I sympathized for Joe, forced to live with this person who expected everything to be as she imagined. What makes this film interesting is the story-within-story of the decline of the silent movie actor juxtaposed against a silent era actress acting as the silent actress in decline. The cast is full of silent actors, including Norma, and directors. Even the gossip at the end of the movie was a actor-turned-gossip in truth. Perhaps it had been a stretch for Mrs. Swanson to accept this role. I can't imagine that very many silent-era actors enjoyed the advent of 'talkies'. (possible spoiler:) Also, having the whole story told by a dead man is an interesting take on things. For all that he was murdered, he gave a rather kind story to the one who killed him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just okay</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought that this movie was quite interesting. Did I like it?! No, not very much. But I thought that the idea and the story line behind the movie was very well thought out. Unless you are an actor or actress yourself, nobody really knows what goes on inside the head of a burnt out or out of work actor. We learned this from Gloria Swanson's character, Norma Desmond. Norma was a silent film star who was intending to make her way back into the spotlight and dragged Joe Gillis (William Holden) into her crazy made up world where she would eventually become a movie start yet again. I thought that the acting was fine, and the cinematography was nice, which makes it seem like I enjoyed the movie; but towards the very end of the movie, I was just begging for it to end. I felt that the story was played out far too much, and I just didn't want to watch it anymore. Maybe it will be better if I watch it again, but I'm not sure if I could sit through it one more time.</fullReview>

It is so stereotypical of how the media views washed up celebrities. I do not understand how this film is rated so high. It is a decent movie (a borderline good movie) I should say but the story, plot, and directing is uninspired and unimaginative compared to the other films rated high on the lists of film critics. My review of this movie may be a little off though as a mere 24 hours earlier I had watched zoolander for the 3rd time. Which by the way brings me to another point.

		<fullReview>Sorry, I have to align myself with those few other reviewers who found the movie, well, trite. Not that it didn't have its moments -- that particularly riveting scene, for instance, where Norma sits in DeMille's chair and a stagehand acquaintance puts a spotlight on her and people begin crowding around her, how spooky can you get? But by and large, Gloria Swanson hams up her lines to the point where she becomes a TV skit caricature (only this skit goes on way too long), Holden runs his lines off too fast, and von Stroheim mumbles all his lines indifferently (I picture him saying to himself, "Here I am, the genius who directed 'Greed', and what am I doing today??"). Let's face it, folks, this is the kind of claptrap that made the revolution in film-making some 20 years later so necessary, films like "The French Connection" and "Raiders of the Lost Ark" sweeping away the cobwebs of crass melodramas like "Sunset Boulevard" and never looking back.

		<fullReview>William Holden 32 play Joe Gilles an unsuccessful script writer who while being chased by men trying to repossess his cars has a blowout and ends up in Norma Desmond's (Gloria Swanson 50) driveway. Norma is an eccentric has been star from silent pictures. Gille decides to make money out of Swanson by helping her write a hopeless movie script she is obsessed with...he ends up as her lover out of pity...and is killed when he tries to leave her.I was disappointed. This movie has such an aura and I only watched it because I had just watched Witness For The Prosecution (which was excellent) and wanted to see what else Wilder had done.This thing starts out bad with Holden narrating quick cynical tough lines setting the stage for things. These lines are corny and unconvincing to modern audiences. That turned me off immediately.The movie reminded me of Oliver the 8th with Laurel and Hardy (good flick) only this was a dead serious noir/horror movie instead of a comedy. The stereotyped butler (from Transylvania type) is totally unbelievable as Norma's first husband and her first film director just one of many silly unbelievable parts of the story.Since this movie is so ballyhooed and doesn't measure up I gave it a 4 (normally something like this would get a 5 or 6 from me). That it is number 12 on the list of all time great movies just shows you what sells to the public = nothing that can with stand any intelligent analysis.DO NOT RECOMMEND</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A writer(cinema or any other subjects) who has to live with bad economical conditions is wanted to pay 300 $ that corresponds to last instalment of his car or to give back his car. He never finds the money that he needs and while one day driving in road he sees the men who ask for payment priorly. Running away from those men, tyre of Joe Gillis' tyre goes off and he has to drive in a old large estate where an old film star accommodate. This star is Norma Desmond and she shares the big house with his servant Max who is her first husband. Desmond wants to patronize Gillis and he is wanted to edit Desmond's story. Gillis is obliged to accept this proposal but by the time he follows other jobs and Desmont believes lots of people are still fan of her, but she doesn't know the reality that Max writes those letters to her.Anyway,Desmont goes to an old director for a new film but she doesn't know that she is called for her old car upon using in a film. Desmont also envies Gillis and she disturbs his partner for a project by calling her.Till this point, the film is very boring so that I can play Solitaire in a small window at the same time. But the last three minutes are very creative in which Joe invites her friend and partner Betty to face up with reality. He rejects Betty and after that also Norma. Norma shoots him while leaving the house and he falls down to the pool.Police, journalists and Paramount pictures immediately come to the event place and an artificial film is made in event place as she wanted. Of course all those occur when Norma is in shock.I apologize for the lots of spoilers that I wrote above but if one day I want to remember the film, it is really necessary because the rest of film is really very boring except for last three minutes.I don't comment for any technical details or performances of actors or directing. It's understood just watching it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I started watching SB with great expectations after seeing it praised to the skies in other Wilder reviews, and favorably compared with flicks such as Ace in a Hole, but I gotta say I'm disappointed. Now, I'm aware that saying that SB is anything less than a masterpiece is a heresy for many, but I'll say it anyway. This is a mediocre movie, even a bad one at times, especially during that hideously contrived, overacted, ending.Yet the movie was going pretty well until the party. Until then I was well disposed, willing to be seduced, even if up to this point all what I had seen was a delusional has-been of an actress and a penniless, opportunist, scriptwriter stumbling into each other. But then the whole thing sinks into mediocrity. Actually, what really ruined it for me was Gillis' frantic race back to the mansion, into Norma's arms. That's the most unrealistic bit of bad melodrama I have ever seen. The only way Wilder could have convinced me of such a thing really happening was by developing a psychological portrait on Gillis as a deeply disturbed man, carrying a humongous mother fixation; one who as a child was tortured by a monster of a mother, which withheld food from him until he did what she told him, usually something as humiliating as, for ex., licking her feet. That would have made it for me, it would have given sense &amp; coherence to what comes next. But the way it is shown, Gillis' behavior makes no sense at all. Also, freelance writers are the most independent minded people, the last human creatures still in the wild. To any of them, even death would have preferable to the lifestyle he chooses. There is no logical reason why he doesn't simply leave and goes to work as a dishwasher, waiter, whatever, instead of allowing his own emasculation by the hag. But he does even worse when he sends Betty packing, to make that grotesquely contrived ending possible, when in his case any normal man would have thought: what do you know; I got love when I least expected it. Maybe the rest is on the way. But that would have been just too logical and logic doesn't have much place here.This is one film that doesn't touch me at any level, that leaves me totally indifferent. And don't call it a cultural thing: I've gotten aboard every other Wilder flick--The Apartment, Ace In A Hole, Stalag 17, DI, SLIH, Lost Weekend, Sabrina, etc. I can easily get into the story of a reckless reporter who'll do anything to get the big scoop or that of a moral degradation of a man caught in the web of a black widow, or in a bottle of booze, but I can't picture what may be touching about a crybaby of a woman who once got things most people can only dream about--a $18.000/w. salary, a wardrobe the size of a city block, the adulation of millions--and who didn't have the maturity to go with calm and dignity into retirement when all that, except the money, was gone. I don't know why this Hollywood fixation with the "tragedy" of its retired stars, anyway, about them suffering the same fate that every other thing, human being, will suffer with time. Are we supposed to join them crying and moping? Pull-heeze! Tennis stars are seen also as temperamental and showy, but I can't imagine a 50 year old Sharapova or Williams crying and bitching because the crowd doesn't go wild every time they enter a court to hit a few balls. Grow up, Hollywood! And accept that SB is not the classic you say it is it is but just an overdone, navel watching, schmaltzy soap opera that only moves those fireflies caught in your glitter and hoopla.Truth is, this movie didn't even need to be done; if only Max had had the fortitude to claim his cojones back and told Norma the truth: Girl, you got your 15 min. but now it's gone. But still you have your money and me. Live with that. Instead of that we are treated to a 2 hr. soap opera about people we don't really give a hoot about.Resuming, I don't see anything remarkable about SB. Cinematography is standard. The atmosphere right, but mostly in the depressing confines of the Desmond mansion. Outside of it, it doesn't exist, except for the bit in the De Mille sound stage--the best part of SB along with the blooming Gillis-Betty relationship. A movie focused on this last theme would have been far better and more interesting. Acting goes from good?-Holden, Olson--to wooden--Von Stroheim--to bad and then to worse?Swanson?-to hit rock bottom during her hideously over the top caricature of a washed up actress at the end, which every former female thespian should find deeply offensive. If that's what Hollywood calls good acting, God helps them. 1/10OK, OK, I got it: Hollywood is BAD. But I don't see them raiding the countryside to abduct folks and making work as slave actors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After coming to an appreciation and respect for Billy Wilder over the last twenty years, I thought I'd give this a second chance. But I still find it to be a long, flimsy, obvious movie with one static, overly drawn-out relationship, and a lazy second storyline with the blandest of bland characters. The whole concept is ridiculous. Who wanted to see the story of a failed writer, with the low ambition of being a kept boy, who squints his eyes and makes love to a horrible old shrew because he can't grow a pair to blow her off. That's the whole show for three quarters of the movie. A viewer just isn't asked to do much but pay attention. To make up for how little the story moves, it has a lot of over-the-top acing. I don't find it entertaining or particularly thoughtful. Wilder's run of remarkable movies has impressed me (except this, The Apartment and Some like it Hot). This would be the lesser half of a double bill with the similar Great Expectations, Vertigo or Streetcar Named Desire. I cannot imagine how excruciating this would be as a musical.</fullReview>

When the scrips writer turns into that way in Sunset Boulevard he finds himself in an old mansion which seems to be deserted at first sight but when he walks into mansion he recognizes a woman as Norma Desmond, formerly one of the great stars of the silent screen. She offers him a job reading the script she has been writing for her planned comeback(a return by her original words), and the writer accepts that offers as the only chance of making some money.Soon the former star will entrap him into her fantasy world in which she made herself believe that she is still big, there is no need for dialogues in the pictures, she is still a real star etc..Well I just wanted to give a mental picture of the movie for people who have not seen it yet! Well I don't really know why people just loved such a simple,bosh plot which has nothing exciting about it! Maybe it was a great plot for 50s but I don't see nothing different,original,unique about it! Gloria Swanson seems to doing her job well to portray that Hollywood lady who is entrapped in her glorious past but I don't see any other good performance in any players. Even Max-her servant display a poor performance. I am not surprised that in 1998 the movie was ranked number twelve on the American Film Institute's list of the 100 best American films of the 20th century either after all they think "Citizen Kane" is the best movie off all times. Well I am just tired of saying that top 250 is a list blown out of its proportions.It is not a list good movies but only a list of popularly-voted movies.

		<fullReview>get to be so famous. This is dull to the point of excruciation. The characters ham, overact, yell, and waste your time in every conceivable manner.Wilder was one of the worst of Hollywood writer-directors. His premise seemed to be that the stupidity of the American public required movies to hammer home a simple script and obvious plot by stating and restating the obvious.The best is the narration. 1st of all, it's narrated by a guy who dies. Why does it escape us that a dead guy can't narrate? A framed tale requires a live storyteller.. American Beauty has the same flaw. 2nd, and more important, it's narration for the sake of it "I was tired so I decided to go out for a bit. I walked down the stairs, opened the door, went down the path to the car. I turned the handle to open the door and got in. I started the engine and backed the car out of the garage." Whew, that helped me.This is a Film Noir? Because it's in black &amp; white and is narrated? Because Holden is a guy on the fringes of society and wore suits with padded shoulders. What a joke.This is a hard-hitting and negative look at Hollywood? And that's why it only got 3 awards? Please. It got awards because Hollywood knew - as it knows so well now - how to make movies that other Hollywood types will weep about. Who cares what Hollywood thinks about itself?There were so many brilliant films coming out of Europe and Japan by 1950. But Hollywood was plying us with pap. Sb rings way up on the suck-o-meter.</fullReview>
