		<fullReview>If you want to watch Scarface - go watch Scarface. This movie isn't. KTS is a 180 from the majority of crime classics and their many copycats. The factor that clumps most crime genre flicks together is the top-down perspective. For instance, in the Departed it was the rats joining up with the heads of their respective sides of the law - Costello and Queenin. The same with Pauli in Goodfellas, the Don in Godfather.KTS splits apart because it is a film about crime from the perspective of the prey. The opening shot is a junkie in a cold, wet New Orleans wind, lost in a whirlwind of trash against harsh white sky. This is the view of hopelessness - its also the familiarity of many post-disaster neighborhoods. These characters absorbed into the criminal underworld, not because they are evil, but because they haven't many other options and they're too dumb to know the danger they are in. This is the what KTS communicates to us with the background broadcast of the '08 elections and financial meltdown. When bullets fly in this film - you feel it, because you feel for the characters, which is why having Cogan as its opaque center is so blisteringly effective. He is pragmatic, unapologetic and a completely objective lens to see through. He is the balance between the corrupt political overcast and slime at the bottom of the barrel. "America isn't a country. It's a business."Cogan is the the cleanup for the corporation. He snips the buds, ties up the loose ends. He is the inevitability of the business world."They are all nice guys." The humanization of the characters drains you as one by one they slip into darkness. Cogan's jaws open and you understand that the characters are rats in a labyrinth, they are all gears that will eventually be discarded. The soundtrack rhetoric quite fluidly illuminates the movies' greater statement. With all the economic jargon in a ping-pong propaganda game there are people sleeping out on the streets - and a hungry dog has to eat. And all the way up the food chain, through a shady poker game in the back of some shut-down strip mall, to the podium and our new elected president, everyone is a hungry dog here. This is a methodical film that takes its time with each individual scene. It plays with time and space, slowing down, drifting in and out and then exploding. Cogan walks through the sparks and smoke, he is our escort in understanding the nature and design of things, and he does with an unforgettable composure. The elements of the film - acting, cinematography, etc, adapt to its scope and drive, the purpose that the makers sat down and did it. Each end does its job, and considering where you end up there's not much room for improvement in any area. Is it the Godfather? No. But its something completely different, and for what KTS was intending to accomplish, it was excellent. Don't be deterred by the negative reviews, but don't go in expecting the recycling of Scorsese and Copella. This a picture of its own kind, of its own vision. Let it move you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid, Hero-less, Unsentimental Crime Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was done in a style that was quite unique from your standard issue shoot 'em up or Scorsese gangster movie in a number of ways I found refreshing. It slowed down the pace of dialogue scenes to a relatable and believable level, made the violence far more realistic, and didn't overdo the music. Those who can't handle too much, or too realistic of violence won't like this movie.Some might feel the dialogue makes the movie drag just a bit, but if you like realistic filmmaking, they've made it feel as if you're sitting in on actual conversations. The scenes and cuts are long but are livened up with the fairly constant scummy-ness of the characters. James Gandolfini seemed to prattle on a little too much but I suppose that was the point.The violence can be summed up as unsentimental; much of it can be defined by the difficult achievement of not falling into played out Hollywood clichés. There are no heros in this movie as the director doesn't use cheap tricks, like voiceovers, disproportionate screen time, or happy music to convince you that one criminal is worth rooting for over the others. There is no glorification or demonization of violence, as it is depicted without the influence of music, and the audience can decide for themselves about what is being shown. There are no Schwartzenegger-style shoot outs, as the violence is usually sudden but brutal and loud. Every gunshot is closer to being as loud as real life, so you get a little jolt with every shot like being at a gun range.The use of music is also played down and important in making both the violence and dialogue distinct. There is some music which gives the movie some energy, but overall far less than the average Hollywood film. This adds an element of suspense as the music doesn't give away what is about to happen in every scene (like a movie with ominous music when something bad is about to happen, etc.). The lack of music also allows the audience a semblance of neutrality in what they are observing; characters are allowed to be likable without being good. This is the sort of movie you could expect if the hero was removed and you only had the villains and thugs left over--it is far less boring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a film that looks outstanding. It has that feel of the best seventies cinema. The acting similarly is outstanding but still, a few things stop it from being the stone cold classic it could have been. The cracks started to show when Cogan(Pitt) has his first talk with Mickey(Gandolfini). It's the latest in a long series of head to heads that play out more like acting master-classes than anything relating to the film. That scene effectively breaks the spell and reminds us that we are watching "good quality acting" combined with "a good script".The film seems to go off the rails after this. Any charm or involvement is soon stopped by another showy scene from the director who seems more concerned with showing off his film making skills than actually making a good film.The final thing that jars is Brad Pitt. He had the same effect on Fight Club. Pitt is too big a star for a film like this. He simply doesn't convince as the cynical cold blooded killer. Why would such a man spend that much time on his physical appearance for instance?. A more earthy, hard boiled actor could have made the character believable. Not a bad film but overbearingly condescending at the finale (which I won't spoil here). The film that went before doesn't earn that pay off and its impact isn't felt on the screen. Which makes the end deeply unsatisfying. Shame really as with more editing and less egos involved, this could have been so much better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brad Pitt and Andrew Dominik's fantastic Killing Them Softly has the rigor and grace of the great American crime pictures of the 1970s. A loose adaptation of George V Higgins' great 1974 crime novel Cogan's Trade. A fulfilling elegant and stylish black comedy. The script, acting, direction were all superbly done, and should be commended. Although the film can be very pessimistic, it does have a message, one that should resonate in the near future. The whole cast was extremely effective and highly believable. However Brad Pitt is simply terrific, and deserves much acclaim that could come to him. Just like The Assassination of Jesse James, Pitt plays subtle, but yet powerful sociopath and it ripples the film throughout. James Gandolfini Gandolfini is excellent as a boozy, broken old assassin. Ray Liotta offers a grotesque reprise of the type of manic gangster he played in his younger years in Goodfellas. Richard Jenkins is solemn as ever as the killer's contact, relaying back messages from the Mob and trying to beat Cogan down on prices. All the men here are relentlessly sexist and foul-mouthed.Dominik shoots the action in a grimy shallow focus and his screenplay is tough as steel and shot through with pessimistic, even black humor. There is no mistaking the fact that Dominik loves his characters, letting their dialogue shine uninterrupted. Although the The political message is a little heavy-handed and a bit repetitive, Andrew Domink crafts a memorable and highly thought-provoking crime film, with Brad Pitt shows the world again, that he's a fantastic actor that always surpasses the hype around him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yet another great film being given a bad name by "reviewers trying to do us a favour" (really??? like you're a shepherd and we're all sheep here???). If you're going to read a review, here's one that speaks in all fairness and without trying to glorify it.'Killing Them Softly' is a contemporary multi-narrative crime drama that oversees what crime has become to the mafia since we've seen what years of recession have done to America, post 9/11. It's a film you have to settle into and to watch and listen carefully, yet it provides us with storytelling style very similar to the likes of Quentin Tarantino and classic Danny Boyle.It also makes good use of some classic conventions and you may notice a little bit of Mean Streets, Lock Stock &amp; Two Smoking Barrels, Chopper, Pulp Fiction, Trainspotting etc.When ex-convict Frankie and his Australian heroin-addict friend Russell are employed to hold up a mafia poker game in their rundown dead end town, they get away with it, though causing the local economy to collapse and putting mob boss Markie Trattman (Ray Liotta) in the frame.The dons send mob enforcer Jackie (Brad Pitt) over to deal with it and to set an example, he methodically sets about cleaning up in due fashion.That is the plot, pure and simple, but aside from that, 'Killing Them Softly' is more a film about the bleak, harsh reality of crime in the modern day American towns that the government has all but abandoned and it is therefore about the sheer dead-end desperation of a certain breed of people.Unemployment, recession, drug addiction, violence, desperation, failing health, wilful self-destruction and the disgusting manner in which people regard each other with - it all adds up to one great stark reality. The only way that the government has succeeded in destroying organised crime is by destroying its own country's economy. Desperate people will do anything to survive knowing that, if they give up, they are as good as dead. And that sets the tone for this movie from beginning to end.Not surprisingly in hindsight, this film has no real lead characters, but universally supporting characters that serve the story until its bitter ending where we are treated to a summary in words between two characters. This helps to give a sense that nobody is of any real importance to each other, which is true to the nature of most of its characters.If you like your crime movies real, you'll love this. I'm so surprised at how seamless it is, and also how easy it is to watch despite how well acted and intense it becomes. Dark, gritty, grimy, filthy, absurd, depressing and yet bold with a few good laughs!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lot of the negative reviewers seem to have completely missed the point</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a lot of the negative reviewers seem to have completely missed about this movie is that it isn't actually a crime movie - instead it's a metaphor for modern America.That's why the film contains so many political speeches in its background soundtrack - they're meant to be there to draw the link between what is unfolding on the screen and what is happening in the real America today.This film is rich with different layers of irony; the most obvious of which is the fact that the men being killed are being punished for simply doing what their killers do themselves day in and day out - commit crime and steal from others.It seems to me that the mafia bosses are symbolic of the politicians who blame the business sector, and then seek to punish them, for what are actually failings of the system that they continue to prop up and exploit for their own ends. And just consider the fact that after killing several men for being thieves, these exact same mafia bosses then try and rob Brad Pitt's character of what he is actually financially entitled to from them.The reason both Obama and Bush are heard at different times in the film is because we are meant to realize that this problem is not exclusive to either the left or the right, it is about what America, as a whole, has allowed itself to become as a nation. And also to highlight the fact that both left and right have allowed this problem to persist and grow.Brad Pitt's speech at the end of the film is really the essence of what this film is about - a cynical examination of the death of the American dream and American idealism.I think that in time this film will come to be more highly regarded as a clever piece of commentary on present day America - and when it is viewed in that light (rather than as a gangster film) it makes much more sense to the viewer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A forceful socio-political commentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The idea of film being used as a medium for political themes and socio-economic commentary is nothing new, even recently with films such as Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps and Margin Call aiming to tackle the 2008 financial crisis. But few films have been as unsubtle as Killing Them Softly. Set to the backdrop of the 2008 election, the criminal underworld of an American city has been hit by its own financial crisis after a mob poker game is robbed by two criminals (Scoot McNairy and Ben Mendelsohn). With no trades or money being moved, a mob manager (Richard Jenkins) brings in a fixer, Jackie Cogan (Brad Pitt), to solve the situation. But none of his actions brings back confidence, whether right or wrong. Writer/director Andrew Dominik admirably uses a gangster story as a metaphor for the financial crisis, but the handling was atrocious. Dominik has no faith in his audience to draw these connections, and even worse, come away with its own conclusions; he opts to spoon-feed us the cliff notes as we watch. This is most evident with the constant use of speeches by George W. Bush and Barack Obama made at time, enforcing the parallels Dominik wanted to make. There are constant references to terminology used at the time, particularly the theme of bringing back confidence to the world, the theme that public perspective is more important than actual actions and we are reminded that the gangster world's situation is the same as the financial world's one. This forceful approach does not allow us to see a natural story. Killing Them Softly is a very dialogue-driven film that breaks the old cinematic maxim of "show, don't tell." We are told that the mob has turned corporate and that there is a crisis, but we do not get to see it. It would have been more interesting to see mob bosses arguing and coming up with theories and seeing that gangsters were unwilling to make any deals in the midst of the crisis. Killing Them Softly ends up rather dull as a result. There are some moments that show what Dominik is capable of: the robbery scene was filled with tension and things felt like they would actually kick off. Whenever violence was used in general, it was incredibly grim and brutal. There is a highly stylised moment when Cogan commits his first assassination, completely played out in slow motion ? a brilliant little sequence. The film hits hardest in these scenes. The big saving grace of Killing Them Softly is the acting. There is a great cast with Pitt, Jenkins and James Gandolfini being the biggest draws. They were committed actors doing the best they could, elevating the dry material provided with excellent delivery and chemistry. Pitt and McNairy played the most likable (and I use that term loosely) characters, and were the most well-drawn and conflicted characters in the film. McNairy was the most human, reacting naturally to his situation, and Pitt is able to be cold-hearted and professional when he acts upon his deadly task. Killing Them Softly is a film that feels its political parallels are enough of a mask for it to be seen as an intelligential masterpiece, but it feels too demeaning to have everything spelled out like that, which was made worse given the story played second fiddle to these political parallels. There was potential for a great film if there was a good re-write, but it ends up being one of biggest disappointments of 2012.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Killing Me Softly ... with boredom!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Killing Them Softly will go down as the movie that killed critics opinions for me. Critics out there praised this movie up the butt and I was a fool enough to listen to them and waste my money. You could have told this movies plot in thirty minutes if you scraped away all of the unnecessary and irrelevant plot threads, like a certain character whining about their wife for at least 20 minutes of screen time. There are all of these attempts at being artsy and different with editing and cinematography choices but it always distracts from what little story is there. It tries to pretend to be smart by shoving down the elections and the state of America down our throats for a cheap social commentary. Really, this is a stupid movie trying to disguise itself as a smart one. I kept checking the time and considering walking out but thought that maybe there would be at least one surprise from this boringly straight forward story. Instead there is an incredibly unsatisfying and abrupt conclusion and you're left sitting for a moment, wondering if critics are getting paid off for their praise. Minus a good cast and some pretty visuals that were totally unnecessary and self indulgent, this has little going for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely Not Anywhere Near a Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I actually had no idea what to expect from 'Killing Them Softly', as I'd not seen any trailers or heard any gossip or chatter about it online. So, I guess you could say I sincerely went in with no preconceptions or prejudices for or against this film. That said, it was simply one of the worst filmgoing experiences I've had this past year. The story that the movie started with and the two thieves involved in the card room heist were honestly the most interesting thing about the movie, but it was obvious that they were there as a backdrop (excuse) to bring in Brad Pitt's enforcer. Between Pitt's completely lackluster performance, James Gandolfini's weird drunken pervert of a hit man, and Richard Jenkins' worthless mob lawyer, they managed to suck the air out of every single scene they were on screen. I readily admit that I actually found myself falling asleep and then both wanting to walk out, while hoping there would be a much better ending to make up for the previous 100 minutes of stupidity. There is absolutely no redeeming quality within this movie. And the added inclusion of multiple scenes or audio of Barack Obama's election in 2008--Pitt is a MAJOR Obama supporter--were both odd and seemingly had nothing to do with the plot whatsoever, so they just made the movie drag that much more. I won't give away the ending or what happens to whom, but I honestly should, just to save all of you the pain of sitting through this horrible excuse for a paycheck for Brad Pitt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible...only film i've ever walked out on</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I left the cinema three quarters the way through this film.....never had to do that before. It dragged on and on and on. The endless dialog that had nothing to do with the film was infuriating to say the least. At one point James Gandolfini talks about getting a divorce from his wife for a good ten minutes which is completely pointless and has no relevance to the story line at all. This is just one example of a constant series of ridiculous conversations that the film is riddled with. Throughout the film they seem to have some sort of political undercurrent in the background between George Bush and Barack O Bama which I couldn't get my head around. Whether Brad Pitt was trying to get across his political views or what was going on is anyone's guess. I have no problem with the acting in this film....what I can't understand is why Prad Pitt and Ray Liotta (both accomplished and celebrated actors) agreed to do this film. Please save your money and time and don't go!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very disappointing film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this at Night Visions -festival in Helsinki, Finland. I hadn't heard anything about it so my mind was totally hype free - I just expected a good or average movie.First 20 minutes of the film were decent and two lowlife characters were guite funny - although not very likable. Then came in James Gandolfini with his mannerism stolen from great Jon Polito. He did the same lip licking and empty stare as Polito in Miller's Crossing. Gangolfini's character was just unrealistic and totally unnecessary in the film. Dialogue between Brad Pitt and Gandolfini put me to sleep - literally I dozed off when that timewaster was in halfway and Gandolfini told third time how he likes to f*ck wh*res. There was couple of good scenes in the film, like the heist in the gambling house and the shooting of Ray Liotta's character, which had a nice slowmo and good cinematography. Cinematography in the movie was OK, but it didn't save the storyline from it's dullness.</fullReview>

Everyone is given beautiful little soliloquies. This drew me into each character, even though they are all without exception unpleasant, I still was able to empathize with them. It was like a modern Shakespeare with the regular TV news and political speechifying in the background as a running commentary on the stories progress. The editing was so good I never noticed it.

		<fullReview>This was horrible. I wish I had known I was walking into a movie with an entire soundtrack composed of Obama campaign speeches. James Gandolfini's character was pointless. The shooting of Ray Liotta was the only good part, ironically the film died with his character. The murder scenes were well done, but very predictable. If you barely follow any real plot, provide an awful soundtrack, and push politics, you could consider being kind enough to provide your bored-to-death audience with some gratuitous nudity. Unfortunately, even the one hooker in the movie was unattractive and a little too fat for Hollywood. If you are considering this just turn on C-SPAN and beat your head against the floor for two hours. The end result will be the same. The constant anti-corporate rhetoric spewed by overpaid actors is getting old. If you are going to push some personal political agenda, at least do so in the context of a film that is moderately entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Softly is NOT how the killings are done. Before Brad Pitt starts pumping lead we see Ray Liotta subjected to one of the most brutal beatings I have seen on screen; you hear his teeth and ribs crack. The killings are equally visceral; this is not a film for the faint-hearted.Brad sheds his Adonis persona for the grunge look he wore in FIGHT CLUB, although the character he's playing is a darker version of Tom Cruise's in COLLATERAL. Liotta reprises his role in GOODFELLAS. James Gandolfini builds on his Tony Soprano character to play another hit-man burnt out by too much booze and too many hookers. Richard Jenkins's creepy saturnine Mob Boss seems to extend his (dead!) undertaker from SIX FEET UNDER. There are lengthy talk scenes in cars and bars that bring PULP FICTION and GET SHORTY to mind. The background TV election campaigning by George Dubya and Barack Omaba is presumably meant to emphasise that this is a Serious Movie we're watching, but it's as unsubtle as the hurricane footage.KILLING THEM SOFTLY shows its sources (or its "hommages") too blatantly. The whole thing is like a hyped-up Guy Ritchie or Quentin Tarantino: some good acting, stunning cinematography, a profanity-rich script, but overall a talky, pretentious and very, very violent movie - and quite tedious.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Killing Them Softly (2012) ** 1/2 (out of 4) Three idiot, wannabe thieves rob a mob run cards game and make off with a ton of cash. Then Jackie (Brad Pitt), a hit-man, is called in to figure out who was behind the robbery and to take care of them. KILLING THEM SOFTLY is being called by many a masterpiece and by many others as one of the worst films of the year. I think most people are really going to hate this film because it's just so different from other stuff out there but I'm going to fall somewhere in the middle of the two groups. While I enjoyed the style and the performances, at the same time the film just takes way too long to really get to where it's going and there are some other questionable things that I'll comment on in a bit. What I did like about the picture is that it's pretty brutal and ugly in regards to its violence and characters. The film really doesn't show any of the characters in a good light as the "good" guys are bad and the bad guys are really bad. There's never an attempt to make you connect with these people or enjoy what they're doing. The film also benefits from some wonderful characters actors. Pitt, James Gandolfini, Richard Jenkins, Scoot McNairy, Ben Mendlesohn and Ray Liotta all fit their roles nicely and deliver very good performances. This is especially true of Gandolfini and Liotta. The problem with the picture is that it just has way too many moments where things seem to really get dragged out. Another major problem is that the film tries to be too much like Tarantino. The scenes early one with the two thieves talking dirty about a wide variety of objects is just going to remind people of PULP FICTION. The dialogue here offers up some funny stories but it's not good enough to really grab one and bring them into the picture. KILLING THEM SOFTLY certainly has a unique look and feel to it but in the end it adds up to very little. The Bush-Obama bits of dialogue thrown in throughout the movie also add up to a big nothing, although I'm guessing the point was that even low-life criminals have bit hurt by the economy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brutal!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the 1974 novel Cogan's Trade by George V. Higgins, Andrew Dominik's 'Killing Them Softly' is Brutal! A Hard-Hitting Neo-Noir Crime Film, that speaks its own language without any inhibitions whatsoever! The narrative is difficult to stomach, but the overall impact, is stunning.'Killing Them Softly' Synopsis: Jackie Cogan is an enforcer hired to restore order after three dumb guys rob a Mob protected card game, causing the local criminal economy to collapse.'Killing Them Softly' deals with brutality &amp; freedom of speech. Its about the inner demons &amp; the monsters that give them that "push" to come out fiercely. Dominik's Adapted Screenplay is hardcore. It narrates an unforgiving, unforgettable story, about people, whom we can relate to, but not sympathize particularly. Dominik's Direction, on the other-hand, is raw &amp; rustic. Cinematography &amp; Editing deserve a special mention.Performance-Wise: Brad Pitt steals the show. After 'Moneyball', this is a yet another knockout performance by the Screen Icon. Ray Liotta hasn't been this good in a really long time. Richard Jenkins is excellent. James Gandolfini is mesmerizing in a brief, but significant role. Scoot McNairy &amp; Ben Mendelsohn are fabulous. Sam Shepard shines.On the whole, 'Killing Them Softly' is a wonder of a film. Two Thumbs Up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Markie Trattman (Ray Liotta) robbed his own gambling den some years ago and eventually owned up: because he is a good guy, he was forgiven. Johnny Amato has the bright idea of robbing it again - people will assume Markie is playing the same trick again and blame him - and engages losers Frankie (Scoot McNairy) and Russell (Ben Mendelsohn) to carry out the robbery. The local crime hierarchy, who operate by slow-moving committee, are fronted by the unnamed character played by Richard Jenkins who engages enforcer Jackie (Brad Pitt) to investigate and take remedial action (as long as it remains within budget). Jackie, in turn, brings in hit-man Mickey (James Gandolfini) to whack Johnny, because he knows Jackie.This film had a terrific cast, but it really wasn't very good. The slim story isn't really enough to fill the relatively sparse running time, and there are far too many hugely talky sections which seem to be there just to give the actors a chance to act. In particular, James Gandolfini's character is absolutely unnecessary and occupies two lengthy dialogue sessions. Gandolfini is very good, the character is deeply unpleasant, and that part of the film leads nowhere.But there are also other areas where far too much time is taken to achieve not very much - the dialogue between Frankie and Russell where Russell is descending slowly - very slowly - into a narcotic haze, for instance.I would not have minded so much if there had been some pace, some excitement, or even something attractive to look at. But this is a slow, tedious, drab film with no sympathetic characters and an over-exaggerated idea of its own significance. The political commentary might have meant something if you are American: I'm not, so it just wasted more time. And I would have quite liked an ending. Never mind, maybe next time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why Even Make This Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was so bad, I decided to create an IMDb account finally and hopefully save other people from being duped by the positive reviews.Simply put, this is a movie that never needed to be made. There is almost no story to it and what little story there is is told in a horribly long and drawn out way. This includes lots of conversations between characters that have absolutely no relevance to the plot among other things. One of the biggest pointless inclusions in this movie is the frequent clips of Bush &amp; Obama credit crunch speeches that are spliced in virtually everywhere in this film. Although the movie is set right around 2008, there's no relevance to the story at all and it's almost like Brad Pitt is trying to make a political point but isn't really clear on what the point is. I'm confident they could've edited this down to a short story and told us the entire story in 10 minutes and it would've been enjoyable. Instead, it was 90 minutes of waiting for it to get going. I don't need big action to keep my simple mind entertained, but I do like my movies to have a good plot and a sense of movement. Lawless for instance doesn't move incredibly fast, but you are glued the whole time. This movie has none of it and I was not surprised at all to see 3 people walk out just over half way through as I was thinking of doing the same thing myself.I really like Brad Pitt and I would struggle to think of a bad movie he's been in up until this one came along. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone even if it's free. I only wish I could have the 90 minutes of my life back.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this movie is nothing but 97 minutes full of dirty speeches without any meaning. There are a lot of pointless but interesting characters witch talk nonsense and it contains lots of dull, confusing stories, just words, without an image witch have nothing to do with the plot However the acting was very good by both Brad Pitt and Scoot McNairy. The film's ending isn't that disappointing with Jackies quote, but that quote its not enough to justify the amount of Obamas speeches during the movie The director did a good job, with some very good shots but the slow motion tip was at least Terrible the punching scene was also awful, it looked very fake with all the unnatural punches and the gallons of blood, thing that is actually impossible under these conditions Generally a bad film, maybe meant to be a garnish of Andrew Dominik's view about the situation in United States of America at 2012 Whatever "it meant to be", it clearly didn't succeed</fullReview>

		<fullReview>KILLING THEM SOFTLY reminds me of Tarantino's DEATH PROOF in that both movies are laden with scripts that attempt edginess and off-beat verve by focusing on seemingly irrelevant conversations between minor characters. Both films end up being boring in the extreme purely because the scripts are neither witty nor engaging, in fact they turn out to be mindless and yawn-inducing, written by people who clearly think they're clever than they actually are.It's a pity, because like DEATH PROOF this has the potential to be good. The whole set-up is decent, the card-game robbery is an exceptional set-piece filled with all kinds of tension, and the scenes with Ray Liotta are a real highlight. The rest of it is terrible. Brad Pitt plays a monotonous and uninteresting character who just sits around talking, talking, and talking to other uninteresting characters. There's no suspense, no build-up, no real story. I appreciate the filmmakers were trying to achieve something different here but it's one big fail if I'm honest.KILLING THEM SOFTLY wastes the talents of an interesting cast, not least Pitt who can be absolutely electrifying on screen given the right role (FIGHT CLUB, for instance). Liotta bags the only interesting character and is involved in one scene which pushes the boundaries of on-screen brutality a la THE KILLER INSIDE ME but unfortunately that's the only real moment of interest in the whole thing. A huge disappointment then and not a patch on the gangster movies of Scorsese, Tarantino, or Ritchie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>looked a decent film when advertised at the cinema and duped me into watching once out on Blueray......... a complete waste of 90 minutes!! the story promised much, like the tense robbery of the card game and from that point stretches on into nothingness, the James Gandolfini character is beyond pointless and the constant reverberation of the Bush/Obama speeches throughout makes no sense or relevance to the film at all. I actually created an IMDb account purely to review this dross and try and save people from wasting their time, for people that are actively trying to waste there time I'd suggest the following activities as massively more satisfying......watching grass grow, watching paint dry or counting clouds.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Killing Them Softly ? Seducing Us Definitely</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every now and again, a movie comes along that comes as close to movie perfection as you can get.Killing Them Softly is about the GFC hitting the US criminal underworld. Funds for hits are trickier to obtain. The quality of hit-man you can get for your dollar these days is a compromise.Andrew Dominik has taken a great story, re-titled it with one of its key phrases and given us a movie that will undoubtedly score him a Best Director Oscar nomination in 2013.From the opening sequence with Ben Mendelsohn playing what might be his greatest, grottiest character ever, the subtext of the film is evoked by great visuals of suburban desolation and regular punctuation of radio and TV political rhetoric. Obama is a frequent image ? the official Big Boss of the Ununited States Of America.And without giving anything away (no spoilers here) it all makes even more sense in the final scene ? when text and subtext collide in a gob- smacking, grim realization of what the US has become and what has become of us. As Michael Moore pointed out in Capitalism: A Love Story, the distinction between capitalism and democracy has been made murky when they are in fact two very different entities.Democracy is a form of government of the people, by the people and for the people. Consensus and referendum are key to policy formation and decisions.Capitalism is based upon 'every man for himself' and for a minimum wage the rest of us can put ourselves into voluntary slavery and subscribe to a generic superstition like say, Christianity then buy into the dangled carrot of a better life in the next life. They might call it the After Life but it's really no more than an After Death. And I'm betting not much happens from that point on. Ask a steak that was once a cow what its After Life is like.Capitalism pretended to be the good buddy of democracy in order to establish itself as the preferred First World Westernized way to live. When in fact, capitalism has little to do with freedom of the people ? unless you are one of the few at the top raking in obscene amounts of money you can't spend and fiddling with yourself on your mansion rooftop watching the rest of the country burn because of your unbridled greed.It's great to see Ben Mendelsohn go from an AFI Best Actor Award for Animal Kingdom ? to a significant support role in The Dark Knight Rises ? to a perfectly directed role in Killing Them Softly that will establish him as an internationally recognised character actor. And he's worth every accolade he gets.In my interview with Andrew Dominick, I complimented him on his heavy use of close-ups on his cast which creates extreme intimacy. In scenes of James Gandolfini with Brad Pitt in a hotel room, you can see the direction of dialogue coming out of Gandolfini's mouth and also the expert direction of his character's soul being directed in the facial muscles, tics and the old, wounded eyes of a weary hit-man.I'd give Andrew Dominik a Best Directing Oscar nomination for this scene sequence alone. And I'll bet Gandolfini will get a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nod too next year.Also - the Scorsese-influenced slo-mo car death sequence cut to music truly elevates the art of dying on celluloid to a new level to which Quentin Tarantino can only aspire. And I really like QT's work with death.Andrew Dominik made Chopper starring Eric Bana then The Assassination Of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford and now Killing Them Softly. He's made a massive impact with three films.The Decline Of The American Empire has happened as surely as did the Decline Of The Roman Empire. There's so much in each frame of Killing Them Softly, repeat viewings are essential. It is probably the best film I have seen all year.</fullReview>

The dialogues are not entertaining to me. The ambiance and feel of the movie was disappointing and I didn't find anything new in the plot. Brad is in my top 5 actors and I enjoyed almost all movies with Liotta. My expectations were maybe too high when I watched this movie. I was hoping for a 8 or at least a 7. I just made a critic for The counselor (witch I gave 7) and I compared both movie. The counselor won hands down.Watch it if you have the chance but I don't advise you pay any money for Killing Them Soflty. Even the title is better then the movie itself. Im done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After reading a lot of the reviews here I decided to write my own.I noticed a lot of people fall over the fact that this is a slow paced movie. Well let me explain something: Back in the days most movies were as fast as this. Nowadays we want fast editing and slick shots because of music video's and commercials where the producers need to put a lot of information in a short amount of time. So in my opinion you are an spoiled lazy brat that doesn't want to pay attention, you just want to be entertained without thinking.And just because you can't pay attention that doesn't mean this film doesn't have any story. The story is complicated and wants to show you a message. A lot of other 'big time Hollywood crap' don't show messages anymore, they just want to make a lot of money. Well I want to explain a lot of things about the movie but as you are a lazy spoiled brat you must also be ignorant and stubborn.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is very hard to imagine that anyone would make this story into a movie, especially Brad Pitt, or Liotta or Gandolfini except for one reason.Pay me the money! The same way the movie ends. That was probably the best part of the film.Not only is the premise just plain stupid but the whole story is like a bad episode of Sopranos except they spent 18 million + on the budget of this film that should have cost maybe 2 million like HIt and Run.. except of course.. the actors had to be paid top dollar.Remove these actors and you have a b movie with a stupid story that nobody would sit through and it would be a total flop. Hopefully the director will pick a better story next time as he looks like he has some potential especially since Dominik did a decent job on Chopper... but this was embarrassing. If you are going to make a movie at least make it something meaningful that is at least entertaining instead of just more gratuitous violence about nothing. This genre is finished except for Tarantino who at least has creative misguided violent genius, and hope Pitt will follow his wife's footsteps and do more meaningful projects instead of this hack pay job. Truly pathetic. I gave it a 1 since there is no zero.</fullReview>

Very good movie for those who look at reality as it is and those who can take off their black glasses. Do you people know about allegory? Do you people know about double meaning? Can you watch a movie without effects? Can you listen to what people say and think at the same time? Do you ever discuss movies/books with your friends and think about them?

		<fullReview>I'm not sure what people are looking for nowadays, but from reading the reviews of this excellent movie, I fear it is some sort of escapist garbage: Killing Them Softly was one of those crime movies that just seems like a slice of real life just slightly above the gutter. I didn't know it was based on a George Higgans novel, either, and I was thinking while watching it that I hadn't seen a crime movie this good since 'The Friends of Eddie Coyle,' only to find out that both movies were based on books by the same author.I just got sucked in, the tension was great and interrupted periodically by the dark humor that is so typical of lowlife criminals and junkies. I hope we start getting more like this, more realism in our crime movies, as this one grabbed me from start to finish.</fullReview>

The movie is extremely slow with uselessly long scenes.

		<fullReview>Though interesting, fun and watchable, Killing Them Softly fly just doesn't pack that punch that other film of a similar style and genre have. Films with that caliber (The Godfather), manage to perfect the film throughout, stopping the story for nothing and keeping the plot progressing. Killing Them Softly fails towards the end which is disappointing based on how strong the start of the film was. It seemed promising and the beginning will verify that, but I only wish that the writer continued his A Grade essay, instead of rebel for a D Grade essay. Interesting and for the most part entertaining, but suffers under its own build up to ultimately fail to something not quite up to scratch.</fullReview>

I know it was filmed in Louisiana. Felt vaguely like it could have been Pittsburgh.

		<shortDescription>What it lacks in content, it sure as hell makes up for in film making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two small time crooks and a shifty business man/mob associate decide to take a death defying leap of faith and rob a card game protected by the local mob, which obviously turns out to be a pretty bad idea. And that's really all there is to say about the films narrative. It is simple and undeniably predictable throughout. However, while it can be argued that Killing Them Softly doesn't bring anything particularly new or original in terms of narrative, Dominik's gangster thriller more than makes up for any lack of originality with his casting choice and technical flair and finesse. There's not a moment in this film that hasn't been meticulously crafted by the Australian director, from his beautifully cinematic slow mo drive by shoot up underscored by Ketty Lester's 'Love Letters', to the POV shots of doped up heroin addicted small time 'crim' Russell (Ben Mendelsohn) dreamily fluctuating in and out of consciousness while his mate is having a life or death crisis. And did I mention his excellent casting choice? Brad Pitt is in his element, and does a great job of convincing us that he really is a detached, stone cold hearted mob hit-man. Gandolfini is also in his element as the cold blooded mobster hit-man hired out to kill one of the card game crooks, with many moments reminiscing his Tony Soprano character. If you're a Soprano's fan, like me, then his performance in this could strike a slight feeling of nostalgia. Mendelsohn brilliantly transforms himself into his most grimiest and seediest character yet to date, and - with a twist of comic genius I might add - really holds his own as the naive, bottom of the food chain, petty criminal who sees an opportunity to make a quick dollar and runs with it, without thinking too much about the consequences. Although rather cliché, the anti capitalist commentary is quite effectively used even if it is perhaps a little tactless. The Bush and Obama speeches certainly added something to the overall broken American dream sentiment, but perhaps it was a bit too obvious for intelligent audiences. The final message of the film - that the political world, much like criminal world, is a business, just as ruthless and just as unsympathetic to the weak and misguided - could have been delivered in perhaps a more original fashion, but nevertheless, the exchange between Pitt and Richard Jenkins in the final scene gives the whole political motif of the film a darkly comical twist, leaving us with a subtle smile rather than a raised fist often accompanied with a feeling of despair.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked the way the film started with a very bleak and down-to earth approach to the whole set-up. Some interesting low-life characters planning a robbery always catches my attention. If anything, it steps up a gear when Brad Pitt enters the scene and I'm really beginning to get into it. Sadly, it wasn't to last, when the James Gandolfini character appears it does take a bit of a dive. He seems a bit of a wasted character; only there to pad the thing out a bit. It's a shame because I really liked Gandolfini as an actor and felt this was not a fair reflection of his talent. Some very interesting effects were used and I found these very interesting. The use of slow motion in one particular assassination scene was quite breathtaking. There is also a scene depicting the world from a drug addict's point of view that looked pretty strange too. Over all, it's one of those that I think I'll have to watch again to fully appreciate. For now, I liked it, but didn't fall in love with it; I'm sure a future viewing may fix that one way or the other.SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDEDMy score: 7.2/10.You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is a good case to be made, at least here in Britain, for prosecuting Killing Them Softly under the Trade Descriptions Act. But I for one shan't be on the sideline cheering on the suit. Many, I'm sure, tuned in - went to the flicks, bought the video, watched online illegally - after hearing that Brad Pitt is a hit-man called in to clear up a mess, and they will, most probably, have been disappointed.Killing The Softly is most certainly not your average gangster flick. It's most telling scene comes right at the end when Pitt, the hit-man, talks to the crooks' lawyer who is there to pay him for for the murders he has committed on behalf of his paymasters. The scene is played out against yet another of those superficially rousing, although, in fact, pretty vacuous Obama speeches long on sentiment but pretty short on anything much else, in which he tries to grab the heart of America in order to garner a few more votes. Such soundbites permeate the film. Pitt's character has heard it all before and then some.In the final scene he is accused of cynicism by the crooks' lawyer, but in truth - and oddly - he is one the film's most honest characters. He does what he does, looks a situation squarely in the eye, calls a spade a spade and does what he is asked to do. He doesn't try to justify or excuse his dirty work. The rest of the characters, from the two losers, who kick off the whole stupid charade on behalf of another loser who thinks he has a clever plan, to the sap who is bumped off by Pitt for no very good reason but to keep the gambling punters happy and is paying for a past transgression, to the hit-man called in from New York who for one reason or another has lost it and is sent packing, are more or less living in their own dream world. All have a working explanation, none of which, however, is worth a row of beans. Only Pitt, the effective, professional killer sees everything clearly.It might, though, not be as we would like to see the world. Writer and director Andrew Dominik makes the point that most of us seem to be far happier eschewing the violent, lethal reality of the killer Pitt and instead prefer to accept the anodyne, risk-free, no-smoking, ginger ale world of Obama and his vacuous rhetoric. Remember, it was Obama who gave the green light to the - well, murder - of Osama Bin Laden in a foreign country. Whether or not you agree with what he sanctioned and what was done, one must wonder exactly how much his liberal principles played in the decision to give that assassination the OK. For, whether you think it justified or not, a murder it was.In a sense Pitt is just Obama without the liberal veneer: he does what he is paid to do - America is business - and is under no illusions as to what he is doing.So be warned: yes, you'll get lots of tension-building gangster scenes and, yes, you'll get your guts full of gore if that's what you want (and many, of course, do), but Killing The Softly is a million miles away from being the kind of gangster flick you (and my son, who started watching it with me, but gave up halfway through) expect. The point it makes - and even 'making a point' will lose it Brownie points with many punters - is not particularly original or profound, but, for this punter at least, Dominik has made a thoroughly entertaining and watchable movie, much as he made with The Assassination Of Jesse James... which also starred Brad Pitt.PS. I like and have always like Brad Pitt, a very gifted actor (his appearance in Inglourious Basterds is nothing but an aberration and is Tarantinos' cock-up, not his). I should like to seem him demonstrate his talents in a more 'talky, stagy' film. I am confident he could do it.</fullReview>

It is so quiet but you can feel the heat and their anxiety.After seeing this film I noticed that other crime movies are overly bloody, loud, and frankly overdone, with an exception of Reservoir Dogs.

		<fullReview>There is more wordplay than gun-play here and it is a Neo-Noir, hard-boiled, unfettered attempt at gritty realism. Some of the extended dialog scenes are pretty good but not quite excellent. There is some rambling and pointless exchanges with little pay-off.But there are some serious, reality sound bites that give us the same thing. There is that continuous backdrop of Political rambling rhetoric that mirrors the Character's innate ability to speak much and say little.This is an against the grain try at alternative, smart Cinema with just enough stylized graphic violence to make it obvious that this has Artistic commentary and not Documentary style Cinema Verite on its mind. Overall it is a well done and interesting kind of side-step from the usual whiz-bang editing and shaky Camera stuff that has become so common. This is slow, bordering at times on tedious, but never a bore. It is well crafted but does not quite reach that level of great Prose transferred to great Film. But it is a good try at a very difficult, rarely achieved process that creates the best of this kind of thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Killing Them Softly is a political satire mashed up with a thriller/heist genre tag, but the combination does not quite gel. Two lackeys rip off a card game at the behest of a small time hood, bringing bigger hoods down on their head. All this happens with financial crisis news playing in the background. America is a business we are told, pure and simple, and not a compliant, transparent, accountable one. The Tarantino influences are a bit too obvious - philosophical hit men riffing off each other in cars and diners - and the political commentary is bulldozed into the scenes. Having one character Aussie just seems random, and flagging him straight away as a liability, then having him be an actual liability, reveals the rather mechanical, plodding plot. A great cast means it never gets too dull, but it never reaches any heights either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Dark, Grim!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's funny to see how people are constantly hating on this movie, other than the critics. It seems like people were expecting a shoot-em-up action thriller, but Killing Them Softly is a different kind of film. It's a slow, politically-infused film that portrays the dark times America went through during the recession. It's a film how people will do anything for money and how they will protect their money at all costs. No doubt this film is very slow, but it has intense dialogue and great acting that puts the dialogue to good use.Andrew Dominik's film is about how a mob enforcer named Jackie Cogan gets called in to settle things when two bumbling, dim-witted thieves steal all the money at a mob-enforced card game.The acting is wonderful and a good thing too. Only strong acting would have been able to elevate a script like this. Brad Pitt is always good and once again proves he is an elite actor. Richard Jenkins has some of the strongest dialogue especially in the end. James Gandolfini doesn't seem like he fits in the movie, but he does a great job. Finally, I think Ray Liotta was criminally underused. I would have loved to seen more of his character.Overall, Killing Them Softly is a dark, bleak film that is relevant to our troubled economic times. It has a strong screenplay and strong acting which is why I did not find this film tedious. I love how at certain times, we here dialogue from both Bush and Obama and they add to the political narrative. Be forewarned that this film is not for everybody. I did not mind it and I really liked it. I rate this film 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Beauty of Simplicity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film reminds me of the kind of breezy, competent, procedural explorations of the underworld we used to see in the 1970s. Unsentimental, understated, blackly comic, and sparsely stylized. It's a magnificent example of restraint and indulgence, and when and how to do both.The story and the characters are fully fleshed but they don't seem to serve any purpose other than exhibition. Three sets of protagonists (none of them truly antagonist or contagonistic to each other to count) all act in accordance to the events that happen and piece together the aftermath in a logical but undramatic fashion. The film is incredibly deft at making the drama about the implications of what is going to happen rather than milking a scene for its anguish. Even the most gut-wrenching moments are played for maximum minimalism, and the humor and horror both emerge undiluted and unaugmented as a result. The violence is actually perhaps the best of any film in decades as it's played (with the exception of one scene) for all of its brutal, instant, and appalling reality. You feel the aged and worn reality the characters live in and the existential malaise that comes from being trapped in it.The narrative is unconventional, in both how it begins and ends, but its not pretentious or gimmicky. The film is merely interested in what happens and how it happens, and leaves it to the viewer to determine how they feel about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite a Cast of Interesting Characters, The Plot Falls Flat on it's Face</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll keep this one short and sweet. This movie had serious potential, yet despite the cast of very interesting characters involved(and some very good actors such as Ray Liotta and Brad Pitt), this movie fails in almost every form of storytelling. The into was interesting enough to keep me watching, and some of the dialogue was actually quite funny. It almost seems like they tried to steal Tarantino's style of long dialogue scenes found in movies such as pulp fiction, yet the dialogue itself is not pertinent to the story whatsoever and doesn't help define any of the characters or plot at all. It seems a lot of it is there just to make the movie longer. The plot itself is an interesting idea, but executed very poorly. I'm a huge fan of mob flicks, and in my opinion, this movie had serious potential. Unfortunately, the lack of character development and flimsy progression prevents this story from really going anywhere. I won't give anything away(in case you are still interested in checking this one out) but the story just kind of bounces around between sets of people without any rhyme or reason. Many scenes seem like they were added for shock value alone, and unfortunately add nothing to the overall story, which is weak to say the least. Also, the ending is probably one of the worst i've seen in a movie to date.In a nutshell, this movie has some very interesting characters and a lot of potential, but lacks a meaningful plot in pretty much every way. I give it a 5/10 simply because some of the characters were interesting, otherwise I would probably give it a 3 or a 4. Very disappointing considering the great cast involved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Are you ready for a 2012 version of the Quentin classic Reservior dogs minus a bit of gore and more of economic and political philosophy brooding on 2008 American economic meltdown , then here is it . A very well made tale of retribution where local parallel gambling economy is brought down by three " smarties "and the big chiefs employing a contract killer ( Brad Pitt ) to bring them down . "Thomas Jefferson was a white snob who screwed his slave and left his off springs under slavery , who said some nice things like 'we are all one ' because he didn't want to pay taxes to the Brits ... so that others would die for him . This is America and America is business , so pay me up " .... this almost sums up the theme . On the background track we hear a series of speeches by George W Bush and Barack Obama , former as the lame duck outgoing president desperately trying to control the sub prime crisis and the other first as the campaigner with magnificent thunderous speeches and thereafter as the president incumbent . A highly political drama with the actual stuff mostly hidden in the conversations rather than visuals or acting , peppered by violent contract killings !!! Thinking man's rough ride .... classic by its own !!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the meaning of America</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here is one action movie that succeeds in a very original manner to say more about the America of today (or of a few years ago) than many other 'serious', 'social', 'politically-engaged' film. It does it so in a very Tarantinesque manner, but it's Tarantino violent and milieu films with a twist. Or more than a twist.Apparently director Andrew Dominik made just another gangster story. We can locate exactly when it takes place, as the soundtrack mixes music with speeches from the final weeks of the 2008 presidential campaign. A couple of low level losers gangsters rob an illegal poker house, which is owned by the mob. The reprisals will not be late into showing up because crime is a business and there are several levels this business is operated. One of the greatest qualities of this film is to catch the characters that populate the different layers of the crime industry and bring them to screen (with the help of a well selected and directed cast) in a very credible manner - from the drug-addicted burglar in rags to the smooth business-like manipulators at the higher levels who do not look too different from the corporate America managers, certainly not when they sip their Martinis.This is maybe the last great role of James Gandolfini (I did not see yet 'Zero Dark Thirty') and he has a couple of poignant scenes with Brad Pitt, fighting overweight, bad health and a feeling of mid-life lack of achievement which may stay as one of the last memories we are left from him. We will also be left with the memory of the final replica which puts the story in the context of a country which is run as a violent and uncompromising business. Certainly just one of the meanings of America today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dominik's "America's not a country. It's just a business.". Work of art.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a robbery on a Mob card game an enforcer is hired to restore order in the local community.A realistic and brutally violent portrayal of union corruption told on the back drop of pre-Obama administration. Killing them softly doen't hold back when it comes to punches, gun shots, bribery and politics.Based on George V. Higgins novel 'Cogan's Trade' Andrew Dominik screenplay is wordy, sharp and naturally 'cool' but not in a stylized way as with for example Pulp Fiction (1994). It has a great subtext and subtly covers a wider picture and some poignant issues.The material avoids the clichés as much as possible and it has some surprise moments and threads, the characters are well developed with many layers. The dialogue feels authentic which is complemented by the excellent delivery of the actors.The cast are on fine form both Ray Liotta (playing against type cast) and Brad Pitt are outstanding even though they don't really have have any scenes together per-say. Richard Jenkins is perfectly cast. Notable is crook Frankie, Scoot McNairy and drug addict Russell played by chameleon?like actor Ben Mendelsohn. The late James Gandolfini is superb as hit-man Mickey, a depressed killer at the end of his career. You feel you're really having a glimpse of these men's lives.Andrew Dominik's direction offering is commendable, and is a slick as Pitt's knockout lines. It's gritty, moody and ominous assisted by the on location shoot. Dominik creates tension and makes the most mundane of shots look interesting. The drug induced scenes and car crash segments are partially memorable.This will leave you smirking, wincing and caring for the flawed characters fates. Highly recommend alternative to Hollywood gangsters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Pleasant and Refreshing Surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I suppose you can attribute some of my positive reaction to this move to the fact that I had never seen any of the previews or reviews and knew nothing about this movie prior to watching it other than the DVD cover. Judging a book by its cover was definitely misleading in this case. I just figured another action flick that managed to score Brad Pitt. But as I have read in other user reviews since this turned out to be a nice throwback to some great character based movies and for me a "Tarentinoesque" movie all about the characters and their situations and the actors selling you on them. There is action in this movie but it is secondary and only a tool to help get you to relate to the character situations. It is rated R for obvious violence but there is also some great dark comedy that you can get a good laugh out of if it is your kind of comedy. If anything they force you to laugh to deal with the uncomfortable awkwardness of some of the character situations and verbal exchanges. All in all as my review title suggests I think this was a pleasant, refreshing surprise and a great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How the Mob Solves an Economic Crisis</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I guess I should say third time lucky with this film. The first two times were while I was on a plane flying at 30000 and sometimes, even with the technology of having the television in the back of the seat in front of you, and listening to the film through headphones, you are not able to truly appreciate the nature of the film. Also, at least in my case, I ended up falling asleep, and this is not really the type of movie that one can fall asleep through (unlike Die Hard Another Day, or even Jack the Giant Killer) and still understand what is happening.It is interesting that the film is played in the background of the 08 presidential election and the economic collapse that led up to it. Many of the films you see these days don't have a background like this, but in a way it is also comparing and contrasting the dichotomy that is the American way of life. There is the top down view that is played out over the media and there is the bottom up view that nobody sees. In fact, the three corpses that come out of the film never seem to even hit the news, and in the end find their way into a freezer at the morgue.The economic crisis of 08 is reflective of the economic crisis in the film, but they are solved differently. It is almost as if the film makers are suggesting that mob justice is the justice that works. Basically, years ago, an illegal poker game was robbed, and after a shakedown nothing turned up and everything went back to normal. Then the guy, who was running the game that was robbed, mentioned that he was the one who robbed it, and in response everybody saw it as a joke.What happened though was that somebody else thought that he could then rob such a game and get away with it because they would all blame the other guy. However, as is mentioned in the film, this cannot be allowed to happen. They all know that this guy was not behind the second robbery, but it is not a question of truth that is at stake here, it is a question of reputation. If this robbery is to go the way of the other robbery, then any old punk would try their hand at this. As such, the first robbery is swept under the carpet, but with the second robbery, the mess needs to be cleaned up, and cleaned up in such a way that the street knows that they simply cannot behave in that way.This is where the economic crisis comes in, and all of the rubbish that spewed out of the mouths of both Bush and Obama. In a way it is similar, but different, because the response was different. In the underworld, the enforcer moves in, deals with the problem, and the situation has rightened. However, in the larger economic world, the government moves in and attempts to patch things up through bailout plans and security buybacks. Four years later the problem still hasn't been solved, but what has happened is that these companies, the ones that are too big to fail, have simply been told that if they run into trouble, then the government will bail them out.Nobody even mentions the background until the end, where Cogan (the enforcer, played by Brad Pitt) looks up at the screen and scoffs. He lives on the street and he knows how things work on the street. He sees right through the fine sounding talk of Obama, and the idealism that America is a nation of people working together. It is not, it is a world were everybody is on their own, and they sink or swim on their own. If order is to be maintained, then those who step outside of that order must be dealt with, and dealt with in such a way that a message is sent to others to let them known that such things will not be tolerated. In a way the underworld probably works much better than the world of the legit because the use of force is real, and nobody is immune from the wrath of the enforcers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark Humour, Political Commentary &amp; Outbursts Of Violence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Killing Them Softly" is a delirious cocktail of dark humour, political commentary and extended conversations that are occasionally interrupted by outbursts of extreme violence. It's also a stylish heist movie with very strong characterisations and a tendency to go amusingly over-the-top. Regardless of this, it's great to watch and remains riveting from start to finish.Writer / director Andrew Dominik's screenplay is based on George V Higgins' 1974 novel "Cogan's Trade" which has been updated by moving the action to 2008. During this period, the news agenda was focused on the impact of the financial crisis and the Presidential election campaign and numerous speeches relating to these events are heard in the background throughout the movie. This highlights the similarities between the criminals and those who were responsible for the economic collapse but also emphasises how detached they are from the preoccupations of the political mainstream.Johnny "Squirrel" Amato (Vincent Curatola), a criminal who runs a dry cleaning business, hires a couple of petty crooks to rob a mob-protected poker game that's run by local gangster, Markie Trattman (Ray Liotta). Amato convinces Frankie (Scoot McNairy) and Russell (Ben Mendelsohn) that nothing can go wrong because the mob will immediately assume that Trattman is responsible because he'd actually knocked over his own game some years earlier and incredibly got away with it although he later foolishly admitted to some friends what he'd done.After the robbery's carried out, independent enforcer Jackie Cogan (Brad Pitt) is brought in to restore order to a situation which had the potential to affect all the syndicate's card games and lead to a serious loss of income. Driver (Richard Jenkins), is the lawyer who acts as a middle man for the mob and after discussing what they want to achieve and agreeing a fee for the job, Cogan goes ahead and very efficiently takes the necessary action to ensure that any disruption to the mob's business is kept to an absolute minimum.In comparing the actions of the characters in this story with those of the bankers and financiers who caused the financial meltdown, their greed, recklessness and incompetence is naturally highlighted with Cogan, by contrast, showing the kind of calm efficiency that an effective regulator might be expected to use to restore confidence to a shattered system and ensure future stability.Some of the movie's best moments of humour arise out of the characters' extremely poor judgement. An example of this is when Amato, who's just convinced Frankie to carry out a suicidal heist, tells him that he needs to do the job soon because "we're not the only smart guys in the world". On another occasion, shortly after a speech in which President Obama talks about "the American promise that each of us has the freedom to make of our lives what we will", Russell describes his plan for career advancement which involves selling enough stolen dogs to make sufficient money to become a drug dealer."Killing Them Softly" is well directed and beautifully photographed. Appropriately, the action takes place in a variety of bleak locations and a great deal of flair is shown in the way that some sequences are filmed. Russell's moments of drifting into and out of consciousness whilst using heroin are particularly impressive as is the slow motion depiction of a drive-by shooting that's accompanied by Ketty Lester's "Love Letters". Another highlight is the robbery which becomes incredibly tense because no-one watching would want to see the consequences if it went wrong on the night.In any movie which focuses on the idiosyncrasies of its characters, the quality of the acting becomes very important and in this respect "Killing Them Softly" is particularly well served by a cast of top class actors who bring immense colour and vitality to their work. Predictably, Liotta and Pitt are superb but the brilliant contributions of Scoot McNairy, Ben Mendelsohn, Richard Jenkins and James Gandolfini (in a cameo role) also merit high praise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You can be excused if you are disappointed after watching this movie. The poster and I think most ads did create an image that the movie actually can not live up to. This is not a generic action movie. There is nothing ordinary about this movie and it is not meant to be just "fast food" consumption. What it is though, is a class A drama, with some exquisite acting in it.James Gandolfini alone is worth the money (and time) you're about to invest to watch this. That is if you're interested in character driven story telling, rather than an all out action movie. There are quite a few fine moments, that superbly underplayed (Jenkins with Pitt to name one pairing outside the already mentioned Gandolfini thing).Unfortunately Mr. Soprano himself is not longer with us, to grant us performances like this, but we can hope that Brad Pitt might explore more diverse roles (he's in a zombie movie now, who knows what's next). Great acting, great not conventional story telling, if that sounds like something you might be interested in, dive in!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'America is not a country its a business.'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Andrew Dominik's screenplay and direction of George V. Higgins' novel 'Cogan's Trade' may have to search for the right audience because it is a complexly designed and performed piece of cinema. But for those who are willing to step into a different stratosphere of combining gangland antics and brutality with a strong subtext of commentary on the current status of American political system - a film packed with some top notch performances by a varied set of actors - then spend some time with KILLING THEM SOFTLY. The title comes from the main character professional hit-man Jackie Cogan who confides that he likes to carry out his missions without getting to close to the victims so that he doesn't have to hear their whining and pleas and crying etc as he kills them - distance allows him to kill them softly.We learn that Markie (Ray Liotta) some years back made a lot of money by raiding a gambling game. Since it worked before, odds are that it will work again now that Markie is out and in the mob controlled gambling scene. Some amateurs (Scoot McNairy and Ben Mendelsohn, both losers on heroin) are hired by Johnny Amato (Vincent Curatola) to stickup a mob protected card game, causing the local criminal economy to collapse. Jackie Cogan (Brad Pitt) is an enforcer for the Mob and is called in by an unnamed driver (Richard Jenkins) who is brokering the deal to track them down and restore order to the local criminal economy. Cogan demands that an assistant Mickey (James Gandolfini) be brought in, but when Mickey arrives in town he is far more interested in prostitutes and staying drunk than doing his job. How the final plan to correct the problem is carried out is the rapid-fire sequence of the last part of the film and to spoil it would be a shame.In many ways the movie is a recreation of the 2008 financial crisis - each character represents a different contemporary type (e.g., Richard Jenkins is the American government, etc). Under much of the dialogue for the film is the presence of political television shows with Bush and Obama talking, underlining the 2008 financial crisis, and that adds to the veracity of the story. The actors are excellent, the action is a bit on the gory side, but the seemingly endless and roaming dialogue holds a lot of viewpoints that are salient and make these underbelly jerks credible. You simply have to be in the mood for this one. Grady Harp</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In America you're on your own....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film has an amazing set up. Ray Liotta runs an underground card game sort of thing and it gets robbed by masked men.But earlier in the story, Liotta tells his friends that he set up his own game to get robbed prior to this, but this time, everyone thinks he set it up again.But this story is just a sub plot, the real film is an underlying stab at the state of the US government, and here characters in the film show three different sides.Jenkins could be classed as the American government, the government who tells you everything is going to be okay, but scrutinises everything that is going on, and tries to get everything at a discount.Gandolfini could be the white collared worker, drowning his stresses with alcohol,a nd complaining about every mortal thing, but not really doing anything about it.And then there's Pitt, the voice in your head, the solution, the dark side of the person, the part of you that will actually stand up. He is confidence, he is the voice, almost Tyler Durden-esque, he is what many want to be or say, but are too afraid.Other than that, it's a really great movie, funny, tense and beautifully gory in equal parts, it's well written, with some great performances and some scarily beautiful stand out scenes.Liottas death is a really stark and effective scene, and with the use of the film stock, looks gritty and dirty, the way you would expect his character to die, grim.Performances are excellent, but I can see why not many people like this, it could be classed as too pretentious, but you just have to look deeper.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, I didn't know this was shot in New Orleans, where I only live a 2-hour drive from. So with that out of the way, I found this film pretty interesting to watch though like my movie theatre-working friend, I agree it was pretty weird. Still, I liked that since I'm usually tired of the more conventional movies we usually watch when we go out. I mean, not seeing Brad Pitt, the film's supposed star, until about 20 minutes in was not too much a surprise to me since I knew this was more of an art-house film with the dialogue meant to address certain philosophical issues or maybe the political landscape at the time since this takes place just before the 2008 election as evidenced by all the G.W. Bush and Obama footage. Also interesting use of vintage recordings and slo-mo scenes concerning shootings and beatings. Really, I'm glad I saw Killing Them Softly even though I know it's wasn't the most exciting thing to watch. Oh, and I liked Ray Liotta and James Gandolfini, also.</fullReview>

James Gandolfini, Richard Jenkins, and the other supporting cast members are a wonder to watch. The take on the gangster genre, which I think created a reality that was dirty, creepy, and probably right on.... no glitz and glamor no cheesy love scenes, just grit and blur which totally plays on the mind to support the reality of low-life gangsters.

Pitt seems to have the same charisma on screen now as a Brando or Pacino, Gandolfino was a few short steps away from Tony Soprano so no complaints there and the lead (who was in Monsters, sorry can't remember his name, read the credits!) is turning into a really empathic and powerful actor. I cringed sometimes with fear for the guy I really did.

		<fullReview>No actual review, just a question: where was the character Dillon (Sam Shepard) in the film? I must have blinked; I missed him. So did my wife. The character is frequently mentioned, but I can't place him in a single scene. I do think the political scenes added little to the story, in fact, they added nothing, and the intended parallels between crime and politics seem forced rather than ironic. I think Mamet was more successful in "American Buffalo" where criminals talk like businessmen, and in "Glengarry Glen Ross" where salesmen talk like criminals. However, the dialog in this film is very good, with the exception of a few scenes where the wheels just spin. None involve Pitt or Gandolfini, however. The screenwriter did well by them, and they returned the favor. I suspect the film is set in Boston, but I can only base my assumption on some lines of Gandolfini's referring to his "coming up from New York." My favorite film set in the world of small-time criminals and hit men is also set in Boston: "The Friends Of Eddie Coyle," one of Robert Mitchum's best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningLast year, Markie Trattman (Ray Liotta), who organizes illegal card games on behalf of the mob, pulled off an ingenious scam, hiring some men to hold up the game and get his own money back to him, which only went pear shaped when the mob called the games off as a result and some people got mad. A year later, two dumb criminals try and do the same thing to Markie, but lacking the sense of Markie, soon find mob enforcer Jackie Cogan (Brad Pitt) on their trail.I don't recall seeing a trailer for Killing Them Softly, and with the lay out of the poster and the cast involved, it looked like your typical mob thriller, which still could have had potential. But Andrew Dominik, who I remember employed a similar tone with The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, the only other film of his I'd seen, has instead crafted a slow, lingering film that's much deeper and more ambitious than it first seems. The opening perfectly sets the tone for this, catching you by surprise with it's grainy, unnerving style, followed by scenes that rely more on atmospheric tension and lingering exposition than anything flashy or stylistic. It doesn't feel driven so much by a plot as by the relevance and motivation of the characters and what they represent about the situation and society in general. There's the constant hint of a political statement, with speeches from Bush and Obama playing on television and radio sets during numerous scenes, trying, and not really failing, to be symbolic.Performances wise, in a support role, Liotta doesn't really get that much to do, but still fits his role well (and even gets to do his 'crazy laugh' at the beginning) and in another support role, Gandolfini also fits the bill. But Pitt is the main star of the show. His hit-man is so much more and has so much more going on beneath the surface than is first let on. He's a man of deep complexities, convictions and compassion, and Pitt really gets to show more than he's ever usually done in this role.Simply by being so surprising, and having so much more to say than it lets on, Killing Them Softly, if not a must see, is certainly well worth seeing. ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Going into the movie theater I knew I would like this movie, not from the trailer or the actors but from the bad reviews I read. Reading those reviews I knew that it wouldn't be a movie with explosions and shooting every 10 seconds, it would be a realistic and gritty crime drama. Apparently some of the other reviewers walked into the theater expecting to see "Killing them loudly with explosions, guns, nudity, sex, no talking, more action, less acting, softly". The movie is a drama and in my opinion it succeeds as one. Set in the midst of the financial crisis the county found itself in a few years ago its plot is simple. Two idiots hold up a mafia card game and now they are wanted men. Bratt Pitt plays an enforcer who is hired to find those responsible and, well, make them go away. There are plenty of scenes that I feel the average movie goer will find boring but if the viewer listens to what is being said, and compares it to what is being said by the various news clips featuring President Obama and President Bush I think a connection can be made. With an all-star cast featuring some of my favorite actors it is an incredibly realistic film. Unfortunately with the movies that succeed in the box office dropping story for explosions I feel that movies like "Killing them Softly" will never do well, but at least I can enjoy them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I chose to see this movie after reading the IMDb reviews and I'm happy that I made that choice. Against the backdrop of a failing economy and towards a presidential election in the state of New Orleans, the film briefly explores the mob-psychology in a penny-pinching situation. The acting by the lead as well as the supporting actors are good. Brad Pitt highly excels in the 'professional enforcer' character. His philosophy that he does not like his victims to die in sheer pain (and hence the implied meaning in the film title) and would take them down by sheer surprise is indeed rare in professional enforcers. That also defines his working style as such. The character played by Richard Jenkins (actually a 'no name' character) called 'Driver' is equally matching Brad's wits in their conversations ('as long as things are with-in budget'; 'decisions are being taken by a committee / board' etc.). Ray's role demonstrates that in the mob-world, once a sin is committed against them and is also owned by, it follows them to their grave.Given all the above, I found that Gandolfini's character occupied too much screen time for nothing. His interaction with Brad was going on and on on a topic (failing marriage, hooker-stuff etc.) was simply unrelated to the story that was going on. I wonder how Andrew let this happen as part of his screenplay. That's the only flaw that I noticed in the film.Coming to Direction, Andrew Dominik managed to deliver goods by making sure that the viewers are hooked for the full film for its crispy narration. Just when I thought that the film is going somewhere, it actually finished!!. But, it was nice to have done that way!. Kudos Dominik, well done!!!.My rating for the movie is a 7 out of 10.

		<fullReview>Slow-burner crime flick that's thankfully free of the usual action film silliness.Two low level goons rob a card game run by the mob and, by making off with the wedge, apparently cause the city's 'criminal economy' to collapse.It's a rather heavy metaphor of American economics and the wealth divide that comes with unshackled capitalism, set in 2008 the Bush/Obama electoral race plays out in the background to reinforce this. The plot of the film itself is an obvious micro-study of America's wobbly fiscal position, Brad Pitt's final sentences in the film sum it up well.Although set in recent times, the film seems to make a strong effort to look like something from past decades. Aside from the election race footage (seemingly on every screen passed in the film) there is one brief shot of a mobile phone, everything else: clothes, hairstyles, cars, even the weapons used are far less era specific, giving the film a drab 1970s look. The retro look suits the film's throwback vibe, it's far more about dialogue and acting than crash-visuals and violence fetishism. Y'know, like film's used to be.Originally at: http://filmplop.blogspot.co.uk/2012/12/301212-killing- them-softly-2012.html</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Killing Them Softly is a neo-noir crime film based on the 1974 novel Cogan's Trade by George V. Higgins.It stars Brad Pitt together with Richard Jenkins,James Gandolfini,Ray Liotta,Scoot McNairy and Ben Mendelsohn.It was directed by Andrew Dominik.In the past, Markie Trattman, the proprietor of a criminal poker ring operating in an unspecified New Orleans neighborhood, decides to orchestrate an inside job by paying two men to rob his poker room. He holds up under questioning by the hit-man Dillon, although he later openly admits his involvement to various criminal figures; he suffers no retaliation. Amidst the American financial crisis, a man named Johnny "Squirrel" Amato plans to rob Markie's next poker game, anticipating the mafia will blame Markie for the heist. He enlists Frankie, a na?ve, former business associate with a boy's voice, and Russell, an unstable heroin addict who is stealing purebred dogs for money, to perform the robbery. Upon completing the crime, Russell travels to Florida to sell the purebred dogs.Driver, an emissary for the mafia, converses with a hit-man named Jackie Cogan. Although Jackie understands Markie was uninvolved in the aforementioned heist, he believes Markie should be murdered in order to restore the mobsters' confidence in the local gambling scene. The dialogue is sharp and so are the performances. Andrew Dominik directed this neo-noir in a low-key comic style that's alternately gritty and fancy as he mixes conventional mobster mayhem with an unconventional take on gangsters caught up in the Great Recession. And with Brad Pitt as his ideologically enraged male muse hit-man, as if wandering in from Occupy Wall Street.Despite the fact that it is less satisfying than either The Sopranos or Goodfellas,it still manages to entertain the viewer as it is stylish, profane, intelligent, and eminently diverting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only Fans of the Late Novelist George V. Higgins Will Applaud Brad Pitt's Crime Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Connoisseurs of hard-boiled criminal melodramas should line-up for writer &amp; director Andrew Dominik's latest outing "Killing Them Softly," starring Brad Pitt, Ray Liotta, James Gandolfini, Sam Shepard, and Richard Jenkins. Mind you, this isn't about a daring heist caper with edge-of-the-seat suspense, careening car chases, and scantily clad dames. If anything, "Killing Them Softly" qualifies as just the opposite. Had I not read the page-turner Dominik adapted for this third feature film, I would have thought he was proving that he could do little more than imitate Quentin Tarantino. Indeed, the first time I saw this atmospheric, but strictly small potatoes thug thriller with its loquacious low-lifers, dismal urban locales, and ultra-violent, artsy-smartsy, shoot'em ups, I had a low opinion of it. Dominik adapted "Killing Them Softly" from the 218-page novel "Cogan's Trade," published back in 1974, long before Tarantino arrived in Hollywood. Anybody who remembers the vintage Robert Mitchum movie "The Friends of Eddie Coyle" (1973), will savor this 97-minute epic. The characters are unsavory hoodlums with foul mouths and itchy trigger fingers who love to talk about their individual peccadilloes. A liquor-swilling James Gandolfini appears for three scenes and vanishes, while Pitt looks like a pirate, smokes like chimney, and sports a genuinely cynical attitude. Unfortunately, this Brad Pitt movie doesn't look like it was designed for mainstream, PG-13 audiences, any more than Dominik's last picture, the little-seen western "The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford." Nevertheless, although it looks like a hundred other forgettable, straight-to-video crime movies, "Killing Them Softly" is one of the coolest, all-male, crime movies you will enjoy."Killing Them Softly" draws its title from the protagonist's description of an execution style murder where the assailant doesn't have to confront his victim and contend with an emotional outpouring of mercy. In other words, rather than killing somebody you know, you only rub out those people who don't know you. Basically, this riveting crime thriller amounts to a series of garrulous conversations between hoodlums punctuated with gunplay. While the novel took place in the 1970s, Dominik has updated it to 2008 during the Obama versus McCain presidential election. Wall Street has just plunged America into the depths of a recession, and nobody is happy. An ex-con named Johnny Amato (Vincent Curatola of HBO's "The Sopranos") owns a dry-cleaning business. He hatches a scheme with another ex-con, Frankie (Scoot McNairy of "Argo"), that involves knocking over a mob-protected poker game. Everybody knows that if you try to steal from the mob, you can expect to die a horrible death. Markie Trattman (Ray Liotta of "Goodfellas") masterminded such a heist; he robbed his own game and convinced the mob enforcers sent to sweat a confession out of him that he didn't do it. After Dillon (Sam Shepard of "Safe House") and Kenny Gill (Slaine of "The Town") rough Markie up, Markie goes back to business as usual. One evening, with a different group of poker players, Markie lets it drop that he robbed his own poke game. Nobody retaliates, but Johnny Amato decides if he doesn't rob Markie's new set-up that somebody will beat him to it. Frankie isn't so sure about the wisdom of Amato's strategy. Amato assures Frankie that everybody will remember Markie's early treachery and the real hoodlums will get away scot-free with about $50-thousand. Frankie and his wisecracking, heroin-shooting, Australian pal, Russell (Ben Mendelsohn of "Knowing"), burst in on Markie's poker game and rob not only Markie but also his players. Frankie wields an incredible, double-barreled, sawed off shotgun with the barrels cut so far back that you can see the shells with their green crimping sticking out. No sooner than they hold up the game and escape, the mob in the anonymous city where the action unfolds imports a thug, Cogan (Brad Pitt of "Fight Club"), to straighten the situation out. It seems that this second robbery has hurt the mob. Nobody wants to gamble for fear they will be held up. Cogan and a mob attorney, Driver (Richard Jenkins of "The Cabin in the Woods"), arrange the details and the pay-offs. Of course, nothing goes according to plan for Cogan. He hires an out-of-town torpedo, Mickey (James Gandolfini of "True Romance"), to whack Johnny Amato because Amato knows Cogan. Again, Cogan has neither the patience nor the desire to watch Amato plead for his life before he blows his head to smithereens.The late George V. Higgins was an outstanding crime novelist with an ear for dialogue. He shocked critics with his pervasive use of profanity. Like Tarantino, Higgins possessed a droll sense of humor and nothing about his cut-and-dried crime novels were ever cut and dried. Higgins' characters uttered the F-word as often as Al Pacino's Cuban gangster did in "Scarface." Dominik has transferred "Cogan's Trade" to the big-screen with enviable fidelity to the source material. "Killing Them Softly" is one of the rare exceptions to the rule where the movie isn't as good as the novel. When he isn't faithfully duplicating Higgins' irreverent dialogue, Dominik proves that he is a truly gifted director. He shows what it is like for a heroin addict to carry on a conversation. Furthermore, the little touches distinguish "Killing Them Softly;" you've never see a car door shut the way that Dominik depicts it. Using television news clips from politicians during the 2008 Wall Street debacle, Dominik compares the criminal tendencies of Wall Street with hoodlums. Nothing about "Killing Them Softly" is soft, but its sense of irony will have you rolling in the aisles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disorganised Crime</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George V. Higgins wrote some superb hard-boiled crime fiction novels and two of his very best are "The Friends of Eddie Coyle" and "Cogan's Trade." Both written in the seventies and focusing on nefarious activities in the Boston underworld, the former was made into a suitably downbeat movie in 1974, featuring Robert Mitchum in one of his career best performances. Now "Cogan's Trade" is updated to the year of Obama's election and put on screen by director Andrew Dominik as KILLING THEM SOFTLY.I can't claim to be a big fan of Brad Pitt but you'd have to be in complete denial to fail to acknowledge that he takes on some seriously unglamourous roles and projects clearly chosen to advance his status as an actor rather than a Hollywood star. This is more evidence. Here his plays Jackie Cogan, a razor sharp and clued-in hit-man contracted by the Boston mob to rub out the perpetrators of a poker-game heist. Cogan is a replacement for Dillon (a character who also featured in THE FRIENDS OF EDDIE COYLE) who has been hospitalised. Instantly he figures out who's responsible for what and what has to be done. Then things get tricky.First, the unseen mob executive board don't want him to whack Markie (Ray Liotta) the host of the illegal poker game. Rather, they want him roughed up because people like him. Markie has a history ? he knocked off his own poker game once in the past. Although this time he's innocent, Cogan knows that he has to be killed, reasoning that it is weak to do otherwise and will send the wrong message. Next up, the "mastermind" of the heist, Johnny Amato (Vincent Curatola) knows Cogan, so Cogan reasons an out-of-towner needs to be brought in to carry out the hit. Unfortunately, the out-of-towner in question, Mickey (James Gandolfini) is now a hopeless, burned-out alcoholic with an unfaithful wife and a penchant for hookers. He's less than useless. Meanwhile, the two incredibly dumb lowlife sleaze-balls who carried out the heist, Frankie and Russell (Scott McNairy and Ben Mendelsohn), are phenomenally careless and loose-mouthed about the robbery with Russell addicted to heroin and embroiled in a plan to become a dealer and Frankie all jittery and nervously unstable.So it goes. Convincing characters, great dialogue, stylish filming (Markie's death sequence is amazingly staged and shot) and wonderful interplay from a solid-gold ensemble cast make this one of the best films of 2012. Credit to Pitt for his super-cool turn as a completely bad-ass enforcer calmly and confidently striding through a world of unravelling mayhem and incompetence where he is the only character with the force of will to exercise control and do what is required to set things right. For some, it might be seen as dialogue-heavy, rambling and at times incoherent, but that's probably the point. Life is often like that and things don't go according to plan, so it's credible and realistic in that sense. The pacing may also come across as a bit ramshackle and uneven, but it's a minor point.I, for one, was riveted, and it's pleasing to see a film stick relatively close to the spirit and content of the source material, finding ways to enhance it in transition from page to screen. The criminal world is represented as a sub-cultural society that is fractious and disorganised, beset by indecisiveness and uncertainty ? presenting the concept of "organised crime" as something of a misnomer. If you want a movie that's hip and cool, that isn't bogged down by pretentiousness and glamorisation, something that crackles with quotable dialogue punctuated by episodes of stylishly rendered yet appalling violence, then this might be for you.The obvious star appeal of Brad Pitt was not enough to make this a box-office hit and I'm not overly surprised. There's no CGI, no pallid and winsome vampires or spandex-wearing superheroes, so that's the teenies out of the equation. You need to watch, listen and concentrate, drinking in the atmosphere and savouring the slow-burn. Farewell to the ADHD contingent. The action content is sparse with the tension content being high, so nothing much for the adrenaline junkies. No good guys, no heroes, some bad language and some cruelly explicit violence which will likely alienate the moralists. And we have a political counterpoint to the Obama feel good factor, driven home by Cogan's flint-hard cynicism about America in his closing speech ? the film ends on the lines: "Don't make me laugh. I'm living in America, and in America you're on your own. America's not a country. It's just a business. Now *beep* pay me!" So how popular was it likely to be with the masses?No matter. It's popular with me. I like good cinema. And that's how it strikes</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Andrew Dominik returns with a bang after five years in a fine exhibition of stylish yet technically powerful movie-making. Right from the start, the movie keeps the viewers glued to its scenes of raw roughness shot absorbingly by Greig accompanied with music of hip and class, at right places that blends well with the overall personality of the movie, a rowdy-cold production. The fine performances particularly from Brad Pitt as Jackie Cogan, a person of style and substance and Ben Mendelsohn as Russel, the drug addict, lifts the film up to many levels. There are some long conversation scenes which can probably give the viewers some time to scratch their heads and elsewhere, but looking at them with critical eyes, they seem well fit. The screenplay is smooth and does get funny at some places in a dry sorta way. In all, this one looks like a strong contender for this year's Oscars. Killing Them Softly definitely has my vote, easily among the bests of the year!(imeansuraj.blogspot.in)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Killing them softly is like a beautifully aging wine, it gets better if you give some time and thoughts on it.We are used to waiting for the drama to be prepared for us and mostly we want to consume it without thinking. But this is a holistic film, so you may wish to focus on the whole experience rather than the end result. In other words you need to show some effort and climb up the apple tree, no one will put sliced apples in your mouth.Here the drama does not come in a ready-to-eat format. All the elements are there but you need to put them together yourself. If you feel unsatisfied, I am guessing it is because you were waiting for sliced apples.My suggestion, consider it as a snapshot of America, a cultural critique. And don't be put off by the bad language but think why is it used.Keep thinking after watching the film, it will get better and you will make more sense. This is not a bad film, not bad at all. Indeed, it is a quality production, a film that I will remember for many years. Though, I did not feel so yesterday when I left the cinema !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Killing Them Softly ? Gritty realistic crime movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Killing Them Softly has the very idea of Pulp Fiction behind it: people involved in crimes are real people too, not just criminals. The result is slice of life of those people.The difference lies in the way it is presented. KTS is less comedic than PF, it has laughs, but not that surreal effect that comes close to caricature. It is a more realistic version without all the flowery prose, with more in your face camera moves, instead of the odd, yet effective, choices that Tarantino makes.Pitt is excellent, and I like his choice of tone. A very mature Brad, letting us know he can do things in a more muted format.Violence is there of course, the rhythm is very casual, the story interesting, and the bits of action gripping. Very effective movie. I highly recommend, unless you can stand that kind of violence. The only reason I didn't give it a perfect mark was the fact that being a very brutal film, I won't able to watch it as often as my favorites.See it, well worth it. The theatre will bring an addition dimension, but it that's my point of view.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A parallel story of promises never kept</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most reviews of this film talk about what we see on the screen. There is more here than meets the eye. The setting is the City World gone bad. The action revolves around retribution for a heist of a mafia protected card game that threatens this small time underworld economy. Someone has to pay and be made an example of so this does not happen again. But it does happen again and the wrong person is blamed. The fixer is brought in, Brad Pitt as Jackie, who agrees to fix things for Richard Jenkins, Driver. There will be blood and lots of it. At times I wanted to walk out of this film. The hoods are losers, disgusting, stupid, filthy, addicted and pathetic. The violence is brutal. The language comes from the mouths of people who have become brain stem creatures. But I stayed to the end much like each character in the film. In the background, playing on car radios and displayed on large flat screen TVs, is the news about the fall of the American economy and the rise of Barack Obama during his campaign and eventual election. These CNN clips parallel life on the bad street where people fight for territory, their next buck?to keep their end of the "deal". They interrogate one an other for the truth, turn on one an other and endlessly lie. So we are watching parallel stories about the protection of the rich and powerful for the promise?a so called dream that is always out of reach. There is a polemic in Killing Them Softly about all men being created equal penned by the father of our country who kept slaves and did what he wanted with them. Without giving away too much of the ending, the main character utters our own sentiment when he says, "Pay me." I am glad I stayed to the end and glad for production companies like Plan B.</fullReview>

It contains some of the most beautiful set pieces, wonderful acting and often hilarious dialogue.Forget the plot, this is about the characters, all rich and wonderfully imagined, from the heroin addict selling stolen dogs to the ageing assassin unable to keep going without drink, drugs and women.And all these characters are beautifully fleshed out by some of the most incredible cinematography you'll see in a film this year. It contains an assassination so wonderful, tears might well up inside you as every bullet pierces the man's skull. It makes brutal murder beautiful.The thing that really struck me about this film was just how funny it was. I went in expecting a hard nosed thriller and was completely blind sided by the tone and level of humour. Scenes are devoted just to funny anecdotes, the sort of thing two criminals going to a job might discuss to keep themselves calm.Andrew Dominik has without a doubt created one of the most original and beautiful films I've seen in a long while.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shaggy dog story with bite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George V. Higgins must be the most underrated "crime" novelist around. He is admired by higher profile authors like James Ellroy but largely unknown by the general crime-reading public. Perhaps it's the shaggy dog, dialogue-driven nature of his books that puts people off. His stories are more about the journey than the destination. Higgin's finely observed portrayals of the speech-patterns and behaviours of the American East Coast underclass should have made his work fertile ground for screen adaptations, but again he has been pipped by other crime authors. As far as I'm aware only one other of his novels, 'The Friends of Eddie Coyle', has been adapted to film. A new adaptation was well overdue. Thankfully, director and screen writer Andrew Dominik has stayed true to the source material (Higgin's novel 'Cogan's Trade'). In doing so, he has made a film of dialogue and mannerisms where, like Higgin's books, it's not so much where you end up, but how you get there. Along this journey, Dominik is ably assisted by a fine ensemble cast led by Brad Pitt. Each part plays its role and each is essential to the success of the other.'Killing Them Softly' may not be to everyone's taste, but if you like your films to be "mouthy", intelligent, well-scripted, well-acted and well-paced, this is one for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is built upon the premise that modern day United States (the corporation) operates on the same ethical and business practices that the mob does. The non-judgmental, almost nihilistic story telling seems to be an attempt, a good one at that, by the director to gently guide the audience to come to grips with the nonchalant attitude they presumably have towards the plethora of businesses whose accumulated amoral mass has made it so that the nation, if we can still speak of one, no longer has a moral core. Well, neither does the movie and the parallels don't end there. Watch for yourself to find out more.All in all, good acting, well structured story and fluid dialogue makes it a good, a very good watch. I can't however agree with those who are praising the movie for being anti-cliché and therefore unpredictable and suspenseful throughout. If anything one can easily sense what is about to happen before it does, for the movie plays out like a Greek tragedy, you know what is coming as all the loose ends are tied, just like they were supposed to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A trio of dumb criminals conspire to rob a mob-controlled card game; it falls to enforcer Brad Pitt to clean up the mess, which basically involves killing everyone involved (and some who merely happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time). Andrew Dominik's 'Killing Them Softly' is a form of ultra-black comedy, mainly consisting of stylised, deadpan conversations between Pitt's character and the various idiots he encounters and mostly dispatches. Slightly heavy-handedly, the 2008 American general election dominates the television channels on in the background. The movie is admirably unglamorous in its portrayal of gangster life; it's also a little pointless, though the mood is well-sustained, in a tale of no good guys and arguably even fewer truly wise ones.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Killing Them Softly is a political allegory, set in a blue collar town full of gangsters. Ray Liotta plays one of the gangsters who had previously successfully ripped off a card game of high stakes he regularly attends with his mafioso buddies, an act he later admits to and is forgiven for, so long as it doesn't happen again. But local small time crook The Squirrel has other ideas, and recruits two bums fresh out of prison to hit the card game again, with the inevitable consequence of Liotta being blamed for getting up to his old tricks again. The plan works like a charm, and Squirrel and his cohorts make off with a hundred grand.The robbery is incredibly tense, and the first third of movie is flawless, but then it dips a little, but not totally. The main reason for the drop in quality is the decision to cast Brad Pitt as the enforcer the Mafia send to find out if it is indeed Liotta who is responsible or whether shenanigans are afoot. No offense to Pitt, I've enjoyed him in some of his movies but he was miscast here, he's trying to play an ice cold killer but just comes over as sullen and bored. I also find him a little too high profile for these kind of roles.There are some wonderful moments that elevate the movie, one being the assassination of Liotta, which is aesthetically stunning and a real triumph for the art department. The film also springs to life when James Gandolfini arrives as a hired gun, racked with regrets about his life and marriage and drowning in booze and hookers. He just owns every scene he's in, and his performance here reminded me how great a loss he is to movies. The rest of the cast also excel, Scoot McNairy is superb as the lowlife criminal who finds himself out of his depth, while Ben Mendelsohn steals the show as his heroin addled partner.It's not an easy film to watch, the violence is brutal particularly the scene where two mafia thugs try to beat a confession out of Liotta. The story itself is uncomplicated and that's partly why I enjoyed it, it's quite old fashioned in that sense. If they had only cast somebody less high profile and more believable as a soulless killer than Pitt it would be damn near a perfect experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good film, good acting, but doesn't come together</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall, this is a good film with a basically fine story with potential, nice cinematography, and good acting, but the parts don't really come together, it fails to maintain suspended disbelief, and the story ends up being fairly predictable while not entirely convincing.Cinematography and directing were good, at times excellent, with some nicely artistic shots, some unusual and compelling usage of slow motion in key scenes.The constant use of news events and speeches by Obama and W relating to the economy and society were interesting and tied somewhat nicely into some of the thematic issues of the film, but ended up being a bit heavy handed, as were the thematic issues, which were ultimately expostulated in a speech at the end that, while nice in of itself, really seemed somewhat forced and out of the blue with respect to the characters.The acting on the whole is very good, often excellent. There are some good characterisations and portrayals of characters, Gandolfini and Liotta particularly standing out as provided nice, memorable performances. Liotta is especially wonderful in (SPOILER) the beating scenes, no doubt also due to some nice script-directing attention to detail and realism in how one might act.However, at times it is almost overplayed and gratuitous, perhaps due more to the script and editing that lingers too much on what is clearly good acting with a lot of nice details in the mannerisms, etc. This ends up leaving us feeling that we are watching good actors demonstrating how to do the job well rather than being absorbed in the events. It breaks the momentum and leaves us with fairly disjointed set-pieces of nice acting and dialogue that don't necessarily flow and at times, as with Gandolfini's appearances, seem incorporated only to showcase some nice dialogue rather than adding anything meaningful to the story. Those scenes in part remind me of the adage that if you introduce a gun, it had better be used at some point, Gandolfini's character being the gun who is showcased nicely yet never used - being explained away and vanishing from the movie without ever actually having a point int he plot.SPOILER - As for the overall plot, it is a potentially interesting plot, despite the fact that it is clearly fairly worn - crooks hold up illicit gambling ring and are hunted down, but the real problem is that it develops in an entirely predictable and unconvincing manner. For the most part, everybody you expect to die, dies, and pretty much when and in the manner expected, the only exception being the one who is instead arrested, again not entirely surprisingly. Those who survive are the ones expected. Moreover, in order to make it possible for the central character, the hit-man played by Pitt actually to discover the identities of the robbers, the plot relies on the all-too-convenient, facile, and somewhat unconvincing solution of having one of them blabbing about it to a known associate of the usual enforcer of the card-game/mob syndicate (for whom Pitt's character is filling in). While this is not in of itself too much of a stretch necessarily, it is well worn, predictable, and in this instance not convincing in part because one of the robbers just happens to have been doing another deal with him, the other robber was apparently aware of that but did not realise it until after the fact, and the man who hired the robbers made a big show of being very careful not to hire the one who blabbed because he seemed like an unreliable junkie, but then ended up, with no real explanation, hiring him anyway, leading to him being involved and then spilling the beans to the enforcer. It stretched credulity.In the end, the movie is overall an interesting, stylish, nice-looking hit-man/crime/heist film with some good characters and good acting, but which does not really come together. I feel it to be an example of a film made by people who had some great ideas about characters and directing and who wanted to showcase good acting, good cinematic effects, etc., but didn't know how to develop these cohesively with a convincing or truly interesting plot or tie them all together.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Watched this one at the cinema on its release, but posting my previously-written review only now) The only annoying thing about watching (on the big screen) Cogan's trade, or Killing them softly is the 'Cigarette smoking' disclaimer that appears on-screen whenever a character lights up, which is pretty much for 80 min out of the total 97 minute running time. Based on the novel by George Higgins (Friends of Eddie Coyle, another fantastic crime book/flick), this one plays out like another Tarantino movie, and is a total change-of-scene for Andrew Dominik, who worked with Pitt earlier in the neo-western cult classic, 'Jesse James/Robert Ford', as well as the under-seen Aussie cult crime classic with Eric Bana, 'Chopper'...One thing tying Dominik's outings together is his penchant for sudden, bloody, albeit predictably stylized violence....Reminded me a lot of Refn's 'Drive', though that one had more retro music and less talk....The Tarantino-esque talky sequences are what made this stand out, and use that comparison in a very favorable light, and if this the advent of a new genre, then so be it, in addition to the grimy production design, and the period setting (McCain/Obama '08, though everything looks 70's, but IMO, that's more a homage to the writer's setting). All the interactions between Pitt, Jenkins, Gandolfini and McNairy ('Monsters', and 'In search of a midnight kiss', a fantastic, little seen, Indie romance-drama) are what lift the predictable plot away from the boundaries it's imposed on itself and the characters, and is a prime example of superior storytelling....The soundtrack stands out too, esp. one track (Johnny Cash - The man comes around) when Pitt makes his (pardon, but it's been shoehorned into my skull now) Bollywood-style entrance, and another sequence when it's only Pitt and Liotta in the frame, one that's kinda hyper- stylized...The stylishness, of which there's a lot (in a good way), also makes way for some very, very dark/macabre humor (James/Ford also had it in spades), as evidenced in every sequence that Mendelsohn (Animal kingdom, DKR..) is in, and one with Slaine (The town) as well...But what won it for me? The absolute kick-ass ending...watch it, you'll Know what I mean (or not)....What I wish it had more of - Sam Shepard, Sarah Palin.......kidding about the last one, but it's entirely in context of the movie's setting...Don't miss, esp. not on the big screen....and be prepared to ignore the morons who keep walking out of the showing, or talking loudly expecting to see a 'Bourne' or a 'Taken'....don't even glare at them....softly....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Raw Look At Crime</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie presents a cinematic and raw look at killing. Brad Pitt plays a cool or cold, no nonsense enforcer. What's unusual about this movie is how it portrays killing someone and the visual/auditory use of drugs. There are some nice cinematography scenes as well as graphic murder of a human being that borders on bloody glorification and yet also emotive repulsion and pain of death by bullets. Ray Liotta plays around of his crime-ridden personas but with more of sodden yet sympathetic, sad character. The sudden ending seems abrupt and cut off, as if to avoid the most difficult part of the movie conveniently or running out of time or budget. In sum, this movie is sufficiently different from other crime movies for its simplicity, straight forward approach, along with a subtle undertone of black comedy. At the same time, there seems that it doesn't quite manage to pull off the perfect, classic of satisfaction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So much right and so much wrong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Killing Them Softly is about a trio of thieves who rob the wrong people and end up with the gang and a hit-man (Brad Pitt no less) on their trail. The advertising describes it as a 'black comedy/drama,' although I found little to laugh at during the whole thing. It seems like its trying to be a homage to 'overly-talkie' films like Quentin Tarrintino writes, but sometimes the dialogue simply went nowhere.The actors are all great. It has a stellar cast who do their best, plus the cinematography is all top notch. There's some, but not as much as you may have been led to believe, violence in it. If you've heard this is a violent film, they're probably referring to one particular scene midway through the film. Apart from that, there's actually very little else that will shock you visually.So it has good actors, a good setting, quirky dialogue and a premise that, although not totally original, is certainly watchable. I can see how some people liked it. Although, not everyone did. Some may say that the only thing missing from such greatness is a story. The narrative doesn't really have much focus and flits back and forth from different people leaving you wondering where you'll be next.And then there's the politics. Throughout the film we're constantly seeing the 2012 presidential election campaign on TV screen. Apparently (and I have to confess that I didn't get this) the whole film is an allegory of modern America, i.e. one character represents the American public's sense of despair and apathy, while another represents the American public's sense of knowing what's really happening, but knowing they can't do anything about it and so on.There's a lot to like about Killing Them Softly. There are some very good bits here and there. But then that's the problem - for every good scene there's a dull one that either goes on for too long or doesn't go anywhere.Not bad, but could have been better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Comcast/Xfinity: "In this thrilling crime drama, a professional enforcer (Brad Pitt*) probes the robbery of a mob poker game by three low-level thieves, but his investigation is complicated by an alcoholic hit man (a world-weary looking James Gandolfini*), incompetent gangsters, and the playboy host of the game (a corpulent Ray Liotta*)."* - text in parentheses are my additions -From that description, despite the phrase "thrilling crime drama," I was expecting a "The Ladykillers" or "Lavender Hill Mob" comedy. That turned out to be completely wrong. There is ZERO humor in this film. I also wouldn't call it thrilling, since its obvious the mob wants those involved to be killed.Instead the film is a character study. We get to know the motives, fears, desires of the players. In the background are snipers of TV coverage of the 2008 presidential race between Bush and Obama, a time when the economy was in a state of near collapse later called the Great Recession. Crime, too, is in a depression. Basically the film delivers a depressingly cynical message that Jefferson's vision of democracy is a lie, that America is a business, and that way to live life is take what you can. I watched this on a Comcast/Xfinity cable TV digital recording device. Half-way through I decided that I wasn't enjoying it and turned it off. But several days later I went back and finished it. I'm glad I did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Modern-day crime classic's are hard to find.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Crime has an always be in our world. So will the need and problems of money. Andrew Dominik's 'Killing Them Softly' stars Brad Pitt as a hit man ordered in to clean up a job after a robbery at a poker game went horribly wrong. Through this wee see many criminals such as Ray Liotta as a poker club owner for mobsters to gamble, James Gandolfini as a disgusting criminal, and two new comers playing robbers. 'Killing Them Softly'definitely has its intense moments, but that's not what kind of film it tries to be. Andrew Dominik's message is about how money is always driving people, as well as crime can reflect a human soul. The film takes place during the 2008 Obama/McCain election which ties into the plot of money due to these men trying to solve America's economic chaos. Brad Pitt is excellent as Jackie the hit man who provides cool looks and interesting dialog through. The supporting cast is brilliant and Andrew Dominik delivers a reflective story on the greediness in American's and a new crime classic that has awesome characters that are not forced for a second, and excellent filmmaking to back up this modern day crime classic from a filmmaker that will hopefully become Oscar- worthy in the future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the better films of 2012</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Formally titled Cogans Trade, this grimy little comedy is certainly one of, if not the best looking movie of 2012. It's great to look at. Director Andrew Dominik was put in director's jail after a war with the studio over his Jesse James film and its subsequent box office flopping and it took Brad Pitt to once again allow him another go. But it's Killing Them Softly's rare F cinemascore and quick box office death that will likely send Dominik straight the director's death chamber. The man just can't catch a break and that's a shame because he's clearly talented, has a killer eye and collaborates wonderfully with his cinematographers. The first 20 minutes or so are hilarious as we follow two of the lowest low-lifes stealing dogs and plotting to rob a gambling ring. Then we introduce Pitt, who is the weakest link in the film. He's not terrible by any means and he can be quite good in some scenes, but he doesn't bring much to this character except star power and the rest of the cast is populated with some of the best character actors doing exceptional work. But it's a minor gripe. A larger gripe would be the election broadcasts between Obama and McCain. It was a mean and funny way to open the film, talking about hope and the American dream while we see a low-life miserable and about to cry - but about the 10th time we see a billboard or a debate on a TV, it's no longer satirical or even a hit you over the head metaphor - it's just annoying. That aside, the film is one of my favorites of 2012 and a shame it not only never found an audience, but seemed to anger those who did pay to see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm in two minds about this film. On the one hand, it contains some brilliantly funny monologues from Brad Pitt as an unflappable hit-man, and the much missed James Gandolfini who plays a sex-obsessed washed out colleague of Pitts. It also has a few sequences which define excellent direction, such as a slow motion car assassination in which EVERY angle is explored in detail, and a conversation with someone high on drugs that's so well edited, it must be what trying to communicate with a junkie is truly like.BUT the movie is a long haul for such a simple plot line, and it tends to drag in spots. Plus sometimes it can sometimes be too arty for it's own good, and dwells on scenes when simply rushing on would be the preferred option. Weighing it all up in my head, I decided that the good just about outranks the bad, so I give it a partial recommendation. And... there ya go. 6/10</fullReview>

We don't know who he is other than he's standing in for another guy who's hurt. That's it. Boring. You might say it's a character study on the criminal element. Okay.

		<fullReview>It's really hard to make up your mind about this movie. I don't know if it's really exciting for a boring film, or really boring for an exciting film. The plot itself should give plenty of opportunity for either exciting action, clever dialog, interesting characters or a gripping story. But you don't get action. You get violence, really stylish violence, but not action. You don't really get clever dialog. You get conversations about hookers, sex and some small hints towards politics. None of these conversations really seem to stick, apart from maybe the last conversation between Pitt's and Jenkins' characters. However, this conversation just seems out of place, like director Andrew Dominik wanted it to be in the movie, but didn't know how or where.You don't really get interesting characters. The movie is mainly carried by Pitt's character, a character without any kind of background information or depth. Sure, the character is a cool hit-man, but you get nothing to go on. Maybe this was to create some mystique, but it just leaves you kind of careless about his motives. Same goes for the other characters, with James Gandolfini's character as a low point: when he's introduced you feel he'll be in some way monumental, but he seems to be in the movie for no other reason than just being in the movie. You don't get a gripping story. There's no build up, suspense or climax. This probably has to do with being realistic, but this proves that realism shouldn't be a film's main concern. What you get is a story that has the potential to be gripping.So, it this movie all that bad? No. The acting is tremendous and the way it's shot is tremendous. However, the story is just too hollow, as well as the characters. The director's attempts to include politics (the movie is set around the 2008 elections) never seem to get off the ground, which mainly makes them feel forced, although they do lead to the only memorable (and quotable) lines in the film. So, after about 90 minutes the movie just ends, and you can't help feeling like this movie could've been so much better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Killing Them Softly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The characters who needed to die in this film were not killed softly. In fact writer-director Andrew Dominik shot those scenes in the noisiest way possible, employing graphic visuals and realistically echoing all shots ringing out as if you were at the side of a gun going off at point blank range, putting strain on every speaker in the cinema hall. But when the dust clears an settles, Killing Them Softly is found to be a little wanting, although a reprieve is found in not being anywhere close to the meditative behemoth of his earlier film starring Brad Pitt as Jesse James.Adopting from a 1970s novel written by George V. Higgins entitled Cogan's Trade, Killing Them Softly got updated for today's audiences, putting us in the current US Administration and the various cliffs it had to maneuver itself out of. The corruption of capitalism and social tirade made by Pitt's hit-man character Jackie Cogan probably summarizes in no less succinct terms, all the criticisms leveled at the system, though pales if in comparison to how Edward Norton's Monty Brogan iconic monologue in front of a restroom mirror in Spike Lee's 25th Hour. It shed some hard truths, being politically incorrect and never mincing its words, which made Jackie's one liners seem all the more hollow.From the get go, you'd come to expect a pretty unconventional film, with a fairly irritating and jarring opening credit sequence that prepares you to enter a seedy world where an illegal gambling joint, run by Markie (Ray Liotta) is about to get hit. It muddles about for a little while as primary schemer Johnny (Vincent Curatola) enlists the help of Frankie (Scoot McNairy) and reluctantly, his junkie buddy Russell (Ben Mendelsohn) to pull off a job that has opportunity written all over it, no thanks to Markie having to commit an insider job once, and getting away with the heist even when exposed that he was the mastermind.Richard Jenkins' middle-man Driver character for the mob enters the picture, and engages the services of Jackie to go put things right, where those responsible would have to get pumped with lead. And as with most heist jobs committed by those who cannot keep their mouths shut and their trail clean, it's sooner or later they get found out and tracked, leading all the way back to the top of the food chain. So you'd know how the rest of the film went from a trailer that revealed a little bit too much. Brad Pitt continues in roles that allows him to be ugly characters both internally and externally, having makeup and costuming disguise his good looks in order to blend and try and pull off a negative role fairly convincingly. In fact there isn't any likable character in the movie, where justice prevails in a way, even if it's mob justice. Almost single-handedly carrying the film as the rest of the actors are relative unknowns, the film picked up with his character's introduction, and accompanying graphic violence that perhaps was unnecessary, if not to want to shock the unsuspecting audience into awe at its matter-of-factness.Good production values, brilliant art direction and fine cinematography continue to be hallmarks of Andrew Dominik's film, but here you'd feel short changed at its abrupt ending that didn't go anywhere. It did its job in bringing current proceedings to a close, yet opening another door that left it hanging like an unfinished job. Perhaps it's for artistic reasons to leave an open ending and reminding everyone of the corrupt nature of a business transaction, but this is blatantly hiding its short-coming in shying away from the conventional studio end, and in doing so brought about a certain pretentiousness, and lack of courage maybe, to know how to call it quits properly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This isn't going to change your life, but it can kill some of your time. You might want to imagine this as a Coens black comedy but without much in the way of playful ruses or clever deconstruction that characterize their best work. Sure enough, Pitt and Jenkins were together in Burn After Reading, which aimed for a similar effect?trivial lives destroyed in petty schemes, and all that chaos and human buffoonery as a celestial poker game between callous, indifferent gods.The idea is that the world has been broken for some time now, caused by greed and selfishness. In the film, years ago a mob acquaintance robbed his own poker game and got away with it. This opens the ground for street punks to try it.It happens again only this time with complete incompetence. No one really cares about honor or friendship or even the truth of the thing, except the corporate guys who now run the show are paying for someone to take care of loose ends and public appearance.So, this paid for violence swoops into these lives and blindly wrecks everything. It is brutal to watch, but no one here is innocent. Only the drug-addled fool who got everyone into this mess is spared with prison time, because the laughing gods always take care of their court jester, who half-lives in divine hallucination, and is probably not even going to know the difference.But, Dominik is just too square for this. He insists on serious politics instead of letting us infer it. He pitches some of it as clowning, but then has elegiac Cash on the soundtrack and the filming emphasizes soft urban squalor. There is a baffling slow-motion scene, empty bravura.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I should have known better when I saw a movie I never heard of before with Brad Pitt in it at the rental Kiosk. I should have taken this as an Omen that it was going to be horrible. However I am a big Brad Pitt fan and can't recall any other bad movies he's in. Unlike other big name Actor Brad Pitt seems to cherry pick films that are always good and not selling out to do quick roles to get a quick buck! Even the Animated movie Brad Pitt (MegaMind) was one of the best kids animated movies I've seen.This is an exception, I created an account so i can write this review to warn people not to waste their time or money. This movie has a lot of big name actors but no plot and very little action. I think brad was trying to do an old style film noir but it really failed. I hope this is not the beginning of the end of Brad and he starts going the way of other old actors and making trash. I'm going to see World War Z when it comes out and he better redeem himself!just to reiterate stay away from this.</fullReview>

Good cast crew but that's all this movie has. No plot no goal... etc. It starts off well and trying to "untangle" but it just stays there. You wait wait wait to see something happen and you end up seeing the movie is ending. You ask your self why? Did i lost so much time on this and that's when you get more and more frustrated.

		<fullReview>What can I really say about Andrew Dominik's Killing Them Softly. Well, my bosses named our site after it, and judging by our ongoing excellent taste in film (hehe), the namesake of our moniker should be a masterpiece. It is a masterpiece, a slow burning, truly clever crime yarn that slightly deconstructs the genre, sets it's story at a pivitol time in American history, and has some of the most hard hitting, intimate scenes of violence I've seen on film. Dominik takes his sweet damn time getting to know these characters before any bloodshed occurs, and when it does, it's a visceral affront to the senses, pulveruzing us with a very un-cinematic, realistic and entirely ugly vision of violence. Ray Liotta plays Markie, an illegal gambling official who once robbed one of his own games, subsequently boasting about it like a chump. When another of his outfits is knocked off by two scrappy losers (Ben Mendelsohn and Scoot Mcnairy) logic dictates that it must be him playing games again, and his superiors send a merry troupe of thugs to find him. The matter is overseen by Jackie Cogan (Brad Pitt) a slick, sophisticated killer who prefers to 'kill them softly', in other words, from a distance and with little pleading or fuss. He is employed by "" (an awesome Richard Jenkins), a businessman sort who isn't above haggling for the price of a killer's contract down to the very last dime. You see, the film is set during the 2008 financial crisis, and Dominik takes every opportunity he can to fill his frames with debris, dereliction and strife. Even in a world of criminals the blow to the economy is felt, and they too must adjust accordingly. Cogan brings in outsider Mickey (James Gandolfini), an aging wash up who spends more time swearing , boozing and whoring up a storm than he does getting any work done. Gandolfini ingeniously sends up his capable Tony Soprano character with this bizarro world rendition on the Italian hoodlum, a fat, lazy layabout with bitter shades of the threatening figure he must once of been. Before all this happens, though, we are treated to extended interludes spent with Mendelsohn and Mcnairy, and they both knock it out of the park with their shambling, sweaty, reprehensible presence. Mendelsohn is endlessly watchable, muttering his slovenly dialogue through a curtain of heroin and sleaze. Watch for a tiny, super random cameo from Sam Shepherd as a thug who hassles Liotta. There's a beatdown sequence, and you'll know when it comes, that pushes the limits to extremes. Every punch is felt like a meteor landing, leaving the victim and the viewer aghast. Dominik never throws gimmicks into his work here. Every scene is insistently unique, and the real hero is pacing. The film moves in fits, starts and eruptions with long flatlines in between, until our instinctual knowledge of a narrative truly is lost to the story, with no idea what will happen next. Genius.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow and Unnecessarily Vulgar</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After staging a robbery at his own gambling establishment, ""Markie Trattman" (Ray Liotta) learns what it is like to become an actual victim when a pair of gunmen named "Frankie" (Scoot McNairy) and "Russell" (Ben Mendelsohn) decide to rob the place a few weeks later. Although most of the underworld bosses figure Markie was innocent, the perception of his complicity lingers and a hit man by the name of "Jackie" (Brad Pitt) is hired to resolve the problem. Soon the situation becomes quite dire for everyone involved. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this movie definitely had some potential?especially considering the solid cast available. Unfortunately, the pace was much too slow and the script was unnecessarily inane and vulgar. To put it quite simply, it would have been more beneficial to have had more action and less conversation. As it was, I found this movie to be quite dull and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly below average.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting spectacle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This paragraph is a quite a tangent, but, if you are interested in seeing this movie, I highly suggest you read it. This is not, and I mean NOT (N-O-T), an action movie. There are some scenes with a bit of action in them, but they're all very brief. This movie is a slow- moving thriller, and is very reliant on it's dialogue.So, I just saw Killing Them Softly recently, and these are my thoughts.Killing Them Softly is a Crime Thriller that does not focus on the glorification, nor the extreme shame, that the actual Crime gets in other movies. This movie is actually about the people that commit those Crimes. Killing Them Softly is interesting, due to the fact that almost every single character is a terrible person, who has done terrible things, but, they are also one of the most strangely relate-able bunch of characters I've seen in a while. Every single character has at least something going for them, and, despite their aberrant flaws, it's shocking when something happens to them. I also really enjoyed the little bits of Dark Humor in this film (at least, that's what I thought it was), the performances (especially from Brad Pitt), were really good, and the cinematography was decent.However, this movie is NOT perfect! Although there are more flaws if you nitpick it enough (as with anything), there is one main flaw I found this movie: it's not-so great presentation of story. Don't get me wrong, this film has a very interesting story, and when it opens up, it actually provokes a bit of thought... however, that stuff didn't hit me until more than half-way through the film. The way the filmmakers chose to write the story is very troublesome in the bits and pieces before that more-than-half-way mark, mainly because it's pretty hard to follow. Throughout the opening, I kept saying to myself 'Okay, now you've lost me', which is a bad sign.In total, I'm glad I saw Killing Them Softly. Perfect? No, but not as mediocre as some people will tell you it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring and Uninteresting, with Style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie because my copy of Child 44 was broken, so instead of going upstairs to grab a new movie I stayed where I was and switched on Netflix. I really wish that I'd just taken the effort to go upstairs instead. Killing Them Softly is a gangster movie about the most boring and uninteresting parts of being a gangster. The plot is a day in the life of a gangster, and it's really not all that interesting. Right from the get-go I wondered if I should really stick with this movie. The movie gets right into it, no explanations, nothing. I had no clue what the characters were talking about. As the movie progressed I figured it out, but it was just so unclear at first. The rest of the plot is fine, but it's so slow and uninteresting. There's no interesting plot twists or anything, and sometimes things weren't even clear. Again, they're explained more thoroughly afterwards, but considering the fact that the dialogue could barely explain something as simple as 'kill this guy because he stole from us' it really makes it hard to enjoy. I actually had to see the guy get shot before I understood. The characters, oh boy. The amount of interest that I had in them was nonexistent. And yet the movie tried to develop them. I know none of these characters are really all that important, so why force all these annoying, drawn-out, pointless 'conversations' with them? They're so uninteresting and the movie would have been better without them. At times I would zone out and when I came to the characters would say: "Now, to business" and I'd think 'well it's about bloody time'. The 'character development' was such an unbelievable pain to sit through. Character development isn't just about how long someone can ramble about topics that don't mean anything to anyone. It requires action in addition to conversation. The only good thing about this movie is the stylish violence. There was one scene that was very cool to watch. But was this enough to warrant a more positive rating? No. All the rest of the violence is just regular old violence. No style, nothing. I liked exactly one scene in this movie. Everything else? Not so much. Overall Killing Them Softly was a waste of time. It's slow, boring and uninteresting. But hey, at least there's one good scene. Maybe I just need to watch it with the right mindset, but because of my experience with it I highly doubt that I'll ever bother to re-watch it. In the end I would not hesitate to not recommend this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the rarefied Assassination, with its rich period detail and earthy palette, Killing Them Softly seems rather Grey and even ordinary. It bypasses the last 20 years of post- Tarantino gangster movies to recall David Mamet's 1975 play American Buffalo, itself a meditation on recession-era crime and punishment. The Mamet-like dialogue is the most telling example of what's not quite right. Dominik has a cast of excellent American actors here, but most seem to be in service to a script that isn't quite as sharp and perceptive as it thinks it is. Music (and sound itself) is a secondary problem. Throughout the film, TV sets blast out bulletins from rolling news channels, providing a crude running commentary on the larger world. The music choices (The Velvet Underground's Heroin for a narcotic state) are equally clunky.Surprisingly, then, Killing Them Softly does, just about, work. Key to this is yet another superb turn from Pitt, playing another of his indignant outsider antiheroes: movie-star cool, noir-thriller weary and yet driven by something recognizable and psychologically real. It's Pitt who sells this movie as he navigates the mess he's been brought into, a world where gangsters rob their own illegal card games just for a laugh, and where hired hit men, once the samurai-like loners of bygone days, have become flabby, broken-down, unreliable losers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Engrossing from the start, but plodding in the long run</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This neo-noir crime-thriller, directed by Andrew Dominik and based on the novel 'Cogan's Trade' by George V. Higgins follows a story set in the fall of 2008 during the American financial crisis and the presidential election campaign, of Johnny Amato (played by Vincent Curatola) who hires two amateur criminals Frankie (played by Scott McNairy) and Russell (played by Ben Mendelsohn) to assist in a robbery of an illegal poker game run by Markie Trattman (played by Ray Liotta). After successful pulling off the robbery, Ben and Russell kidnap Markie and brutally dispatch him. This gains the attention of mafia ambassador Driver (played by Richard Jenkins) who hires local hit-man Jackie Cogan (played by Brad Pitt) to go after the criminals and bring them in the justice.The title derives from the main character's unique way of taking down the bad guys. This movie is definitely no instant classic nor does it try to be, it manages to stand tall above its flaws. Brad Pitt is brilliant as ever, and his portrayal in the main role is deeply engrossing enough to keep viewers attention. Ray Liotta who is well known for his performance in the classic crime-drama 'Goodfellas' finds his time to shine here as well. Both these actors manage to stand out from its slow paced plot. The story begins with a promise and the characters remain solid upon introduction. The main flaw, however, comes from the slow pacing of the plot. The film starts at a solid pace and brings fair interest to the characters and the themes of economic collapse including political commentary on the 2008 presidential election campaign when Barack Obama was running for his first term. The idea of the plot is a robbery of a poker game involving illegal gambling to bring down the criminal economy, and the concept is best stated by one of the character's quotes "America is not the country, its a business". The whole concept however, is a bit confusing and somewhat hard to follow. These flaws though, are made up by some incredibly performances by the cast and great cinematography, and an okay direction by Andrew Dominik. Some scenes work well and generate plenty of suspense, others not so much.Killing Them Softly, thought suffering from pacing issues, stands as a firm neo-noir thriller. This is not a film that will appeal to everyone and certainly not appeal to every Brad Pitt fan, but it is worth watching. Just don't go into this movie expecting something like Scarface or Goodfellas, otherwise you will likely be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't read the book before seeing the movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I heard they'd made a movie based on Cogan's Trade, I was eager to see it even tho the cockamamie title put me off. I consider Friends of Eddie Coyle to be one of the all-time classic gangster films &amp; always wondered why none of George V Higgins' other crime novels had ever made it to film. Most of Higgins' plot exposition emerges thru dialog anyhow, so his books seem ready-made for film.Killing Them Softly turned out to be not quite in the same league as Eddie Coyle, but it might have been if they hadn't tried to fix what wasn't broken. Admittedly, a large part of my dissatisfaction with many a movie stems from knowing the books they're based on. Having just re-read Cogan's Trade for maybe the 6th time or so, I knew the story inside out. That's always a problem when they base a movie on one of your favorite books: you've built up clear images of each character &amp; setting in your mind. You also know what's coming next, which can rob the action of considerable impact. Still, if the book's good, you want to savor it on film.This was well cast &amp; acted, with Brad Pitt as hit-man/fixer Jackie Cogan, James Gandolfini as a subcontracted killer reluctant to ply his trade &amp; Vincent Curatola in a small but pithy part as the conniving Johnny Amato. Higgins' original 1974 novel was transposed to the Obama era, which certainly makes sense from a producer's standpoint ? you save money not shelling out for '70s cars or masking anachronistic street scenery ? &amp; maybe that wasn't such a bad thing. Not what I would have preferred, but the story wasn't specifically tied into the '70s, so yeah, OK. And I do have to admit those voice-overs of Obama justifying the infamous Wall Street bailout added a nice touch of irony.My real gripe, what really spoils it for me, is that absolutely extraneous monologue in the bar at the end. Up till then, they'd stuck pretty close to the original &amp; made a pretty decent movie out of it. But then they have Cogan react to a televised Obama speech by spouting off about Thomas Jefferson being a slave-owner &amp; America being not a country but a business. Not that I disagree with the political sentiment expressed, but it just doesn't belong, it seems to have just parachuted in out of nowhere.Presumably they tacked this on in a gratuitous attempt to make the movie somehow more relevant for today's audiences, but it adds nothing to the story &amp; today's relevance very quickly becomes yesterday's obscurity anyhow. Higgins' real mastery was always in the dialog, but some utterly deluded hack with a political axe to grind thought he could improve on Higgins. The sad part is that those in charge ? who should have known better ? let him try.</fullReview>

I think it attracts a lot of the "bada-bing" crowd that really believes that whole load of dog excrement. If, however, you're moderately intelligent and know what a crock that stuff is, you will say, "Finally, a mob film that is pretty darn realistic and no doubt much, much closer to the truth".I found some of the extended dialogue sequences a bit tedious. It didn't ruin it though. Good performances all around. Could have done without some of the artsy fartsy sequences, but that didn't ruin it either. Great Louisiana backdrop.

		<fullReview>This crime drama is a bit slow at times, but harsh violence in sporadic sequences saves KILLING THEM SOFTLY. Markie Tratmann(Ray Liotta)hosts high stakes mafia-sanctioned poker games and has already been broken up once with a robbery in this time of underground economy tanking. Two incompetent small time crooks, Frankie(Scott McNairy)and Russell(Ben Mendelsohn), decide to steal from one of those poker nights in hopes of it being blamed on Markie. At first it is, but then Driver(Richard Jenkins)representing the local mobsters hires the hit man's hit man Jackie Cogan(Brad Pitt)to investigate the robbery and track down the two witless crooks and make them pay for their stupid deed. Jackie is a methodical madman; calm, cool and intimidating. And oh yes, a very deliberate and successful dealer of punishment.America is not a nation or community; it is a business. And sometimes business is calculated and crass. The featured violence is brutal and graphic. Some very strong sexual reverences that border overkill. Pitt may have taken the money and ran; his performance didn't seem hard pressed. Just a smooth and believable role. Also in the cast: James Gandolfini, Vincent Curatola, Max Casella and Sam Shepard.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The soft landing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Brad Pitt was a rising star around 20 years ago, he appeared in a smaller scale film directed by Robert Redford. At the time Pitt was touted as the next golden boy of cinema to follow in the footsteps of Redford. A decade later both Pitt and Redford appeared on screen for the first time in Spy Game and Redford admitted at the time he wanted to see how Pitt has progressed as an actor in the intervening 10 years.It will be true to say that Pitt has followed the Redford play-book somewhat and realised there is more to being just a movie star and look for the next box office popcorn hit and taken on risky projects from Fight Club, Seven and Babel to crowd pleaser's such as Ocean's 11 trilogy or Mr and Mrs Smith.Killing me Softly is a film noir and an independent film with political nuances which merge as the film concludes.Its setting is the autumn of 2008 during the banking crisis and US Presidential elections as we see extensive news clips throughout the film.Pitt plays a hit-man called Cogan who is hired by the mob to rub out two hoods who rob a poker game. Cogan likes to kill his victims without warning so not giving them an opportunity for fear or despair. An act he describes as killing them softly.The film is a low key affair, plenty of swearing, violence and Pitt although being the main star, its actually an ensemble piece. James Gandolfini, Ray Liotta and several others all have scenes to shine although the actors playing the two hoodlums quickly get irritating when you start to think the quicker they get shot the better. Sam Shepard makes an all too brief cameo.The film's noirish plot can become a little confusing if you do not pay enough attention. The violence might be off putting for some. Other's might be left flummoxed as to why we have so many news stories on the financial crisis and the US elections. It rewards you at the end but the message sort of got lost in the violence and stories of bad guys many with little redeeming features.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Characters did it for me.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This felt like something Guy Ritchie or Quentin Tarantino could have done. Plenty of similarities in tone and the whole construct of the film. "Killing them softly" nods towards some of the better movies of these directors, and not just copy/pasting something cheaply without accomplishing anything but establishing a pretty fun experience of its own.The cast is great. I especially enjoyed James Gandolfini (rest in peace sir), Ray Liotta and Ben Mendelsohn. Very good job from all of them. And when you add pretty solid efforts from Brad Pitt, Scoot McNairy and Richard Jenkins, you have no problems here.These good performances compliment this movie probably a little more than most, because we really don't get a brilliant or a gripping storyline. This isn't a "story" movie (although there is one), the story doesn't carry the film. The characters do.There is pretty much dialogue that has nothing to do with the main plot, there are no real "good guys" in this film, there are several main characters without the focus being on just one or two...you get the point. Anyway, this is how you handle characters. Good writing, dynamic scenes, interesting reactions. You feel something for the main characters, each and every one of them. That doesn't happen often in a movie like this. Gandolfini's character especially was great. I loved the writing for him and how he delivered. And he wasn't even an important character for the story itself, just for the mood.There is also a certain political atmosphere present in this film. It mostly focuses on the 2008 US presidential election, TVs on the background and radios on the cars. It gives a nice, weird undertone to the whole movie. Some people may think it's trying to push some agenda, but I didn't really think that's the case. Either way, it doesn't affect my score in any way, just felt like it should be mentioned, it just grounds this movie in a certain way.If you must have an exciting story that is fully told, you could be disappointed in this movie. I liked it for the characters and how well they were handled, the mood, how the whole thing was directed and put together. Well shot, well paced and generally a work of good quality. Oh yeah, and not being PG-13 also helped.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost Great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Almost great.That's what this movie turned out to be. Almost.The opening is brilliantly entertaining in a bleak and sad kind of way. A heist by two of the kind of people you can easily picture are the exact kind of people who'd go and risk their lives for a few thousand bucks. Both actors sell their parts as impossibly, almost unbelievably sad, gullible, rather brainless shitbags.And Brad Pitt turns out another great performance as a sociopath. His capitalistic sociopathic hit-man is brilliant to watch. As are some incredibly well filmed scenes. There's even and interesting undercurrent of political commentary. An explanation of the 2008 financial crash and recession as a parallel to the very illegal poker game heist pulled in the movie.But none of it really comes together. A lot of the screen time just goes for the sake of going, with nothing happening. There's this entire sideplot with James Gandolfini that, while sometimes amusing, also has shots that just last for minutes of people sitting in a perfectly ordinary restaurant, doing nothing. And the entire sideplot doesn't go anywhere and doesn't seem connected at all to the aforementioned political commentary.Nor does the whole political commentary thing work in the end. While it's just drawing interesting parallels to illegal gambling it works fine and is weirdly interesting. At the end of the movie, when the director has Pitt just come out the make the political statement "America isn't a family, it's a business, NOW PAY ME!" It just falls flat.Parallels between the real world and the movie's world were interesting, but until that moment nothing else was really building up. It just feels like an explanation of what happened, rather than a judgement one way or another. So to have this seeming crime caper just go all political in your face at the end was weird. Almost as weird as much of the movie being spent not really doing anything. Pitt's hit-man spends a lot of it waiting around for his break to kill the guys he's there to kill. There's no real cat and mouse or tension, he just spends minutes and tens of minutes sort of... checking around to find them, finding them, then killing them, and then he's done. And so is the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Killing Them Softly is a Gangster / Crime /Mob type film about a group of criminals that decide to hold-up a Mob protected card game. As a result the local Criminal economy suffers and a fearless Hit-man (played by Brad Pitt) is hired to hunt down the culprits.Killing them Softly has some great actors, good script and some great action &amp; effects. The film is quite well made and has a good feel. However, despite having the potential for a good production the film gives up its story far to quickly and any real suspense is lost. There's also characters in the film that don't seem to serve any real purpose so some of the talent is wasted. (There's also the question of why anyone would hire a useless &amp; untrustworthy criminal to do such a high profile robbery!)Overall its fairly entertaining and well made and actually quite enjoyable and there was enough substance to keep me entertained for the duration of the film. Unfortunately it just felt a little pointless!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Andrew Dominik demonstrates that peculiarly British ability to condemn Americans as reactionaries and as rebels both at once. Near the end of this bizarre and often stomach-turning film the central character, a coldly efficient mob hit man, launches a barroom diatribe against Thomas Jefferson--yes, our third President, author of the Declaration of Independence and founder of the University of Virginia who doubled the size of the country by the Louisiana Purchase! Now, Jefferson's war record might have been somewhat iffy but he certainly was more than a wine snob and slave humping lecher.It's understandable that a fifty year old novel might require a few changes to film it in this era. What we see on the screen here however is in no way the character study mob prosecutor turned novelist George Higgins made from listening to hundreds of hours of bugged and wiretapped conversations and reducing them to written transcripts with every grammatical mistake, every stammer and of course every obscenity exactly captured. It is instead an anti-American diatribe with excerpts from the speeches of candidate Obama and President W. Bush continually playing in the background. This annoying counterpoint is meant, one supposes, to show in classic Marxist fashion that it doesn't matter who becomes President because elected government is a sham, America is heartless and corrupt offering no opportunities but crime either big-time like the bankers or small potatoes like the career creeps who feature in this picture.Along with Brad Pitt himself, at least a dozen people are given a producing credit for this movie, counting all the associate producers and assistant producers. This may explain why this ill digested story of the robbery of a mob-protected poker game and its consequences turned out as it did.Nor is Dominik without flaw as a screenwriter. He cannot keep Britishisms out of the speech of his Americans. Americans don't "piss themselves" and they never "have a go" at anyone or anything. The characters in the novel, several of them, are changed to where they make no sense in the story. The New England Mafia run out of Providence, RI by capo Raymond Patriarca becomes some faceless corporate entity.There are some pluses. The cinematography captures the bleakness of certain parts of Boston. In what turned out to be his swan song James Gandolfini plays an out of town gunman pretty much as George Higgins created him. Brad Pitt is suitably cunning as the murderous Jackie Cogan whose job is to set things right when criminals get out of line and prey on each other.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Teaming up for the second time after 2007's masterpiece The Assassination of Jessie James by the Coward Robert Ford, director Andrew Dominik and star/co-producer Brad Pitt bring us another beautifully bleak piece of cinema with Killing Me Softly. Like Jessie James, Softly is very much a mood piece, full of astonishing imagery that speaks as much about its characters as the actors themselves. But where Jessie James was gripping and wholly absorbing over its 160+ minute running- time, Softly is ultimately quite dull at just 97 minutes, playing with an interesting economic subtext alongside a rather straight-forward crime story, full of characters seen many times before and even played by the same actors.Two small-time crooks, Frankie (Scoot McNairy) and Russell (Ben Mendelsohn), are drafted in by a gangster known as the Squirrel (Vincent Curatola - The Sopranos' Johnny Sack) to rob a mob card game ran by Markie (Ray Liotta). Markie had robbed his own game in the past and later admitted to it, but was given a pass due to his likability, and the Squirrel feels he will inevitably get the blame this time. The robbery is a success and Frankie and Russell go to ground, so the mob ask the mysterious Driver (Richard Jenkins) to bring in hired killer Jackie Cogan (Pitt) to find and kill the culprits, only Jackie likes to 'kill them softly' from afar, and realising he knows one of the targets, brings in over-the-hill trigger-man Mickey (James Gandolfini) to help.With only one female character of note appearing in the film for the duration of about a minute, Killing Me Softly is very male-orientated, featuring a lot of hard men talking in rooms smoking cigarettes and getting down to business. This would be all well and good if the plot threw in any elements of surprise, but the film moves on with an almost resigned inevitability towards a rather straight-forward climax. But this is a film that strives for more than a bunch of criminals whacking each other - that is clear from the repetitive news coverage of the Obama-McCain presidential campaign (the film is set in post-Katrina New Orleans in 2008) - but it tries to hammer the point home. The big joke is that economic hardships even effect those who steal for a living (the robbery causes an imbalance within the criminal economy), but the point is not made with any subtlety - surprising given the care Dominik gave to Jessie James.All that said, the film still has plenty going for it. The cast are superb, with Gandolfini stealing the film with a relatively small role yet again, as the boozy, sex-obsessed hit-man who may have been something in his day, but has become a sad man full of self-loathing due to an unhappy marriage. Mendelsohn impresses as well as a junkie who makes his money from stealing dogs and selling them for profit. But the plaudits must go to cinematographer Greig Fraser, who injects a steely 70's feel to a film set mostly at night, and throws in a moment of ultra slo-mo when an unfortunate character gets riddled with bullets in his car, that is as beautiful as it is ugly. However, these plus-points do not manage to save the film from being a huge disappointment given the talent involved, and with a more interesting plot and less spoon-feeding of its social message, could have been outstanding.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*This review does NOT contain any plot spoilers*This is a gritty mobster movie and it not for anyone with a weak stomach. There is no shortage of blood, violence, sex, and extreme profanity. The political undertones are simply trying to portray that there is no big difference between main street and wall street. The characters in this movie do everything for money and the political messages and what not are supporting the fact everyone needs money blah blah blah so on and so on.Basically, the political ad ins made sense to me. It ties the whole movie together where it lacks plot. I was able to use my imagination and make sense of it, where others may give the movie a one star rating and say it doesn't make sense. The movies current rating of 6.3 does not do it justice because all the extremest one star ratings. I say check it out if you do not have a weak stomach and if you can put together the plot with the political back tones.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Killing The Softly is Neither Soft Nor Rock Solid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you have read through my reviews, you will know that I am a stickler for realism in movies that should command it. This is my outlook and if you are watching something with me, its to the point of being annoying. But it is what it is. And Killing Them Softly suffers early on from a plot point which is so unrealistic that it affects the level of the rest of the film. But let me give a brief rundown of the setup here.Its 2008, and the economy is collapsing. The underlying parallel drawn throughout Killing Them Softly is that the downturn has carried over into the underworld as well. Criminal organizations have lost their clout, street level cons don't respect the bosses, no one is making any money. Its in this setting that semi-wiseguy Johnny Amato (Vincent Curatola) recruits a hapless thief named Frankie (Scoot McNairy) to rob an underground card room frequented by goons and ran by Markie Trattman (Ray Liotta). The kicker of their plan is that it is common knowledge amongst local wiseguys that Trattman himself orchestrated the last robbery on his card room. So if the card game is robbed again, everyone will blame Trattman, thinking he set it up himself. Of course, things do not follow said plan, and once the robbery has happened, the big shots call in hit-man Jackie Cogan (Brad Pitt) to track down the bandits.Killing Them Softly is brilliantly acted. Pitt is spot on as a frustrated button man who belongs in a different era where those who violated the gangster code were dealt with severely. James Gandolfini also shines as New York Mickey, an old school fixer who is way past his prime. Cogan summons for Mickey thinking he needs a veteran partner to get the cleanup done properly. However upon Mickey's arrival, Cogan quickly realizes that he may be a liability instead of an asset as Mickey is a boozehound broken up by his failing marriage. The scenes between the two are like watching a couple of prizefighters speculating on MMA boxing, two old warriors being left behind by a world that has moved on without them. Likewise with Pitt's moments on screen with Richard Jenkins, who stops in as the unnamed middle man between Cogan and the unseen crime bosses.But back to the aforementioned unrealistic plot point. It is revealed early that these gangsters were robbed once already by Liotta's character and they decided to let it slide because he is so likable. To me, that just kills the culpability of the rest of the film. It may be that director Andrew Dominik was trying to point out that that is just how far these gangsters have slid to let a disrespect like that go unpunished. But I feel it is an unforgivable error, and the film is kept from being great due to it.</fullReview>

I was vastly disappointed when I watched this.Firstly, I was severely disappointed with Gandolfini's contribution who hardly appears in this film, despite being a phenomenal actor who was one reason why the Sopranos was so good.I also felt that the film tried way too hard in being arty and the time and effort it put into this could have been better spent elsewhere.Maybe I'm being unfair, this film wasn't all bad.

		<fullReview>With a cast of stars including Pitt, Gandolfini and Liotta and based on a crime novel involving the mafia, hits and heists you would expect this to be excellent. So is it? yes! well no, hmmm...errr yeeaah...kinda.The plot in this film is really very simple and pretty thin. Ray Liotta's character sets up his own poker ring operation for the loot and gets away with it scot-free. Sometime later two losers do the same thing to Liotta's poker ring and they get away with all the loot...putting Liotta's character under suspicion. Pitt's hit-man character is then brought in to sort out the whole situation and find out who stuck up the poker ring for a second time. Which I might add he manages quite easily it seems.That's the game in a nutshell and like Pitt's acting its basic. This film is semi decent yet flawed, flawed in the sense that the plot is stretched out to 1h 37min with lots of pointless dialog. Most of which bares no relation to the actual plot but just drones on. The main sequences guilty of this are the dialogs between Pitt and Gandolfini, the latter of which just goes on and on about screwing hookers whilst drinking and not much else.To be honest the plot is half way complete early into the film, Pitt has his job to do and it doesn't need this long to watch him do it. Don't get me wrong though the acting is terrific throughout from almost all players involved...well the stars, accept Pitt. Liotta is turned from tough guy to punch bag in this mobster story and he does it well. Gandolfini looks every bit like a real mafioso head honcho year by year and does what he does best despite the meaningless rambling dialog he has and Jenkins is solid n stoic as ever.For me this film does highlight how very average an actor Pitt is surrounded by some serious acting stalwarts. Again don't get me wrong, Pitt does OK in his role and in any less of a film he would be fine but this is a grown up mobster flick and he just doesn't match up. I'm not really too sure why they would cast the guy in this type of film really. One sequence I don't get with Pitt's character is when he whacks one guy...but using a shotgun?! Not only that but he does it from a distance! surely shotguns aren't that effective from a distance and surely carrying out a hit this way would attract a lot of attention from say...the noise?! Not to mention the mess and damage, ah what do I know.The other thing that bugged me was Scoot McNairy and his annoying tone of voice, the guy sounded like Shaggy outta 'Scooby Doo' for Pete's sake!! geeeez! Didn't think much of Ben Mendelsohn either really. He's an Aussie actor and plays an Aussie in the film, the guy just didn't fit into the story at all, typical US hoods and an Aussie, nah.The profanity count is high and the violence is brutal, it may make you wince, possibly even jump at times but there isn't lots of it. As this takes place in 2008 there is also snippets from the real event of President Obama's election campaign and victory, why? I'm not so sure as it has no real relevance to the plot or its outcomes. There is a political message in here as Pitt's character states 'America's not a country, its just a business', its all about $$$.The film is well directed whilst visually it looks slick and gritty, but its trying to hard to be a Scorsese product or trying to hard to be something unique and different. Either way it doesn't really make it mainly down to the fact there isn't much of a plot to speak of.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fantastic. Just a great throwback crime flick with an excellent cast. It pretty much simultaneously works as a crime thriller, a dark comedy, and a social commentary. Of the cast I'd say Scoot McNairy and Pitt were the standouts. Gandolfini and Richard Jenkins are also pretty good despite not really having much to do. It's a nice change of pace for Andrew Dominik after the sprawling epic that was The Assassination of Jesse James. This is a lean, mean movie that tells an engaging story and takes care of its business all in about 95 minutes. I don't think this is the kind of a movie that will be an Oscar contender. Anyone who is a fan of the cast and/or the genre should be able to find a lot to like though. Very highly recommended!</fullReview>

This isn't a good film, it's boring, but based on on something that really shouldn't be. Which I suppose is the point it's making, but it's a very dull point. And what's up with James Gandolfini character? did they hire him for the film, pay him and he turned up but then realize they didn't have a part for him? and had to add it in last minute? waste of time, as was the rest if the film.</fullReview>

Brad Pitt does not make a convincing bad guy. "Squirrel" was sort of funny, yet still credible. Way too much political babble constantly-- what on earth is all that about? Did people really pay to go see this? How much were the people that gave it good reviews paid to do so? Ray Liotta did a good job, he seems to be part of many mob flicks.

		<fullReview>Jackie : Next he'll be telling us we're a community Jesus, what a disappointing movie this was. The only thing it excelled in, is the fact that a trashy story that you can summarize in a few lines, was drawn out over a period of long miserable 97 minutes. If the intention is to express a political statement that the most important thing in the world is money, and that America is not the idealized "Land of Hope and Glory" and everything is really nothing else than "Just a business", then I think this movie is completely useless and a waste of time, as this has been demonstrated in many other films. Every well-informed citizen who's aware of political affairs in the world,knows this. And the fact it's more lucrative to end up in the crime scene compared to a standard job is generally known. It's also not shocking news that this isn't without danger.The synopsis of the entire film is dead simple : a small local criminal is planning to raid the gamble room of another small local criminal. The brilliancy of this plan is the fact that this 2nd criminal already robbed his own gambling club before. So the mafia will assume he did it again, eliminate him and the 1st criminal and his companions go unpunished. The first criminal hires two nitwits to perform the job. At the same time the mafia sends someone to straighten things out. His plan is to eliminate criminal 2 so the hardcore gamblers gain back confidence and business are back as usual. After a while he finds out who the real perpetrators were. Meanwhile the requested 2nd assassin has been sent back home with a "Return to sender"-stamp on his butt, because of his drinking problem and an unstable state of mind. As a final result criminal number 1 and nitwit number 1 are eliminated. The 2nd robber is safe and sound in prison cause of drug offenses.Absolutely nothing happens in this movie except for some harsh and brutal scenes (exactly 4). You get however endless chattering about a cheating wife, a drinking problem and a thighs slapping story about driving around in a car with a pack of dogs crapping all over the place. The scene where Markie is terribly beaten up by two accomplices is quite realistic with blood and vomit flying around as a result. The killings are not for the faint-hearted and are shown in a brutal and cold-blooded way. But this was not enough to save the movie.Even Pitts appearance as a kind of "The Wolf" from Pulp Fiction who comes to clean up the mess, isn't enough to make this movie better. The performances of Pitt and Gandolfini, who really has the look of an experienced gangster, are really exquisite. Beside that the rest is just a sad spectacle. Frankie and Rusell really are two individuals no one would pick to do that robbery. Rusell looks as if he's drugged all the time and constantly produces nonsensical gibberish.Fans of alternative movies will love KTS because of the quasi-intellectual overtones and the sophisticated cinematographic recording techniques. You can probably say that the slow motion images used during the beat up of Markie is pleasing to the eye and brilliantly portrayed. It's also nothing new. In "Disconnect" they used it at the end. Only in that movie the story around these images was much better. And fragments of speeches by Bush and Obama scattered throughout the film will also be appreciated. Not for me. I hear that kind of drivel already enough in the news.All in all a faint gangster story More reviews at http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be/</fullReview>

We're all just pawns, man!?that you wish he maybe could have made a movie about politics and its effect on normal people that wasn't literally narrated by C-SPAN. It doesn't help that none of these gangsters are interesting in and of themselves; they're all so weighted down by Import that the movie never has a chance to come to life. It's so anchored in Dominik's grim world view that there are never any stakes. Gandolfini gives a committed performance as a disintegrating killer who realizes just how pathetic his life has been, but Dominik gives us little reason to care; I spent most of his scenes wondering if he was supposed to represent a big financial bank in foreclosure, or the American taxpayer, or maybe George W.

		<fullReview>Johnny Amato (Vincent Curatola) wants to rob a closely guarded mob card game. Amato uses two inept gunmen, Frankie, (Scoot McNairy) and a drug Aussie named Russell. (Ben Mendelson) Amato doesn't want to use Russell to knock over Markie Trattman's (Ray Liota) poker game, but Frankie convinces him. Amazingly, the two bumbling gunmen pull it off. A mob associate, The Driver (Richard Jenkins) brings in a hit-man named Jackie (Brad Pitt) to hunt down and kill Johnny, Frankie, Russell, and Markie Trattman. Jackie's reluctant to kill Markie, even though he thinks Markie is in on it. Jackie brings in a washed-up hit-man called Mickey (James Gandolfini) to track the four men down. Jackie doesn't need much help finding the perpetrators, because Frankie's been bragging about robbing the poker game to Jackie's mutual friend Dillon (Sam Sheppard). Does Jackie find Amato, Frankie, Russell and Markie? What does he do when he finds them?I don't like this movie. It tries to be a cheap copy of a Tarantino movie and fails. Do you know how I know it tried to be a Tarantino knockoff? Frankie and Russell start talking about things that aren't related to the heist in an irreverent way, but the difference between this movie and a movie like Reservoir Dogs, which successfully punctures pop culture, the writing in Killing Them Softly SOUNDS like movie dialogue, it doesn't sound like the way gangsters talk, the way Tarantino would write it. Another disappointment in this movie is the interspersing of political speeches by W, and Obama during the financial crisis, with the action in this movie. I don't know many bar owners or gangsters that are interested in politics, but in every scene there's some pol making a speech in the background. Lest the viewer think this is accidental, Pitt makes a long soliloquy about what he thinks about the government. Brad Pitt needs to realize his limitations as an actor, he is good in certain roles, action movies, that take advantage of his comedic timing, like Inglorious Basterds, a great Tarantino film. But Pitt is deadly serious here, not even a hint of irony. This movie reminds me of Drive, but Pitt is not nearly as good an actor as Ryan Gosling is. Gosling's moody performance in the Driver is what made that movie work, Pitt's mumbling throughout makes this movie snoozeworthy. It's nice to see James Gandolfini, in what could have been his last role, but he does nothing more than reprise his Sopronos role, and reinforce the tendency of casting directors to typecast people. Ray Liotta makes the best of a small role, but he was much better in Goodfellas. The movie is slow, but it's not the direction, it's the writing, but you can blame the same guy, Andrew Dominick, he wrote and directed this movie. He also wrote the similarly boring Assassination of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford.For many more movie reviews, visit my blog reviewswithatude.wordpresss.comKilling Them Softly: Bored to Death.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film may not be Citizen Kane but its not one of those films which will be forgotten. It has the characteristics of a film which generates a cult following for reasons you cannot put a finger on. The film however may not be for everyone. There is a poetry behind the parallel the film tries to draw. Set in the time when Obama was running his "Yes, we can" campaign for the presidential elections, the film tries to draw parallels between the dystopia of a once rich and prosperous nation and a once happy and profitable gangster trade.Recession has hit even the gangsters. They need to make the same changes in their businesses that other corporates have been doing. Cutting costs, bringing in a no surprise mode of operations, hiring consultants to execute projects, so on and so forth.The poetry doesn't end there. Some of the substance induced conversations are so surreal, its near poetic. Some scenes put you on the edge of your seat and some make you say "WTF". Some make you ponder what's going on and once in a while there is "WOW" scene.Having said this, the film has its share of clichés. Some which almost tend to show the messy screen writing. This is where the film falls remarkably short of being a classic. The film is worth watching. Worth watching for a few repeats too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everything you want in a movie, except a story!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Take some excellent acting, believable characters, excellent cinematography, thoughtful sound and lighting work, and you would expect an above average movie. Unfortunately there is one key ingredient missing from Killing Them Softly and that would be a plot. I paid $0.99 to watch it via a streaming service and that was way too high a price. I've watched super bowl commercials with more complex story lines. Technically it is sound, but the plot is not as good as Plan 9 from Outer Space. To sum it up, three guys do something stupid that copies the stupid thing another guy once did. Those guys get killed for being so stupid. I dosed off during while watching so I backed it up thinking I must have missed something important since the film had no meat to the story, but I soon realized I missed nothing by sleeping through twenty minutes of it. The movie is worth watching if someone pays you to do so, but otherwise don't waste your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Negotiating a hit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching Killing Them Softly put me in mind of the great crime caper film of the Seventies, Charley Varrick. That's the one where Walter Matthau and some accomplices pull off a bank heist in a small out of the way bank in an obscure New Mexico town. Only the bank is a place where syndicate money is held and laundered. Joe Don Baker is the hit-man sent after them and he loves his work. Fortunately at least for Walter Matthau he's smart enough to outwit Baker. Killing Them Softly has no Matthau among the targets as the tale is told from hit-man's point of view.The hit-man or at least one of them is Brad Pitt and he gets no pleasure in his work, it's a business like any other. He wants to be well compensated for his services. In fact he wants to Kill Them Softly which to him means taking them out with a rifle with scope because he doesn't want to hear their pleadings. Or by surprise in one case where everyone knows its coming, but the victim.Two real criminal losers Ben Mendelsohn and Scoot McNairy are hired by Vincent Curatola to rob an illegal gambling establishment run by Ray Liotta. With Liotta you can see a bit of his Henry Hill from Goodfellas, with Hill running just this kind of place as he headed into middle age in the mob. The reason for this target is that several years earlier Liotta ripped his own card game off, but eventually was forgiven when the gambling started booming again. Curatola is sure the mob will look right at Liotta again. Not that they don't look at Liotta again, but they're smarter than that. They always are.Once the caper goes down in comes Pitt, but also with a few competitors, James Gandolfini being one. That's where Pitt starts negotiating his deal.Brad Pitt gives a good performance here, but for me the real stars are McNairy and Mendelsohn. You will rarely losers with a capital "L" portrayed on the screen as they are with these two. In a way they ought to be put out of their misery for their own good. Still you feel sorry for them somewhat.Interesting mob movie with some deep black comic overtones.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excruciatingly bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really had high hopes for this one based on the trailers I saw but it really took a nose dive the longer it went on. It started with the intro flashing back and forth from the scene to the opening credits, like a strobe light. It was so annoying. Everything was very drawn out. Even the killing scenes took its time, focusing more on using cool effects then moving the story along. There wasn't any action and the conversations between Brad Pitt and James Gandolfini were confusing, pointless and horribly long. In an effort to avoid being completely negative, there were a couple of good things about this film. The robbery scene to kick start the plot of this film was pretty good. There was a good amount of tension to it and the camera work helped with that. The political speeches of the time interjects throughout the movie which I thought was fitting with the plot. They talk about the economy and saving the economy and I thought it related well to the robbery and how it affected the economy of the mob who got robbed. The dialogue between Brad Pitt and Richard Jenkins was really good, offering a bit of a point of contention between Pitt and those that have hired him, even though it never goes anywhere. That is the main problem with this movie, it never goes anywhere. James Gandolfini's character is the worst character ever in mob film history. He whines, complains and tries so hard to have an emotional angle that the character gets lost in it to the point where he becomes irrelevant. All the conversations that take place in this film never goes anywhere and nothing is resolved. Really disappointed in this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really not that great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, so I'll open this up with the fact that I am a huge fan of Brad Pitt and usually I will really try to like a film when I'm watching it when he is one of the roles, but this film was a serious exception to that rule. To put it bluntly, I'm not sure how many of these reviews can be listed as "containing spoilers" because not much even happened. However, one of my main issues with this film is the straight up over- usage of swearing and offensive language. I understand that some movies cannot have the mood captured unless you tap into that kind of dialect (I love Tarantino films - including Django Unchained) but this film almost relied on it and for me and my boyfriend it actually made it pretty uncomfortable and tiresome to watch. I'm in no way a prude, just to point out, I think anyone reading this review who has seen the film will agree with me that there was an excessive use of language, which I generally feel make a film unrealistic in ways. Overall, I don't have much criticism for the storyline of the film (even though there was a distinct lack of it) apart from the fact that it seemed to go off onto tangents and talk about people that weren't actually given a face until you've already forgotten their name and what they'd allegedly done. But what do I know, I turned off leaving 35 minutes left, and I think this is possibly one of the first films I've ever seen where I haven't even cared about what happened. That being said, I do know people who would actually really enjoy this film and would review it as 10 out of 10, so maybe it's just an acquired taste.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How not to write an allegory</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brad Pitt plays a hit-man sent in to clean up a mess caused by the robbery of a mafia-run card game by a group of amateurs. But wait, there's more! See, it's really about America and the economy and all sorts of relevant things. What, you didn't see it? You must have been watching a completely different movie because half the time it seems like the actors should just turn to the camera and tell you the message.The Driver represents the government, Mickey represents the American people, fallen from grace, and Jackie represents the growing cynicism or voice of reason, your call. This is outlined with scenes such as when Jackie insults Thomas Jefferson while the Driver defends him, Jackie says Mickey "just ain't the same anymore", when The Driver is hesitant to make arguably logical yet tough decisions, and of course the monologue where Jackie basically says "maaan, the people don't caaaaare about each other. We're not Americaaaans. People only care about moooooney." Even less subtle is the political speeches that frame the movie, where Bush talks about the economy and Obama talks about how we're all the same.There is a lot to like about this movie though. The dialog is well written and acted and the tension is handled beautifully. The characters are also interesting. The cinematography is also well made, though sometimes out of place or blatantly derivative. (Dredd?) My other main complaint is when Jackie explains the title's namesake. When he's confronted with it though, they never really go anywhere with it. That's how one can best describe this movie: It doesn't really go anywhere. But it's a fine movie to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Killing Them SoftlyThe softest way to kill someone is to place a silk encased feather-down pillow over their face and smothering them to death.This thriller, however, defines "soft killing" as shooting from afar.Johnny (Vincent Curatola) hires Frankie (Scoot McNairy) and Russell (Ben Mendelsohn) to holdup a gangland poker game under the assumption the blame will fall on Markie (Ray Liotta), the guy who robbed it previously.Unfortunately, when Russell spills the beans about their successful heist, it gets back to Jackie Cogan (Brad Pitt), a cold-blooded hit man hired by the mafia to kill Markie.Fearful for his life, Frankie makes a deal with Jackie to give him Johnny, but can he trust Jackie to keep his word?While the assassinations are impressive, the longwinded chats and Frankie's irritating voice make for an uneven experience. Incidentally, the best disguise for robbing a poker game is wearing sunglasses and a hoodie.Red Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brutal brilliant cynicism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A blackest of black comedies about the revenge organised crime exacts against some thieves who stole from them, set against the recent collapse of the global banking system. In both cases, confidence in the system needs to be restored. In only one do those responsible pay the price. "It's not what you do," as one of the characters says, "It's what other people think you've done." There is some superb acting from a fantastic cast. James Gandolfini's portrayal of emotional disintegration as an unreliable hit-man, Scoot McNairy's frightened, weak, and human petty thief, and Ben Mendelsohn's pathetically realistic drug addict who's hopeless empty existence revolves around implausible schemes to make money, are all outstanding. Among them, Brad Pitt's coldly amused and business-like hit-man comes across as less consistent and less well-rounded. However, he easily dominates the final scenes and his delivery of the final dialogue, the knockout punch of the whole film, is wonderful.Among all this is the sheer banality of crime, the utter lack of imagination, the inability to conceive of consequences before actions that doom the them. Some of these characters are so low they are standing under the barrel, looking up at the bottom and thinking it's the sky.In the scope that this film gives the actors room to act, Killing Them Softly feels like an American "44-Inch Chest", another gangster film I really like (though with a very different moral outcome). And, perhaps strangely, it also bears comparison to Ralph Feinnes "Coriolanus", as well as the obvious influence of Tarantino's bantering style from films like Pulp Fiction.Killing Them Softly is theatrical in style, in that it is dialogue heavy, and it does also take a good few minutes to get up to speed with a prolonged opening explanation of the setup. Once past that the story, dialogue and acting are absorbing and tense.A film as bleak and cynical as they come, and filled with good performances, I greatly enjoyed this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At the end of most movies, you usually get something out of it. Maybe you were entertained for around 2 hours. Maybe you got some insight into an event you didn't know something about. Maybe you just got to stare at someone good looking for a while. This film.....I just don't get it.It's not that the story line is hard to follow. Two punks pull a job which lands them in a whole bunch of trouble. In comes hit-man Brad Pitt to clean up the mess. It's just that, at the end of it all, you kind of think, well, what's the point?Andrew Dominik certainly shoots the film well. And given that he wrote the screenplay, it's falls on him to make this an enjoyable film. And it's not that it's poorly written either. It just doesn't have a point. Even the storyline, whilst pretty straight forward, doesn't open up your world or even provide that much entertainment as you follow Pitt's character through his paces. But maybe that's the point of the film.....who knows. All I know is that at the end of 90 minutes, I knew I'd watched a storyline play out, with no real surprises, no real twists or life-enlightening moment. Step A went to Step B went to Step C, and not via D.It's well acted. Pitt does OK with a relatively straight forward role. Scoot McNairy is the standout as Frankie, one of the poor lads who gets caught up in the job. Ben Mendelsohn is decent as the other half of the duo, whilst James Gandolfini is great in his little cameo, although I don't really get what the point of his character is. It almost felt that his scenes were thrown in there to stretch out the running time.All in all, it's not that this is badly made, or badly acted, or badly shot. It's just a pointless film. Not sure what Pitt, who can pretty much pick and choose what he makes these days, saw in this film, but whatever it was, I didn't see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great, now let's see the rest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An interesting style mostly seen in Tarantino filmsThis flick is more about each scene than it is as a whole movie. Some will appreciate this, loving the slowed-down-to-create-a-tense-livable- reality, but, the majority may label it was slow with no action. They however would be missing the point in that each scene or verbal exchange is the action. Long bouts of dialog (and / or body language) give you the time to understand each parties perspective and, feel their worry, confidence or fear. We are immersed into the thought patterns of each character and that gives so much more depth to these scenes as we ponder the possible outcomes that may emerge with each passing sentenceThat said, it's all very well to create character depth, great dialog, atmosphere and a believable story, but you have to take it somewhere, ideally a thrilling, clever or action packed ending.#major spoiler coming - don't read on if you having seen it yet#Pitt's character didn't get paid at the end and we've been shown he's a business man, or, sociopath .. you can call that. Either way he won't take it lying down not getting the cheddar owed to him and that is clearly portrayed in the lead up to, well, the credits. It seemed poised perfectly for the assassin to take on the employer and complete the story in a tense standoff where the man that has it all gets a dose of reality that money doesn't buy everything - including life. We should have again got to join the minds of those involved in a dialog that would change what we think we are about to see as a conclusion with each passing sentence.There's a reason Tarantino films are long. You want to use realistic scenes it will be slower, and if you're going to do that stick with it and finish the story with detail and style because that is what fans of this style are waiting for!Solid movie but seemed like it got short 3/4 of the way through</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brad Pitt, a mob hit-man, cleans up after a card game is robbed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Killing Them Softly" has some big positives, one big negative, and a fairly large other negative. If the big negative had been left out of the picture and some other relevant material substituted, this neo-noir movie could have given the 1967 "Point Blank" with Lee Marvin at least some competition. But, to be honest, I doubt even then that it would approach that film or "The Friends of Eddie Coyle", both being films set squarely in the world of hoods.Brad Pitt is really excellent in a well-written part. James Gandolfini also lifts the picture with his portrayal of a hit-man who likes his booze and his women. Ray Liotta provides good support, and so do the two small-timers who rob the card game in a tense scene. They are actors Scoot McNairy and Ben Mendelsohn. The acting is a big positive. The basic story is also a big positive.So, what is the big negative? The writer and director was Andrew Dominik. His directing was good. Where he went wrong big-time was in his idea that the actions of the hoods in this film find a clear parallel in the 2008 financial crisis, and then he failed in his attempts to integrate footage of Bush and Obama and newscasters who are talking about these events. Dominik has said of the original story "as I started adapting it, it was the story of an economic crisis, and it was an economic crisis in an economy that was funded by gambling ? and the crisis occurred due to a failure in regulation. It just seemed to have something that you couldn't ignore." The financial events have their villains, for sure, but Dominik's screenplay doesn't identify them and it completely fails to show the parallels, if any, between these unidentified bad guys and bad institutions and the goings-on of these hoods and hit men. All that he ends up doing is weakening the focus of the film. While watching the film, I made an effort to ignore this background stuff, since to me it functioned as irrelevant noise.I have to wonder why screenwriters make such gross mistakes and why no one who reads the scripts is able to bring them to the attention of the film makers.The other lesser negative is a little too much of the semi-comic, rambling, and vulgar kind of dialog that Tarentino brought to the screen and that traces back to some of the screenplays that Scorcese used to depict the mafia. This has worn out its welcome. It no longer seems original. It creates a certain tone to the picture that is unrealistic. This undermines the neo-noir center to the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In Killing Them Softly, Brad Pitt is not too shabby. The movie however, is depressing, mean-spirited, and unnecessary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Killing Them Softly is one those movies that even almost a year since its release, I'm still trying to figure out why it got made, how it was able to get made, and why would anyone want to make it. Its director, Andrew Dominik, from what I found out in an interview, actually said that his film was sort of a comedy. We'll it is about as comedic as the movie Platoon (1986). In all honesty, Killing Them Softly is dour, depressing, and the cinematic equivalent of an oil sludge. It has the minimal amount of plot because some of the plot holes are the size of craters on the moon. Added to that, you have James Gandolfini (I kinda thought he was an important part of the story) enter the film with two 5-10 minutes scenes only to be never be heard from again. Oh and I almost forgot, Sam Shepard, a well known actor, inhabits about 30 seconds of screen time without any lines of dialogue. Huh? In truth this film has other characters you feel sorry for and don't care about at the same time (not easy to pull off but nevertheless this is not a compliment). And believe it or not, what's on screen was based on a novel (Cogan's Trade by George V. Higgins). With 97 minutes of virtually nothing of real importance, I'm sure that it must have been one epic novel.Now I would never give a movie zero stars because well, I've never made one and I'm sure it's very hard work. I usually give a review a minimum of 1 star. With this one, I'll throw in another one because the performances are pretty decent (especially Brad Pitt, who tends to give good performances in bad movies). His character, Jackie Cogan, plays a philosophical hit man who has to off a couple of guys that rob a Mob protected card game. He's gets the OK from Driver (Richard Jenkins a mafia diplomat) and proceeds to also implicate another hit man to help out with the job (Mickey Fallon, played with schizophrenic void by James Gandolfini). That's basically the whole movie. Everything in between is conversations between 1-3 actors (usually most of the scenes are between two). This gives Killing Them Softly an empty, shut out feeling. Some movies succeed with a "behind closed doors" ramification. This is not one of them. As a viewer myself, I felt a sense of solitude and possibly needed to see a psychiatrist (you know I'm kidding).Despite many of its shortcomings, I can honestly say that it was however, well shot. And Dominik seems to love to use special lenses. They highlight the images of a drug addicted haze through the eyes of some of the characters. This is done before they commit their crimes or get killed. But really what's the point. If there is any message to convey from all of this it's explained in T.V. images throughout the film of Obama preaching out to the world during what I guess is the 2008 Presidential election. That's not enough for me. And I sure based on the box office take for Killing Them Softly, other moviegoers felt the same way. At the end of the film, Pitt utters the line, "America is not a country, it's just a business. Now pay me." That's sound advice. I wish I could go back in time when I saw this movie at the theater. I'd tell the manager at the box office that he or she needs to pay me to see this dud.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beating Them Over the Head With the Point</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When You get Ray Liotta and the late James Gandolfini to do a mob movie, you are starting off with four stars without doing anything. Throw in Johnny Sack (Vince Curatola) and you've got good actors doing what they do best. Unfortunately, this well directed movie is brought down by other concerns.You have a very basic crime story at the core. A (made) card game gets hit by some punks, and this sets in motion the mafia moving as 'corporate' entity to set things back in order at the street level. The strong points of the movie spring from this plot: a great tense well done robbery scene; an equally good payback when some enforcers beat up the usual suspect; and stylish and well done first execution on a dark and rainy street. All of this is well directed and works well, as does the initial interplay between wiseguy Curatola, and Scott McNairy and Ben Mendelsohn, the two street punks that he needs to execute the plan.There are a number of factors that drag the film down. Most importantly, we are repeatedly beaten over the head with the metaphor that the Banking Crisis of 2007 is analogous with the Mafia stealing from itself and using heartless violence set in motion by unknown 'bosses' to clean up the system, so the system can continue. Plain and simply, this is a fail. The extent to which this meme was imbued into the film goes beyond blatant propaganda, and seems obsessive on the part of the Story tellers.Secondly, as good as the initial word-play and street banter between the three heist criminals is, this same technique fails miserably in the dialog between Brad Pitt and ...everyone else, but particularly in the pointless scenes with a burnt-out hit-man played by Gandolfini. This story arc goes nowhere, makes no point, and seems almost to be filler.Then there is the core problem with the film, Mr. Angelina Jolie. All though looking somewhat Haggard, one can't help but feel like they are watching the coolest frat-boy in human history pretending he is an uber gangster. Pitt just doesn't have the range or edge to do this part justice.So, what could have been a fine underbelly of the mob story, ala Atlantic City, leaves us with Brad Pitt giving a speech about Thomas Jefferson hypocrisy and the denial of the American Dream when all we really wanted to see was some wise guys getting whacked.Four Stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Three petty criminals rob a Mob gambling establishment. Confidence is lost and nobody returns to gambling. Jackie (Brad Pitt) is hired to take down the robbers. He takes on suspected robber Markie Trattman (Ray Liotta). He figures even if Markie isn't the robber, it's worthwhile as long as the gambling public is satisfied. Richard Jenkins plays Jackie's handler and James Gandolfini plays the boss.This takes place during the 2008 election and from the financial meltdown onwards. There is this running connection with the real world politics of the day. Filmmaker Andrew Dominik is constantly injecting news coverage of political speeches. This is both annoying and distracting. I understand the connections. He didn't need to hit us over the head with it. The only good part is that it leads to a fun little speech from Brad Pitt at the end. It's a puny reward for so much investment.I didn't find any of the original robbers that compelling. They end up being minor characters which puts into question why they are so prominent for so long in the movie. It makes the first section ultimately unimportant. And the interactions between Brad Pitt and Richard Jenkins and Gandolfini were unsatisfyingly talkative. The film lack the energy needed for those dialogs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Goes nowhere with great cast and bland storyline.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The characters who die in "Killing them Softly" are ironically or not, not killed softly at all. Writer-director Andrew Dominik shoots these scenes in the noisiest way possible; employing graphic visuals, super slow motion executions, and shots ringing out so realistically loud, as if you were next to someone with a gun going off at point blank range. Organized crime in America is troubled, just like the rest of the economy, with a business slowdown and a growing recession. The film seems to be trying-and failing-to draw parallels between events unfolding in the film's forefront, and the running background narrative of the 2008 financial meltdown and presidential election. Perhaps if the primary narrative were more coherently developed those parallels would be easier to understand.The plot of "Killing Them Softly" is bare, and straightforward. A genial criminal named Markie Trattman (Ray Liotta) operates a mob protected high-stakes poker game operation. One night three hooded stick-up men brazenly rob the place, and make off with a big bag of mob money, causing the local criminal economy to collapse. This in itself is suspicious--it looks like an inside job, because who is crazy enough to attempt this blatant act? As a result, a high-level mob boss named Mickey (James Gandolfini) arrives in town and orders the executions of the thieves by a hit man named Jackie (Brad Pitt)."Killing Them Softly" continues as a dismal, dreary series of cruel and painful murders by men who know one another in a barren city where it's usually night and almost always raining. There is one female character in the film, a hooker employed by Mickey, who is the only mobster not exclusively obsessed with crime or money. As the body count grows, we meet Driver (Richard Jenkins), a gravel-voiced chief executive who appears often in a car parked underneath bridges.Andrew Dominik is a fine director with great potential, but here are short changed with its abrupt ending with a film that really doesn't go anywhere. It brings its current proceedings to a close, yet opens another door and leaves it wide open. "Killing Them Softly" is a curiously dead movie and it never really gets off the ground. The film is strangely flat in spite of a generally excellent cast and a premise brimming with tough guy possibilities.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is it a 10? no but is it a 1? no. I guess i can kind of see the point of some people who enjoy the old style of arnie action films, they want gun fights and car chases from the first second of the film. if that describes you then this film wont be on your top 10 list i can assure you. from first glances i thought this film would have more action, and to be honest the first time i watched it i was waiting for the action to start, but after re-watching it and actually paying attention to the story line you find that it doesn't actually need all the gangster and hit-man violence. Don't get me wrong, there is some action and killing in this film, and the rare scenes with action are shot very well.overall this is a dark, gritty and real film. Watch this film and PAY ATTENTION and you will appreciate how well this film was made. if your looking for a mobster film then stay away, but if you enjoy good acting and a great script this film is one to put on your to do list.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Brilliant But Very Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I heard about it on the grapevine and the cast alone was enough to whet my appetite. I hadn't read or heard any reviews either but when I was told that a lot of people walked out of this movie, I knew I needed to see it. There should be a list of the ten best 'walked-out-of' pictures, I can only guess at what makes the grade: Salo; The Excorcist; The Devils; Women in Love; The Last Temptation of Christ; Ken Park? Readers may add if they wish.What's good about this film is the place and time. What's really happening on the screen is a document about the unseen underbelly of global finance and the flesh trade, it happens to be set in America 2008 but the story would work in Bangkok, Moscow or London. Big to medium size crooks employ small time &amp; desperado types to monster money out of card game profits or to kill those responsible for pissing on their territory. These themes are all explored in delectable detail on the smaller screen in shows like the Sopranos, The Wire &amp; Boardwalk Empire.But! Brad Pitt strutting his stuff in a Scorsesse-style-art-house picture with the colour turned down &amp; the sound turned up. WTF, the usual suspects howl, we are mad as hell etc. I guess this is the James Bond/Guy Ritchie audience crying all the way to the automatic teller machine and wishing they had rented some Kiss, Kiss, Bang, Bang thingo. What we get to see is NOT Tony Soprano ( although fans of the show will recognise many of it's players) but a bitter &amp; twisted hit-man called in by Brad's middle-management fixer to do the job. The problem is, he can't do two hits - too risky, as he's up on a gun charge. The rest is the negotiations, the 'proper' clean-up &amp; the shooting in the head of any loose ends. BUSINESS as usual- nothing new here, happens all the time.Ben Mendelsohn's junkie with a grand plan is an outstanding performance, I guess he's got USA street cred since "Animal Kingdom", expect to see more of him folks. His character is the only light touch, if you can call it that, the dog-napping scheme and subsequent troubles are hilarious. I could almost smell him, plus he got to live, the option 2 for so many people who have to eek out their existences in that fashion, jail is better than dead. The final scene between Richard Jenkins and Brad is inspired, it's just another day in America, and he wants to get paid! His career won't suffer one iota.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've done some research prior to watching Killing Them Softly and found out that the book it's based on had been made almost entirely out of dialog. Seeing the cast i thought the idea of translating such a literally template into a movie as a challenge for the authors. Unfortunately, this became it's biggest issue.The plot is good with outsider thugs meeting the heavyweights in the business and causing trouble that had to be resolved by those pulling the strings. Probably the best thing is drawing parallels between governments and gangsters which both work by the rules set (or broken) by corporations and banks.Despite being prepared i've been struck by the amount of text spilled across the screen. The characters talked as if there were no tomorrow. It's a pity since i don't have to know anything about a movie before i see it. Without knowing upfront the details about the book i would have liked it even less.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disguising a brilliant take on the American economy with a convoluted gangster plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set after the 2008 presidential election between John McCain's "Country first" and Barack Obama's "Change we can believe in" platforms, "Killing Them Softly" is about living the American dream, the downfall of the American economy, and the difference between a country and a business. But you would be forgiven if you didn't find that storyline very evident. Those are just ideas not plot lines.Knowing that the general public doesn't care much for history lessons or lectures, the filmmakers disguised their film as a crime drama. One where somewhat inept (but still alive) wannabe-gangsters infiltrate rival mobs, rob underground poker games, or kill fellow low-lifes because their boss asks them to, or they think it will impress their boss. I always get lost in gangster related crime dramas, but especially in this one since there wasn't really a coherent or meaningful plot. The plot is just a necessary device to get across their important concept of selfishness, greed and the economy.One of the low-scale gangsters supposed to do the dirty work, but is not yet indifferent to death, blood and begging, is Frankie (Scoot McNairy). He does realize that he's too far in over his head but doesn't really know how to get out. A much higher-up boss in the criminal world, Jackie (Brad Pitt), is supposed to fix the mess that Frankie and his fellow amateurs have created. He has gotten a little philosophical in his old age ? not helped by the fact that his former boss (James Gandolfini) has turned to alcohol and prostitutes in his old age.Although I could barely follow his story, McNairy made me care for his life-and-death situation. When Pitt approaches him in the bar, his fear, his knowledge of doing the right thing, and his desire to run are all on his face, and even worse for him is that all options likely lead to the same outcome.As I said the film is just a platform for presenting ideas and Pitt's character is in a current philosophical stance, so "Killing Them Softly" ends the movie the only way they could with Brad Pitt delivering one of the best monologues ever uttered on film. He compares Barack Obama to Thomas Jefferson, and the country of America to a money-first business. It's cynical and it's right.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Screenplay and story lacks in the film. When I saw a promo of Killing them softly.It reminded me some of great movies like GOODFELLAS &amp; DONNIE BRASCO. I expected the same twists ,more drama and great acting by the actors ,however Brad Pitt carries the entire movie on his shoulders but screenplay and story did not support him this time.Could have done better.Watch it for Brad Pitt but only if you are a fan of him.The movie starts well with a heist which was planned by three guys and here come Jackie Cogan (Pitt)to investigate.But this is it ? Yes ,because the movie had nothing to offer but Brad Pitt .Ray Liota was wasted in a brief role. I don't get this thing there is no one in a villainous role while protagonist is Jackie Cogan.It fails to create my suspension of disbelief. Also it has lesser drama and whole movie focused on dialogues which barely moved the story forward.Screenplay could have been better but its not.On the whole it has something to offer but writer failed to deliver what he wanted.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I couldn't help but notice hints of Jim Jarmusch, Terrence Malik and Quentin Tarantino throughout. Not sure if director/writer Andrew Dominik in fact tips his hat to any of these film makers, but it was interesting that any one of the mentioned directors could have been behind the camera for a number of scenes. Simple, effective story line without a crazy twist or surprise ending. 'Neo' in the sense that this film inventively captures contemporary organized crime. Similar comparisons can be made with HBO's groundbreaking series 'the Wire'. Superb cast &amp; performances. Ben Mendelsohn's (Animal Kingdom)performance was some of the best black comedy I've seen in awhile. Expect a strong group effort by Pitt &amp; co.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a highbrow crime flick ... please avoid it if it isn't your thing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Killing Them Softly is NOT a movie for everyone as it is heavy on dialogue, has political overtones and has some finely orchestrated scenes of nihilism and violence.Many will assume it is little-more than a shoot-em-up gangster flick; but that is hardly what it is at all. Brad Pitt's (Ocean's Eleven, Fight Club) Jackie is called in to "clean-up" after a poorly-conceived card game robbery (connected to the mob) conducted by three dimwits who thought they were going to strike-it-rich with the hit. Jackie talks a LOT with both Driver (Richard Jenkins - The Visitor, Burn After Reading) and Mickey (James Gandolfini - "The Sopranos", 8MM) about what to do with those involved including Markie (Ray Liotta - Goodfellas, John Q) and Frankie (Scoot McNairy - Argo, Monsters).Also in play -- audio and video clips of the 2008 presidential election which make for a nice commentary on present-day America. Pitt's final dialogue is fantastic and McNairy proves to be one to watch with this star-making supporting turn.Although nothing alike, if one did not like Drive he/she won't like this one either.This is rather a highbrow gangster flick -- it is slow and the dialogue drives the action; but that didn't keep me from enjoying it. I'm sorry if it does you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gritty crime movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved Andrew Dominik's "Assassination of Jesse James". In "Killing Them Softly" he is clearly aiming to make more than just a run of the mill movie about criminals in "Killing Them Softly".The basic storyline is about a small time crook in an unnamed and unpleasant looking US city who decides to rob a local poker game protected by the mob. He thinks he is very smart and that another local gangster will get the blame for this. He recruits two of the most hapless criminals you could find to do the job for him.The movie really gets going after the heist as a mob lawyer (Richard Jenkins) is put in charge of sorting out who did what and ensuring everyone gets what's coming to them. He turns to hit-man Jackie (Brad Pitt) who sets him straight on what the criminal underworld expects to happen in these situations. There are some great scenes where Jenkins and Pitt sit in a car discussing in a very matter of fact way whether someone should be killed or just badly beaten.Throughout the movie the soundtrack often plays US politicians including President Obama speaking about how they intend to bring the "true" America back to its former glories. Their rhetoric is in contrast to the matter of fact way in which we are seeing the criminal underworld sorting out its problems.There is a lengthy diversion when Jackie brings in a New York hit-man, Mickey (James Gandolfini) to do some "work" for him. Mickey turns out to be on the verge of a nervous breakdown and a lot more trouble than he is worth. Maybe this is meant to show us that even mobsters can go off the rails in the end.Jackie ends up getting his hands very dirty as he sorts everything out. At the end of the movie he says that, in contrast to what politicians say, the US is not a community of people "all in it together". He believes the true spirit of America is about looking after Number One.I enjoyed the movie a lot. The gritty urban settings added to the sense of dread as the gruesome action is played out. However I thought the director was pushing his "message" about the dark heart of America a bit too strongly at times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Killing Them With Dialogue</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know I liked this movie a lot. I found it to be a fascinating piece of work showcasing the life of Mob Enforcer Jackie Cogan and the various lowlifes he comes into contact with due to an unfortunate situation involving a Robbery of a mob protected card game.So why all the negativity? Why the "F" CinemaScore? I think I can answer in that in four words, "A Crapload of Dialogue" that is pretty much the foundation for all the complaints against this movie, that people talk to much, and I have to agree the film has a hell of a lot of talking, the movie is literally 85-90% talking, I happen to not mind that. I found the mass of dialog to be enlightening, like for instance at one point in the film a Hit-man is called in from out of town, in most movies he would do his job and leave, in this film we are drawn into almost a character study of the man as we learn about his struggles with alcoholism, how he's been in jail a few times, and how his Wife Threatens to divorce him frequently and next time he assures Jackie "I'm gonna sign the papers" will he? Who knows, the fact is the films telling us stuff about him and I find that rather refreshing, the characters are not Cardboard cutouts, they are real people, with lives, and problems just like us. The film is pretty much discussions with four rather brief sequences of violence thrown in for good measure, it reminds me a bit of Tarantino's "Jackie Brown" of which I'm a big fan.That being said "Killing Them Softly" is not without its flaws. For instance the opening sequences consists of dirty bags and trash blowing around in the wind as a character walks out of a dark hallway, sounds cool right? Except it keeps cutting back to "So and So Presents" and "In Association with bla bla" during this sequence, stopping the sequence each time it does so, this wouldn't be a big deal if it only happened a few times but I swear it must've happened like Ten Freaking times! For no reason! Then when it flashes the title it doesn't just say "Killing Them Softly" it does it one word at a time, stopping the sequence just like all the other credits, oh and did I mention the whole time this is happening a speech by Obama is being played? Because the film takes place in and around the 2008 election? The speech also cutting in and out? Its a bit disorienting to say the least. Also farther on in the film a character is speaking to another character who is stoned out of his mind, the stoned character continually drifts into sleep/trance and we see a funky light visual filter, its novel the first one or two times, but then it keeps happening.... over and over with the other character having to snap his friend out of it each time. It gets the viewer a little weary.Besides that I really enjoyed "Killing Them Softly" it proves Andrew Dominik is still quite a director I just hope maybe sometime, someday, he can direct a box office success! And perhaps he shall, but until then I imagine this film will wind up as a Cult Classic much like "The Assassination....." So with all that being said, if you can take a lot of dialog with not a whole lot of action I highly recommend this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The plot isn't the only important aspect of a film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was initially very excited for this movie when I saw the trailers online, hoping that it would be another ball-busting, knee shooting, throat slitting movie, especially because it had James Gandolfini, Vincent Curatola, and Ray Liotta (notorious mob movie/TV show actors), only to be grossly unimpressed by the plot. The main character isn't introduced until at least 20 minutes into the movie and it's a bit difficult to tell what's going on and the importance of Barack Obama in the background. There is little to no character development whatsoever, and the characters are shot as quickly as they're introduced....and that's what's so magnificent about this film.On face, the film is about Brad Pitt having to restore the balance of the criminal world, but he has a criticism about how people go about killing other people: they become emotional about it. He has a tactic he likes to call "killing them softly" which is basically shooting them from a distance, essentially becoming morally disengaged so that you feel no attachment and the deed is done quickly and cleanly (aside from the gushing blood and exploding heads); you don't become attached to the guy whose brains you're blowing out.What Dominik has done (and what most reviewers saying this film is terrible are missing out on) is that he brings in the "killing them softly" ideology into his filmmaking. Because there is no character development, you really have no reason to become emotionally attached to any of the characters, so when Brad Pitt has to, in the end, kill them all off, you feel nothing. You become emotionally detached from the characters because you had no way to become attached to them in the first place. The film itself ends very abruptly with a political message, but that's not important. I was put off by the abruptness of the ending only to later realize that that is STILL playing into the "killing them softly" motif. It ends so quickly and cleanly that you had no idea that it was about to end and you leave the theater with zero emotional attachment.Having seen a lot of film and analyzing it for undertones and the overall quality of the cinematography, I would highly recommend this movie for anyone that cares about film past the plot itself. Sure, the death scenes are phenomenal (10/10), but they're really only about 20% of the movie. Watch it for the quality of the film itself and not necessarily just for the plot.</fullReview>

The random cuts to President Bush and Obama were awkward. It's like they tried to fit two huge goals in one film. The first goal; create your basic crime drama. The second; a drama with a strong political commentary. For some reason it didn't mix well. Don't get me wrong, some of the scenes were quite intense, but for most of the film it was a snooze-fest. I genuinely like deep dialogue between characters, but in this film they went no where.They could've built up the characters a little more, too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too self-important for its own good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some minor bad guy played by Vincent Curatola decides to rob an entire underground casino operation. It's a good plan because this has happened before when the very mobster in charge of the operation decided to rip off his bosses and customers. He wasn't discovered, instead when he confessed while drunk no one believed him. So Vince knows everyone will suspect this mobster, played by Ray Liotta. He hires two goofballs to pull off the job. And it goes well. One of the mobsters wants to invest in drugs but also becomes a user.The bosses through some shady lawyer guy bring in Brad Pitt to clean things up. And Ray is the first one who will have to suffer the consequences, whether he was involved or not. Brad eventually finds one of the goofs while the other is caught by police for his drugs. For some reason an ex hit-man, played Gandolfini, shows up in town and chats with Brad. While we get inferences about what happens to him nothing is shown. Brad will have to get the goof to turn on Vince, and...Brad will have to get paid in full. That's more or less the story here.From the beginning of the movie much is made of politics. All this is happening right after financial crisis of 2008 and we get a lot speeches by W Bush and Obama. What the importance of all that is becomes a little clear only at the very end of the movie, an end that is rather underwhelming. In general, story-wise there's nothing special here except for the political/philosophical angle. Visually there's plenty of interest, in particular some neat camera perspectives. The violence is also very graphic. Performances are alright. The cast is almost too good for the movie, but they failed with two of the more important characters, namely the two goofs.This is the kind of movie that thinks too highly of itself. Somewhere someone thought all this is just so brilliant, but it just isn't. Much of the movie takes place in endless mostly pointless or superficial conversations. And the final line which represents the writer's revelation doesn't have anything to do with the movie.</fullReview>

These actually take up most of the movie so be ready to sit and listen to a bunch of dialogue.In between is three or four minutes of action\suspense.

		<fullReview>I was going to see this film in the theater but never got around to it, finally got the DVD from Netflix. The trailer, unfortunately, had better plot and character development than the movie itself. I don't mind a somewhat unfocused beginning, as sometimes the plot becomes clear and/or interesting later on, but in "Killing Them Softly", there was much attention to a seemingly minor subplot, which turned out to be the only plot.I generally like Brad Pitt, but he seemed to be exerting minimal acting effort. Nice to see James Galdolfini on screen, although it was sad to think about his recent death and wonder whether this piece of work was his last screen appearance. Tony Soprano deserved better. After spending an hour watching and waiting for things to become interesting, I finally had to shut this dog off and mail the disk back from whence it came.No need to warn about spoilers - can't spoil what you have not watched. Although I would think that its sleep-inducing potential might benefit some insomniacs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was expectantly thrilled to see another Brad Pitt movie that had him playing an edgy character once again, as I feel he is very interesting to watch in these roles. This movie did give Brad an edginess but the script and direction were not half as good as Brad can be. I found the entire movie to be very wordy and the dialogue did not move the story along fast enough to justify all the talk, talk, talk. The title refers to the distance that Jackie says he like to kill from as any closer he gets too involved. Or some such drivel. Then when he gets around to doing it, his second gun shot is from close up. What was all the talk about distance and Killing Them Softly about? I lost interest halfway through this and started to fall asleep.. Not a good sign. Any movie that puts me to sleep is not holding my attention.I would not recommend this picture other then as a cure for insomnia.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best movies have two qualities, they are interesting and they entertain. However if it only is interesting ("The Impossible", for example) or only entertaining ("Hotel Transylvania", for example) then they are worthwhile."Killing Them Softly" is neither interesting nor entertaining. It is about the crime subculture and how it operates like a business. Even if it happens to be a good friend of yours, if he deserves a severe beating that puts him in the hospital with broken ribs, a fractured jaw, and punctured lung, that's just business.The movie reminds us of that theme throughout, by including TV broadcasts from 2008 where either former President Bush is explaining something relative to the economy, or new President Obama is explaining how we are supposed to be all one community.I like Brad Pitt, I find his roles almost always interesting. He has an interesting one here as Jackie , and his "job" is to restore order in the criminal community after a couple of lightweight thieves rob a card game populated with mob members. But they include so much blood, gore, and violence, often up-close and in super slow motion, plus all the characters using as filthy language as the script writers could come up with, the overall movie is neither interesting nor entertaining.A Big Miss.</fullReview>

And after that when the little boss guy is trying to recruit them to knock over the card game, that was funny too.But, after about that first 10 minutes, everything just seems dragged out, completely inconsequential like the director and or writer just didn't have a clue what to do next. All right, now after the heist we spend the next 35 minutes or so listening to some boring, uninteresting conversation with Brad Pitt going on and on about what they should do. Next you have this drawn out, brutal, absolutely meaningless beating of Ray Liota which takes like 7 stupid minutes. Then, we have like another 6 meaningless minutes with the 2 stupid guys getting high. Then, guess what...? Yes, that's right, we then have to sit through yet ANOTHER 6 minutes of Brad Pit RE-explaining what they have to do.At this point, I look up and see that almost an hour has gone by. Have I been really engaged and entertained by the 'Oh so Clever' story...? No... Have I been riveted by Tarantino-esque clever dialog? HELL no... So, I try, I really try to think a moment about WHY the hell I'm watching this EMPTY, BORING (unless you really enjoy seeing Ray Liota beaten, bleeding, throwing up all over, bad guys laughing at him all the while... Uh huh...) and frigg'n POINTLESS film? So, I do something that is probably the wisest thing I've done all day, and I took the bloody disc out of the player and shaking my head and trying to throw off the distaste and pain of what I've been sitting through for the last hour, and I DIRECTLY come here to tell whomever may be interested that this is ONE time where I do not know WHAT the hell is going on with all these great reviews, but for anyone who truly WANTS to ENJOY watching a good, entertaining movie, if I can save them the absolute and total waste of time, then that is the least I can do...Look, I usually really LIKE heist / gangster films; they are usually great! But this stinking turd, at least in the first hour as far as I could tell, truly has no redeeming value what so ever. None, Zero, Nada, Zip, you get the idea. I normally do NOT go out of my way to review films that I don't like, but in a case like this where I have read all these reviews about how bloody MEANINGFUL this film is and how CLEVER the way they worked in the 2008 financial crisis and how this is such a frigg'n BRILLIANT metaphor played out in the gangster world about what is happening in the financial world, I HAVE to come her and HOPEFULLY save some poor schlep like me some agony and disappointment.I would have REALLY appreciated some reviewers stating MUCH more honestly what a piece this film is. I truly am at a total loss what the big deal is here; you have No depth, NO cleverness, NO true tension because NOTHING of value is happening. WHAT...? What the hell is it that could possibly interest anyone? Maybe later in the film it might actually turn into something genuinely riveting and gripping, but with a first hour like this that is SO egregiously CRIMINAL (and NOT in the right way) it renders the film completely inexcusable as a piece of entertainment at ANY level...I'm gonna go back now and see if I really checked out these reviews properly before I watched this, uh, film. There HAS to be some sensible and intelligent reviewers out there who MUST see this for what it is.I suppose that I must have missed them...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Please waste no time watching this awful movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had been looking forward to this release for some time. The cast alone made it a must watch for all those who love their mob films. While Ray Liotta has made some terrible films (Operation Dumbo Drop comes to mind), you can never forget his stellar performance in Goodfellas and that alone makes this worth watching, surely? Alongside this you have James Gandolfini who rocked in the Sopranos and Brad Pitt to name a few....and that's where the positivity ends. James Gandolfini plays a hit-man called Mickey whose role in the film is to get drunk screw hookers and do ABSOLUTELY nothing to the plot. His inclusion is utterly pointless!!! Ray Liotta has a key role and plays it so weakly it is untrue. His acting is pedestrian at best and his death comes as pure release of relief to the watching public rather than the shock and awe it was supposed to portray. Then you have Brad Pitt who as the main protagonist should be the pivotal Saviour of the film who suddenly cannot act. He is terrible. I rate his performance on Friends better...and if you have seen that he was truly, truly terrible. This film had the likelihood of being so good, and lets the audience down in every way. Twinned with the fact that the whole film carries a poorly executed political undertone through the TVs and radios all the way through with no possible explanation or reason. By far the worst film I have seen for many years. Waste no time by renting this and if you own a copy the only possible use for the disc is hanging up on string over your balcony to scare off magpies which is where my copy is currently residing...and in that job it is doing remarkably well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As soon as the movie starts with the viewer is subjected to various political gibberish, describing the housing crisis in the Bush years, then onto our current president's platitudes. Such is the 'vechile' by which the movie moves.This was a fatal mistake.Much in the way the music score shaped 'Goodfellas'.... from RatPack Crooner songs of the old, to 70's Stones songs describing the infliltration of drugs- KTS uses presidential newsreel instead.KTS tries(?) to convey the attitudes and atmostphere by presidential speeches dealing with recent debacles.. As if this has something to do with the way people are thinking in the underworld. This is ridiculous logic and it just doesn't work.The cinematography is impressive in many respects... the different angles and shots of slums of urban areas (no city is really identified, afaik.. just the northeast)worked. Also numerous murder scenes were realistic, effective, and disturbing.Gandolfini's character shows promise but takes up 30 minutes of the film. Useless except showing how Jackie is capable of tying up loose ends, but honestly, it's time wasted.Jackies last lines sound cliché and silly. If Jesus H Christ could be president and the country was doing so well that every American could have two cars in the garage and steaks in the fridge...these guys would still be doing what they do, so spare the tirade and excuse to make a political statement out of a B grade plot that deals primarily with losers sharing their insecurities just before they are killed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Obama + Bush clips</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to laugh at all the reviewers who just cannot seem to grasp the simple significance of the inclusion of all the financial crisis clips in this movie. I laughed my ass off every time they came on - the whole corporate thing - it isn't a metaphor it's a comment on America - if you're just too dumb to get it - I will spell it out for you : 1) this entire country is CORRUPT from the very very bottom - where this movie take place - to the very very top, represented by the patron saint of the Left Obama and the patron saint of the Right, Bush.2) all the corporate little metaphors, jokes and digs - the ENTIRE point of including all that is that the mob life isn't just like corporate America, IT IS corporate America.This movie is not for those who can't think, who can't see metaphor, allegory and who want some kind of fantasy escape from what real mob/criminal life is like, what killing someone is really like. This didn't have all the fakeness, it just had reality and that is very very hard for people to take.And Pitt was great, his face as a grown man, his character in the movie, the points he bring across with his actions in the movie, great stuff.And the last 60 seconds, to tie it all together like that. Awesome.It's real it's gritty, it's a mirror we hold up to who we are as Americans at this point in history, it scares the crap out of people if you look that deep and THAT is why so many did not get or like this movie - they want to keep living in fantasy land - they want ketchup blood and phony clichés and scripted violence and this movie has none of that.Nice stuff for anyone who can think.</fullReview>

I cannot believe that this is an extension of other movies from the past of the actors as being said by others. This stands out to me in a few ways. Firstly, the significance of the horizontal political statements being thrown and embellished throughout the movie ( I mean even during the robbery there is Bush, making his famous (Bullshit) speech ) make an interesting atmosphere for the duration. So this movie introduces characters in a most intriguing way. This movie stands out to me because it leverages characters and ambitions against the dark backdrop of the present American political scenery.Enjoy!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a film for dummies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I start this review of with a less than eloquent title as Im prompted to write something favorable after reading some of the negative user reviews regarding this film. Everyone is entitled to their opinions of course, though I think a sub category should be made, next to the MA and R ratings, NFD - Not For Dummies. By this I mean not for people whose main exposure to film is likely what they've seen on commercial media channels and the numerous poor sitcoms and crime dramas. NFD could also be an expectations warning - this is not a Coen brothers or Tarrantino romp, view it with out prejudice, though I understand this may be difficult for some, especially when most media these days is hyper pastiche candy. Killing them softly is not a pretty film, its bleak and its ugly and most likely closer to the truth of the state of affairs in the good ol' US then what CSI or some such inane show would lead you to believe. It is also darkly humorous with some subtle (or not so subtle) social commentary and features a killer ending with an insight into the mindset of a gangster. The film is distasteful (on purpose) with many art-house touches, but for anyone that enjoyed films (good films!) like Blue Valentine or Drive, or even the Pusher Trilogy (oh Nicholas Winding Refn!) you should find something good in this film. For those that either have not heard of aforementioned titles the choice is yours - steer clear and at least have the humility to acknowledge that some things you may never understand (cue the scene of Flea in Fear and Loathing licking substances of a stranger in a bathroom).</fullReview>

This Movie keeps you interested through out the entire movie, its slow paste but it never gets boring because there are funny comments and lines that the actors "Bradd Ptt", "Scoot McNairy" and "Ben Mendelsohn" act out beautifully.This is personally one of my favorite movies. Here is why:When i came out of the theater i couldn't stop thinking about the movie and its concept. I though about how the life as "Markie Trattman" (Played by Ray Liotta) would be, and how anybody grows up to become such a cold and cynical man as "Jackie" (Played by Brad Pitt).When a movie gets you thinking and makes you wanna go and spend money on another ticket just too see the actors act out their roles and see the marvelous scenes then the movie deserves 10/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Killing audiences softly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>¨This guy wants to tell me we're living in a community? Don't make me laugh. I'm living in America, and in America you're on your own. America's not a country. It's just a business.¨Killing Them Softly is Andrew Dominik's latest film which was nominated for the Palme d'Or in last year's Cannes film festival. I really had high expectations for this film, but was disappointed with this noir action film. The entire film was a political allegory, but I really didn't enjoy it all, and felt the political messages were a little too heavy and tiring. The highlight of Killing Them Softly was Brad Pitt's performance, but in the first half of the film he gets very little screen time. This is the second time that Pitt works with Dominik after having worked with him in the critically acclaimed The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford. That film was more beautifully shot in my opinion, but of course this being a sort of noir film the cinematography was much dirtier. It was shot using Kodak's 500T 5230 film stock which gave the film a much darker and grayish tone to help set the mood of the story. Killing Them Softly was loosely based on George V. Higgins novel, Cogan's Trade, and adapted for the screen by Dominik himself. The film has a lot of dialogues going on and little action, which isn't exactly a problem for me considering I enjoy Tarantino films, but the dialogues in this movie were just not that entertaining, and the characters weren't really memorable. Dominik was forcefully giving the film a political message and it was just too heavy handed for my taste, but I know many people enjoyed it so I can't say Dominik failed. I'm simply not into political movies so I didn't appreciate this very much. If you enjoy politics then you might appreciate the political allegory behind this action thriller, which in my opinion didn't add anything new to the genre. It was very predictable.Johnny Amato (Vincent Curatola) hires two amateur criminals, Frankie (Scoot McNairy) and Russell (Ben Mendelsohn) to perform a heist at a Mob poker ring operating in New Orleans. Markie (Ray Liotta) is the proprietor of the place, and when the two amateurs rob him, the mafia blames Markie for the heist since he has had a similar history in the past and the local criminal economy has collapsed. The mafia's messenger is played by Richard Jenkins who we only know as the driver. He hires a hit-man named Jackie Cogan (Brad Pitt) to kill everyone responsible for the heist in order for balance to be restored amongst the mob world. While all these situations are taking place we have several voiceovers playing in the background (television or radio ads) with political messages from Bush and Obama, in order to make sure the viewer understands the political allegory that is taking place here. The plot is pretty simple and not much happens between each dialogue that is taking place. James Gandolfini also has a funny role in this film as an alcoholic hit-man. The true star of the film is Brad Pitt who delivers each line in a very cool way without overdoing himself or going overboard with his character. He seems like a man who is in control. In one of his speeches he mentions how he doesn't like it when his victims get all touchy and feely about being killed so he prefers killing them softly from a distance, thus the title for the film. That line and the last one he shares with the driver are perhaps the best scenes in this movie. I also have to say that Scoot McNairy gave a pretty good performance in the supporting role. He really seems like the main character of the film during the first half and he gives a solid performance. I really wasn't familiar with his work although I do realize he was in Argo, but had very little screen time there. Overall I really was disappointed with this film and felt it didn't present anything new to the neo-noir genre. There were few action scenes, but I really didn't care much for the characters so I wasn't immersed into this world that Dominik was trying to suck us into. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

The no nonsense realism of the story (realism as in: no hero/good guy to root for), combined with some nice bullet-time and great conversations and acting is a must see. I can relate somewhat to other reviews that bash this movie, the story is not a complicated mind twister of 'who done it', but in my opinion it is not always necessary to have an unknown outcome for a movie to be enjoyable. Is there a deeper message in it? I guess that as an European my view on America has shifted the last years and the last remark in this movie gives a good summary: "?it's not a country, it's a business?"</fullReview>

I expected a gangster movie with Brad Pitt as a bad-ass and a great supporting cast. What I got was boring dialogs with meaning for, maybe, the Americans. What was so interesting about Gandolfini going on and on about how he used to screw someone back in Florida in the hotel room? What relevance did it have to the movie? It took forever with shitty details included.I have watched Pulp Fiction after (because I just wanted to shake of the bad taste) and that's a movie with long dialogs that keep your attention, that make you not want to miss a word.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why did this bomb so bad? Ohhh because its a rotten awful movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a big Hollywood star (like Brad Pitt) makes a movie that completely tanks (like Killing Them Softly did) the inevitable excuses begin. It was released at a bad time, the marketing was poorly done, audiences aren't into violent crime thrillers right now...but its rarely noticed when the movie is just simply awful. I actually thought that the bad marketing and timing thing might be true because Pitt truly doesn't usually make a bad movie. The film is a violent, gratuitous, boring, long, poorly written slop of a mess that half the time I had to remind myself it was still playing on my TV I was so bored and cared so little. The writing was just atrocious, I mean the concept seems like it could have worked in the hands of the proper writers but the dialogue is incredibly stupid and vapid and pointless. Conversations go on and on that have nothing to do with the plot just to drag things out and look pretentious and "quirky." The film tries to channel the Guy Ritchie films of yesteryear while mixing together Goodfellas and other gritty mob dramas but it fails on all fronts. It felt more like a stage play and an incredibly boring one at that.Brad Pitt is still pretty good in the movie. I mean the script is so disgustingly awful that he only has so much to work with. But I don't blame the issues of the film on his shoulders. He is decent in the role and appropriately evil. Scoot McNairy is also pretty good in his role as Frankie. The scenes with him and Pitt are some of the more redeemable in the movie. Unfortunately most of his scenes are with Ben Medelsohn who is supposed to be manic and over the top and he is that but unfortunately it doesn't work. It comes across as annoying and over-acted. James Gandolfini gives what just might be one of the worst performances in a film I have ever seen. Every time he is on screen it is excruciating. His dialogue is horrendous and the two scenes with him and Pitt "bantering" was simply awful awful!! Richard Jenkins and Ray Liotta are decent in their small cameo roles but nothing stand out as their characters are mostly means to an end. The only positive note to Liotta's character is his stylistic death scene.Amateur director (I say amateur because he has very few credits to his name) Andrew Dominik wrote and directed the movie. This is more often than not a bad idea. A writer's vision might not translate well onto screen or a director's vision might not make a good script and yet here we are. I can't ever describe just how bad the dialogue is. Brad Pitt's speech at the end feels like a mid-point speech but instead ends the movie in some bizarre, ridiculous way. There are only two things that make this even remotely redeemable and that is the half decent performances of Pitt and McNairy and the death scenes. There are only a few death scenes but they are done in a gritty, disgusting, violent, sickening way and its too bad the whole film didn't have that tone because it might have actually worked. This is a dud from every angle. Steer clear and find something else in the genre. 2/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well acted and shot but also slow, boring and insubstancial</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The more I think about Killing them softly, the more infuriating it gets. If a movie is driven by dialogue, it has to be well written and fast enough. If so, the movie is usually at least interesting, like most of Quentin Tarantino's films (though even he hasn't always succeeded), but if the dialogue is slow and toneless, the film always collapses to dullness. I don't know has the director Andrew Dominik tried to pursue Tarantino's style, but if he has, then he has failed awfully. There's only a few scenes where the dialogue is fluent, like the scenes between Brad Pitt and Richard Jenkins. At it's worst it's in the scenes between Pitt and James Gandolfini, where Gandolfini's explanations about the difficulties of criminal life and his wife are bland and aimless, not to mention that his character is completely irrelevant.The acting is beyond great. Pitt delivers a charismatic performance, and Jenkins, Gandolfini and Ray Liotta are all good despite the lack of character depth. The show is still stolen by the rising stars Scoot McNairy and Ben Mendelsohn, who play these loser crooks effortlessly and impressively. Despite the steadily strong performances, Pitt's and McNairy's characters are the only ones you care about even a little bit.The film's political message is the biggest question mark. It feels like the point of the whole movie is forced roughly to the viewer, but I still left the theater wondering what the hell this was all about. All I could understand is that America is in an economic crisis, affecting in the criminal underworld too, and it doesn't seem to change, whilst the big policy-makers promise all kinds of stuff.The worst thing about the movie is that while Dominik clearly tries to make the viewer to think and draw parallels, the script he has written (based on the novel "Cogan's trade" by George V. Higgins) is just clumsy. If you make a movie with some kind of political message, so be it, but to make the viewer understand and think about it, you need to have a good story and not just some series of scenes involving boasters talking trash in cars and saloons, in between some slow and gory violence and then some more boasters talking trash. In the end it feels the movie doesn't have a story at all, just a preposterous collection of slow conversations.The first movie directed by Dominik that I saw was The Assassination of Jesse James by the coward Robert Ford (terrible, terrible, TERRIBLE name!!!!) and I despised it for its slowness, lack of climax and pretentious bombast, but it was well acted, very beautifully shot and the scenery was gorgeous. Killing them softly has almost all the same strengths and weaknesses even though it's a completely different kind of movie. Once again, beautiful cinematography, scenery and acting, but the slow and weak script overwhelms these like a tsunami.Killing them softly is not an instant nor upcoming crime-classic, and I didn't expect it would be. Whatever my expectations were, this movie failed them. It's a film you won't really remember much of either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Exactly is Your Point!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I gave this movie a 4 and I sincerely believe that I am being overly generous at that. When I saw this title I thought wow, James Gandolfini (Tony Soprano)and Ray Liota (Henry Hill) as mobsters, in a movie starring Brad Pitt, I thought how could this movie not be great. Well let me tell you it found a way. First there is zero, character development, you can pretty much deduce that Brad Pitt is hit man that is called in to find and kill whoever robbed a mobbed up card game. We don't know anything else about him, then enter James Gandolfini, who is also a hit man but has now become a drunk and seriously addicted to prostitutes. His character made absolutely NO contribution to the plot (if you can call it that) of this movie. It wasn't his fault mind you, the script was bad, very bad, and no actor either living or dead could have saved this thing. The biggest problem with this movie(and there are more than a few) is I didn't care about any of the characters, I was actually happy when some of them were killed so that I was spared listening to anymore of their wooden dialog. I mean Tony Saprano was a very bad guy, but I was invested in him, I cared what happened to him, Henry Hill was a very bad murderous guy but I cared about what he did. The director made some very peculiar choices for the score to this movie, I don't mind different types of music for shootouts rather than the tension building type common in most action movies, but this movie was completely detached from the scenes with someone getting there head blown off, and yes it is gory.I do not recommend this movie for anyone. I kept waiting for the "real" plot line to show up and 10 minutes from the end of the movie I realized that this was all I was going to get, it was very disappointing made even worse by the wasted talent of some of my favorite actors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great but I Think You're Reading Too Much Into It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this movie, it wasn't this violent bullet-fest, it was just an interesting movie. The story was weak, and it was mostly about the characters which I enjoyed. I liked all the characters, they all had their motives and they all acted accordingly to who they were. I did find Gandolfini's character a little annoying at times but he wasn't in it for very much. I think many people heard the title Killing Them Softly and saw Brad Pitt on the cover aiming a gun and expected a gory bullet ridden mess, but what they actually got was just a simple character driven movie. The violence is intense yet brief, the characters I find compelling. Pitt's performance as a cold detached mob enforcer was excellent (but off course you wouldn't expect less), and Jenkins was superb as the shady mob lawyer. I did not really pay attention to the whole socio-economic metaphors and representations in the movie, and I took the movie as more or less a literal movie with no ulterior motives and I loved the heck out of it. I think most of the metaphors people interpreted into the movie were utter BS, but that's just me. I didn't come away from this thinking I had watched a social commentary or art or high brow intellectual film; I came away thinking this is a great sort of nihilistic movie that I'd watch again, I took it as entertainment no more no less. I'd say if there was any social commentary it's all displayed in Pitt's speech at the end, but other than that I think you're reading too much into it (BUT THAT'S MY OPINION I COULD BE COMPLETELY WRONG). Then ending was anti-climactic, but I felt that it was anti-climactic on purpose and it actually fit with the whole feel and theme of the movie. I'd recommend this to anyone, and I'm proud to say I watched this and it's one of my favorite movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't even have to read the negative reviews (but I did) to know what they're going to say - too much talk, not enough action, undeveloped characters, no story, too confusing and on and on. It's almost precisely why I found the picture so fascinating. Set against the backdrop of the 2008 financial meltdown and the presidential election cycle, the mob business is undergoing it's own downturn, made worse when a free lance criminal (Vincent Curatola as Johnny Amato) hires on a couple of hit men to duplicate a staged robbery that Markie Trattman (Ray Liotta) successfully pulled against himself to set up the story. The picture takes it's own sweet time to develop the characters of Frankie (Scoot MacNairy) and zoned out partner Russell (Ben Mendelsohn) in a buildup to the actual heist, putting the mob on defense in a protracted cat and mouse game over who's going to pay for this latest indiscretion.I read a couple reviewers who were of the belief that Brad Pitt was making a political statement here as a noted Hollywood liberal and supporter of the President. Let's keep something in mind, Pitt's an actor and he didn't come up with the script. In fact, Pitt probably had to choke down his dialog in the final scene when he confronted the mob lawyer (Richard Jenkins credited as Driver in the story) after checking his payoff - "I'm living in America and in America you're on your own". Meaning that he expected full payment for services provided after intermediary New York Mickey (James Gandolfini) crapped out on his end of the deal. The message was a decidedly capitalist one, and if the picture had gone on, I'm pretty sure Jackie Cogan (Pitt) would have been made whole one way or another.In my estimation, the film's best sequence occurred when Jackie performed the hit on Liotta's Markie character. Done in extreme slow motion and highly stylized, the scene is destined to be a classic of mob movie inspired violence. One might even say there was a distinct poetry to rubbing out Markie Trattman. Jackie's other victims weren't done quite as creatively, let's just say he was efficient at his job. Come to think of it now as I write this, there wasn't too much 'softly' about it either.Anyway, going in one should temper expectations against one's preferences in movie styles. Characters and dialog are my thing and this one delivered along with the expected violence. I'd put it up there with some of the year's best output.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>KILLING THEM SOFTLY is one of those movies that feels like the director is trying to channel Scorsese. Kinda like HARD EIGHT, or WE OWN THE NIGHT, etc. It's very derivative. Scorsese setting, Tarantino dialog, Ted Demme doing BLOW musical sensibility, there ya have it.In the 90's, small time crime movies like this were a dime a dozen and most didn't get theatrical releases. This one wouldn't have either, were it not for the great cast.It's Andrew Dominik's third film, but it has the feel of a first film, kind of a lack of self awareness. Dominik is just trying too hard, from the very beginning. He tries some experimental film effects, like during the painfully irritating opening credits, and during a heroin sequence, that are mostly just distracting and annoying.A lot of the time they are throwing songs in your face in that annoying way that some film makers do. Hmm... what song should we use for a heroin sequence? How about the Velvet Underground's "Heroin"? NO ONE has done that before!!! And then, why not make the audience listen to that Godawful "Paper Moon" from the 30's!!!! YES the whole thing, are you kidding? They'll love it! When? What do you mean "when"??? During a shoot out, DUH!!! Even the idea of using Kelly Lester's awesome song "Love Letters" during a shoot out was done before in Blue Velvet. The main character is not actually Brad Pitt, it's Scoot McNairy, hipster icon. The guy every underachieving narcissist longs to be and every 23 year old coffee shop girl wearing glasses she doesn't need wants to smoke weed with. He annoyed me to no end in MONSTERS and he's just as bad here. However, he is playing a lowlife scumbag and he does pretty much nail it.But other than Scoot, the cast is great across the board, and they save this movie from the director, with his apparent love of Scoot McNairy and heroin and annoying songs and ideas like constantly having Bush and Obama speeches coming out of radios and TV's. Brad Pitt is just fun to have around. The only movie of his he couldn't save was that stupid movie "The Mexican". Gandolfini comes in to give the film some indie color, and method acts a broken down, bitter old alcoholic to perfection. Ray Liotta has a great scene where he keeps his composure during a hold up and tries to keep things from going over the deep end, but that's it, after that his only major scene is getting the living crap beaten out of him underneath a Rain Machine Supersoaker 3000.It's a good, solid, straightforward story. Very interesting and entertaining to watch when you're not being distracted by unwelcome elements like the freaky credits or the bush speeches or the incongruous songs.You'll hear a lot about the ending. The only real problem with it is that it isn't much of an ending; everything just stops and the credits roll, like the Sopranos series finale. It's like Dominik doesn't know how to bring things to a close. I'm sure that they cover that in film school, you can't just stop things and roll credits. There are a hundred ways to end a film. Have the main character drive away. Have people leave a scene to some music. Do a montage of the settings in the film to some music. Do something. Don't just roll credits all of a sudden. I've heard that this movie was supposed to be longer. I'm very glad it wasn't. The relatively brisk pace and short running time are definitely to the film's benefit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some great actors in something awful.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Without Brad Pitt, Ray Liotta, Ben Mendelssohn, James Gandolfini, and Richard Jenkins there would be absolutely no reason to watch this clicheed piece of mediocrity.Pitt spends almost all his scenes seated in a car or a hotel room, as if he was available for two days filming. His films are usually so watchable, one gets the feeling that he must have lost a bet to end up in this thing. Even Gandolfini is disappointing. His character doesn't give him much to do other than be repellent.The graphic violence is perhaps the movie's one redeeming feature, oddly enough, because it's the one element of this film that is done slightly differently than most of the films this is attempting to be. Paralleling events in plot to events unfolding in American political news maybe seemed like a clever plot device when talked about in production meetings, but the whole thing just feels like an undergraduate film student trying to be clever, but failing.There is nothing inspiring or appealing about any of the characters in this film. There is no complexity. There is no clever narrative. There is no genius dark humour. Killing Them Softly is so disposable it doesn't even register as pop culture. It isn't even a badly made film that threatens future greatness from an unlucky director. It's a waste of massive starpower, a string of very ordinarily done cliché, and well worth missing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just plain awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I actually created an IMDb account just to review this movie, it was so awful and pointless. If you've never seen Brad Pitt in a bad movie, well this is the one. The film is peppered with pointless dialogue that leads nowhere and you are left asking the question what was that all about ?. Ray Liotta's character held up the movie up to a point but even that couldn't save this picture from the confusing screenplay and directing. Its as if this movie was directed by a committee. Pointless political dialogues in the background with Bush and Obama that have absolutely no bearing to the storyline whatsoever and quite frankly irritating - not only is it pointless, its overused throughout the film. Im not really sure why this movie was made in the first place. Its like some art house project that didn't work out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Eeeeeugh, the close up shots of fake blood are enough to turn your head, the attenuated sounds will just make you squirm - unless, of course, this is the stuff you want in your thrillers. I wasn't convinced by all the actors in this Brad Pitt vehicle. Vincent Curatola was oddly wooden in his Squirrel/Johnny role. James Gandolfini however was truly convincing as the hired gun who's too far gone to perform any more. Now, as to Brad....erm, well, he's alright, putting in a workmanlike performance. I suspect its the political message he's trying to make that was more important to him. However, a cynical one liner, delivered right at the end, doesn't quite make this any more than the average thriller/petty crime story. There are too many continuity mistakes - and obvious too, that it really should be sent back for editing. You'll need to do better next time guys.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Technically accomplished. Drains you though!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a technically accomplished film. The camera is superb. Everyone's acting is well accomplished. The acting has a "pantomime style" touch to it. I think this is on purpose. I think the director likes to give a surreal, not believable type, character roles and dialogues. Pitt performs with consummate ease. The best developed character is Brad Pitt who plays a sociopath who believes in abject capitalism at the cost of community and cohesiveness. The capitalist wants "order" at the cost of togetherness, kindness and softness. At least this is what I gather the movie was trying to say. Knowing that Pitt and Jolie are strong Democrat and Obama supporters. The second best character is the middleman played by Richard Jenkins. He makes us aware that if you worship capitalism then you don't question the ones already high up the pyramidal food chain. There are more powerful forces even hit men don't dare question. The third best character is the one by Ray Liotta. Seasoned mobster who is blasé. The fourth best developed character is an ageing hit-man called Mickey. But there is a problem. The film relies too much on cinematography, style, and tricks to keep you watching, than the story itself. The story is never the focus. Rather the caricature of artists performing this parody pantomime is the focus. But it is refreshing to a small degree, not enough to make you feel that you watched a great movie. Maybe it is because the movie works if what the film wanted to achieve was to make me very cynical, and bored, and disparaged.My opinion is that it fails despite its cleverness. But it is worth watching if you don't mind casual viewing. Perhaps when you can have a friend over and distract yourself away from "interesting-boring" bits, such as a slow motion bullet!! I don't know what they were thinking. **************What happens to companies that pay their employees too much? They create wealthy citizens who spend that money into the economy but the company that employs them goes bust because it is less profitable than a company that does not pay its employees well!! So the wealthy employees become poor because now they don't have a job, or work for less for the more profitable company. But this "profitable" company will find it harder as years go by to sell their goods because the society is filled with people with poor income because they don't pay their employees well. So this company goes bust as well. Mobs are pure capitalist structures. I like democratic capitalism as long as as it is based on relationships, kindness and societal cohesiveness and not just business.****************maybe I read too much into what the film makers were trying to say. Thanks for reading.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wretched waste of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am only even giving this movie a 4 because of James Gandolfini. Even tho his character was a loathsome drinking, whoring, immoral hit man - he didn't write the lines and he portrayed his character very well. The story was banal, and worthy only of a 10 minute story line, which they somehow managed to stretch to 90 minutes of a terrible waste of time. The dialogue was poor, cinematographic mediocre and plot virtually non-existent. The producers did not even see fit to bother with a musical score, but underlined the scenes of the movie periodically with un-related speeches by Obama (related to the financial crisis of 2008 - 2009) which had no relevance to the story at hand.I only watched this in the first place because Brad Pitt &amp; James Gandolfini were headline actors - terrible disappointment. I can only think they are working for a paycheck in this movie.If by chance you read this review before seeing the movie - please SAVE YOURSELF THE TIME - not worth it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is possibly the most boring, slow paced, terrible film I've ever wasted my time on. From the boring pointless conversations between characters and the lack of action for a crime film, the writer/director should be ashamed to even think about putting this out as a film. I'm glad I didn't waste my money going to see this at the cinema otherwise I would of walked out and demanded my money back. There was one good thing about this film though, the part where it ended. The actors were obviously just in it for the pay cheque because they didn't put any effort into their performance at all. They could of got some unknown actors to fill in for them and they would of probably put on a better, more believable, less-boring bit of acting for the audience.</fullReview>

It's like Brad Pitt and his Hollywood cronies have to be political although they are too stupid to know what's going on. Endless movie, political seeming, but no real point. The dialog in this movie consists of a few words interspersed with profanity, the only two characters I could identify were Pitt's (because he's Brad Pitt!) and Liotta's only because they said "Marky" a million times. Extremely violent for violence sake while lacking story or point.Save a buck or two and avoid this stinker.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen and I am huge Brad Pitt fan. This movie has no purpose, no real plot or climax. The best thing that came out of it is its clear image of how much the director, the writer and the actor hate Obama and what he stands for. The message could not be any clearer. I get it but what you don't get, dear writer, is what Obama REALLY stands for.I could find more than one scene to criticize but I will only stick to one. I have never seen the most passive robbery in a movie before. Two guys come in, yell at Liotta and leave with two suitcases full of money while 30guys deep-stare into their eyes while sitting at the table and barely moving. What is that!! Come on!!! Where's the action, where is the chase, where's the thrill. I did not feel it at all. To me this story was so lame that it made me wanna throw something at the screen and start booing.As for Brad Pitt, did he tried to look Italian? or Irish perhaps? He shaved the side of his head, to fit the general stereotype of what most mobsters look like but all it made me think of is Sean Penn in "I Am Sam" with that goofy haircut. At least, ask the makeup girl to cover the shaved area on the side of your head.In conclusion, Brad, stick to action/comedy and don't try to make your movies look like a cheap version of Quentin Tarantino's thrillers. I think we all get it, you love guns</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A refreshing dialogue-based gangster classic in an age of teen vamp flicks.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am so utterly shocked &amp; appalled at the reviews this film has garnered thus far. Are people really so shallow and lacking in intellectual capacity &amp; attention-span in this day &amp; age that they cannot sit through an all-too-short 97 minutes of film primarily focused on dialogue as opposed snazzy action or slap-stick comedy? It makes me want to wipe out humanity and start again...Anywho, after Dominik's first effort - 'The Assassination of Jesse James by The Coward Robert Ford' - possibly the finest movie-going experience of the decade; a masterpiece of character study, of fine cinematography, with the most beautiful soundtrack I can bring to mind, and fabulous acting with a perfect cast, a film that was unfortunately only released in a few cinemas across America after being screwed over by the studios/industry for Dominik's uncompromising approach to film-making, I went into the theater not knowing what to expect. How would he deal with a traditional and more commercially viable gangster flick after one of the most aesthetically beautifully &amp; totally absorbing epic westerns I have ever seen? The answer? With mastery and finesse.Killing Them Softly is a modern examination of the effects of an economic downturn on society, and more specifically the criminal underworld. A sociopolitical commentary as opposed to the typical glorified roller-coaster, on the subject of struggle in the seedy underbelly of the city. Continuous but well-placed and almost comical news snippets cover the TV &amp; radio wherever present, of campaign speeches promising change, promising improvement during the 2008 presidential elections. The impact is felt everywhere, in Gandolfini's tired, alcoholic, washed-up, once-great hit-man, or in Pitt's position of control navigating his way through budget issues in acquiring the right tools for the job, or in Scoot McNairy and Ben Mendelsohn's portrayals of naive thuggish criminals desperate for any scrap of cash. But even if you take offense to the slight criticism of capitalism's shortcomings, or to the "excessive violence", the brilliant dialogue and dark comedy is guaranteed to stimulate any thinker, although for some strange reason it seems to be where most people have found fault with the film - not enough action for a gangster film, too much dialogue. One remembers fondly when this was what films like 'The Godfather' were praised for.Dialogue.Not only did this movie have all the right camera angles, wonderful acting, the right message, and some brutal violence, but it had dialogue! Dialogue! Oh how i miss you so! Every word so well-crafted! No longer do I feel as if I am a nervous pre-teen sitting through an American Pie movie for fear I cannot handle big words! This movie was fantastic. The reviews thus far are little more than a shining example of dead-eyed morons dominating the entertainment industry by throwing their money at films that I wouldn't even sit through the trailers for, let alone the whole film. That dumb, dopey, easy-led demographic of half-retarded weekend alcoholics who can't deal with depth and challenging film-making, have no appreciation for cinematography, and can't pay attention to anything lacking in superheros/vampires/werewolves.Movie of the year. My only complaint being that I'd prefer to see the original 2 &amp; 1/2 hour cut as opposed to this shortened-down-for-the-plain-shallow-masses cut.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Right up there with the darkest of US cinema.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Andrew Dominick's masterpiece was The Assassination of Jessie James by The Coward Robert Ford. (his second movie after Chopper). It's a movie of near perfection and, like Killing Them Softly stars Brad Pitt.This is a more ensemble movie not in any way dominated by Pitt (great as his performance is). Ray Liotta, James Gandolfini and Vincent Curatola (Sorpranos), Scoot McNairy (Monsters), Ben Mendelsohn, Richard Jenkins (the Father in Let Me in) all play pitch perfectly.There's only one female part in the entire movie; a cameo spot for an angry black hooker that is lucky not to join the list of victims that this very funny black "nuevo noir" delivers.At the end of the first reel one of the stars takes such a beating in the pelting New Orleans rain that you actually physically flinch with every blow (if you can bear to watch). It's visceral and it's as real a beating as I've ever seen on screen (better even than the great monochrome De Niro beatings of Raging Bull - this is the real deal in HD colour).Set against a constant backdrop of Obama and Mitt Romney slugging it out for the 2009 Presidential Election the steady stream of newsreel footage replaces a great deal of what might have been music score and appears to represent the civilised violence that Pitt prefers as a killer with a conscience.Killing Them Softly refers to Pitt's disdain for killing people at close quarters that he has a relationship with. So given that one of his targets identified by Richard Jenkins the New Orleans Gangland procurement Officer ("it's just so "corporate" these days he says, referring to the decision making on mafia death sentencing, in a laugh out loud moment) is known to Pitt he suggests bringing in a fellow killer , the, as it transpires, totally washed out and alcoholic Mickey, played to perfection by James Gandolfino. OK, it's a bit Tony Soprano and Gandolfino is undoubtedly typecast (but so's Liotta). But, hey, who cares. It doesn't matter because every second on screen with Gandolfino's tics, breathing, sighs, lip licking and world weariness is gold, pure gold (maybe even outside chance of Oscar Gold). It's not much more than a cameo in truth, and he drifts off into the ether as the film resolves itself, but it's pure magic.This is a shocking movie. In many ways as tough, god-dam fearless and just plain horrible as last year's Drive.It's not as sexy but it's as brutal and heartless with its killing and it's arresting from start to finish.It's a worthy addition to the great cannon of mafia movies; Goodfella's, Godfather, Casino, Scarface without the family scenes. It's a great 8 out of 10. But Jesse James is even better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must say today's Brad is a far cry from the Brad of Thelma and Louise. The guy has learned how to choose acting projects wisely. Perhaps that has come with having been in the producer's chair? He has been on fire lately with the likes of Bennett miller, Terrence Malick, Quentin Tarantino, David Fincher, the Coen Bros, Andrew Dominik, David Soderbergh and Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu.This is the second collaboration between brad Pitt and young newcomer writer-director Andrew Dominik. The first was the Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Fod, which i liked a great deal, so i have been eagerly waiting for this film. This was a grand output. The film's script, acting, cinematography, and score were cerebral and substantive.The film is all dialogue, as Roger Ebert points out in his review. Dominik's adapted screenplay was witty yet extremely dark, capturing the ugliness of organized crime's underbelly. Although action scenes were scarce, they were stylishly done. The performances of Pitt, Gandalfini, and the accents of the film's duo of bumbling idiots stood out the most with me. Superb. The cinematography was riddled with goodies, from the introductory slow-motion shot to the pan-outs during the robbery, to the graphic killing scenes. The score was fresh and soulful... Johnny Cash oooohhh yeah. Finally and perhaps most importantly, the product was greater than the sum of its parts, I thought. There was cohesion throughout with all its elements. Great film. Almost saw it twice in the same day.</fullReview>

The undertones that they all drive Pontiacs (US manufactured doomed from the recession) to the background radio blaring continuous political debates grows tiresome after the first 20mins. Being foreign and not completely clued up with US debates, I'm still somewhat uncertain if the director was Anti Obama - but the punch line at the end was "America is a business - bitch" seems like the whole conclusion the director/writer/Brad Pitt wanted to make, and resonates Pro-Romy nuances. The plot otherwise is nothing short of dull, with the only entertaining aspects reiterated in the trailer. Best avoided!</fullReview>

Who thinks at this point that these so called petty mobsters would be of any interest to anyone, if they even exist? I could go on. But having wasted more than an hour with this drek, and walking out to plead for another movie ticket, I have spent too much time on this already. Let us pray, may the complete idiots behind this miserable garbage be sent to a foreign country or planet where they will not murder anyone's weekend ever again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Has to be the worse movie I have seen in some time. Hey Brad, the election is over and your man won - Given your love affair with BO I am going to assume you donated your paycheck to the government. Was there a plot? Felt more to me like a high school talent show with the cast and director each showing off individual skills with hardly any connective tissue. Oh did I mention the occasional in-your-face political rant from BP. Why is it that some actors feel the need to interject their politics into their art. Talk about out of touch. I'd like to see BP and other politically vocal actors put their money where there mouths are. Sorry BP, but I won't spend another dime on any other movie some producer is dumb enough to cast you in. Stick to your craft and leave the politics to the other out of touch segment of our society. Bottom line, save your money - your going to need it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are some really good actors in this movie. Unfortunately the quality of the actors were not enough to over come the tremendously horrible writing and directing. I wanted to walk out during the opening scenes. It was painful to watch and hear. It only got worse as the movie progressed. Some people think that just because something it different and not "mainstream", it's artistic and should be praised. I think I'd rather be water boarded than have to watch this movie again. The government should consider forcing detainees to watch this movie. It's legal torture. I have only seen two movies that were worse - "Gods and Generals" and "The Krays". Save yourselves. See something else. Anything else.</fullReview>

Not even a Australian from Western Sydney sounds as Aussie as the guy in the movie.When this movie is released on DVD, I suggest we all buy the movie and burn every single copy.

		<shortDescription>Realistic and Refreshing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Killing Them Softly' shows how not all films have to be high-octane and fast-moving for them to be excellent. This film surprised me because there wasn't as much violence as I expected but it was overall a lot better than I thought it would be. The story is tied in with the 2008 US General Election which is around the time where the global economy really did begin to fail. It's a pretty standard mob/hit-man story but its social setting makes it a little bit different from other films. The film doesn't flow very quickly but it does so in a realistic fashion. Things progress in the film at a natural pace, not too quickly. The ending might be a bit deflating for some but I thought it was quite intelligent as it ends just as Barack Obama is giving his first speech shortly after winning the election. However, because this was filmed with hindsight in mind it's not as clever as it could have been; we already know what the next four years are going to be like so when Brad Pitt's character dismisses the elections stating that nothing will change it's not that genius because we all already know what the aftermath of this film will be anyway. The story was basic but there were quite a few instances where you're left shocked or surprised, especially in the violent scenes. There's no majesty in this film, the death scenes are quick, violent and shocking which makes it seem more realistic. There's one scene where slow motion and high definition footage is used but after that it's all quick and brutal but it works really well.The acting performances are pretty good; Brad Pitt was excellent, it's been a while where we have seen him play an antagonist. He plays a very complex character who is obviously some sort of sociopath but also has basic manners and can act like a gentleman at some points. James Gandolfini's character can be seen as pointless in some scenes but his purpose of showing how old hit men live out the rest of their lives is quite refreshing. Ray Liotta's role was a little bit disappointing; he doesn't have much screen-time. He performed well but you could have got any actor to play that role. Scoot McNairy really surprised me; he showed a lot of potential here and it would be great to see him in more films. Overall, this film wasn't brilliant but it was a lot better than I had expected. Despite the dialogue being really well written and really funny in some cases, there were scenes which dragged on too much. Scenes with James Gandolfini were the main examples of this which is a shame because he gave a great performance. One of the really great things about this film was the little doses of humour scattered throughout it, making it a lot more bearable. I would recommend this film if you liked films like 'The Departed' or even 'Goodfellas', it's a lot different from those two films but it is of the same quality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The worst movie Brad Pitt ever made!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is without a doubt the worst movie of the year. I expected to see a gangster shoot-em movie with some great actors .Normally I love Brad Pitt and he never does a bad movie, until now!!! this is so bad!! slow scenes, no action, a bunch of commentary that had nothing to do with the plot of the film which I don't even know if there was a plot. And by the way politics is over!! No one wants to hear politics anymore and the movie was full of Obama campaign crap and politics!! WTF!!! yes politics in a gangster film. There are many scenes where they purposely put Obama talking very loudly or political ideals in the movie in the back ground on the radio or on the TV's. I did not get why they did this. I will never understand, we know who won president so why put it in the movie, I'm not getting into politics here I'm just saying that I didn't pay good money to a movie to hear it shoved down my throat. bad idea!!!! this movie sucked!!!!!! There is just to many bad things to say to explain how bad this movie is. I would be here all day and night. This movie had so much potential and they just blew it, they simply blew it. :(</fullReview>

Ironically funny at times, it reminded me of the little gem from a few years back, 'In Bruges'. Just some of the black humor basically. Apart from that, this movie had a bit of an identity problem with not being clear on its main plot. Although, it started off well, it kind of diverted midway losing its main focus. At the end of the movie, you finally understand what point the filmmaker was trying to make and technically has failed to convey so far since he resorts to blatantly voice it through one of the characters. Not my favorite by any length but not that I hated it either. Just confused!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining but had so much more potential!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Andrew Dominik's third feature is an interesting, often entertaining but also frustrating crime thriller which reunites the Australian film-maker with Jesse James star Brad Pitt. The film features severe brutality and wonderful performances but the elements that should have stayed in the subtext are beaten into the audience as much as much the hapless characters.Adapted from George V. Higgins' novel and set in New Orleans against the back drop of the Wall Street Banking Crisis and the 2008 Presidential election, Killing them Softly is a crime thriller with a socio-economic message not so much on its sleeve but carved on its forehead. Scoot McNairy (Monsters) and Ben Mendelsohn (last seen in The Dark Knight Rises) play two na?ve crooks who agree to rob a Mob-protected high stakes poker game for a local small time gangster named the Squirrel (The Sopranos' Vincent Curatola). The bosses suspect Markie Trattman (Ray Liotta), the game's manager who is more guilty for his negligence than his complicity. Jackie Cogan (Brad Pitt), an efficient and clinical hit man is brought in by a mysterious lawyer (the ever great Richard Jenkins) - with connections to an unidentified network of authorities inside and out of the underworld - to clean up the entire mess.Dominik seems to relish in deconstructing audiences perceptions of gangster-genre veterans such as James Gandolfini, Curatola, and Liotta. The three are somewhat weak characters who are simply small fish in a very big and dangerous pond. Liotta particularly is a quivering, cowering tragic character ? completely removed from the swagger he exemplified in Goodfellas. Gandolfini too retains some of his magnetic threatening persona but he is a hit man with a broken heart and a broke n liver from his alcoholism and penchant for prostitutes. The rest of the supporting cast is superb with Sam Shephard, Richard Jenkins and Slaine (seen in Ben Affleck's The Town and Gone Baby Gone) all delivering strong but all-to-brief contributions to the film. Pitt is maintaining his consistency with another confident and compelling performance. He imbues Cogan with empathy ? exemplified by his tact of assassinating his targets "softly" ? yet he is direct and unyielding in his objectives. His speech at the climax of the movie set against Barack Obama's election victory speech is electrifying and among Pitt's finest work. Killing them Softly is a violent film. The beatings are rough and severe and you feel every punch ? every broken tooth, every crack in the jaw, every smashed nose. The gunshots are loud and frightening. The gangster life is in no way romantic or glamorous. It's a kill or be killed environment and those who hesitate to be ruthless and driven in their mission are victims. It's a Darwinian environment where "hope" and "change" are just words printed on dilapidated billboards. The plot of the film is very simple but Dominik rather slows down the action and focus on the characters. It's almost surprising the film ends when it does as one does not know what to expect or where the story is heading. There is an uncertainty in the pacing of the film that is quite apparent. Furthermore, rumours that Dominik's original cut was 2 and half hours (the finished film is a brisk 97 minutes) give weight to the belief that Dominik had much more ambitious plans. It's easy to speculate about the reasons for such a massive cut to footage (studio pressure perhaps) but Dominik seems to mistrust his audience to "get" the sub textual themes and motifs. It's painfully apparent that the heist and subsequent fallout is an allegory for the Economic Crisis and the cutthroat crime underworld is not dissimilar to corporate America. Dominik doesn't believe in understated or subtlety but Killing them Softly is an entertaining ride nonetheless. One cannot help ponder whether this film was destined for something much, much more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just Awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the worst movies I have ever seen. The movie is very slow and boring. Brad Pitt has maybe 20 minutes of screen time, and I'm being generous. One of the only movies I have wanted to walk out of. If I hadn't been with a friend, I would have. We both kept looking at each other saying how awful the movie was. The guy sitting behind me fell asleep within the first 10 minutes and walked out when he woke up. What little plot the movie had was predictable, and then there are all of these political innuendos that just don't seem to fit or add anything. James Gandolfini's character was by far the worst. In one scene he spends what seems like forever talking about his wife, all of this pointless to the story, and another scene he starts in again with another story that drawls on and isn't really necessary. I don't blame him, his acting was fine and I'm sure he played the character as he was told, the problem is that his character just isn't needed and his lines come across as filler trying to extend the running time of the movie. Take him out and you'd probably lose 30 minutes of run time, but this is 30 minutes that can be taken out without really effecting the story at all. The whole movie really could have been condensed to 20 minutes and told the same story. I would definitely advise waiting until this one makes it to TV to watch.</fullReview>

He finally did show up but it was, in my opinion, an uninspired performance and there was just no saving this movie. I think they were going for a "No Country For Old Men" type of feel but they completely missed the boat on that effort. If you have an extra 20 bucks and a lot of time to waste, you will still regret wasting time on this movie, even if you are a die hard Brad Pit fan. In fact, you will be even more disappointed then because his role in this movie is confusing and a lot more limited than it should be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film proves that a 90-minute film can still be boring. This is an introspective slice of life involving hit men hitting one another. The grisly whacks are separated by long actor's exercises, which prove that the actor can play his character well. It is a major shame these characters were not used in any remotely interesting way.My theory is that the filmmakers discovered they had only a 70-minute film and then decided to add the essentially irrelevant dialogue--many scenes of two actors sitting and talking. And there's a drug scene with a slo-mo hallucinogenic effect, similar to numerous films released around 1970. And there is a slo-mo killing. Slow, slow, slow. The poor script is not helped by the uninspired direction and camera set-ups.The only reason I stayed for the whole 90 minutes was that the film was shot in New Orleans, though evidently it is set in Boston. There are no identifying landmarks.If you are expecting any kind of action film, look elsewhere. And don't assume that the excessive political commentary will endear this film to any Obama supporters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Kills Softly.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Killing Them Softly (2012): Dir: Andrew Dominik / Cast: Brad Pitt, James Gandolfini, Ray Liotta, Richard Jenkins, Sam Shepard: Director Andrew Dominik is obviously inspired by the success of Quentin Tarantino but the biggest flaw in this film is his over kill of that inspiration. We have overlong scenes of beatings, drug restrained minds that barely register, plus we have a car shooting that goes poorly into overplay in its visual presentation. Also, the whole Barrack Obama TV speech that is constantly in the background becomes a distraction. On the positive side we have a decent screenplay with a title that seems to suggest concealing sin. It opens with a mob poker game interrupted by two young crooks who make off with a lot of cash and will both pay a heavy price in different ways. Brad Pitt is brought in as a hit man to commit two hits but he knows one of the targets. So James Gandolfini is summoned as a mobster to commit the other hit but he is overwrought with personal issues regarding marriage and is drowning his reputation in alcohol. Ray Liotta plays the mobster hit at the poker setting but since he pulled an inside job in the past he is suspected of doing so again thus leading to very brutal karma. Richard Jenkins plays a contact who meets Pitt in a car under a bridge to convey information. Sam Shepard plays another hit-man who is in the interrogation type of hobby in terms of his methods of stating his claims. Flawed yet entertaining crime film where crime not only doesn't pay, it often leads to irritations within the very circles that were advertized to be tight knit. Score: 8 / 10</fullReview>

It is slow, however this adds to it as even right until the end there is still something to keep you watching as there are many unexpected elements to the film.The slow pace and lack of action makes the film seem much more realistic and is why I particularly enjoyed the film.I wouldn't recommend this if you like fast-paced action movies as I'm afraid this probably won't be for you.

		<fullReview>"Thus did a handful of rapacious citizens come to control all that was worth controlling in America. Thus was the savage and stupid and entirely unnecessary American class system created. Honest, industrious, peaceful citizens were classed as bloodsuckers, if they asked to be paid a living wage. And they saw that praise was reserved henceforth for those who devised means of getting paid enormously for committing crimes against which no laws had been passed. Thus the American dream turned belly up, turned green, bobbed to the scummy surface of cupidity unlimited, filled with gas, went bang in the noonday sun." - Kurt Vonnegut"Capitalism seems inescapable. But then, so did the divine right of kings." - Ursula LeGuinAndrew Dominik directs "Killing them Softly". The plot? Vincent Curatola plays Johnny Amato, a down on his luck business owner. Looking to make some easy cash, Amato hires Frankie (Scoot McNairy) and Russell (Ben Mendelsohn), a pair of small time crooks, and tasks them with robbing a poker game run by Markie Trattman (Ray Liotta). This game is attended by wealthy mobsters. The robbery is successful. Looking to restore confidence in those who attend the poker game, the mobsters hire Jackie Cogan (Bradd Pitt), a renowned assassin. Jackie kills Markie, Amato and Frankie. Consumer confidence restored, the poker games continue. Jackie Cogan collects his payment. "America's not a country, it's a business," he growls.Filled with sound-bites from various US politicians, "Killing them Softly" hopes to work as a broad allegory for the Global Financial Crisis (2008-2011). In Dominik's hands, the film's gangsters and poker games thus echo the behaviour of various mega-banks and mega-corporations, who routinely gamble, speculate and trade mega-portfolios behind closed doors. The sanctum of hyper-capitalists, this market within a market is off-limits to lowly outsiders. Anyone who intrudes, dies. Anyone who challenges the game, dies. And should this little market ? which has no connections to old fashioned notions of labour and commodity production ? collapse, then these collapses will be blamed on sacrificial lambs, and restored via violence, clandestine connections and the shared delusions of inside traders and outside consumers; the game goes on as long as faith in the game going on goes on.As a straight crime drama, "Killing them Softly" is stylish but silly. As an economic treatise, it is pretentious, obvious and heavy-handed. Dominik has no gift for metaphor, no concept of subtlety, and fills his film with intrusive television news snippets. Compare to Robert Altman's similarly themed "Thieves Like Us", a 1974 masterpiece which used incessant radio sound-bites to superior effect. Countless films have drawn parallels between mobsters and businessmen. In these films, the excesses of the gangster echo the excesses of the capitalist. Typically, both are seen as systemic aberrations that can and should be managed; get rid of such bad eggs, and things will work fine. In promotional material, the makers of "Killing them Softly" themselves claim that their film promotes "responsible capitalism", Dominik merely angry at "government bailouts, banks and irresponsible speculators", not "capitalism" itself. But cutting-edge computer models (Peter Victor, Sainjit Shastri, Kevin Anderson, Adrian Dragulescu etc) of even the most rudimentary capitalist economies (ie those without interest-issued currency, privately created exogenous money, banking cartels, bailouts, government intervention etc) show the same results when these simulations are allowed to progress. The system itself - and its drive for the private accumulation of even the slightest profit - at its most basic level, inherently breeds poverty, descending wages, unemployment, unpayable debts, inflation, the devaluing of all currencies, a market predicated upon expansion, cyclical booms and busts, bankruptcy, monopoly and a largely exponential increase in production and consumption. Plotting data from the Energy Information Agency on energy use since 1650, also shows the system's global energy requirements exponentially increasing at a rate of about three percent per annum, a rate which is both unsustainable and inexorably heating the planet. These systemic "side-effects" aren't the result of corruption, criminality or bad eggs, they are how capitalism works (or how math, thermodynamics and the universe works) and always has. Yes, this has enormous benefits (production and mobilisation on a massive scale), but few of these can be morally justified based on the knock-on negatives (no country can provide full employment, aggregate debts are unpayable, 80 percent of the world lives in poverty, most humans don't/can't own land etc and even in the US, the world's superpower, most of the population lives pay-cheque to pay-cheque). Currently, the only things propping up such a volatile system ? and wealth pooling in increasingly fewer hands ? are things like yet more risky loans, defaults, death, war, the birth of new generations to exploit and/or push debts onto, massive welfare projects, blind faith and the cyclical scapegoating, raiding and restructuring of whole countries by transnational bodies which function as a giant loan sharks (the IMF, BIS, World Banks etc).But the point is, "Killing Them Softly" is wrong to blame shady guys in poker rooms and double-talking Presidents in sharp suits. The smallest monetary transactions, the lowliest trades, the humblest businesses, all engender the same forces. The money used by every hard-working, well-meaning human being itself constitutes a type of violence (money only has value because of scarcity; because someone else doesn't have it), a type of social exclusion (every dollar out of debt A is, puts B in proportional debt, a situation which necessitates continual borrowing, production, and so a perpetually inflating economy) and so a type of complicity. The end result of all this is that every homey Mom and Pop store, every entirely legal transaction, has the same nefarious knock-on effects as a Bear Stearns or Goldman Sachs. And when everyone is complicit in this violence, you can't go blaming bad guys playing poker in back rooms. 7/10 ? See "The Drop".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Solid Nothing Else</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Filmmaker Andrew Dominik kicks the proceedings off with an engaging look at the exploits of two bumbling criminals (Scoot McNairy's Frankie and Ben Mendelsohn's Russell). The ensuing heist sequence is as engrossing and suspenseful as one might've hoped, and there's certainly a great deal of promise in the initial shift of focus to Brad Pitt's professional assassin, Jackie. Passable film due to the last 45 minutes where the suspense and thrills are brought upon, as we see Brad Pitt work his gold with great directing. But Dominik, working from his own screenplay, has infused the narrative with an off-kilter feel that does, at every turn, undermine the movie's various strengths, with the continuing emphasis on aggressively pointless subplots and side characters wreaking havoc on the film's increasingly tenuous momentum. Killing Them Softly runs at a smooth 97 minute pace and it feels at often times very slow running. Pitt's character does not make an appearance until roughly 24 minutes into the film, which at this point we see the supporters paying their price, as the backstory is being brought to us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting and unsentimental</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a very interesting look primarily at economics, it is all about the flaws in the economic and financial system and how cash flow from the top affects cash flow to the bottom of the social ladder all in the microcosm of small time crime. It is also about the masochism of the men in this film, they all appear to e very hard but almost all them crumble down to babbling wrecks under pressure and are pretty much portrayed as pitiful, revolting, misogynistic wrecks. It destructs the idea of masochism very well without every devolving to the 'macho porn' as Robert Ebert put it of fight club. This film like fight is solely about men, women are incidental, it is far far better than fight club though. As well as this it is shot beautifully and has a very brooding and dark atmosphere. The film also doesn't over stay it's welcome, it knows when to stop, at just 97 minutes long it is the perfect length for the simple yet effective plot unlike so many other films (Tarantino, ahem) that painfully overstay their welcome. The acting throughout the film is also on point with Brad Pitt on top of his game, bringing a terrific subtle, nuanced and menacing performance to the screen. That is the good stuff, first of all the film is all about men and is very misogynistic(purposely so at points) and when a women appears on screen it appears as if the director has no clue what to do with her. As well as this there are a couple of scenes that grind and drag a little and end up repeating itself which is irritating however both of these complaints are incidental and take little away from the very well polished finished product.To conclude This is a very intricate, interesting film about gender politics, masochism and economics and it manages to present these ideas in a clean, uncluttered and unsentimental 97 minutes. Great film that commands respect and a second viewing. Sadly underrated and not enough people have seen it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A slow paced film but is worth it ultimately</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only reason this isn't a ten in my book is because it was much slower than what it should have been and didn't have as much happen as I wanted to. Now on to the positives, the film has excellent writing which made up for its slow moments and plenty of excellent actors. Overall worth it.The reason I think this film has a 6.2/10 is because it wasn't well received, I came to this conclusion because I thought the same thing when I first watched it. I didn't like it at first but that was thanks to the misleading trailer making this film out to be a light action film with plenty of crime/drama. But this was just straight crime/drama.So after my first watch and disliking it, I came back to it to see Gandolfini after he past and with the right mindset it is a really good film. Just look at it as a slow burn and expect lots of talking but after everything in the film is said and done it is definitely worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Killing ME Softly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I'm living in America. And in America you are on your own". Brad Pitt appears in the second half of the movie and disconcerts the main characters, emotionally breaking their permanent safety. Characters personality evolves with the events that follow in the storyline while a glimpse of American political background accompanies this crime fiction. According to the trailer and the adverts Pitt should have been the most important figure in "Killing them softly" while he is not. The movie should have also been a thriller although the scarcity of action and the constant strong language make it an in vane intent in getting the audience's attention. A sudden car explosion attempts to make the public laugh is immediately followed by another long and useless conversation with swear words and sexual references. If there is a message in this movie it failed to reach me considering that the best quotes are hardly related to the plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ultimate Movie Review! - http://tss5078.blogspot.com - @tss5078</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really liked the trailer and story associated with the film Killing Them Softly, as it appeared to be an original idea in the genre of organized crime. Usually these films are all somewhat similar to The Godfather or Goodfellas, and while that's not a bad thing, I was really interested in seeing something a little different. Killing Them Softly starts out on the right foot, with a daring heist and a bunch of wiseguys left reeling. I was excited and thought this would be a terrific film, but as it continues it really slows down and the story dies right along with it. After a big mafia card game is robbed, the wiseguys want answers and turn to a man named Jackie (Brad Pitt), a problem solver who works under the radar to get the right answers to the right people. Almost as soon as the heist and fallout from it are over, the film goes from an Action Thriller to a painfully slow Drama. Killing Them Softly had all the makings of a great mob movie, the story, an intriguing leading character, and three guys who were in the Sopranos. The beginning was amazing and the ending was pretty good too, but for the hour and a half in the middle, nothing happens, and It was infuriating! We all know what a great actor Brad Pitt can be, especially in this type of role, but his talent is just completely wasted by a Writer who had a beginning, an ending, and no idea in between. Aside from Pitt, the rest of the cast only has brief appearance here and there, except for Scoot McNairy, who you may remember from the awful Science Fiction film, Monster. Since then he's turning up everywhere and I couldn't imagine why, until I saw him here. McNairy plays a good kid, who is caught in the middle, and just wants to survive. He goes through a range of emotions and from side to side as if he were a veteran well beyond his years. What a thrill it must have been for a young actor starting out to show up on the set and be surrounded by the likes of Brad Pitt, James Gandolfini, and Ray Liotta! As for the film, the bottom line is this, it has a big cast we all know and love, with a few scenes that will really blow you away, but overall the story is severely lacking in content and just wastes the talent of it's performers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dark thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems screenwriter/director, Andrew Dominik has successfully lifted every tarnished sentiment from the streets struggling America. Debt; distorted justice; corporate greed, are just some faces in his view off the hard realisms of capitalistic collapse, and takes grim form in this blunt edged gangster film. Two dopes, Frankie and Russell (Scoot McNairy and Ben Mendelsohn), follow the advice of a small time crook to rob an underground card game of its takings. The result is a call to Jackie (Brad Pitt), a hired enforcer by the local crime bosses to deal retribution, which he does with the proficiency of a predator toying with its dinner. But while Pitt headlines, it is McNairy that fills centre stage as the panic stricken, canary voiced thief, facing his impending doom. The soundtrack of campaign talk by politicians, becomes a sardonic commentary woven into the snappy dialogue. If it's dark you're after, you'll love this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before watching the film i didn't really know what to expect. Watching the trailer it seemed that the movie would be a classic action film. Not in a particularly explosive manner, but none the less a film of the sort one has come to expect from Hollywood over the years. With this expectation i watched the film, and i think this may have jeopardized my experience some.The movie IS good. Don't get me wrong! I did enjoy a lot of the moments in it. The acting is very believable, and the film contains a lot of very interesting cinematic and photographic effects, a cool set of characters and an interesting storyline. This being said, I think what ruined it for me was the pace of the storyline. Walking into an action movie one expects rapid shots and generally a fast moving plot. In this movie you still have these characteristics in some parts of the movie, but there are a lot of scenes where time stands still. This causes a fair amount of schizophrenia in the general buildup of the movie.All that said. It is a cool movie worth seeing. Just don't expect an action film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Average mob action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only reason I'm calling this film average is because it has Brad Pitt in it. The man's sheer charisma saves every scene he's in, but even then I have to face the fact that this film does not have a lot to offer.The film has a promising start. Three idiots plan and execute a heist to steal money from the Mob, believing the blame to fall elsewhere. And thus Brad Pitt has to deign this small ghetto criminal community with his presence. Sure the three idiots, who we get introduced to first, are dumb and annoying, but that's their purpose.Unfortunately the film never quite delivers. The characters all have lackluster motivations, none of them are that interesting - even Pitt's is rather clichéd - and you don't end up caring what happens to them. The story likewise never rises above norms and expectations. There's some charm to its willingness to not take sides or to paint the Mob in any way as something glamorous, but that ends up being the problem. We watch mobster films for the glamour, or if not for that, for the high stage violence and action. In those respects, this film is painfully grey and willingly so.Is it a bad film? Absolutely not. It's shot well, the story has structure, the dialogues are halfway interesting. It simply doesn't have anything in it to separate it from the masses. Still, if you're a fan of Brad Pitt or if you want to see a mobster film that doesn't treat them as newborn Greek gods, then this might very well be worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I put off watching this for a while as I thought it may be too violent .There was some close up shots of blood and gore but I lived through it ! I thought James Gandolfini was superb in in this film. His part seemed just right for him. Angry , overweight , he made you believe he was that horrible assassin who just cared about whores, alcohol , was sentimental about one whore while saying he loved his wife. An emotional mess , who Brad Pitt tried to reason with . The film was just paced right .Sad to see Ray Liotta's character being so na?ve as to think he'd get away with his life , hard to believe he could lead that dark life and not have his own kind turn on him . Brad Pitt was cool and hell bent on getting his part done and getting out of there in one piece. A chilling slice of the under belly of America with a political rhetoric running through it. Enjoyable film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting take on crime drama, dampened by the forceful political commentary.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Killing them softly is so close to being a great picture. The acting is great, and, although the film is commonly criticised for its pacing, i felt it to be superb. So where does it go wrong? The first, and most obvious, problem I had with the film, is the way in which it attempted to ply its message; "America is business". Throughout the film we see not just glimpses or hints, but protracted excerpts from speeches and political commentary surrounding the 2008 presidential election. This film seems to have taken the subtle yet pervasive political insight that made The Big Lebowski so special, and turn it into a blunt instrument which hammers home the disconnect between McCain, Obama and Bush's free, equal and prosperous America, and the bleak and violent American city we are presented in the film. The message is okay (I mean at least there is a message) and it comes together nicely in the last scene of the film, but ultimately I would have preferred a more subtle means of delivery, especially since the comparison is not all that convincing. My second problem with the film is it's indulgence in violence. It's not that its too violent, indeed with this kind of film ultra-violence could conceivably serve a purpose, but Dominik seems to dote on the violence in such a way that it becomes tedious and uninteresting. We don't need to spend the time that we do on Ray Liotta's untimely demise. Fully slow motion close ups of guns and bullets and cars crashing and heads bursting and, of course, blood. It all seems a bit unnecessary, a bit cliché, and i just wish that Dominik had taken a more interesting approach to violence - which is such an important aspect of the movie. Overall, I think that Dominik has admirably set out to make an intelligent and interesting crime drama with a social conscience. I just wish that he could have separated himself from the over- worn clichés of modern cinema. The fine performances uplift the film, but are let down by it's style. Well worth a watch, if only to see what it could have been.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Way too soft</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brad Pitt, you're killing them softly with this movie. Too easy a punch? Eh, it barely landed on him. He'll be fine, at least much better than the movie itself. Killing Them Softly is another hit man movie but without all that back-stabbing and double-crossing nonsense. No, this is simply about revenge. You'd think Pitt could melt into the movie pretty easily as a rough gun for hire, but he seems to have approached this role much like he did for True Romance: lazily laying on a couch with the munchies.A young scumbag, who works for an older scumbag, decide to take on a third, even-shiftier scumbag to knock over a Mob-operated poker game that's overseen by a corrupt cop, played by Ray Liotta. They come to this decision because Liotta had already done it, selling out his Mob overlords, and got away with it - but not without some suspicion. So the logic followed that were this incident to occur again, why, it'd be ol' Ray Liotta taking the blame.After the robbery takes place - Liotta's present, but it's clear the mobsters around him think something different is afoot. That's where Pitt comes in. He's hired to track down the miscreants and their ringleader and shoot them dead where they stand. The title refers to Pitt's method of killing - from a distance, both physically and emotionally. He doesn't want to know their sob story, he doesn't want to see any crying, and he doesn't want any begging. So he shoots from a distance. But that's the funny thing, see? Of all the people shot to death in this movie by one Brad Pitt, all are pretty dang close up except for one - whom Pitt finishes off at close range. So much for that tenuous connection to the title, eh?Anyway, Pitt's character does an awful lot of detective work for a gunsel, just to find two teenagers and an old man. But yeah, no spoiler, they get found. I think what bothered me about the movie was how truly low key Pitt is in the movie. Why was he cast? I don't mean he needs to be all-out Brad Pitt, Movie Star, but he - and the rest of the movie, except for a resurgent Liotta - were languid to the point of disinterest in making anything resembling a special film.This seems like a movie that should have stayed a book (it's based on the novel Cogan's Trade, named for Pitt's character), a book that would have a long-running series, a la Spenser or any number of gumshoes/shady characters. But as a movie, there's just not enough of anything: excitement, wit, eccentricities, you name it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Needed more Hits</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hit-man Jackie (Brad Pitt) is hired to find and eliminate (softly, I guess) 2-men who robbed a Mob card game. I got the feeling watching this movie that everything was made up as we went along. In the beginning before and after the robbery we follow the 2-thieves for too long. Very annoying and we kept waiting for Brad Pitt, as hit-man Jackie, to make an entrance. We like hit-man stuff. Jackie comes on the scene and works out the details for shutting down the 2-thieves plus Johnny Amato (Vincent Curatola) the mastermind of that robbery. We do not know why James Gandolfini was in here because all his character Mickey, another hit-man, did was to whine and complain about almost everything in his life and he has a huge drinking problem. All we can figure out is that Gandolfini was in here to audition for a part in another movie. His characters's whining foul-mouthed complaints went on for too long and we slipped into La La land. He brought nothing to the table. Brad Pitt is always good even when scripts are weak and this, without a doubt, is. What might have saved this was more hits and less talkie-talkie, talk talk. See? Hey, this was supposed to be a hit-man movie, not a talk fest. We enjoyed Ray Liotta, as Markie, as he is also always good, but he never gets recognition he deserves. Bummer. The backdrop for this movie is the 2008 collapse of the US financial system and we constantly see Bush and Obama on TVs almost everywhere on the campaign trail explaining how to get the country out of the mess we were in. Near the end Jackie believes this is not a country, but instead a business and where is the rest of his money? (5/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Yes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"You sure you want to do this?" After three criminals are talked into robbing a local mob protected card game the mobsters want revenge and justice. They hire Jackie Cogan (Pitt) to get the job done. He starts off as a level headed enforcer but dealing with those involved slowly changes his mind and he becomes unpredictable. I was really looking forward to seeing this based entirely off the poster and the cast. There is a saying that says you can't judge a book by its cover. That is very fitting for this movie. The title is deceiving so if you are expecting an action movie you will be disappointed. The cast does do a great job but the marketing for this movie does not do the movie a service. This is basically a movie showing the parallels of the local criminal economy failing as well as the US economy and the problems that causes. I like James Gandolfini but his part was a little useless in this. I hate to be so harsh on this because it wasn't that bad but when you go in with one expectation and get something totally different its hard for me to change my thinking that fast. Overall, not that bad but nothing at all like I was expecting and the title is not accurate. I give it a B-.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid, but maybe forgettable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the tradition of underworld crime dramas such as The Godfather, Andrew Dominik's Killing Them Softly is a tense and gripping tale of gangland politics, yet reaches for more with sharp allegory and moments of biting satirical jabs at the bureaucratic mishandling of the recent financial crisis.Featuring an impressive ensemble of solid performances, Killing Them Softly weaves a complex narrative across various levels of an urban crime syndicate, from Richard Jenkins' shady middle- man, something of a liaison with the 'legitimate' world, to the bottom-feeding duo of Scott McNairy and Ben Mendelsohn, whose heist of an illegal poker room launches the plot.Brad Pitt is pitched as the film's lead, and he delivers typically solid if unremarkable work as contract hit-man Jackie Cogan, yet truthfully he is just one piece of Dominik's larger puzzle. Killing Them Softly's scope is ambitious, and for the most part successful, particularly in the darkly hilarious interactions between Pitt and Jenkins scattered across the film. The frustrations of committee decision making are a big theme of the film, and surprisingly the infuriating situations Cogan is faced with seem almost like they've dropped out of a Mike Judge film.However, as an unfortunate consequence of the multiple story threads, not everything works. James Gandolfini appears as a colleague of Cogan, and while his story is interesting, it has little impact on the wider plot and as such could have been trimmed or jettisoned altogether. On the opposite end of the spectrum, not enough time is devoted to Mendelsohn's stunning work as the grimy, burned-out junkie Russell. His arc is wrapped up a little too neatly, and without much explanation, yet Mendelsohn gives one of the stand-out performances of the year, and announces himself as an early Oscar season contender.Killing Them Softly is certainly a good film, but I have an odd suspicion that in a months time I'm not really going to remember much about it, aside from Mendelsohn perhaps. There are some terrific moments, and Dominik has a good eye but seems a little hesitant to push himself too much. The infusion of political critique is smart if occasionally too obvious, and, much like last year's Drive, the unexpected flashes of violence are effective in their brutality. It may not have the legs to go down as a classic, but Killing Them Softly does have enough going for it to merit a recommendation.tinribs27.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Clearly, Andrew Dominic has one one topic in mind - 'Investor Sentiments'. Concentrating mainly on a particular mob-controlled poker game and an eventual 'crisis' that follows, Dominic satirically compares it with the US financial situation against the backdrop of an upcoming General elections.Brad Pitt as Jackie Cogan is impressive, teaching an important diplomatic lesson that - 'Its what on the Street that matters..'. Yes! Scapegoat's the word. Some scenes like the beating of Markie are brutal when compared to the musical soft nemesis offered by Jackie.Not to mention the brilliance of the supporting crew. A particular scene which shows a character Russel depicting so perfectly the state of oblivion as experienced by him.

		<fullReview>(87%) In twenty years time when people start to get nostalgic about the past they'll look back on this and deem it "very 2012", which is at least something, but they'll also get a pretty good crime drama along with it too. From the very start this practically rubs political cynicism in the audiences face as it takes you deep into a part of American life the men at the top would rather you didn't see. Brad Pitt may be all over the posters but for a good while he's not even on screen, but once he shows up he highlights how he's matured into a solid, natural screen actor. The cast in general is strong, with the brilliant James Gandolfini stealing the entire film with a rather small part as a no longer employable killer. I liked the news reports used as score, the plot maybe overly talkative at times, but the dialogue is at least better than most, rather good in fact. Overall a near certain top ten of the year.</fullReview>

In fact at one point, I didn't really know what they where talking about. Brad Pitt was OK, but I am not sure what the point of the character played by James Gandolfini was, because all he did was talk and talk and talk. (And drink!)

		<shortDescription>Just another deadbeat crook movie - with a twist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I watched this movie, I did as I always do - read reviews of the movie to get a feel of if this movie was worth watching. It got pretty mixed reviews and a lot of them criticizing the two deadbeats in the story. So my expectations weren't high. This movie delivered though. I must say this movie is different than a lot of movies I have seen, since its message is delivered in the last sentences of the dialogue and one knew all the way that it was going to be that way. It built up with historic events from the election campaign in America in 2007/8 and one knew that something was to come out of it in the end. The story is about some small town crooks wanting to score a jackpot in a easy way, by faking to be somebody else. By doing that, the one they're faking would take the blame of their crime and they would walk out with all the money. It doesn't work out that way of course. Even though the guy they are faking, made the same stunt as them previously, the one guy is arrested and the two others are killed for their misdeeds. Retrospectively, this movie is SPOT on. The sentence "America is not a country it's a business" becomes clear in a chilling way in this movie. The deadbeats represent the poor in our society and that is why I think their acting was great. They really were lousy people. And the criminal syndicate that is responsible for the killings of these guys, represent those who have the money in America. Even though their doings are worse than that of those deadbeats, they hardly take any consequences, whereas the bums take all the blame. This movie takes a small scale crime and scales it up to open our eyes to the real crimes of this world. Making the poor pay for all the rich people's mistakes. The movie had decent acting in my opinion, though I think it was a bit short.</fullReview>

Brad Pitt, excellent here, is hired to rub out the other participants. Liotta had nothing to do with this, but business is business and so goes suspicion with it.Richard Jenkins plays a calm, collective mob attorney who makes arrangements.In a supporting role, the late James Gandolfini is excellent as a hit-man too consumed by booze to carry out his part of the plot.The theme here is that business is business and that wrongs have to be corrected is weakly shown here.The abrupt ending to the movie doesn't help either.</fullReview>

Other than those scenes the movie was dry... it smacked of an unsuccessful wannabe Tarantino movie, and it had too many violence to women references. (like when the two "kids" are in the car talking about having sex with hookers, one says that the hookers he sleeps with are too nasty to want to rape, but will do when you don't have any other option. and the other one says that every time he sleeps with a woman she always says she wants to kill herself afterwards. then there was the scene with the guy from Sopranos in the hotel room giving money to a hooker and telling her that she needs to do anal and she tells him to F off and he tells her that she needs to be careful because one day she is gonna mouth off to some old guy who is gonna cut her up.)as a woman it's just not all that pleasant for me to watch a movie that seems to focus on this kind of stuff.</fullReview>

We really don't understand why low life scuzz like Brad Pitt figures that the remainder of somewhat more elevated society could possibly in any way identify with the sewarage in which he lives, could in any way identify with him and his low-life ilk.The sooner these low life f**k, f**kin', G*d**mn crudities disappear from the movie industry, the better it will be for ALL of us!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first few minutes into this movie had my interest as it explained a developing plot well and provided a starting point into a movie that should provide some entertainment. In short summary, a plan is devised to rob gamblers using what I deem bumbling idiots for the robbery. The movie continues to expand on the storyline with bits of action+humour here and there then completely falls apart. It felt as if someone had flipped channel to a soap opera. There was very little action and A LOT of pointless talking. So much pointless talking that I almost fell asleep a few times.I really wanted to like this movie given the fine start it provided, but since the writers didn't seem to care, neither did I.

		<shortDescription>Gangster Johnny Suede can't stop this from ultimately being irrelevant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched KILLING THEM SOFTLY two weeks ago. The fact that right now nothing from it is relevant for me certainly indicates that I strongly believe this film is pretty much unimportant, forgettable and ultimately its main point wasn't something I care for. It's an average crime film; clearly, the intention of director Andrew Dominik (whose still short filmography only includes CHOPPER and "The Assassination of Jesse James"; I have yet to see the first and the later is a fine film in my book) wasn't to tell an intriguing story or to play with narrative forms. Let's see, this is as simple as this: we have a couple of not-really-professional criminals who get involved in the execution of a robbery plan of an older man. After they complete the theft, gangster Brad Pitt (with a sort-of "Johnny Suede" look, doing, for the first time in many years, nothing really special), on the other hand, will work to find them and make them pay for their crime. Before I continue to write about the performances and stuff, I have to mention something about the pace of the film and the screening I attended. The trailers shown before the main show were the ones of the new Sylvester Stallone (BULLET TO THE HEAD), the new Jason Statham (PARKER) and ALEX CROSS ? three films that overall seem to be the same: action- packed, fast-paced, just average, big and loud, Hollywood stuff (no offense meant to the great Walter Hill though). I'm not sure how KILLING THEM SOFTLY was sold but I came back home with no doubt people wanted more action, noise and all of those things the trailers showed ? at least five persons walked out. My problems with it have nothing to do with the lack of action and its long talking scenes. I found, as a matter of fact, some interesting material out of that, like for example how the faith of the mentioned not-really-professional criminals is basically decided with conversations inside of a car between Pitt and Richard Jenkins' characters. There are good, stylish sequences, and Dominik is definitely a gifted filmmaker. Performances are good too ? I especially liked ARGO's Scoot McNairy. On the other hand, a guy like James Gandolfini is completely wasted ? I ended wondering about the whole point of his character (a hit-man with drinking problems) as Dominik didn't care much for him. And really my main problem is how the film leaves you thinking you sat down for almost two hours just for a speech (made by Pitt) about the United States, Barack Obama, and money. This is what KILLING THEM SOFTLY is all about: the American 2008 crisis. You know that as it opens with a speech by Obama, and constantly there's stuff dealing with that. The crime world deals with an economic crisis too and ultimately Pitt's speech is the only thing that stands out, as the situations we have (two criminals with money problems being the specific one) aren't something we haven't seen before; I mean, yes, the setting with the crisis may be different but really the content is not. *Watched it on 20 January, 2013</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chilling, contemplative, just not interested</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set to coincide with the economic turmoil and political repercussions caused by the downfall of financial institutions in 2008, "Killing Them Softly" descends audience into the murky underbelly of Boston. In a town encapsulating the downfall of the country, two wannabee criminals Frankie (Scoot McNairy) and Russell (Ben Mendelsohn), too compulsive or too stupid to attempt a different course of action, agree to rob a mob poker game and pin it in its entirety Markie Trattman (Ray Liotta). The crime-lords through the middle man Driver (Richard Jenkins) hire a calm, controlled contract killer Jackie (Brad Pitt) to solve the conundrum, thus coming in as a voice of objective reason to calm the turbulent undercurrent. Writer-director Andrew Dominik delivers a movie mired in murky darkness, ugly and decrepit. The story isn't about vengeance, but bleakly conveys necessity. Culprits must be found, even if they are not the true perpetrators, must be cleansed, thus clearing the atmosphere and allowing for the gambling to restart. Murder and its collateral damage isn't mindless violence, just business that has to be restarted as soon as possible, else money is being lost. The connection to the Wall Street shenanigans is pretty obvious, where several companies were pinpointed to take the fall, irregardless of their culpability, in order to allow for the borderline illicit trading to restart. As such Jackie is the clean-up guy for the mob, opting to kill softly without overly prolonging the inevitable, just meticulously reaching the conclusion. Despite doubts and detractors of his employ, Jackie always knows best: Markie has to be marked, else the 'street' will doubt the sincerity of the mobs actions, thus harming the game. Issues of guilt, likability or justice have no role to play in this scenario.Employed with graphic (sometimes pointlessly slow-motioned) violence and set in the dreary downpour scenery of Boston, "Killing Them Softly" delivers an inspired premise, but one that fails to ignite and inspire, instead burdening the viewers with its despondent atmosphere. By the time the inevitable occurs, offering little reprieve in between from its dole outlook, the overall impact falls well below the mark. Although Brad Pitt does imbue a sense of constructive commitment and delivers one of his most memorable performances (once again disposing of his pretty boy exterior to become a outerly and internally repugnant individual), the overall story peters out leaving little impact or contemplative need. Appropriately as seedy as movie, as the society it portrays, "Killing Them Softly" isn't your standard gangster fare, instead showing a world with corrupt or skewed morals, but bereft of wit, charm, instead bleakly ordinary in its despicable brutality. Illegal gambling takes place in dirty back alleys, while the robberies themselves are neither witty nor intriguing, just simple jobs performed by limited individuals all for the sake of quick cash (Wall Street anyone?).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark, gritty gangster drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Killing Them Softly is a movie that is very well done and is unique as far as gangster flicks run in that there is no good guy, there's hardly any light, witty banter, and it by no means glorifies the underworld lifestyle. This is not Rocknrolla. From start to finish, it is a dark tale where the viewer is drawn in by the horrible lives that the main characters live. There is nothing happy about their worlds. The story unfolds well and with the exception of one or two items, everything is tied up nicely at the end. The one thing I will say about this movie is that Brad Pitt continues to deliver top notch performances and receives little attention from critics for his talent. I think that this stems from the fact that for most of his career, he has been considered the "pretty face." However, I feel that this is selling him short. Ever since "Meet Joe Black," Pitt has continuously stolen movies with his acting abilities and really should be considered for more praise from the industry. That aside, Killing Them Softly is not a movie you watch to feel good about the world. However, if you want to watch a true depiction of what underworld/gangster life is like, and how there are no happy endings, then this is the movie for you. Well done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was too much movie for the few little intricacies that shined and after a while they start to grind down to dull. I found the over bearing constant political news clips of the Bush transition to Obama taking oath most annoying; it had ZERO point other than Brad Pitt delivering his final lines.....which would have been more poignant without all the hype/build up to nowhere. Better editing may have been able to pick this movie up where it fell on it's ass. I'm not saying it was a waste of time but it was a waste of Ray Liotta, Brad Pitt, James Gandolfini and Scoot Mc Nairy AND it would have been a waste of money had I paid to see it in the theaters.Oh...I will however acknowledge my extreme appreciation for it's nod to Blue Velvet in the scene involving Ketty Lester's "Love Letters". It amused me greatly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A violent, darkly comic drama that holds your attention for 90 minutes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Starting off on a slow note, Andrew Dominik's "Killing Them Softly" gathers momentum at its own pace for the rest of its runtime and eventually turns out to be a fascinating crime drama. Encapsulated by a theme of violence, "Killing Them Softly" is a stylized, darkly comic and brutally violent adaptation of George V. Higgins 1974 novel "Cogan's Trade".Set in the American economic crisis of 2008, Johnny Amato (Vincent Curatola), who is also known as 'Squirrel', decides to rob a mob-protected poker game, run by Markie Trattman (Ray Liotta), and sets his former business associate Frankie (Scoot McNairy), who desperately needs the money, and Russell (Ben Mendelsohn), a slightly psychotic drug addict, to the job. The game, once robbed by Trattman, is successfully robbed again, and the two make off with a large amount of money, thus causing the local economy to collapse. The mob then enlists the help of Jackie Cogan (Brad Pitt), a professional hit-man, to track down those who were responsible for it.The film trudges along at its own pace where considerable screen time is devoted to the conversations between the characters. It relies heavily on dialog, and Dominik weaves sardonic humor into conversations supremely well, thus making the tension spurt out with words. The film lacks the zing factor because of its grim setting, though the neo-noir style and performances make up for it. The plot lacks twists and turns of any kind, but that is deliberate because Dominik tries to keep the film as realistic as he possibly can. This is an open invitation for the violence to be shocking, brutal, detailed and, though it's infrequent, it is unusually explicit.On the plus side, the film is well-directed and the screenplay is laced with colloquial wit that packs a punch. The score is soft, reminiscent of the 80s, and is kept to accompany the intense plot and helps to ease the tension slightly. Of the performances, James Gandolfini, who portrays a alcoholic professional hit-man, gives the best performance of the film, He steals every scene he's in with absurd ease and its hard to take your eyes off him. Pitt is perfectly cast in the role of Cogan. The unshakable calm and confidence he brings to his role is exemplary. The rest of the cast give stellar performances, especially Richard Jenkins who does well in a small role."Killing Them Softly" is nowhere as good as the best neo-noir crime dramas of our time but it's one ingenious crime drama that greatly respects the intellect of its audience. If you don't have a problem with brutal violence, I would advise you to check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dazzling existential gangster movie, spoiled by imperious political subtext</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Andrew Dominik, the Kiwi filmmaker behind dogged magnum opus The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford returned to screens this year alongside the perfectly coiffed Brad Pitt with another dose of savage Americana in Killing them Softly.Based on George V. Higgins 1974 novel Cogan's Trade, it's a grimy story of the insipid Boston underworld. Laundromat man by day, mid-level gangster by night Johnny "Squirrel" Amato (Vincent Curatola) hatches a plan to knock over a mob-protected card game and frame the game's crafty operator, Markie (Ray Liotta). He hires a couple of young hoods to do his dirty work: the anxiety riddled Frankie (Scooter McNairy) and his ex-con pal, the sweaty Aussie junkie Russell (Ben Mendelsohn). The job pays off, but the card playing mobsters have their bent attorney (Richard Jenkins) hire the enigmatic hit-man Jackie Cogan (Brad Pitt) to clean things up and get their revenge.Dominik makes the bare-bones crime story ooze with cool, with abstract slow motion shoot outs, hazy heroin binges. The sublimely inventive cinematography from DP Greig Fraser is a treat, with cameras attached to car doors and tracking shots all heavily influenced by Blaxploitation pictures like Black Caesar. It all sounds great too, with Pitt's badass Cogan being introduced to the tun of Johnny Cash's 'The Man Comes Around'. What a cast of heavies Dominik manages to wrestle in too, with Goodfellas' Ray Liotta as the pusillanimous game organiser and, best of all, The Sopranos' James Gandolfini as a nihilistic old hit-man more committed to the bottle than his gun.So far, so good, but Dominik inflates the hard-boiled story with some extraneous narrative flourishes. Lifting the film from the seventies to late 2008, we get the backdrop of financial meltdown and the presidential election. Only they're not background concerns, ringed out instead on billboards, car radios and TV broadcasts. It's all window dressing for the characters involved, who rarely pay attention to the orations, yet Dominik wants the audience to be made glaringly aware of the political allegory. Instead of wry satirical subtext, it's ham-fisted, gross prophesy, an omen to these despicable men and their dog-eat-dog mentality.Just like Peter Yates 1977 movie The Friends of Eddie Coyle ? yet another adaptation of a Higgins novel ? Killing Them Softly is an existential gangster drama, where gangsters are gangsters purely because they don't know how to be anything else. Unlike that cult classic, Killing Them Softly's message of America's social unrest hits like a repetitive thud around the head, crassly blending gruesome mob activity with hindsight-laden subtext. Whilst it may be one of the most visually ambitious films of the year, Dominik's latest is so glaringly unsubtle with his commentary that the entertainment factor ends up obfuscated. The characters may be killed softly, but Dominik has no problem berating the audience.More reviews at www.366movies.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simple story driven by dialogues that is plainly just about killing, money and sex</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was sorta nervous about going in to see this movie, mainly because of the negative reviews saying how boring this movie is. Even made a small talk with a gent on if this movie was going to be good or bad. It turned out to be a entertaining political gangster movie. Now Andrew Dominik made a political gangster movie before but this one is better. Now I agree with some of the complaints about this movie though. The dialogue is drawn out and sometimes isn't coherent with the story which makes it feel like the movie is dragging sometimes. Also the story isn't anything spectacular but it's the direction they go with it that makes it stand out a bit. This movie sorta reminded me of the movie "Killer Joe" except the stupidity of some of the characters didn't get that annoying. And Brad Pitt like Killer Joe is suave and proficient in what they do but isn't a perverted or obnoxious. They are both cynical characters though. It isn't as messed up compared to "Killer Joe" but it's more effective. Some audiences claim they were really bored with this movie and the message might not be clear cut. But the execution of how the characters do things make it really watchable. James Gandolfini Gandolfini is in this and the characters make a big deal out of him but he isn't all that relevant when it comes to the story. This movie is driven by the acting and how messed up and gritty some of the dialogues can get when it comes to killing, money and sex. This is a decent political gangster movie but nothing all that memorable either and that includes the dialogues.6.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chix Chat on Film Review: Killing them softly bored me completely.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Killing Them Softly is the type of story that makes me question the very reason for anyone to make a film like this. It was an adapted novel, so I was sitting in the theater wondering why adapt? I understand that people in all walks of life have a story to be told, so if the point of this movie was to reiterate that crime doesn't pay or to solidify the point that criminals are idiots, then job well done. The trailer gives the impression that this is a story about a hit man, Jackie (Brad Pitt) who likes to keep his work impersonal, as if the business of killing wasn't impersonal enough. For the most part he does exactly what he sets out to do. There is little insight into the person that Jackie is other than from the low key meetings with his employer (Richard Jenkins), and when he makes Frankie (Scoot McNairy) an offer but he and all the characters are so distasteful that there is absolutely nothing or anyone in this film for the audience to invest in. None of the characters are endearing, I strangely felt somewhat compassionate towards Frankie (Scoot McNairy) but that was really just a testament to his acting ability, when he seemed to be afraid, he seemed very afraid. He did a convincing job as did his associate Russell (Ben Mendelsohn) in playing dregs of society. This film was the exact opposite of a Romantic Comedy, I don't know what to call it other than Dismal Drama. There was no loving couple to find lose and then regain the love for one another, this was criminal activity and cold blooded murder for hire. The one and only female in the entire story was a hooker (Linara Washington) for Mickey (James Gandolfini). He and Markie (Ray Liotta) seemed to have a part in the film only to lure the viewers into believing that this was going to be some kind of Good Fellas type story, assuming you had not read the book and already knew what the heck was going on. There may be an audience who can appreciate a story about crime, murder and betrayal, but I prefer a bit more range. It's a sad case when the most fun in a film is someone's brows being burned off for being stupid. Maybe I should have followed the couple who walked out after the first half hour and never came back. I give it a red light</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Killing Them ???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie review is on the film "Killing Them Softly," starring Brad Pitt, Ray Liotta, and James Gandolfini. As simply as I can put this, this film is about a hired gunman that is hired to kill three men that robbed a mob card game. Also, there is some kind of deep message about what America actually is.Honestly, this wasn't a bad film but I would rush to see this again. This film had a lot of dialog. At times I felt there was too much dialog. Plus, the dialog itself was okay, but not that interesting. I thought Brad Pitt's acting was good! He was without question the highlight of the film. I just wanted to watch Brad Pitts parts and see what he going to do mid way though the movie. Throughout the film there were clearly notified political viewpoints being shared. It was like the film itself was just a cover up for some kind of message the director wanted to get across. Jackie (played by Brad Pitt) say's a quote, at the end of the movie, which I'm not going to give away because I'd feel like I would have given the movie away in a sense. Was that the message the director wanted to get across??? Overall, don't go see this film in the movie theaters. I know Brad Pitt, Ray Liotta, and James Gandolfini is in it, but don't see this film. "Killing Them Softly" is not a film worth spending your money to go see unless you're a really huge Brad Pitt fan and you just have to witness all of his films on the big screen. I'm giving this film a 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on the trailer and cast, Killing Them Softly promises to be a great gangster movie. Unfortunately, it sorely disappoints. The movie is slow and lacks suspense. The script is extremely poor and full of strange plot choices. James Gandolfini enters the stage and great conflict is promised, and then just exits the stage again. We are told what happened to him, but we don't see it. Pitt is a stylish killer but his character doesn't show any real development, nor do we see any interesting interaction with the apparently soft hearted masters behind the scene. With this great cast, something better surely was possible. The lack of a female interest is perhaps not a requirement for a script but anything would have helped here.</fullReview>

I watched this movie because I considered Brad a first class actor. I have my doubts now. This could have been a great thriller instead of violent Hollywood gangster dribble. Some great past gangster movies like ScarFace, Goodfellas, or Leon: The Professional come to mind. The plot left a lot to be desired, but I guess it was poorly developed like the writing.

		<fullReview>Killing them softly is about a man hired to kill a few individuals who were connected to a robbery. Many of the negative reviews stem from the massive amount of talking that takes place. I don't personally mind a movie full of chatter as long as the conversation is interesting and witty. The previews that were shown before its release was pretty deceptive. It made the movie seem as it was going to be full of blood and gun play. Others were expecting it as well and when it didn't turn our that way many individuals were turned off. Killing them softly could have been much more then a mediocre film. The movie is incomplete and the acting is not the best. Some of the killings may be violent to most but its nothing we haven't seen before. One scene I found decent was when it was time to take out Ray Liotta. His killing was shown in slow motion and he's the first guy to be taken out. Also you hear a number of short presidential speeches throughout the movie. Not sure why it was put in film but I'm sure there's a reason. The ending was terrible. In short as long as you are aware of what the movie consist of throughout it shouldn't be a problem to sit through it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An exercise in style and an unwitting tribute to the masters of the gangster genre.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a gangster movie, without a civilian in sight, is set to the soundtrack of American politicians mouthing words they don't believe in, you know the director is trying to do something different.And when the period becomes the autumn of 2008 when the global economy went into a tailspin along with the election of Barrack Obama as Americas first African- American president, we know that we are looking at an unlikely recipe.This film is based on a 1975 novel by George V. Higgins, a master of hard-boiled gangster dramas with a gift for dialogue and set in 2008 in a barely recognizable post Katrina New Orleans.The images are at once post apocalyptic, a completely stoned junkie wearing tattered clothes and bathed in cold sweat walk into the frame, the sky is overcast, the posters of Obama and McCain peer down at him in an improbable way, all this set to the soundtrack of Obama's suave oratory.He steals dogs for a living and aspires to become a drug dealer, no doubt consuming a great deal of narcotics in the process.We learn that he is about to be recruited by his mobster friend into carrying out a hit on a high stakes poker game, with hardened criminals at the table.The laundry owner who is the mastermind of this heist figures that it's a smart way to make some easy money.Ray Liotta who plays Markie Trattman appears the way we have left him in several other films, a victim of his own naiveté, but an aspiring criminal still.He once organized a hit on his own poker game, and got away with it.He lived to tell the tale years later, finding it so funny that tears stream down his face.His listeners gave him a pass then but if there is another similar incident he surely won't get a second chance from the mob.This is the premise on which the trio act, they have a ready-made fall guy.The hit goes as planned, the junkie duo walk away with the money and the mob calls in a contract killer Jackie Coogan played by Brad Pitt to settle scores. Pitt is handled by Driver played by Richard Jenkins, who appears more like an accountant than a mob front man.His middle management bearing and inept decision- making is drawn from the corporate world of Dilbert. Hank Paulson can also be heard on the radio at times giving his spiel on saving the economy .Given the political setting of the film it is one of the few gambits that succeed. Jackie is a very rational guy, of the opinion that they bump off Markie because his existence threatens the confidence of the criminal world and clams up the free flow of dirty money.Something like allowing Lehman to fail as too many Federal bailouts point to an incurable and intolerable weakness in Wall Street.Meanwhile Pitt lays out his methods on the table, he likes to kill from a distance, up close the victims get too emotional and start pleading like kids.He like to kill softly.And to kill one of them he needs an accomplice since he does not like killing the people he knows.In walks the still sensational James Gandolfini as Mickey and provides the film with lots of entertaining dialogue.He mouths lines about his messed up marriage life and his obsession with prostitutes, all the while drinking way too much for Pitts comfort.Pitt course corrects and takes matters into his own hand right up to the end.The cinematographer Greig Fraser uses a new Kodak film stock and custom-made lenses to achieve a blurry creamy texture that makes the film visually very interesting to look at. Along the way we get plenty of rain, brutal killings and a gut wrenching beating scene, but not a moment of genuine tension. In one scene a jet lagged Mickey toys with a nervous waiter in a combined homage to Joe Pesci's "Tell me what's funny ?" scene from Goodfellas and Chigurh playing with "The Gas Station Proprietor" in No Country for Old Men. There are moments of dry humor and one wonders how Mr Tarantino might have handled this material.Or the Coen brothers or Scorsese for that matter.But Andrew Dominik is trying something different here and not quite succeeding.In fact the best moments of the film are his attempts to "uncopy" the Tarantino's of the world, case in point being Mickey's talkative character.I was quite open to the premise of the film, a mobster film as a comment on the failing American political and economic system, unlike most American critics who see this as an attempt to malign America by a non-American director. Much in the same way Lars von Trier was not allowed to criticize America in Dogville. But it turns out that the closing piece of scorching dialogue mouthed by Jackie is not enough material for a wholly credible film.The ride is as cold and damp as the world inhibited by the characters. Dominik made the brooding The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward James Ford, dripping with internalized violence and homoerotic tones, here he delivers a barely watchable film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brad Pitt's silly wit doesn't count in here where the plot is very, very simple against a backdrop of financial instability. The direction is superb, so are the performances but Brad as a lead role... doesn't appeal to me because he has less screen time than one of the two people shown at the beginning.Killing Them Softly is a typical neo-noir film where the perpetrators are used to take on the main guy and all that bullshit. It actually bored the hell outta me and I actually skipped some minutes by going out arbitrarily.On the other hand, the slow-mo sequence at the middle of this movie is one hell of a film-making. I enjoyed it and another couple of scenes. The long conversations injected ennui and I was totally ridiculed at how Thomas Jefferson &amp; Barack Obama were brought into the whole picture. It shows some real truth about America and it;s lifestyle, but I am disappointed by my one of the most awaited films. 6 is the greatest I can give!WATCH OUT FOR: The slow-mo sequence!Can be watched with a typical Indian family? 50% YESLanguage: Strong | Sex: no | Nudity: No | Gore: Strong | Alcohol: Yes</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely a very cold, cerebral experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Killing Them Softly is the first time in a long time where it feels like something went over my head several times. The only other Dominik film I have ever seen is The Assassination of Jesse James, which is one of my absolute favorite films ever. I had heard such a mixed reaction towards this though, so I didn't elevate my expectations very high. After seeing it, I can definitely see why. It's meticulously paced and crafted, visually stunning, but also somewhat cold. Technically it's amazing, and once again the cinematography is a big part as to why it feels so accomplished and secure in itself. Dominik certainly doesn't seem to pander down to anyone, and the result is a film that feels like nothing less than what he wanted. The whole ensemble is pretty great as well, with Pitt as the stand out. I just can't say much about this at all though, because I deeply respect it but also couldn't enjoy it as much as I wanted to. It is in a sense enjoyable though, some of it really riveting, the dialogue taking center in some great moments.I do want to have some time to mention just how happy I have been about Brad Pitt for a good while now. He continues to challenge himself with a variety of roles in a wide variety of projects. Of all of the actors working right now, he probably has the best resume of the last decade, with several films of his being among my all-time favorites. He seems to have a deep appreciation of everything cinema has to offer and he's wisely taking advantage of it. I hope this streak that has been going on for a while now continues on for a very long time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'KILLING THEM SOFTLY': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Brad Pitt reteams with director Andrew Dominik for this crime caper based on the 1974 novel 'Cogan's Trade' by George V. Higgins. The two previously worked together on the 2007 critically acclaimed epic crime film 'THE ASSASSINATION OF JESSE JAMES BY THE COWARD ROBERT FORD'. Domik wrote and directed this film about a Mob card game robbery, which causes the economy of organized crime to collapse, and the enforcer (Pitt) hired to find those responsible. Domik updated the 1974 story by drawing obvious comparisons to the downfall of the legitimate capitalist economy of recent years. The film is a somewhat simplistic character driven crime film but it's told with so much style and is full of so much talent that it's sure to please any true fan of the genre.The story revolves around a trio of criminals who decide to rob a Mob card game relying on the idea that the local Mafia will think the organizer of the poker game, Markie Trattman (Ray Liotta), is responsible; due to the fact that he previously admitted to robbing his own game before. Initially everyone does suspect Trattman of the crime and enforcer Jackie Cogan (Pitt) is brought in to rough him up. Cogan, as well as his employers, know Trattman wasn't responsible for the crime though and Cogan is given the task of finding out who was. The whole time business is dead due to everyone being uneasy over the crime and it's up to Cogan to quickly find those responsible and punish them in order to restore the organized crime economy.As far as theatrical business goes 'KILLING THEM SOFTLY' is the lowest grossing film of Pitt's leading man box office career. It's been labeled a bomb by some but I think this is just an attempt to smear Pitt and try to take him down a few notches (by those jealous of him in the film business). The movie was made for just $15 million and it's not the type of film that normally gets a big theatrical release at all. It's the type of gritty low budget indie crime film that usually gets a small art house release before doing the majority of it's business on video. The fact that this got a wide theatrical release at all (and even at Christmas time) is a testament to Pitt's box office power. Of course it hasn't been a huge moneymaker but it's already made more than twice it's budget back ($30 million) and that's before it's done most of it's likely business on video. In reality the film is a success anyway you look at it (despite what naysayers say). The film business, like everything these days, is all about politics (people will always try to tear others down) and the comparisons in the film between organized crime and capitalism are a little overdone and very unsubtle but they work for the most part. The film has been accused of being too slow but you'd have to have some serious ADD not to find it at least a little amusing. There's always something interesting going on (despite the fact that there's not a lot of action) and I was never bored. There are much more slower paced films out there than this that don't get overly criticized for it and still do amazingly well at the box office. This is a well made film, maybe not what some were expecting, but it's an entertaining and effective crime film and Pitt and Dominik both do impressive work in it (once again).Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xLp95d1OTk</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In America you are on your own</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Widely regarded as a mixed bag, KILLING THEM SOFTLY is more like a diamond in the rough, or a useless stone to the un-keen eye. Adapted from George Higgins' 1974 novel Cogan's Trade, writer-director Andrew Domink's screenplay may not sit well with viewers who lapped up his previous film THE ASSASSINATION OF JESSE JAMES BY THE COWARD ROBERT FORD, but there is a lot to like about SOFTLY once you get passed trying to figure out what it's about. For starters, the film is beautifully shot. I suppose this is Dominik's unplanned result of trying to give a crime-drama an art-house ambiance. We have seen before that art in movies works best when illustrating melancholy, especially when the theme is suffering, or yearning, or any other depressing emotion. SOFTLY's art is abstract in nature because it is staring at you in plain sight but most people don't see it. Maybe this has to do with Dominick's intentionally vague narration, or perhaps most viewers sabotage the film's message by expecting a typical 'bada-bing bada-boom' gangster action flick. But clearly, this film is not for everyone and not many viewers will appreciate its conception. Run by Markie Trattman (Ray Liotta), a mob protected gambling den is held up by a couple of dimwits who seem like fish out of water. The sequence when the robbery takes place is spring loaded on hair thin tension but is one of many scenes in the film embedded with dark humor. Brad Pitt's Jackie Cogan is introduced by the bad boy of Country music - Johnny Cash singing "The Man Comes Around". This is a fitting introduction for a mafia investigator, enforcer, and hit man rolled into one. Cogan is now tasked with finding the duo that made off with the loot, while also investigating Trattman's negligence in preventing the robbery.The talented Mr. Pitt is convincing as an unsympathetic antihero who likes to dispatch his victims when they least expect it, or "from a distance" as he put it. Ever since Pitt displayed some serious acting chops in TWELVE MONKEYS, he pretty much bought the biggest names in film production. Even so, Pitt has chosen his roles wisely (as opposed to pretty boy roles by Tom Cruise) and I can say that he is today what Redford, Nickolson and Hoffman were in their heydays. Pitt's Cogan is also a bit unconventional if you are expecting a cinematic gangster with big guns. As much as I like Al Pacino, SCARFACE went overboard in the final scene with Tony Montana and his "little friend". The kill scenes in SOFTLY are few, but Dominik makes you wait impatiently before opening a can of stylized blood and gore. Instead of those trigger happy drive-by shootings we have seen in previous gangster movies, Domink reminds us of the mob's ruthless modus operandi, and the significance of power, respect and loyalty. Gandolfini's character, the hit man who was supposed to take out the people Cogan is tasked with finding, is pointless and one of the areas Domink could have done without. Still, Gandolfini's does a good job as Mickey, barking insults at the service industry from barmen to prostitutes while maintaining a menacing presence throughout. Coming to the film's setting in the 2008 financial meltdown, our two idiots (played by Scoot McNairy and Ben Mendelsohn) are so na?ve that it never dawns on them (at least before the robbery) that robbing the mob at gun point is a suicide mission. This obviously makes them petty thieves who are not associated with the ways of organized crime. On the opposite side, not only is the gambling network disrupted when this happens, the mob looses face by being robbed by morons. Would a pride of lions allow a hyena to drag away a fresh kill? It's the same here. Like the old method of developing photographic film, Dominik's nuance is in the picture that emerges. For me, it is a portrait of Charles Darwin with guns! This is nicely done by integrating the thought that you cannot survive by blaming the government for the economic crash. Pitt echoes this at the very end when mob lawyer Driver (Jenkins in another fine role) tries to negotiate a concession for each kill "America isn't a country. It's just a business. Now, f-ing pay me!" In all this, the biggest irony is if legitimate bankers (Wall Street) brought the American economy down on her knees, why are mobsters outlaws when bankers as well as mobsters see America as a business playground?One of the biggest let-downs of the movie is not actually a fault of the director or the screenplay he has written. It is the roaring complaint that Domnik tries a Tarantinoesq narration but fails miserably. This was probably a misconstrued perception by some fanatical film critic at the Cannes premier and it may have just cascaded from there. Half of Quentin Tarantino's dialogues are meaningless melodrama, whereas Domink uses wit in dialogues that are drafted into huge concentric circles that eventually close in on the main topic. Eventually. Capiche?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Told and Shown Plain and Simple Rescued By Sucker Punch Cinematic Lifesavers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Both its sensational acting and dazzling cinematography give the film notability and credit where it is certainly due. That being said, "Killing Them Softly" takes a bleak and somewhat insulting approach in displaying its thematic parallels by spelling out its message in bold letters set on CAPS lock. It's worth seeing for its superb acting, lavishing visuals and dark comedic dialog, but will definitely put many viewers in a see-saw battle judgment bind. As a result of a wishy washy plot sequence masked by abstract techniques throughout brutally violent scenes, it is no wonder that a vast majority of public viewers may be put off at times or throughout the entire duration. The film will test your patience from start to finish. Its funny and quirky one-liners throw lifesavers at its dialog which gets to be uncomfortably drawn out a majority of the time. It pained me while watching as it had more than enough potential that was not sufficiently executed with courtesy towards trusting the audience. There aren't any hidden plot tricks or major twists and I felt as though I was spoon-fed notions that had been sternly established at the beginning. However, if you're a huge movie buff like myself then you most likely will appreciate it for the director's "soft-yet-not" depiction and the pros I mentioned which acceptably outdo the cons. For what its worth, I give it a 7/10 rating where the film can fairly stand at best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is about a mob leader whose underground gambling facility got robbed at gunpoint. Revenge is at every corner."Killing Them Softly" may sound like an action film, but it is not. There is hardly any action. There is only one fight scene that is worth mentioning, and even then it is only because the slow motion blood splatter and scattering broken glass look cool. The plot is weak, and nothing happens most of the time. I can't believe there is so much irrelevant conversations in this film. There is a ten minute conversation in a hotel room that is totally irrelevant to the plot. The pace is so slow, that the story can really only fill up thirty minutes of screen time. The rest of the scenes are pointless fillers which are neither artistic nor entertaining. Keep away from "Killing Them Softly", even if you are a Brad Pitt fan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If your in the mood for your typical mob tale of blood, guts, hits, and murder then this independent flick "Killing Them Softly" is one to watch as the all pro well known cast of Pitt, Gandolfini, Jenkins and Liotta made the chemistry flow well to produce a good picture. This film shows that in economic hard times people will do just about anything to make a buck it's all about business and money. You name it if it means robbing a mob card game to get well respected then so be it. Still with any mob picture this film alike has nice subplots and interesting twist and turns with each character as two of the hotshot bosses Markie(Ray Liotta)and Johnny Amato(Vincent Curatola) are meant to meet fatal ends. Yet so clever and done in a professional and entertaining way is the work of hired gun enforcer and hit-man Jackie(in one of Brad Pitt's surprise better roles)as his older buddy and partner hit-man Mickey("The Sopranos" James Gandolfini)has a problem with the bottle and female escorts to be a factor in the game. Overall pretty good mob puzzle that unravels to a bloody and wicked end as it shows the true colors and ways of life for many it proves it's all business as everybody wants a cut of the money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best screenplays of the year!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Very few guys know me." Jackie Cogan (Brad Pitt) Small time hoods and godfathers have given filmmakers ample cause to celebrate character-driven drama, in which the modest details of dialect and action seem almost Russian novelistic on the big screen.Such is the minimalist charm of Andrew Dominik's Killing Them Softly, an appropriate title given the spare use of violence, which is nonetheless fanciful and impressionistic when it happens. Some may call slo-mo a cliché by now, but it seems to me an evocation of memory that expands the moment.Upon reflection about the impressionistic violence, I liked the movie even more because the emphasis is so obviously on character. Since that is the way of the source from crime writer George V. Higgins, it all works even better. Updated to 2008, the film repeatedly overlays or cuts to political and business references such as George Bush speaking on the economy, which is quickly deteriorating like the afterglow of the heist.Given that the hit man Jackie Cogan (Brad Pitt) is sensitive about murdering up close, the emphasis on the psychology of the murders is called for. He says, "They cry, they plead, they beg, they p***** themselves, they cry for their mothers. It gets embarrassing. I like to kill 'em softly. From a distance." The plot is not intricate: Cogan is called in by the Mob (exemplified by the suited, Richard Jenkins' seemingly shy Driver) to avenge the heist of its "protected" poker game. As avenging angel Jackie closes in on the perps, he talks more than he kills, and Dominik overlays several scenes with '30's pop culture ballads like Love letters and It's only a Paper Moon. It's a cynical take on a cynical business.Because I am convinced this is one of the best screenplays this year, allow me to quote Jackie's final speech after he discovers the mob has short-changed him. Note the emphasis on the recurring theme that, like America, crime is a business: "My friend, Thomas Jefferson is an American saint. Because he wrote the words all men are created equal, words he clearly didn't believe since he allowed his now children to live in slavery. He's a rich wine snob who's sick of paying taxes to the Brits."So, yeah, he writes some lovely words and aroused the rabble and they went and died for those words while he sat back and drank his wine and f***** his slave girl. This guy wants to tell me we're living in a community? Don't make me laugh."I'm living in America, and in America you're on your own. America's not a country. It's just a business. Now f**** pay me."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting twist on a mob tale...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps the most memorable aspect of this movie is the number of times you see actors you know from other mob themed TV series or movies...obviously there's James Gandolfini from "The Sopranos"...plus another guy from that TV series whose name doesn't readily spring to mind...not as well known...looking at the cast list for this movie it would be Vincent Curatola. Another obvious actor is Ray Liotta, from the movie "Goodfellas". It's close to a "Who's who" of mob pop culture!Anyway, this movie isn't in the same class as these TV series or movies...or even director Andrew Dominik's superior Australian mob related surreal fact based dramedy "Chopper", which starred Eric Bana. The main reason I don't score this movie higher is because of the often meandering conversations involving Gandolfini's character (Mickey) and Brad Pitt's (Jackie Cogan). It almost seems like the role was beefed up to draw in Gandolfini...and perhaps he thought that there was an Oscar in it? These scenes seem pointless in any case and worse, they're a drag on proceedings.The story concerns an armed robbery on a poker game attended by mob identities. Theoretically, it should all go smoothly...the wrong guy will get the blame for setting up the robbery and the actual people behind the robbery will get away scot-free. Of course, things never go to plan and a hit man (played by Brad Pitt) is hired to punish those behind the robbery.The 'twist' to this story is how these criminals are represented as parallel to corporate America during the time of the global financial crisis. There's an interesting timing to this movie's release in any case...coming out soon before the U.S. presidential election, it constantly reminds the viewer of how bad things were economically in the last days of President George W. Bush's presidency. However, unlike how the mob works, most of the real corporate criminals who caused the global financial crisis in the U.S. got away scot-free. Jackie Cogan even casts his eye back further in time, drawing a parallel between current corporate/criminals types and President Jefferson. That's a really powerful parallel...both as being tax dodgers and engaging in immoral activities. In any case, there are a multitude of actual news clips showing presidential hopeful Barack Obama saying hopeful things about the nation, as well as some by President Bush. The movie contrasts these images with the reality of life on the street. The opening scene of Scoot McNairy's "Frankie" walking along a residential wasteland is telling.For some reason an Australian actor (Ben Mendelsohn) has a prominent role as the Australian robber Russell. His make-up and costume is superb. He looks like a dero and has a greasy sheen to his skin...you can just imagine what he smells like! Perhaps there is some kind of meta-narrative reason for an Australian being prominent in this tale. In the end, I'm not sure whether he is ultimately smart or stupid in his actions.Perhaps this film suffers too much from being flabby...too many parallels with the news clips and too much drunken meandering conversations by Gandolfini's "Mickey". Might have scored this 75% if not for the latter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Such a disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just finished watching this movie and I'm still not sure what happened or what went wrong. I wanted to like this movie so bad. I tried to like it. With some of my favorite actors in it I was bound to be very forgiving as far as any flaws there may have been.But I just can't bring myself to like it. I don't know how this movie received all the good reviews that were thrown in our faces every time we seen the trailer on TV. That alone should be a red flag. Because whenever a movie trailer talks about how good the movie is it's usually the only way to get people to go see it.It almost feels like this is an amateur movie made for a film festival. If that were the case, and they cut it down to 45 minutes, it could have been alright. But you're lead around the whole movie waiting for it to pick up, waiting for a plot twist or something. Because there's no way this could be the whole movie. But guess what it is, and it ends as it starts, going no where.The two good things I can say about this film; it was short (if it were dragged out to 2 hours I would have been pised) and the acting was pretty good. But good acting gets you no where without plot and a script! This director is horrible. I got the feeling the whole time this movie was not intended for me (the average movie goer). The feeling I got was I was watching a movie I should not have been watching. Like it was an artsy movie intended for Hollywood types in the movie business.I could go into detail why this movie didn't work, getting into specifics of the script but frankly, I don't know where I would begin. The whole thing was just badly put together and poorly written. It's almost worth seeing just to dissect it and pick it apart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Killing them softly directed by Andrew Dominik is a perfect title for this movie with Brad Pitt as Jackie, the ruthless killer who does not like to mince words. Scoot Mcnairy as Frankie and Ben Mendelsohn as Russell are the kids without lot of experience who get involved with the mob. Jackie and James Gandolfini as Mickey( perfect for this role especially after The Sopranos)are buddies and know what they are doing. Ray Liotta as Markie thinks he can fool the mob and gets kicked and brutally killed. No one should mess with Brad Pitt because he is great with his killer instincts ( Kalifornia, Seven, Ocean's 11,12,13....). enjoyed the movie thoroughly. Entire cast was excellent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a brilliant adaption of Cogan's Trade by George V. Higgins. Killing Them Softly is an American crime film directed by Andrew Dominik and starring Brad Pitt, based on the 1974 novel. There is very little not too like here for Crime-buffs. Changing the setting to Louisiana, in 2008 made it far more relevant, and entertaining. Pitt is Jackie Cogan,a professional enforcer who investigates a heist that occurs during a high stakes, mob-protected card game. As this very sorry saga demonstrates, crime will not clearly pay. The supporting cast is also very good, Richard Jenkins as Driver was very subtle, his interactions will Pitt, are some of the films highlights. James Gandolfini as Mickey is a burned out enforcer, who really should have chucked-it in long ago, and gone it Florida. Ray Liotta as Markie Trattman, has come full circle, in the Mob. He too Should have gotten out, but as his character's actions show he still wants crime to pay. The results are very un-pleasant.Andrew Dominik and Brad Pitt, have repeated success, here. Joins a very distinguished number of must see films of 2012.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Andrew Dominik's gangster film inserts a contemporary setting into George V. Higgins's 1974 novel, 'Cogan's Trade'. It is unashamedly one for fans of indiscriminate violence and mayhem, with lashings of Tarantino-esque dialogue and Cronenbergian suspense. Dressed sharply in black and sporting a 50s-style bouffant and goatee, Brad Pitt stars as Jackie Logan, a slick mob enforcer contracted to whack a couple of punks (Scoot McNairy and the increasingly prolific Ben Mendelsohn) for holding up one of Ray Liotta's illegal card games. As Markie Trattman, Liotta delivers one of his better performances since his unforgettable Henry Hill in 'Goodfellas'. You can't help but feel sorry for him. He is savagely beaten for being suspected of staging the heist. He did it once before, so naturally all the shotguns point towards him. The violence, which I enjoyed, is enough to make you recoil, but isn't that the point?James Gandolfini stands out as Mickey, the depressed, hooker-loving hit-man, but he could play this sort of role in his sleep. One of the delights of this film is the long dialogue scenes he shares with Jackie, in which he laments his failing marriage, and expatiates upon his carnal knowledge. As for Beautiful Brad - I've still not seen anything (apart from 'Fight Club') that convinces me he's the great actor the world thinks he is. It's not that he's too pretty in this role (which he is); it's that he just doesn't pass for a cold-blooded killer. And no amount of homicides he commits would convince me otherwise. www.moseleyb13.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brad Pitt and Andrew Dominik reteam for a Killing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Australian director Andrew Dominik made a blistering debut with Chopper in 2000 before the suitably epic and problematic pause before his second feature, The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford hit in 2007 ? one of my favourite films of the last 10 years.Never one to rush to his next project, Dominik is back with Killing Them Softly. Again based on existing material, in this case the 1974 novel Cogan's Trade by the late crime author George V. Higgins, it also sees the director once more penning the script and re-teaming with Jesse James lead Brad Pitt.The script updates the action from the 70s of the novel to run concurrently with the final days of Obama's race for the presidency. His speeches of hope and the potential of the United States are intermingled with a base and grimy tale of two inveterate idiots who devise what they think is an elaborate plan to steal from the mob and frame someone else for the job.It's this act, and the almost unbearably tense robbery scene, which sets up the rest of the film ? forcing Brad Pitt's Jackie to go after those responsible.Killing Them Softly is a film about death, the necessity of it at the darker edges of the world but also the way in which it can be seen as a mercy. When Jackie is told to rough up a potential culprit, he protests ? if they're going to kill him anyway, why put him through the misery of a beating beforehand?The title itself refers to the hit-man's philosophy on killing ? a preference for taking his victims by surprise, sparing them the fear and anguish of facing their mortality.It's this oblique attitude which sets Killing Them Softly apart from the identikit crime dramas which trickle through cinemas on a yearly basis. There's a humanity here, despite the criminal deeds at hand. Dominik also works hard to pepper the script with humour ? some coarse but all adding up to the portrayal of these characters as more than mere engines for exposition and expiration.Some of the best scenes in the film revolve around Pitt's all too frequent visits to his mob handler, played by Richard Jenkins. As the economic downturn hits, each and every expenditure has to be checked with the committee in charge. Decisions are caught behind walls of bureaucracy, to the embarrassment of Jenkins and frustration of Pitt.This is Pitt's film through and through, from his superstar entrance accompanied by Johnny Cash's The Man Comes Around to the intensity of the finale. Jackie is a somewhat familiar man out of step with his time, disenchanted with the excess and stupidity of the people he has to work with. It's frequently a quiet performance but commanding, projecting the controlled power of the character without ever slipping into cliché.The small cast is mostly peopled by character actors ? Ray Liotta gets more to play with here than he has in years and Sam Shepard barely gets a look in. Jenkins is a delight while James Gandolfini provides some crime family credibility.Next to Pitt, it's the duo of Scott McNairy and Ben Mendelsohn who you'll spend the most time with and they do a great job of toeing the line between being likeably dense yet still expendable. Mendelsohn goes for broke as a grimy antipodean addict and McNairy has the harder role as a character you almost hope will make it.Dominik forgoes the luminous Oscar nominated photography of Jesse James here in favour of dark and gritty lensing courtesy of Greig Fraser. The deeps blacks and rain wash the film into almost monochrome shades, highlighting the potential glint of a weapon in the darkness. The director also throws a couple of set pieces into the mix, including one heavily trailed hit that is rendered with all the slow motion style of a much bigger film and a visual highlight of the experience.But Killing Them Softly is not about murder, it's about the miserable fate of the underclass and the cycle of behaviour which keeps them there. It's contrasted again and again (perhaps too heavily) with the hopeful message of Obama amid the collapse of the global economy as the mob, an organisation where money was never an issue, penny pinch in their dealings with life and death.Andrew Dominik has crafted another classic with Killing Them Softly. More accessible than Jesse James and powered by a commanding performance from Pitt, it mixes dense, dark visuals with a curt humanism that sets it apart from others in the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Killing Them Softly' Review by Heavy Metal Mouth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Killing Them Softly is a new release from acclaimed yet unprolific director Andrew Dominik, the man behind gritty 2000 biopic ''Chopper'' and the critically lauded ''The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford'' in 2007. The huge gap between both previous films is unexplained, which is curious considering the wide praise both received. So upon Dominik's return to filmmaking 5 years later with Killing Them Softly, a gangland thriller which sees him reuniting with Brad Pitt, it would be natural to have high expectations. The large void which the gangster film genre is currently experiencing this century is easily understood- an exceptional list of films came from it, and since the likes of ''The Godfather'' I &amp; II, ''Goodfellas'', ''Pulp Fiction'', ''Scarface'' and groundbreaking HBO drama ''The Sopranos'', most would feel it is territory that has been covered, sealed and shut. And so 12 years since the millennium, it would seem that with the exception of Martin Scorcese's ''The Departed'' in 2006, we haven't experienced a 21st century gangster classic, leaving the market wide open and perhaps meaning that the timing of Killing Them Softly has been quite shrewd. So, how does it hold up in comparison to what has come before? Well, mostly it doesn't, and mainly because Killing Them Softly takes a very different approach to the crime genre, with mixed results.Set in New Orleans, the story follows a heist gone wrong, as hopeless criminal junkies Frankie and Russell (played by Scoot McNairy and the wonderful Ben Mendelsohn) stick up a big time card game with disastrous concequences. Wrongly suspected of involvement with the robbery is Markie Trattman, portrayed by Ray Liotta, while professional hit-man Jackie Cogan (Brad Pitt) is drafted in to get answers and deal with those responsible for the missing money. Pitt is his usual self and puts in an assured central performance which holds the film together from start to finish, while Mendelsohn's turn as the despicable Russell is tragic yet hilarious. Another impressive performance comes in the shape of James Gandalfini, who successfully shakes himself of the shadow of Tony Soprano while portraying a heartbroken, alcoholic hit-man who seems more interested in drinking himself into a coma instead of the job at hand. Liotta, however, feels under used and Richard Jenkins' screen time is also brief and underwhelming.While the film is successful in it's stylish, refreshing attitude and contains an undeniably brilliant cast, the pacing of Killing Them Softly is it's main problem, as it fails to ever really lift off the ground and hit full power. Fans expecting action will be disappointed; Killing Them Softly is as laid back as the gangster genre gets, and it's best features are in it's witty, clever dialogue and the underlying political message which is carried throughout in the form of Barack Obama and George Bush's constant radio and television presence, which ties in skillfully with the money obsessed criminals in the failing economic climate of New Orleans.In stark contrast to Dominik and Pitt's last collaboration (which many found to be overlong and impossibly slow), Killing Them Softly is short and sweet at just 97 minutes and doesn't outstay it's welcome, but while some would complain of it's limited running time, there was no need for it to be any longer.Overall, while Killing Them Softly will never compete with modern crime classics such as ''The Departed'', the unusual style it encorporates makes it memorable in its own right and it deserves to be seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Killing Them Softly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, do you want to spend some time with Louisiana lowlifes and mafia's underlings? Ray Liotta was in Goodfellas, so he'll always have a place at the table in movies about criminals associated with whatever city Mafioso exist in whatever settings they're located. He portrays a man named Markie who orchestrated the theft of a poker game featuring mobsters, admitted to it in laughing jest with others at a separate game (the members in attendance weren't part of that initial theft, but still, what a dumbass admittance), and pretty much stigmatizes himself in the process. Johnny "Squirrel" Amato (Vincent Curatola) runs a small-time cleaners, convincing an ex-con named Frankie (Scoot McNairy) to find a partner as he plans to use them to rob another poker game, understanding Markie will be implicated as the one responsible. Frankie chooses (and, to his detriment, he selects the worst possible partner you could think of) a heroin addict named Russell (Ben Mendelsohn) who isn't selective in who (or what) he bangs (there's a delightful conversation about sex with goats and dogs). The two do pull off the heist and Markie is obviously stunned by it. But Russell goes off with a "buddy" named Kenny (Slaine) to sell stolen dogs in Florida and admits (probably while wasted) his involvement in the heist. Obviously Kenny can't keep this to himself and so he informs a hit-man named Jackie (Brad Pitt), and the dominos fall as they may. Jackie meets periodically with a "go-between" for the mafia of whatever dump Louisiana city this film is set in (which looks like a toilet bowl in many of the scenes shot) played by Mr. Reliable Character Actor, Richard Jenkins, who looks like a corporate stooge that was plucked from a board meeting. That was the point, I guess, that mafia business is corporate, affected by the economic crisis just like any other business, needing to pay for hit men at a specific reduced rate due to the recession. Look, you can doll this movie up with glossy cinematography, have slow motion smoke and the perspective from a dope-head going in and out of his heroin-induced high, but "Killing Them Softly" is still just Brad Pitt killing three people for Louisiana mafia in some city rotting at its core. You can have pretty boy Pitt, slicked back hair, slick looking shades, and Bogarting cigarettes, looking cool and smoothly going through his lines with the typical confidence afforded him. Even if he's a cool cretin, he's still a cretin. He can work people, and Pitt knows how to eliminate targets so that his employers are happy. That's what he does without fail. He's damn good, too, and kills without a hint of guilt or doubt; when he shoots Squirrel, he doesn't flinch, setting off a shot that downs the guy instantly, later putting another into him, and, in turn, silencing him. Then, after Jackie has successfully manipulated Frankie into believing he's safe from harm for aiding him in the murder of Squirrel, there's a few bullets waiting to splatter his brains all over the place. Again, Pitt's Jackie is good at killing people. He is a psychopath that without this profession, I imagine Jackie would continue to murder because it's in his DNA.Ultimately, Killing Them Softly will probably be best remembered for the brutal, heavily stylized gun down of Markie, in all its slow-motion bullets, broken glass, and blood. It's damned impressive, I gotta say, with Liotta's body still in the car as it drives accidentally into oncoming traffic, the windows shattering (his head even smacks the windshield), and there's an emphasis on Pitt's gun ejecting shells, pop-pop-pop, in the rain. It was as if the director wanted to offer his own John Woo moment. All that's left besides this is spending time with scum, and I have no desire really to listen to a pathetic hit-man in the form of James Gadolfini (he has two conversation scenes with Pitt, one in some lounge, another in a hotel room) going on and on about hookers he has bedded, and how he's due to go to prison for being caught with a shotgun in the truck as he was going geese hunting with a friend in Maryland. Galdofini's Mickey was a choice by Pitt to take out Squirrel. But Mickey is just too alcoholic and his gluttony of self-pity, acknowledging that an upcoming divorce might be in the cards further promises a decline. So Jackie will just have Mickey arrested and sent back to New York for leaving the state illegally. Yes, Jackie is not a nice guy. A lot of Jackie's moments are spent in cars with Jenkins, talking over their situation regarding the three needing to be killed (and what to do to Markie). We see that, through their mouthpiece, Jenkins, that the mafia aren't as bloodthirsty as we are accustomed in Martin Scorsese mobster films. The mafia would prefer not to kill Markie, but Jackie insists he must be put down, as if he were a diseased dog or a horse no longer of value, needing to be eliminated so that business in illegal gambling halls behind closed doors could continue. Add lots of coverage of the economic downturn and Obama's rise to the Presidency, with a closing monologue by Pitt describing how he feels about America, the whole idea that we are one nation together (it's every man for himself, Jackie believes), and especially about his disdain for Thomas Jefferson. There's a cool spot where Pitt walks through a fireworks celebration of Obama's victory, and the director loves experimenting with how to shoot Pitt and Jenkins in his car. To me, this is just nothing special. Spending way too long with Frankie and Russell, two really skuzzy individuals from the wrong side of the tracks, doesn't exactly help matters, either. Maybe fans of Trainspotting might dig them, though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The criminal world functions in a compromised, but still logical way, while the American financial system goes insane.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my second favorite American film of 2012 (after "The Master"). I'm not at all surprised it flopped at the box office- it offers little that mainstream Hollywood consumers go to a star vehicle for. It's a "crime film" that's not trying to be suspenseful, but rather to illustrate that the world of organized crime is not actually exciting, but repetitive. Crooks get money, at varying levels, live it up, at varying levels, and then get taken down, with varying degrees of brutality. Organized crime is, then, only a particularly dramatic example of the boom and bust cycle of capitalism. It's an entirely political film, entirely a commentary on the moment of its setting- the American election and bank bail-out of 2008, that manages to simultaneously seem timeless and universal. Two Beckett-ian fools rob real criminals (who are also fools) and have a few days of drug-and-hooker-fueled bliss. They are, of course, sitting ducks for Jackie, a thoughtful professional killer who wants to think of himself as a nice guy- he tries to cause no more pain than is necessary for the world he lives in. Jackie tries to restore order to the criminal enterprises of still-devastated post-Katrina New Orleans, but is beset by sniveling mafia-bureaucrats whose "humane" intentions only cause unnecessary suffering. If this does not seem absurd enough, the workings of the "criminal" world are contrasted with news reports of the "legitimate" political world, where the banker-crooks whose stupidity and greed brings the system to its knees are not killed or punished, but bailed out by the state, who appropriated the tax-payer's money to keep a cabal of criminals billionaires. America is a business, the film declares, but one that has ceased to be a logical or functional one, the mafia serving as a faded, but still favorable, comparison. This business stays afloat only through the most insipid pretension of change- Obama- a pretension it has relied on since the days of Jefferson to preserve liberal-democratic stasis.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know, I had mixed feelings going into this one. After all, I don't usually buy into movies where we are supposed to take Brad seriously. I like his playful borderline comedic roles, like Aldo Raine. However this caught my attention when I first saw the previews for the film. Welcome Back Ray Liotta, even though you never officially left, there were a few roles where it made me wonder if Vice City cheapened you a bit, but this movie brought back any credibility you lost. The Roles in this movie honestly speak for the diversity of its actors, and the cinematography was just a treat. There were some very detailed sequences such as when they kill off Liotta's character that had me wondering if they were CG I. Special effects in this film are top notch. Overall, about the only parts that I didn't enjoy would have to be some of the Dialogue, that of James Gandolfini which just seems to drag on and fill up space in the movie, other than that, the violence is violent, the cinematography is spot on, and its unlike any crime film I have ever seen! 8 out of 10 stars!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Half a Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As stated in previous reviews, Killing Them Softly starts good and looks good but after the meeting with Mickey the movie seems to be written by different script writers and starts to fail.As a point in note - it doesn't take someone with too much perception to realise the glasses at the restaurant Mikey is drinking from change not only quantity of liquid in them, but the set designers couldn't even remember how many beers, or cocktails where on the table between any 2 camera shots. This alone (which required me to skip back 30 seconds just so that I could believe what my eyes were telling me) was enough to warrant nothing more than a 5 star rating.Another annoyance was Mikey's character doesn't even do anything other than fill in 30 minutes of boring dialogue that serves nothing to the story and has no point except to give the whole reason of the title of the movie - which Jackie doesn't even stick to, so even less reason Mikey's character should even be in the movie.The movie seems short, and at the end of the movie you get the feeling that you missed half the movie, or the scrip writers had half a movie and filled the rest in with Mikey's dialogue scenes.Really it's just a badly written movie that had potential.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting artistic movie with some obvious metaphors about economy crisis in the USA</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The premise of the movie is simple enough, basically it's a crime story about unorganized crime. Some guys decide to rob a local criminal gambling place. Everything goes according to plan but one of them could not keep his mouth shut so they have contract on their heads. After them is Jackie (excellent Brad Pitt), a pragmatic and cynical killer who tries to solve problems the simplest way possible. His tactic is to make his victims at ease so they don't suspect anything and then he kills them off, which is very scary and chilling. The movie is made very artistically with slow motion and excellent music. In the background of many scenes we hear optimistic speeches of American president which is shown as a contrast to a bleak reality in which people live. It is all very obvious and sometimes heavy-handed but done nicely. We see that all levels of the society are affected by the economy crisis, even the underworld. In the end we don't have any solution or resolution, only thing achieved is revenge against the perpetrators of robbery. Probably the only possible outcome within a corrupt and brutal (economy/state) system.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a killer movie, but it did shoot away some very entertaining moments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Punning these words with my fingers (one time, two time), Writing my review with these words (one time, two time), "Killing Them Softly" with his gun, "Killing Them Softly" with his guuuuuun. OK, that is enough of being a Fugee or a Flack. I thought I catch your attention with a little play on words of that infamous song within my review of the crime-drama "Killing Them Softly". The movie stars Brad Pitt as Jackie, an enforcer hired to restore order after three dumb guys rob a Mob protected card game, causing the local criminal economy to collapse. The movie is set in 2008, during the economic crisis (that is still around, isn't it?); so the film depicts that the economic national crisis does affect also the criminal society of America, poor guys. Andrew Dominick did not kill me with excitement with his direction of the picture, but it was solid enough for me to softly get engaged within the developing narrative. The same could also be said of his screenplay. Pitt continues his impressive acting streak with another excellent performance, here as Jackie. I will insert the impressive supporting acting performances of "Killing Them Softly" as bullet-points, but I think I ran out of bullets. Anyways, those include Scott McNairy and Ben Mendehlson as the dumb criminals who rob the card game, James Gandolfini as a depressed hit-man (yea, he is good at playing that), and Richard Jenkins as a mob lawyer. The film's cinematography excelled in showing the gloomy look of the time. Even though it is not always on target, I did enjoy the experience of "Killing Them Softly". **** Good</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is kind of good because Brad Pitt acts so well, the other actors are decent, but the plot, oh my god the plot, the plot is killing the viewer so softly that in the end you can say ...if i didn't know from the begging that Brad Pitt acted in here i would let this movie rest without me after 10 minutes....on a blank screen. Why does the plot is so lame? because a bum who takes care of stolen dogs takes part in the action and you can say that in the 1 hour of the movie he is the main character,and the chef of the bums is working at a cloth store, there are 2 funny moments, but thats all. I think, in conclusion that the studios that made this movie hadn't enough money to pay Pitt and also support a real plot or at least a story without stupid bum gangsters or a gangster who works in a cloth washing (director or something). i will give it 6.5 for Pitt....</fullReview>

Some good sequences, good score, an exquisite Brad Pitt as a cold blooded, meticulous and unconcerned hired killer,and above all a sooo slow movie. But remember folks, that five years ago, the director Andrew Dominic already gave us a sloooowww western, THE ASSASSINATION OF JESSE JAMES BY THE COWARD ROBERT FORD, a very interesting feature, although. Yes there is much, much talking in this movie, it looks like a Tarantino style. I have never read the George Higgins - the author of FRIENDS OF EDDY COYLE - novel, and probably never will. In the same kind of topic - the searching and destroying mission in order to punish the takers of a card game - I far from that preferred GONIN, back in 2001, and starring Takeshi Kitano, as the ruthless and totally offbeat killer. But this one is not a bad movie, not as bad as many guys told.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just okay. Killing them softly is a film which mixes a social message with a story. Brad Pitt's character is a trouble shooter for mob problems. Everything, in the movie's story is a means to fixing money problems. Pitt's character is mechanical, and cold. There are two types of characters in the movie: smart people (players), and stupid people (victims). The movie is artfully mixed with Obama's speeches. The movie's dialogue slows down the movie. I believe the movie's dialogue shows the stupidity of certain characters. The dialogue of the stupid is painful to listen to. Stupid does not survive is the thesis. The smart characters understand the game and explain how the game is played. Pitt's character explains at the end of the movie that Obama is a package good with is part of the game. The game is money. The story is dark, and gloomy. The movie is hard to watch in spots. I believe the director deliberately made the movie hard to watch. I give the movie a six out of ten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Killing Them Softly" is a character driven story. The actors established their character at the beginning of the film, but one character falls short at the end. This was a really well put together film, at least before it came to a conclusion. I felt that the film was incomplete. At the last minutes of the story the character that developed himself as a remorseful hit man (hence the title's name) that after killed many citizens, ruins his character at the end. I think If they added another 13 minutes at the end by showing Jackie killing the character that should be punish for his actions (you will see if you watches the movie) would make me very satisfied. Overall, this is a great movie for the fans that enjoys excellent acting. But if you are looking a movie with lots of action, this isn't the movie for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As relentless and unforgiving as its characters.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Andrew Dominik's new film is as cynical, fierce and explicit as his previous film, The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, was ethereal and poetic. Based on a 1974 crime novel, Dominik updates the story to 2008, amidst a changing political atmosphere with a newly elected president and the rising fear of a nationwide recession. Dominik's clever ploy here is to utilize the mafia plot as a metaphor for the politics.What raises this material above the average crime drama is the cast, sensational in all roles. Brad Pitt leads as Jackie, a cool and collected hit-man who prefers to kill his victims softly, without any emotional interference. Pitt is terrific in this role, able to carry his scenes and convince us of the twisted philosophy of his character. Equally good is Richard Jenkins as the representation of the opposition, Ray Liotta as a sympathetic gambler and the great James Gandolfini as perhaps the best character in the film, a past-his-prime hit-man now living according to the whims of his hedonistic lifestyle. The scenes between the portly Gandolfini and the lean, ruthless Pitt crackle in their dialogue and drama, elevating what lacks in the rest of the film.Many of the negative attributes of this film stem from Dominik's style of shooting and framing, which leaves practically nothing to the imagination. Indeed, the word subtle is almost an ironic commentary as the film is filled with graphically violent kill-shots, including one following the trajectory of a slow-motion bullet killing a man in the head. Seemingly, Dominik is trying to explore the crime world as a different film would explore the political world. It works to a degree, but it is understandable why many would be turned off by its extreme style.In the end, what remains is the strong ensemble acting and the flashy directing which in many ways is obtrusive and distracting but at the same time fits with the edgy atmosphere and setting. All in all, this is a mixed bag but worth it if only to see this group of actors together in one film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic directing, an average crime story and enough political preaching to make you ill and you have Killing Them Softly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie that wants to be more than it ever can be. In the end I think the movie wanted to be two films, yet both have deep flaws. First lets talk about the political movie its trying to be. Critics and movie-goers have been claiming the political message is a bit heavy handed, this is the understatement of the year. We hear Bush's voice, Obama's voice and various commentators from radios and TV's so many times throughout the film that when it kept happening I could do nothing but roll my eyes. There were literally multiple scenes that end it just the camera centered on a TV with Barack Obama or George Bush speaking on it. The opening sequence alone is enough to make any film lover nervous for what they are about to experience. I had very high hopes and wanted to like this movie, but the blatant political agenda of the film completely damaged the more subtle political implications the film could have had on the viewer. The final speech at the end of the movie also could have been great, and although it was entertaining, no one really wants political advice from murderous gangsters. (views on founding fathers and America)The second movie it's trying to be is much better than the political movie but still it is only an average gangster film that falls short due to unimportant and underdeveloped characters. Brad Pitts character is by far the most interesting but even he fails to become a three dimensional character until the very last scene. We have all seen the story before, job goes wrong and the heavies come to make it right. It is really nothing new and although the slow motion scenes were fun and the music reminded us Of Tarantino or Scorsese, it was still a film that feels as if its reaching for what it couldn't acquire. Sum It Up: The obnoxiously overbearing political approach is incredibly off putting which makes Killing Them Softly ultimately another frustrating movie because we know it could have been so much more. Some scenes play out brilliantly but are only shattered in the next few minutes as we nearly choke on the political matter and meet another character that doesn't really matter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fable, allegory, parody</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Five years ago, the movie world was quite impressed with Brad Pit's 3-hour artsy project with a title that is a mouthful "The assassination of Jesse James by the coward Robert Ford". Set more than a century later (in 2008), "Killing them softly" is nevertheless also a gangster movie. Considerably less artsy and taking only half the running time of "Jesse James", this one is more accessible to the general public. And then of course, there are those who would love to see Pitt even when he only whispers one word: "inevitable"! With the pain-sticking display throughout the movie of speeches by Obama and Bush (and McCain), on both radio and television, it is difficult to argue against this movie being a fable, an allegory or a parody of some sort. Exactly what sort is left to the audience's own imagination. The year is 2008, and we all know what happened in the US in that year.The entire movie takes place either at night or on a dull, grey day, mostly in a desolate part of city that may as well be New Orleans. There is not a single speck of sunshine to be seen. This reinforces the mood that in turn reinforces the messages. While on mood, the movie is livened by period pop songs going as far back as "Windmills on your mind" in the late 60s, not to mention the titular chart no. 1 in the early 70s. One way this movie feel artsy is the conversations. The characters played by Pitt (a top-notch professional assassin) and Richard Jenkins (an underworld arranger) carry out a series of conversations in a car throughout the movie, conversation that bounces at will between philosophical and pragmatic. Another series pitches Pitt against James Gandolfini who plays a New York based assassin flown in to share the job. Through these conversations that take place first in a restaurant, then later in a hotel room, it is revealed that the New York hit man is over-the-hill.Be not mislead, though. Conversations notwithstanding, "Killing" has it fair share of blood, but with a pinch of mischievous black humour. On scene has Ray Liotta playing a minor mobster beaten to pulp. There is also an absolutely delicious sequence on a conversation between Ben Mendelsohn and Scoot McNairy, two "kids" (rookie petty criminals) both high on drugs. The camera beautifully alternate between the POV of these characters (another way of saying "a blur") and how they look to the sober audience. Simply delightful! I realize I haven't said much about the plot. Believe me, there is one, and believe me, that is not essential for the enjoyment of the movie. It is not for everyone but those with a sense of humour and an appetite for the weird will be rewarded.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A worthwhile but lengthy watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to watch the movie with a lot of reservation due to the mixed response to the film.Nevertheless, I had high expectation as it had a strong cast and a great director to its credit.The movie plunged straight away into the plot with many attention grabbing scenes. The excellent cinematography of the movie is to be praised. But as the movie proceeded, it paved way to confusion and disappointment. There was a lot of talk in the movie, which promised great scope for action but frustrated you with a never ending wait. The second half of the movie was slightly better with great acting from McNairy and Pitt. For people with patience the climax of the movie was worth the wait. The last fifteen minutes of movie excellently summarized the present economic situation and the attitude of the people towards the society. The dialogue points out how each person has to look out for himself and not be weakened by emotional attachments in the present world.The disappointment in the second half was solely due to the character of Gandolfini. This particular character has very little relevance to the story and from the first moment of his appearance till the end keeps on blabbering about things completely irrelevant to the plot. The main hurdle for the viewer will be to sit through this excruciatingly boring half an hour. The purpose of the character and the reason for his inclusion in script is totally unclear.To summarize, for a person with lot of time at his disposal the movie is a satisfactory watch if you have the patience to sit through all the jibber jabber till the excellent climax. But for others it is a disappointing watch which has wasted an excellent star cast with a script that goes wild in the middle but comes together only for the last half an hour</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Brad Pitt re-teams with Andrew Dominik and they cannot recreate the magic they had last time the two worked together" When I heard that Brad Pitt would be doing another film with "The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford" I was excited to see if the this film would how good the former was. Premering at Cannes earlier this year Killing Them Softly tells the story of Jackie Cogan a professional enforcer who must investigate a heist that occurs during a high stakes game of poker. This heist is performed by Frankie (Scoot McNairy) and Russell (Ben Mendelsohn), then the two are hunted for which also introduces other characters such as Markie Trattman (Ray Liotta) the person running these poker games, Driver (Richard Jenkins) who enlists Jackie and also Mickey (James Gandolfini) a partner brought in to work with Jackie who also has his own personal problems that Jackie notices very early on.Based on the 1974 novel "Cogan's Trade" Dominik has made this telling of the story more modern by rather setting it in the seventies which it should be in, instead he sets it in modern day with videos and recordings of Obama and Bush playing in the background making sure we know it is about the problems the government had around the time when Obama started his presidency. Some of the characters in this film feel very messed up as they continue to take drugs and mess around to much almost ruining their lives and in other cases ending their lives. The film uses voice-over very well at times but other times I felt they needed to cut down on it. They seemed to be using it to explain some plot holes that would have existed if they did not do that, so that was smart of Dominik.Brad Pitt playing the central character felt underused at times and just their to play his cool wild self he has played many times on the screen, I was excited to see him because of his work last year but I was underwhelmed by Pitt who did the best with an easy role. James Gandolfini doesn't appear in the movie near the end and with two scenes felt like a character I would have like to see more even though I felt he did not get a satisfying end. Ray Liotta was good but that's just the way he portrayed it. Scoot McNairy and Ben Mendelsohn were fine but I found their characters very hard to watch even though they were important to the story.I thought this film suffered most from the fact that on a political front it did not choose a side which I felt it should have. Also the use of political speech's felt overdone and unnecessary. I think if they film was set in 70's like written it may have worked better as political period piece but being in modern time I felt very personal towards the political aim the film try's to capture.MOVIE GRADE: C+ (MVP: Brad Pitt)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Predictable gangster film with Pitt on auto pilot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brad Pitt stars in this run of the mill gangster revenge flick, distinguished only by a couple of imaginative cinematic flourishes, and an interesting sound track.Pitt plays an enforcer, hired by the Mob to restore order after three amateurs hit a Mob organised card game. That's pretty much it plot wise.Killing Them Softly does have it's moments, the slow motion sequence when the Ray Liotta gets whacked is effective, and the film has an interesting look, with a washed out colour palette accompanied by an off-beat sound track. It also attempts some character development, with long dialogue sequences, but these lack the sparkle and wit to hold the viewers attention.The film is set in 2008, (though it's more like a 70&#x2032;s movie in feel) against the back drop of the Obama first inauguration and it seems to want to draw a comparison between the new Presidents "Audacity of Hope" and "One Nation" message, with the crime ridden reality of many of America's large cities, but this is never really explored or developed in any depth.Performance wise, Brad Pitt puts in yet another completely forgettable appearance, mumbling through his lines, and seemingly content to just look cool in his aviators and leather jacket. James Gandolfini plays, what else, a hood who can't hold it together to complete the revenge hits. The more interesting performances come from the two amateur robbers, played by Scoot McNairy and Australian actor Ben MendelsohnKilling Them Softly does have one redeeming feature ? it't doesn't feature that god awful song from Roberta Flack</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Felt Like The Season Premiere Of A TV Show</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie literally felt like a 90 minute episode of a TV series on HBO. As a movie I felt it was paced horribly. Although it had beautiful cinematography and great acting, I feel the plot (at it's core) was dry. It could've been a wonderful movie even though it was extremely cliché. There's only so much you can really do with : idiots rob mob. Mob seeks revenge. Hit-man character development. Also, the political crap was completely unnecessary. In conclusion, I think this would make an amazing first episode of a TV series. If the producers were smart they'd invest in it. As a stand alone movie, it was decent. Worth a watch. Definitely not twice.See some truly scary stuff&gt; www.youtube.com/EclipseProductions89</fullReview>

		<fullReview>was looking forward to seeing this and with such a cast I thought it could not go wrong....but it did, it was ordinary to say the least. Poor quality left field dialogue through out, as if the actors were simply asked to improvise. I had a chuckle when i read some reviews stating you need to be an intellectual to get the drift of this sorry piece of filmaking. Some of those types of reviews are actually sillier than the movie. I would imagine Brad will look back on this one with some trepidation. Gandolfo must have cringed at his script but put his hand out for the pay check never the less. And Mendleson another fav actor of mine doing his best with the limited material. There is only one director I can think of that has set the bar for unassociated banter and that is Tarantino and this movie is a poor copy in that area.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No heroes, no twists, purposefully predictable: Not enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the initial robbery, you can pretty much guess what will happen and then just watch it slowly happen.There are no heroes or plot twists. The mood of this movie is dark, depressed and degenerate, which is at times contrasted with Obama's speeches about hope and unity. The events of the movie seem to simply be a backdrop to a larger point it's making about current American society through conversations between various criminals and clips of political speeches by presidents Bush and Obama. I watched the movie because it had received such high praise (on average), but I didn't find it particularly engaging or intellectually stimulating.I'm giving it 4/10 instead of 1/10 because it was well-acted, well-produced, with some powerful lines had they been delivered in an otherwise better movie, and because they at least tried something a little different with this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mob flick with a kick to the gut</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Andrew Dominik returns with a hard hitting masterpiece based around the deprived American criminal underworld. Killing Them Softly moves away from the traditional 'gangster flicks' by depicting this brutal lifestyle as unglamorous and much harder to succeed in. Dominik teams up with Brad Pitt once more, who gives another superb performance as Jackie, the middle man between the suits and the street level criminals. Pitt isn't alone in giving a great performance however, the acting throughout is realistic, subdued, and at times, frightening. James Gandolfini is excellent as the drunk and troubled assassin, Ray Liotta gives his best performance since Goodfellas, and Richard Jenkins is cast perfectly as the modern day 'gangster'.Dominik does a fabulous job of adapting and updating George V. Higgins 1974 crime novel Cogan's Trade. The dialogue is witty and intelligent, and the movie is paced perfectly, it's slow but there is no need to rush. This pace gives the audience a chance to understand each character in depth, as if we had our nose in a novel. The Laurel and Hardy criminal double act of Frankie and Russell (Scott McNairy and Ben Mendelsohn) provide the audience with an added break of comical mishaps, but their characters are much more than that. They generate the contrast between the rich and poor, which is a reoccurring theme throughout this movie. The undercurrent of Killing Them Softly is one of political (un)fairness, set during the 2008 US presidential election, and the outbreak of the financial collapse. Dominik decides to add another layer to the movie that is much more real and frightening to everyday movie goers, which embarks on a mission to show gangsters aren't just drug pushers on the street, but upper-class white Americans in suits. We have seen this link between the criminal underbelly of America and politicians in cinema before, however Dominik brings this theme right up-to-date. This slow undercurrent of Obama, Bush and McCain speeches that are heard and seen throughout the movie explodes into life and relevance right at the end, with a magnificent monologue delivered by Pitt.This movie is a must see and a chance to experience the extraordinary talent of the finest writer/director of his new generation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Constant smoking, some heavy drinking, serious drug use, endless foul language, some whoring, a terribly brutal beating. Oh, several violent murders. be warned - this is a heavy gangster movie. But it has real style, some superb acting, and a message of sorts.Australian writer and director Andrew Dominik, who worked with Brad Pitt on "The Assassination Of Jesse James By the Coward Robert Ford", has teamed up with Pitt again to film the 1974 novel "Cogan's Trade" by George V Higgins. Pitt is terrific as the hit-man Jackie Cogan who doesn't like to get too close to his victims physically or emotionally so that he can kill them 'softly'. Ray Liotta, James Gandolfini and Richard Jenkins are familiar faces in a gangster world, but the support roles are well-executed as well. All of the characters here are "Goodfellas" but none of them are good fellows - if you get my meaning - and yet the viewer can't help having some sympathy with some of this criminal dis-fraternity.Dominik has made his film something of a political commentary by setting it in the run-up to the US presidential election of 2008 and the financial fiasco of that period with the non too subtle suggestion that greed and criminality are as prevalent in the banks as on the streets of the US of A. In case the viewer missed the analogy, the Cogan character makes the comment in the final scene that "America is not a county. It's a business." Good point - and violently made. Not as cool as "Drive" but still a darned good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Soft focus, kind of, soft centred, indeed, killing? Maybe not as muchas one would expect.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall. this felt like an Elmore Leonard short story that had been kicked in the head by a Jim Thompson character. Not necessarily a bad thing, to be honest. Which is what most of the characters in this movie think that they are doing i.e. being honest. That's weird, because they are all so thoroughly dishonest, untrustworthy, broken down, or devoid of feeling. It's a movie of contrasts, of moods and methods and mania and madness, that snaps you back into attention by some tough scenes. It's also a classic three-scene sketch, that does each section with aplomb and imagination.You're rewarded with a very inventive reveal scene between the stooges, you'll see some some very good performances, as well as some great, although maybe basic characters... it doesn't mess about but it does make the most of what it does have.We're still talking about how it ended and who did what, which is always a good sign. I thought Scoot McNairy and Ben Mendelsohn were superb as the odd couple, and they probably made the film for me. The political backdrop wasn't really overplayed and added to the fun, little reference in speech to "Councillor", for eg, said a lot. Even Brad's soliloquy at the end added a nice little finish.Pulp Fiction without the polish perhaps? Or Elmore Leonard in the gutter? Dysfunctional people doing funny (and sometimes horrible) things would probably sum it up. What happened to Dillon though?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like watching paint dry....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those films that has everything going for it; but somehow just falls short on execution. This Andrew Dominik written and directed film has an all-star cast featuring the likes of Brad Pitt, Ray Liotta, and James Gandolfini; however, it's long on talk and very little in the way of action. Running a total of 97 excruciating minutes, this film is just one step up better than a trip to the dentist office.Brad Pitt is Jackie Cogan, an enforcer brought in by the organized crime syndicate to investigate a recent hold up of an 'organized' poker room. As it turns out, this particular poker room is being run by Markie Trattman (Ray Liotta), a guy who once hired two thugs to hold up his own establishment in the past. The two guys, who are hired to pull off this recent poker room heist, are two certified losers, Frankie (Scoot McNairy) and Russell (Ben Mendelsohn). Though the heist was a success and no one at the crime scene was able to identify the two felons, stupidity reigns supreme as Jackie (Pitt) is quickly able to identify all the key players involved in the recent heist. After all the dots are connected, all that remains is doling out the consequences? all of which needs to be cleared by the syndicate first.The issue with this film is that it progresses like watching paint dry. Most of the film (at least 50%) are conversations of Jackie (Pitt) and Richard Jenkins (syndicate negotiator) sitting in a car talking about what events need to happen. When Jackie decided another hit-man is needed to dole out mob justice, Mickey (James Gandolfini) is called in from New York. Why? Why? Why would this film bother to bring in 'Tony Soprano' then have him act like some punk-ass bitch???? All of his scenes are long, drawn out conversations which drone on for hours and hours, and in the end? NOTHING IS ACCOMPLISHED, RESOLVED, or VENDICATED!!!!! The audience has been forced to sit threw a 30 minute conversation about a hooker in Florida, and in the end, Jackie has to do the hit himself anyways? Some really good writing there Dominik?. NOT!!!!!! To make a long story short, Andrew Dominik had a 30-minute film in which he was able to add another 67 minutes of fluff and filler in order to extend his featurette into a full length film. I do not recommend seeing this film. This film is quite agonizing to endure. However, if you are into movies that feature endless nonsensical chatter / repartee regarding the sale of stolen dogs; how good/bad sex is with prostitutes; or a plethora of CNN archive news footage of the Obama/McCain 2008 election campaign? then this movie has your name written all over it!!!! However, if this is not your cup of tea, then I would forgo seeing this latest Brad Pitt venture.See more of my reviews on FB @ "The Faris Reel"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A waste of superior cast. If you have been waiting for a good mob movie, this is not it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How can you take such superior cast - Pitt, Gandolfini, Jenkins, Liotta, Shepard etc. and make this nonsense? This is not 1/10th of a good mob movies from the 90s, like Good Fellas or Reservoir Dogs. You're better off watching one of those again.There is a lot of pointless blabber in the movie, pointless really. Like the conversation between Pitt and Jenkins in the car or the one between Gandolfini and Pitt in the bar or restaurant. I guess they did not have real script to work with, otherwise that kind of nonsense would have been edited out. I can't believe Pitt let his name be associated with this flop.And it was very annoying to have a radio or TV on in the background (during the heist at the card game, in the car, at the bar etc.) There is nothing to indicate that crime shown in this movie is in anyway or form associated with the current socioeconomic circumstances. The fact is that people who want to take shortcuts always pay in the end, like the two doofus and the squirrel in the movie. Bush and Obama have nothing to do with their plan and their ultimate demise, they would have ended that way even during the Clinton years.Don't be fooled by trailer; avoid this wannabe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bad economic times call for desperate measures in Andrew Dominik's third film. The Australian director best known for "Chopper" and "The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"; has crafted a serious crime film with a serious message adapted from George V. Higgins pulp novel "Cogan's Trade".The story starts with a robbery of a mob protected poker game by two thugs, its now up to hired enforcer Jackie Cogan (Brad Pitt) to investigate into the incident and restore order to the gangland while hope is lost with empty election promises broadcasted across America.This is a very masculine film strongly played out by the cast, also includes Richard Jenkins, James Gandolfini, Ben Mendelsohn, Scoot McNairy and Sam Shepard (although there are only two or three minor female cast members).Dominik stays true to Higgins' snappy dialogue in his script, what also works is the film's cinematic expression, poetically shot and character study. Its surprisingly entertaining when looking at the substantial elements played out in the film a country gone mad not improving even though trying to make it out on top is simply not easy, even when presidential elections show no new solutions to improve unbalanced lifestyles. This film may not be everyones cup of tea but I highly recommend it, Andrew Dominik is incredible to bring this picture to life. We'll see what the actual Americans think now their election is over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Set in a dilapidated New Orleans during the 2008 Presidential campaign; low rent criminal Johnny Amato (Vincent Curatola) hires Frankie (Scoot McNairy) and his junkie friend Russell (Ben Mendelsohn) to rob a back- room card game run by Markie Traftman (Ray Liotta). Markie is known to have staged a robbery on one of his past games, so the assumption is that he'll take the fall. Mob boss, Dillon (Sam Shepard) sends hit-man Jackie Cogan (Brad Pitt) to sort out the mess. Cogan meets with local mob representative Driver (Richard Jenkins) to discuss details and fees for the job. As Cogan is known to Amato, he brings in fellow hit-man Mickey (James Gandolfini) to take him out; Cogan will take out Frankie and Russell. It's a simple premise; however this film is anything but, it's a dark, cynical, violent and blackly humorous tale. Australian director Andrew Dominik focuses on character, giving each of his cast room to breathe, and they reward him with uniformly excellent performances. Pitt featured in Dominik's previous film, the beautiful The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (2007), one of my favourite films of the last decade. Ray Liotta is better than he's been in years, Richard Jenkins and Ben Mendelsohn good, James Gandolfini is excellent as the wounded, self-pitying hit-man, drowning his pain in alcohol and prostitutes, his profane speeches about his sexual prowess and broken marriage are both heartbreaking and sad. However, Scoot McNairy steals every scene he's in; he's wonderful as the nervous, twitchy Frankie, his miss-placed optimism at odds with his constant agitation at his friends and situation. For all the talk, and there's a lot of fantastic dialogue, this is a very violent film. Ray Liotta is subjected to a brutal beating that is as far removed from glamorised violence as it can get, at odds with the stylised, super slo-mo shooting that follows, almost fetishistic gun porn. The script, written by Dominik, is based on the 1974 novel Cogan's Trade by the late crime author George V. Higgins. I haven't read it, however, in updating the action from the 70's to coincide with the final days of Obama's race for the presidency is not lost on the audience. Obama's speeches of hope and the potential of the United States are at odds with the story unfolding on screen, the economic collapse, the miserable fate of the underclass and the repetitive cycle of behaviour which keeps them there, there is no hope for these characters. Not exactly subtle delivery, Dominik ensures we get the message. The film is shot in grimy, washed out tones, almost monochrome noir in a desolate, rain drenched New Orleans, as bleak and unwelcoming as the nameless city in David Fincher's SE7EN. This is muscular film-making; not for the faint hearted, but well worth a look, especially if you like your crime dramas of the hard-boiled variety.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Killing Them Softly up front seems like a male centric action film with guns and chases a d all that kinda stuff, however viewers will be quite surprised at just how much more this film has to offer. First off I will start by saying this is an ensemble effort, Brad Pitt may be the central character and on the poster but really this movie is an ensemble of great male actors all complimenting each other in every way possible, it's actually quite hard to pick which actor is the best in this movie, they're all so wonderful in their roles.The storyline is fast paced and easy to grasp, you never lose track and the film never out stays its welcome, it's actually probably a little too short in my opinion, but a movie that gets the story told with no plot holes in an hour and 30 minutes and still be good is very rare these days. People interested in gangster films like Casino or the like will enjoy this movie, it's kinda like a gangster movie light, not huge and over the top but small and still vicious... Brad Pitt is a bit of a champion to lend his big name to an otherwise small film, I think this movie will gain a very big audience thanks to him.If you're after an easy afternoon at the movies, check this one out, it's dark, it's funny, it's violent and it's excellently acted, I highly recommend this one. :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Killing Them Softly assembles a first-rate cast and is consistently potent in its style, but its writing and direction is where it encounters its gravest problems. We have the likes of Brad Pitt, Ray Liotta, James Gandolfini, Richard Jenkins, and Scoot McNairy, along with director Andrew Dominik of The Assassination of Jesse James By the Coward Robert Ford, which leads one to believe that we have a strong and viable mob drama on our hands. Unfortunately, we have a rather tedious, disappointing excursion awaiting us as we see that the product is combined of outdated mobster morals and lukewarm potboiler drama between its morosely captured characters.We open the movie with mobster Russell (Ben Mendelsohn) attempting to convince his boss to hire a lowlife junkie named Frankie (Scoot McNairy) to pull off an operation involving the holdup of an illegal poker game. With much hesitation, the boss allows Russell and Frankie to pull off the holdup, and the film follows up with a long, dry robbery which is held in a concise building where a number of men in suits have gathered to exchange words, drinks, and hands, all run by crime boss Markie (Ray Liotta). Not long ago, Markie silently staged to have his own poker game robbed and kept quiet about it for a period of time, until openly releasing his involvement over a night of drinks. The gang allowed him one pass, but the next robbery, the one the film opens with, will be counted as Markie's fault and his involvement will be assumed from the get-go.After this robbery, Jackie Cogan (Brad Pitt), a local hit-man, is hired to restore all mob order. He is brought in by Driver (Richard Jenkins), who tells him that Markie must now be whacked not because of his guilt or involvement, but so confidence and loyalty can be restored among its members. Jackie later informs people like Driver and Mickey (James Gandolfini) that he enjoys killing his victims softly, avoiding any last minute pleading, weeping, begging, or negotiating. He prefers shooting from a distance, so all feeling is omitted but all pride is obtained.So one could say the basic plot is a hit-man is hired to kill a mob member who has been shortchanging loyalty. I suppose, but at numerous points in this picture did I need to remind myself of that. Killing Them Softly stages numerous sets of dialog, lasting anywhere from a couple minutes to scenes like the opening heist that go on for roughly eight. Certain monologues and characters could've easily been left out, such as Gandolfini's Mickey, whose dialog exchanged with Jackie in his hotel room shows off nothing but his misogyny and his ability to give hookers foul and rancid sex tips.Pitt works well in roles of men that define character, wit, and self-reliance, and he makes Jackie into at very least a bearable hit-man. He shares the quality of having a cold, pessimistic outlook on life, but lacks the personality and the vibrancy of characters in, say, a Scorsese mob drama. All he has are the quotes and a script that gives him lines that make him no different than the other hit-man in films out there.One thing that Dominik attempts to concoct throughout the film, but doesn't adhere to it until the final monologue of the film is the idea that "America isn't a country; it's a business," talking about every man for themselves, that we work individually not as a community, and all of us should function as anti-corporate individuals. I have no problem with that ideology or the polar opposite one being portrayed in a film, but it's the treatment that fails it for me. This is pretty generic formula that was well alive in films like Goodfellas and even so far back as The Godfather; two pictures that chew up and spit this one out. Throughout the film we see scenes punctuated with news stations or billboards showing former president George W. Bush, 2008 Republican nominee John McCain, or current president Barack Obama either reminding us that America is in consistent turmoil or that our financial future will be restored under their presidency. The purpose of these clips is not announced until the final scene in the film, and never do we get a solid character opinion on the political system in America; which is odd considering we are bombarded with boring, irrelevant banter from mobster archetypes for roughly one hundred minutes.Killing Them Softly wants to showcase award-winning, renowned actors in a mob thriller. It also wants to show us how American politics have falsely and artificially reminded us we are united as one, when we all work with very different agendas. And it wants to show the sporadic conversations that can derail off course easily and never fully regain or pick up any traction. The point is I get it. I get what the film was trying to pull off. My problem is that it undermines the talent involved, and takes a simple, sufficient idea and makes it a lot preachier than need be, acts as if it's trying something new, and then gives us the atmosphere of the seventies, with grit and old-fashioned cars, but nudging it to fit current, rough, uncertain times.Starring: Brad Pitt, Richard Jenkins, James Gandolfini, Ray Liotta, Scoot McNairy, Ben Mendelsohn, and Sam Shepard. Directed by: Andrew Dominik.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The more I have thought about this movie after seeing it, the more impressive it has become</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You won't know if you like Killing Them Softly straight away. It's a modest, peculiar, crime drama that relies heavily on the complexity of its characterisation and socioeconomics, rather than a predictable romanticism about the underworld, followed by the inevitable fall from grace. The film is challenging. It asks more of its audience, but if you're willing to stay with it, it is both original and thought- provoking. The more I have thought about this movie after seeing it, the more impressive it has become. The film's unconventionality stems from its director, Andrew Dominik. He is a New Zealand-born but Australian- based filmmaker, who gave us the local biopic Chopper (2000) and then his first Hollywood production The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (2007). Throughout the development of Jesse James, Dominik fought the distributor Warner Bros. over the direction of the film, which saw him removed entirely from the editing process, and the film was largely reshaped without his input. The film was a box-office failure, and as a result this is the first film Dominik has made in five years. The previous loss of creative control and the importance of financial success, made this director weary of Hollywood's business model and the importance that it places on financial success. Dominik has taken these painful experiences of the dog-eat-dog world of Hollywood and injected them with self-reflection into his story and characters, opting to debunk the American Dream. Jackie's statement at the end of the film, that 'America is not a community, it's a business', epitomises the entirety of the film and the attitude of the characters. The value of money, in this criminal underworld, is placed infinitively higher than any moral trait or any human being or code of ethics. The film projects this through its context and its setting. It is set in New Orleans, with rain soaked streets and rundown buildings proving very atmospheric, and held at the start of the American economic crisis. Cleverly, the film captures the attitude of the recession, rather than being a transparent and simplistic metaphor for the crisis. If the card game is the American economy itself, then Frankie and Russell are the greed of Wall Street. They rob the game with everyone in the room, hoping to pin the blame on someone else and disappear, never thinking about the consequences. The robbery itself is a master class in tension and the film's best scene. It is extended to breaking point, making us dread that someone will be killed, yet it also draws a huge line in the sand too. A long uninterrupted tracking shot of both men exiting through a dark alley reflects the turning point in their lives, from when they had a chance to walk away from the money and then into a new period where it became more important than their own well-being and Markie's, who they hope will be blamed for the crime.The other mobsters are also representative of self-interest, strictly through business and finance. Jackie views murder not in sadistic terms but as a financial outlet from which he can survive. He has a cold detachment and callous nature towards other people's feelings: "They cry, they plead, they beg...Embarrassing. I like to kill them softly, from a distance." He kills people with maximum efficiency because he is not interested in any physical or emotional attachment, only his payment. This attitude is reflected in the soundtrack. Jackie is introduced very coolly, with the Johnny Cash song "When the Man Comes Around" playing. Cash's music was synonymous coming to terms with death, and in conjunction with Pitt's richly defined egotism, it heightens Jackie's presence as an angel of death for hire. There are two separate, seemingly unrelated scenes, which further help us to understand his character. The first is where Markie is pummelled senselessly on a rainy night by two thugs. Dominik doesn't cut away from the violence and the sound effects are deliberately amplified. We repeatedly see the blows smashing up his face as he vomits on the ground. Initially, I thought this was an ugly scene, almost unwatchable, and not without much purpose. However, the violence is actually used to enhance the film's ideology and characterisation. Dominik contrasts the beating with Jackie's execution, which is swift and precise. A slow-motion shot of the bullet, as it spheres through the back of a man's skull, shows Jackie's ruthless but also his professionalism, refusing to linger over the violence or making it personal. As rich and colourful as some of the characters are, there isn't a lot of attachment to these scumbags. This is inevitable and deliberate, but also problematic when the film rambles through some long, cryptic conversations and when geographically some of the characters go missing for long stretches. I'm also sceptical about Dominik's insistence that the film is a comedy too, in spite of a few funny quips. Regardless, enjoyment isn't a factor with stories and characters as unpleasant as this. It is about what new ideas can be conveyed about the crime world. It is a success in that regard because I have spent a great amount of time thinking about its sophisticated gallery of characters and performances, as well as the deep socioeconomic subtext that frames the story. I think I like it after all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You can do a whole lot worse than Killing Them Softly.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Killing Them Softly stars Brad Pitt and he's as brilliant as ever. Certainly not his best role, but defiantly a high quality one. The other actors do their part well also, such as James Gondolfini. The acting was great from them two in particular and everyone else was good too. Killing Them Softly won't sit well with a lot of people. I can understand that, but you have to at least appreciate it. The dialog was fantastically written, the action or shot-em-up scenes were superbly directed, as was the whole film in general, and they were also controlled and kept to a minimum. When it comes to these types of films in that genre you have to compare them to other films within the same genre, and it is no comparison to the likes of Goodfellas. But it does hold its own as a standalone film. The pacing is a bit slow at times and there are a few dull scenes, but all in all it is an enjoyable film. I liked the characters but I think they could've had a lot more done with them. The message of American economy and democratic society was good and well included. Especially the last few lines said by Brad Pitt, which really wraps up the whole point of the film. I think people felt disappointed because it's not some sort of all-action shoot em up, and it's better not being that way. As a film, which doesn't try and take itself too seriously and doesn't try and be pompous about it. You can do a whole lot worse than Killing Them Softly. It's worth a watch. A solid 7/10. So close to a 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some decent scenes, but nowhere near great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the release of director Andrew Dominik's third feature (following "Chopper" and "The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"), many critics are falling all over themselves to proclaim "Killing Them Softly" as one of the greatest crime/mob/hit-man films ever made.And while the movie clips along at a fairly decent pace (running time is only 97 minutes, almost unheard of for a modern feature), it nevertheless manages to slow to a crawl during several long periods of unnecessary dialogue, just as "The Assassination of Jesse James" had. It nonetheless makes a decent entry into the genre, as the picture - based on the George V. Higgins book - "Cogan's Trade," also does well to incorporate other movies such as "Pulp Fiction," "No Country For Old Men," "Goodfellas," "Colateral," "Seven Psychopaths," "Resevoir Dogs," "Driver" and "The Departed," among several others of this movie's ilk. Unfortunately, this particular effort cannot match the others it will no doubt be compared against.That is not to say this wasn't a stellar effort, especially in the acting department, with a low-key Brad Pitt (even more so than his laid back Billy Beane in "Moneyball") hired killer with a heart of gold, Jackie Cogan (Pitt vying for another Academy Award nomination), leading a cast that includes Richard Jenkins ("Cabin in the Woods"), Ray Liotta ("Goodfellas") and Sam Shepard ("The Right Stuff").Plotwise, a New Orleans card game, run by Markie Trattman (Liotta) is knocked off by goons hired by Trattman himself. With this in mind, another low-level hood, Johnny "The Squirrel" Amato (Vincent Curatola, "The Sopranos," "Person Of Interest" TV series) then hires two filthy reprobates, Frankie (Scoot McNairy, "Argo") and Aussie Russell (Ben Mendelsohn, "Trespass") to rob the game.The thinking is that the mob bosses who control things will simply believe Trattman was again responsible, whack him and that would be it. Of course, things do not go as planned and the two novice robbers are quickly fingered, bringing Cogan in to try and take care of things.Since the mob has gone corporate, however, the hit-man must meet with a go-between (Jenkins) just to get the okay for each and every move he has to make. All of this action, for some reason, is against the backdrop of the 2008 presidential elections with more scenes of Barak Obama than last summer's Democratic Convention. Also, it seems every bar has CNN tuned in while all of the characters listen to political news on their car radios instead of music.I'm not quite sure what the thinking was here. Is it to say that in 2008, the economy was so bad, hits could be bought for as low as $10,000 each? Or that making money in America has a slimy underbelly, no matter what the occupation. Plus, with the financial situation really no better after four years of the present administration, it could have just as well taken place now, or even in 1974, when the actual book was published (and the country was also going through a recession).I will give credit for the incidental music, however, with songs ranging from the 1930s ("Paper Moon") to the '60s ("Love Letters") to the '90s ("When the Man Comes Around"), as well as the semi-noir cinematography (Greig Fraser, "Snow White and the Huntsman" and the upcoming "Zero Dark Thirty"), which fills the screen with sequences of hard rain, soft rain and just after it rained.There's are also several memorable - and graphic - killing scenes (no softness here, friends), as well as a slow motion hit that seems to be a nice homage to the late Sam Peckinpah.And, to be equally fair, the picture does have grit, plenty of grit. True grit, in fact. The problem lies not in its earthy script (credit Dominik himself), but with the abbreviation of some scenes (the conclusion is especially frustrating) while others seem to go on interminably - like many of the Obama speeches.Take the case of a bar conversation that commits several sins: Jackie is talking to a terribly misused James Gandolfini ("The Sopranos"), who plays Mickey, a drunken hit-man, hired from Maryland. The conversation goes on and on and on (think of those unending talking sequences in Quentin Tarantino's "Inglorious Basterds," or ANY film by him). It goes nowhere and is memorable only in that Mickey gets to insult a waiter several times.Later, Gandolfini gets even more inebriated and verbally abuses a hooker before leaving the film for good. The fate of one of the hoods, Russell (who plays the smart-assed heroin-addled punk from Down Under perfectly) is also cut short.I have always thought that brevity is indeed the soul of wit (and many other things, for that matter), but if ever there was a request for a movie to go on just a tad bit longer, this is certainly the one - just to fill in several ignored plot points.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Killing them softly" offers an intriguing premise and certainly had its moments, but towards the end it felt more and more shallow and - especially in the middle part - became quite boring as it overstretched its snappy, filthy dialogues, which may have been occasionally funny at the beginning, but towards the end. A damaged up world where danger lurks around every corner. Killing Me Softly not only boasts director Andrew Dominik's uniquely stylized, perversely humorous and subversive vision, but also showcases many great performances that should garner attentions come award season (hopefully). While everyone is on their A game, Scoot McNairy stands out the most with his challenging.Check out my visual review on website harijs lv. Some nice poster art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Killing (off Hope) and Replacing it with Nihilism: Come on Andrew - You can do better than this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Andrew Dominik took Eric Banna, a failed television comedian and transformed him into an archetypal Australian underworld celebrity, Chopper Read. In doing so, he not only created a Hollywood start but made a terrific Aussie movie. So he has to be judged by the standards he has set himself.I can't remember a single thing about Jesse James. I did not get it when I was watching itI doubt I will remember much about "Killing Them Softly", either.It's not just all the talk. Chopper was full of talk. Talk of that entertaining, 'low life argot"- heightened variety that Tarantino served up so generously in "Pulp Fiction"Maybe "Pulp Fiction" is the key to understanding the let down feeling I had after watching "Killing Me Softly". "Pulp Fiction" was about atonement and redemption. "Killing Me Softly" is just that old Post Enlightenment nihilism. Its easy to be nihilistic. It may even garner critical acclaim from the types of people who have been dead for years but just not realized it yet.Take for instance, the incessant references to Obama's election throughout the film. Take that last scene in which the Brad Pitt character dismisses Jefferson as as slave owning hypocrite. The American Dream for some but not all. OK. But at least Jefferson's flawed vision envisaged more than the one per-centers who run America now. Obama seems to get it from both sides. The Republicans seem to think he is the devil incarnate. The Democrats seem to think he is a sell out.Obama pulled off something that Clinton failed to achieve. After finding the Treasury bare of all but Republican military-industrial complex, "set in concrete" spending commitments, Clinton just seemed to give up and set about freeing the banks of lending restraints and chasing tail.Obama succeeded in getting a universal health scheme up and running. So why all the fretting about loss of hope?An Australian Governor General said, many years ago, "the only thing you have to boast about if you live in a rubbish dump, is that you are pulling it down." The bigger the rubbish dump, the longer it will take to pull it down.So why all the doom and gloom about Americans who are committing themselves to the task of making their country a better place to live in. I had given up on Americans until I started to listen to David Barsamian's "Alternative Radio" shows. (http://www.alternativeradio.org) There are a lot of good Americans.Take for instance Hollywood. It has undergone a revolution in the last thirty years of so. One fueled by money, for sure, but one that seeks to depict the rubbish dump in all its ugliness. Take Matt Damon, that former neighbor of Howard Zinn, who has campaigned with such success to make his fellow citizens see the folly of the war-making endeavors. Even George Clooney, that pal of Clinton's has joined him in making spectacularly good films that would have had their proponents hounded into obscurity well before the production stage by the forces of McCarthyism that prevailed in US culture until a few decades ago. Take directors such as Cameron ("Avatar") and Stone (too many to mention) and others, whose ideas will be the source for future historians who find the paper trail in the government archives too bizarre to have any credibility at allSo why the nihilism. Come on Andrew Dominik. You gave us "Chopper". You can do better than this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Killing them softly" thinks its a Quentin Tarantino movie, but it isn't. It has its brutally violent moments firmly intact. But its long, chatty, film school like moments often fall flat.Flick is about a complicated double cross which sees a hit-man being brought in to wipe out everyone involved. Brad Pitt stars as the hit-man who likes too "kill them softly." Taking his victims out quickly, without having to listen too them begging for forgiveness and the likes. Pity the film didn't get on with it in the same way, and we didn't have to listen too James Gandolfini whimpering on about his divorce, or another scene (I'm not sure whether I just dreamed this one or not) where two off the most irritating characters ever conceived sit in a car talking about "beastiality" with dogs. Yes, sometimes you can keep a movie interesting with random chat between the characters, but "Killing them softly" doesn't succeed at this.Its not a terrible movie. It has a half decent cast, and some cool, cold blooded moments. But its main function is to give Brad Pitt something to be in, as a bad guy. Everything else, including its abrupt ending, thinks its way cooler than it actually is.</fullReview>

Brad Pitt in particular seemed to have to put very little effort in to his role and it showed.

		<fullReview>The easiest way to write a review for this movie would be just too list all possible synonyms for the word "awful". It starts off as if it is trying to create the atmosphere of a gritty foreign crime film. It fails terribly. All of the protagonists are painfully unappealing to watch. (Sorry gals, but, yes, this includes Brad Pitt too.) As the movie develops it is clearly trying to make "big" statements about America, in particular drawing conclusions about our society from our last major financial crisis which began in 2007-- the metaphors are painfully simple-minded and heavy-handed. The pacing of this movie is also very, very lethargic--the title "Killing Them Softly" obviously refers to the audience. I only finished watching this movie because it is relatively short, and I was curious to see if it could be rescued. The answer is an emphatic, "NO!" Basically everything about this movie sucks. It is remarkable that Brad Pitt and his wife Angelina Jolie can continue to star in so many mediocre and worse movies and continue to demand and receive such high premiums for their work. They both have massive artistic pretensions and repeatedly fall flat. I can definitely imagine that this concept sounded really good initially, but the execution is painfully (there's that word again) bad. As a matter of fact, calling this movie bad, is unfair to the word bad. Just don't waste your time here. "Danger, Will Robertson! Danger, Will Robertson!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The idea is good, but there are no smooth switchings between various dialogs and felonies followed, providing arid and wavering scenes. Constant background TV speeches regarding financial crisis became annoying soon. The punishment scenes are short and unrealistic as they take place in the open, using guns without dampers, etc.The best performances are given by virtually supporting actors here: Ray Liotta as Markie Trattman, Brad Pitt as Jackie Cogan, James Gandolfini as Mickey; conversations between Jackie and Mickey are the wittiest and most catchy parts of the movie. Use of Richard Jenkins was unnecessary, he is a too talented actor for such a trivial part - he was always sitting only, and briefly on screen.Instead of Killing Them Softly, I would rather recommend, e.g. similar movies buy Guy Ritchie.</fullReview>

I actually cut my fingernails during this one. So boring. Without spoiling one scene (the robbery), I will say that even in the world of make believe there is no way that the two crooks should have even made it out of that one.Do not pay to see this one.

		<fullReview>Unlike the movie, this will be a very brief review.? The plot is simple, perfect for a 15-minute short. Instead, it was stretched to 90-odd minutes, and consequently, filled with over a dozen indulgent, poorly paced, mind-numbing scenes. The character played by John Gandolfini (Mickey), for instance, served absolutely no purpose towards the overarching plot.? Writer/director Andrew Dominik exhibited strong paleolibertarian leanings in his script, culminating in the final monologue by Jackie Cogan (Brad Pitt).? Brad Pitt delivered a surprisingly effective, understated performance.? Sadly, the best scene in the movie is the brutal beating of Markie Trattman (Ray Liotta). It was realistic, though unnecessarily gory, and perhaps a little too violent for many. The scene where the very high Russell (Ben Mendelsohn) was blinking in and out of consciousness also deserves a mention, if only for reminding me of my own youthful escapades.? Personally speaking, I felt the political allegories and attempt at equating criminal organizations with sociocultural capitalism, along with the impact of the 2007-09 recession, waere a little too obvious and forced. It certainly doesn't help to see TVs in bars playing C-Span! ? Decent music.In conclusion, ....(taking a cue from the movie)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Casey's Movie Mania: KILLING THEM SOFTLY (2012)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following from his critically-acclaimed meditative western THE ASSASSINATION OF JESSE JAMES BY THE COWARD ROBERT FORD (2007), New Zealand-born director Andrew Dominik explores hard-boiled crime genre in KILLING THEM SOFTLY. Despite early positive reviews and a coveted Palme d'Or nomination at the recent Cannes Film Festival, the movie is well-acted but shockingly mundane effort that doesn't really deserved such high acclaim at the first place.Based on a 1974 crime novel Cogan's Trade by George V. Higgins, this modern update centers on two small-time crooks Frankie (Scoot McNairy) and Russell (Ben Mendelsohn) are being tapped by their boss Johnny Amato (Vincent Curatola) to rob a mob-protected card game supervised by a mob hustler named Markie (Ray Liotta). At the night of the heist, Frankie and Russell managed to pull it off without trouble. But they didn't realize their consequences eventually put their lives into jeopardy after a mob representative called Driver (Richard Jenkins) hired a hit-man named Jackie Cogan (Brad Pitt) to set things right.The title of KILLING THEM SOFTLY actually refers to Jackie's preferred method of killing where he will choose to stand back from the crime rather than personally getting involved with the victims he's going to murder. Dominik's adapted screenplay is excessively talky, but that won't be matter if the dialogue are catchy or captivating enough to hold your interest. Alas, Dominik is no David Mamet or Quentin Tarantino, for that matter. Sure, the dialogue does contain all the typical tough-guy talks and colorful profanity but the certain vibe or hook, for that matter, is hardly there. Instead, this supposedly breezy 97-minute movie feels like a tired slog. On the other hand, Dominik also tries to make his movie more than just your typical crime genre. Over the course of the running time, he tries hard to make a statement about the 2008's financial crisis suffered in the US as well as the political commentary between Obama and McCain presidential campaign. It's an admirable effort, but the context feels strangely disconnected and they are more of a filler than a meaningful interpretation.As a crime genre, Dominik only delivers them in certain portions. Whenever the action arrives, Dominik knows how to hook his viewers with his ultra-stylized, slow-motion orgy of violence (the particular scene where Jackie shoots his victim from the backseat of a car is a compelling visual flair to check out for). Earlier in the movie, Dominik manages to pull off a tautly-directed scene involving a suspenseful mob heist. But these entertaining scenes are sadly too little to justify the entire whole.At least the fine cast deserve a few praises here. While those who are looking forward to see Pitt's tough-guy role will be (mostly) disappointed by the sheer amount of time watching him talk a lot than doing his killing job, his cold and calculating character remains compelling. With slicked-back hair and a goatee, Pitt makes Jackie Cogan an engaging presence. As two clumsy small-time crooks messing up with the wrong people, McNairy and Mendelsohn are believable in their lowlife roles. The rest of the supporting actors, including Ray Liotta, James Gandolfini and even a small role by Richard Jenkins, are equally good as well.KILLING THEM SOFTLY could have been a great crime picture, if not for Dominik's heavily-restrained direction that doesn't really goes nowhere. What a huge, yet missed opportunity.www.caseymoviemania.blogspot.com</fullReview>

What is does have is the dynamite dialogue, the gritty violence, the spirit.

This is an hour and a half, and the first forty five minutes had me, but then the last lost me.Some of the dialogue is pretty smart. But there is really so much that you can handle. There are many scenes of rambling dialogue that doesn't seem to be coming to a close. It's not terrifically exciting, and after a while I sort of lost interest. Not only that, it feels as if this movie has been made before, and better.What I do like about it is the style that the film is shot. Also, Pitt does a decent job of keeping your interest, even when you feel you've had enough. James Gandolfini does the best work here, but you know what, I can't even tell you the purpose of his character, because I don't even know it. The film is sort of a tease,it wants you to love it, and for that reason, I couldn't.C+</fullReview>

There is nothing memorable about this film less the last statement by Pitt. I have a feeling that the whole film was written in 5 min as a carriage for Andrew Dominik to vent his disapproval of America in the last 60 seconds. Andrews statement (via Pitt) referring to America being nothing but a business and that the whole Obama spin is flat out lie, was worth the first 89min of tediously painful, agonizing nothingness that this film is.It would of been allot quicker to just openly denounce America during an interview. Having said that, the statement probably made more of an impact due to the fact the rest of the dialog was verbal diarrhea.I give it an open 2 for pity sake, a closed 10 for the end statement. Thank god I didn't have to pay to see this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**** Contains Spoilers****To start, I really enjoyed the opening and setup of this film. Frankie (Scoot McNairy) and Russell (Ben Mendelsohn) a heroin addict, the character dynamic were a great set up, including the suspenseful robbery of a poker ring ran by Markie Trattman (Ray Liotta). But while they're in the clear, Russell mouths off about the robbery to an associate of Jackie Cogan (Brad Pitt) who is hired by Driver (Richard Jenkins)who is an emissary for the mafia to take care of Frankie, Russell and the guy who hired them Johnny "Squirrel" Amato (Vincent Curatola) to carry out the robbery. Sounds like a basic yet interesting set up for a crime film right? Here's where it looses its momentum and direction:After being beat up by two local gangsters, Markie is killed by Jackie in a drive by shooting. Jackie then decides that he can't kill Frankie or Russell so they hire a known outside hit-man Mickey Fallon (James Gandolfini)to do the job. Jackie meets Mickey at a restaurant, which is just one big scene of incoherent rambling about the characters wife and how he was in prison. Another scene later they're in his hotel room, after he slept with a hooker he goes on another pointless rant. I think in both scenes Brad Pitt only had a few lines. Eventually Jackie becomes frustrated and carries out the hits himself, while he has Mickie arrested. Mickie's character was pointless to the whole film. Anyways, Russell winds up getting arrested at a bus stop where he brilliantly stores his heroin in a locker. We never see the character again. Jackie confronts Frankie at a bar, which was a brilliant scene. He convinces Frankie the option of helping him track down Johnny "Squirrel" Amato and gives him the option of killing Johnny instead of him. The two ride in Frankie's car. Frankie waits as he witnesses Jackie kill Johnny in a parking lot at an apartment complex. They drive back to a parking garage where Jackie kills Frankie. The film ends with The Driver at the bar watching Obama's victory speech on television. Jackie goes on a rant how he's not getting paid enough, then rants about Thomas Jefferson. The movie ends..... I forgot to mention, that this film shows ads and plays audio from John McCains speeches and clips of Obama throughout the entire film, it was overkill to let the audience know it's 2008. I understand the movie had this undertone of the economy but hell... it was distracting in the films message.Overall this film had a great start but lost it's momentum thanks to Mickey's pointless character and incoherent rants, political propaganda in the backdrop and a dissatisfying ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark, violent, but over-talked</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Killing Them Softly is a brutally downright, satirical crime thriller, where punchy dialogues intertwine with offbeat visceral attitude. Even before the audiences get acquainted with all the sleaze-bag characters, Andrew Dominik communicates one thing very clearly: in the film's brutal nature hides a much bigger, more considerable subtlety, namely the critique of the United States and its collapsing financial and political spheres (right before the 2008 elections). It's not really a film about gangsters and their operations as it is about hope that's somehow faded away a long time ago and there's no way of retrieving it. In all the mess and violence that permeates the screen during the impetuous intermission-like sequences, the characters gradually create their own demise in a way that makes the still-heard political speeches seem almost comical, compared with the enormous problems of the so-called little guys.Three slow-witted and unimaginative guys (Scoot McNairy, Ben Mendelsohn, Vincent Curatola) execute a seemingly perfect mob-protected card game robbery. Even though their plan looks too perfect to be true, they still manage to go on with it. Surprisingly, everything goes smoothly, so the boys start enjoying their easily made money doing drugs and drinking booze all the time. Unknown to them is the fact that a brutal, emotionless enforcer named Jackie Cogan (Brad Pitt) has just arrived in town, and is now ready to find out who planned the job. In the middle of the whole dialogue-driven narrative there are bits of utmost violence, during which Jackie takes the law in his own hands and does so with impressively gory results. What's crucial to say is the fact that every character in the film has one's own ideas about the world as such, and those ideas quickly turn into inanely simple plans, instead of real hopes and dreams.Killing Them Softly bases its substance on a round of long and moody conversations, which ? unfortunately ? become more and more melodramatical and superfluous with every following minute. The film proves to be a game of sorts, juxtaposing various ostensibly inconsistent pieces into a climatic neo-noir creation. Apart from politically related themes (during the card- game robbery President Bush speaks about the financial crisis, during the final payoff there is Obama's victory speech after the 2008 victory), there are the aforementioned abrupt jumps from over-talked sequences to the brutal ones. There is also a sudden contradiction between the low life reality and all those high hopes for a better future, and that's probably the most disturbing thing about this film, and a true eye-opener in itself.The editing is marvelous, mostly so in the drug-filled scene or the ones where gun shots cut through the unsettling silence and create a hardcore mash-up of brains and blood (also, the one, in which Ray Liotta takes a harsh beating is really satisfying). Brad Pitt shows he has guts once again, and proves that his acting skills are on the highest level. Let's hope we'll see more of him in the future. James Gandolfini is more of a lame asshole than a true criminal, but that's his role so there's no way of complaining. Richard Jenkins delivers one of the best lines in the whole film.Killing Them Softly is a wonderful piece in the visual sense. There are lots of stylish camera angles and sudden outbursts of technical improvisations, which only enhance the final effect. However, due to its over-talked ambitions and somehow shallow critique, the film becomes tedious after some time, even strangely one-dimensional, only leaving the audiences begging for more action.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unimpressive and Completely Uninteresting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a card game is held up by a pair of small-time crooks, Jackie Cogan (Brad Pitt) is called in to find the robbers and their boss. Along the way, he has a few fun conversations that seem to last for eons of time. I was excited to see "Killing Them Softly", based on an excellent book called "Cogan's Trade". It was set in a time (post-bailout America) and place (New Orleans) that dripped with emotion and story possibility. The end result is a dry, listless film that never happens upon any point whatsoever. Brad Pitt is given top billing for a performance that lasts perhaps half the movie. He doesn't appear for at least the first half hour, then pops up in a brief, meaningless conversation with Richard Jenkins. The two men talk about other characters in detail. It would be nice to know exactly who was their subject. We never really find out. A series of your usual mob character actors are sprinkled throughout, all adding conversation that pertains to none of the story and leading to no result. Ray Liotta seems to be the only exception, but his actions are what sets the rest of the events in motion, so it doesn't really count. James Gandolfini appears for a two-scene long meaningless performance. I remember seeing Sam Shepard in the trailer, but I can't recall him being in the movie. I once heard Brad Pitt called "the greatest actor of his generation". Is Brad Pitt a good actor? I can never tell. He does not have the charisma of Leonardo DiCaprio or the unsettling ability to become a character that would embody the talent of someone like Joaquin Phoenix. Here he plays the same role he would play in just about any other movie; a confident, if not arrogant man of power. He doesn't do much. Any other actor could have played his role and they would not get the same billing.To be fair, the real stars of the film are Ben Mendehlson, the Australian star of the 2010 crime drama "Animal Kingdom", and Scoot McNairy, who starred in a great sci-fi film called "Monsters". These two play the robbers of the poker game that starts it all off, and make more than able leads. McNairy captures the nervousness that one would naturally expect, and Mendehlson's junky appearance in the film is indicative of his character. "Killing Them Softly" would be helped by better editing. For one, a dialogue-driven film should perhaps be marketed as such. Two, make these dialogue-heavy scenes have a purpose that pertains to what has or will happen in the story, instead of filled with references to characters the audience does not know and will never meet. Finally, the unusual cinematography got to be less artistic and more tedious as I checked my watch for the hundredth time. The camera work needs work. This is not a good film. It has dropped three stars as I wrote this review and contemplated just how not good it is. But it could be great. And for that, I will knock it down one star more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a huge disappointment this for was for me, especially when the anticipation of seeing an excellent movie was the plan. Here's my take on this one, first when you see a movie, there has to be some kind of emotional connection to the characters, storyline, something or anything to make you care or at the very least find interesting. In this case, while the actors are all exceptional, you can't find anything remotely likable or even dis-likable about them, so you end up sitting through this entire movie just killing time not giving a hoot how or where this story goes. Yes the violence is graphic and brutal, but that isn't why most people go to movies, there needs to be some connection with the viewers on some level. This movie fails to connect, if you don't give a crap about any of it, then why are you there? I've seen violent movies before, so what....I was hoping for so much more. The story and the characters are weak and the bottom line on this failed attempt is why bother.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The most of the people expected more from this movie including me as well. It begins on cliché. Two stupid guys accepted dirty job to do for the boss, got some gain and then one of them has started talking about it and talk big, till they got hurt by the end. Movie has some artistic qualities but the plot is weak and could've been much better. In the run it stars slow and boring. Some of the characters were unnecessary e.g. Mickey, character acted by James Gandolfini. The political campaign and comments about how economic crisis effected on crimes were needless. Even a hit man, character acted by Brad Pitt is emphasized and inconclusive 'cause his cleaning tactic has many flaws. One of the light moments was abrupt ending scene that define the purpose of the movie. Gory and brutal scenes may not like everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unconvincing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The start of this movie is very promising. In the intriguing first scene, we see a man walking through a desolate urban landscape, while we hear Barack Obama giving one of his famous inspiring speeches. After a while, the man looks up and sees two billboards: McCain and Obama. So it's clear this movie is set during the 2008 presidential elections and the financial crisis. You'd expect this theme to contribute somehow to the movie. But it doesn't happen. Throughout the film, we keep seeing and hearing speeches by Obama and Bush, but it doesn't become clear why. Is the financial crisis a metaphor for the moral decline of the US? The last scene seems to suggest this. Does the director consider Bush, Obama and American politics to be as abject as the gangsters the movie is about? We can only guess. This wouldn't be a big problem if the story itself would be compelling. But it isn't. For most of the time, it's gangsters killing each other and talking about killing each other. It's a very violent and male-oriented film: the only woman in it is a prostitute. There are some nice moments. One of the killings is a cinematographic tour de force, with the gun, the bullet, the shattering glass and the wounds all shown in close-up and slow motion. But it all looks a bit like showing off. Brad Pitt's role is rather flat, as a cool contract killer. The best part is for James Gandolfini, who plays a pathetic, alcoholic hit-man who turns out to be so inadequate that he is sent back to where he came from. On the plus side there is also the rough, gritty atmosphere with lots of tough talking and hard hitting. But on the whole, this movie is unconvincing. I'm amazed the IMDb-rating is 7.0, because the majority of the reviews are not positive.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. No apologies will be made in regards to my fondness for mob, organized crime and hit-man movies. The underworld grit and quest for power makes for a colorful and meaty topic for books and movies. Still, with such a long and varied history of mob tales, we have come to expect a certain amount of action and a turf war for power and control. Director Andrew Dominik, working from a George V Higgins novel, delivers an artsy look at the emotional side of mobsters and then adds a heavy-handed slap of political and economic editorials.We never knew hit men and mobsters TALKED so much! So often they are portrayed as men of few words who specialize in suppressing their emotions. Here we get Mickey the hit-man, played by James Gandolfini, as a man lost in booze and sleazy sex-for-pay. He has clearly lost his once sharp edge and now loves to tell stories that do nothing but showcase his lack of resolve. We get a few talky scenes with local criminal Johnny Amato (Vincent Curatola) and his small-time recruits Frankie (Scott McNairy) and Russell (Ben Mendelsohn). We even get a talky high-stakes card game stick-up where mob guy Markie (Ray Liotta) tries to negotiate an end to the heist.By far, most of the blabbing comes from mob fixer Jackie (Brad Pitt). It matters not whether he is in the car with the Driver (Richard Jenkins), in a bar with one of the punks, or in the hotel with schlubby Mickey, this guy just talks incessantly. Luckily for us viewers, the dialogue is extremely well written and often entertaining, but it still boils down to too much emotional baggage ... especially from a guy who likes to kill 'em softly (from a distant).The individual pieces of the film work very well. Ben Mendelsohn, who was so frightening in Animal Kingdom, is terrific here as the strung-out hoodlum always looking for a quick score. Liotta adds a sense of humor and realism, Gandolfini dominates the screen, and Pitt proves once again that he is at his best in a tough/bad guy role, rather than as a strutting poser.Where the movie goes wrong is with the obnoxious and numerous attempts to make sure we catch the parallels between the US economic woes and those of the mob. The faceless "committee" mob clearly symbolizes our government's inability to make wise decisions, and if somehow we miss all of that ... Pitt's final monologue spells it out for us. It's always frustrating when the individual parts are greater than the movie as a whole, but an artsy looking mob film that beats us upside the head with a 90 minute message just can't overcome the coolness of Brad Pitt and Johnny Cash (The Man Comes Around).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moments of brilliance, but hard to recommend.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anticipating a chic urban gangster flick (thanks to the promos) I was instead railroaded with a strange, oblique drama that focused on 2008 America as it was negotiating its worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Viewing the economy downfall through the eyes of petty criminals, experienced hit men and a Mob accountant, it's a unique and ballsy picture which has moments of heavy impact and genuine brilliance, but struggles to resonate due to a see-sawing tone and a ridiculously jarring tempo. Ironically, considering the stylish (read: visual) crime saga I was waiting for, the dialogue-only scenes between Brad Pitt's frustrated hired-gun and Richard Jenkins' Mafia moneyman are the highlight of the film; both actors injecting humour and ethos into their characters despite limited screen time. Unfortunately the other major players are underwhelming and/or unlikeable; James Gandolfini's over-the-hill enforcer, Scoot McNairy's paranoid thief and Ben Mendelsohn's smack-addicted crim all fail to compel. Hard to recommend, yet hard to forget.</fullReview>

Had the director extended the the film's trailer by 5 minutes, he could have saved himself the trouble of editing the rest of the film. A low point in the careers of so many good actors one can only assume that each of them forgot to read the script before signing onto this project. Don't even bother waiting for it to come out on TV, even their excessive editing will not be enough to shorten this pointless film to a watchable length. I give it 2 yawns.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Killing Them Slowly.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With an inventive set-up and final sequence, "Killing Them Softly" has a devastatingly hard time making the meat of its plot progress into anything remotely interesting. And while there are some stylized visuals here, which once again display writer/director Andrew Dominik (The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford) as a filmmaker to keep an eye on, "Killing Them Softly", as an entire film, is a meandering bore-fest that leads to a fantastic, but so not worth your time and trouble, final speech about the economic structure of America today, from Brad Pitt. Set against the backdrop of the economic crisis of the late 2000's and the Obama-McCain presidential race, "Killing Them Softly" attempts to tell the story of Jackie Cogan (played by Pitt) an enforcer sent to kill a few blue collar robbers, after a mob protected card game gets held up. But instead, what this movie is essentially about is a town full of morally or physically disgusting mobsters and lowlife's, having conversations. So, if you think "Killing Them Softly" is going to be a violent, mafia film, in the same vein as a Scorsese production, while you would be partially right (when this movie is violent, it is violent beyond belief and Dominik does do an excellent job of creating a world that compliments his dingy characters) you may be blindsided by how much of this movie is based it in the minutiae of odd and far too tedious male conversations (please don't think "Pulp Fiction"). Male conversations, which touch on everything from, different ways to degrade women during sex, to bestiality; with the kicker being, said conversations are more of a waste of time than morbidly interesting. Other than being an utterly uneventful mob film steeped in heavily misogynistic rants, the major flaw here occurs when Dominik stupidly attempts to make a simplistic revenge story more layered than it needed to be. For example, throughout this movie there are constant (and I do mean constant) reminders that all of the events happening take place during the economic crisis. There are even sequences where characters are watching a FOX News report on the economic crisis, go into their cars and hear a similar report on the radio, rob a card game that for some reason has CNN playing in the background, get back into their car and continue listening to the economic report from earlier and finally eat at a diner, that instead of playing music, has a television turned to an eerily familiar MSNBC economic crisis diatribe. In saying all of this, are we to deduce that the mobster motivated plot of "Killing Them Softly" is supposed to be an allegory symbolizing how the US government conducted themselves during the economic crisis? And, are the characters of this film meant to represent certain well known players in the government and corporate world of a few years ago? Well as much as I would like to give a clear answer to this question, I really couldn't figure it out myself, simply because everything about how Dominik handles the story, the conversations, the characters actions, are so damn obscure, that, as an audience member, to create any sort of parallels to the economic crisis as the bases for this particular plot would be a stretch. All I could really decipher was that Dominik was trying to get some kind of sociopolitical point across, but hell if I (or anyone who sat in the same theater I did) knew what it was.The Acting: No Oscar nomination for Brad Pitt this year. To say that Pitt does about two seconds of noteworthy acting here would be a very accurate statement. Don't get me wrong, he plays the main character and in turn is in almost every scene (after the first 20 minutes) BUT as the movie progresses, it becomes apparent that Pitt has nothing really captivating to say or do until the very last scene. Furthermore, until this final scene happens, Pitt merely plays a poor SNL caricature of himself. In fact, his acting is so (surprisingly) mediocre here, that in many of the scenes, all containing actors (Ray Liotta, Scoot McNairy, James Gandolfini) that physically take on a gritty mob or street thug appearance, Pitt seems out of place as the slick haired, tan enforcer for hire. In fact, the best performance here comes from McNairy, who is really the only believable character in the entire movie?Oh, and I almost forgot. Richard Jenkins does nothing here. If you want to see a good Richard Jenkins performance from a movie that came out in 2012, watch "The Cabin in the Woods".Final Thought: Maybe the most surprising thing here is the fact that "Killing Them Softly" is not a long movie at all; with a runtime of 97 minutes. But Dominik makes 90 of these minutes seem like an eternity, with a script that was adapted from a George V. Higgins novel in a purposefully dull manner, while using thematic elements to bludgeon his audience over the head in a movie scored by the droning of political talking heads. In short, it's not like I would rather go through another economic crisis than watch "Killing Them Softly" again, but let's just say, it's not a wonder why this movie tanked at the box office.Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I.

		<shortDescription>A weary tale of illegal rackets as a parable of American financial crisis</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A pulp film with stylised violence, intoxication and no little tension, Killing Them Softly is a serviceable crime thriller. But from the start one is aware of TV and radio reports permeating the sound mix as all the characters seem to be tuning in, willfully or subconsciously, to the financial crisis management of the dead-end of the George W Bush administration.In fact, the manner in which this is achieved is almost overdone for me. However, the sight of James Gandolfini as a former hit-man gone to seed is typical of the excellently played roles that speak eloquently on their own. At the centre of this is a typically cool but nonetheless two-dimensional Brad Pitt in a role that requires an extra, detached facet. He's the perfect actor for a more serious version of the John Travolta character in the more light-hearted Elmore Leonard adaptations but here we need something with more gravitas. The support cast seem to have that, the idea of watching their own backs. Pitt gets steadily more angry but without the pilot light of understanding behind his eyes.An entertaining if mildly disheartening film. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The great gangster films of the thirties were firmly set in the Depression at a time when, economically, the country had basically gone down the tubes and when, in the sixties, movies like "Bonnie and Clyde" and "Thieves like us" revived the genre they, too, acknowledged that criminals didn't always commit crime for power or profit but just to survive. Andrew Dominik's sublime "Killing them Softly" is set in the America of the economic melt-down that saw out the Bush years and saw in Obama's presidency and money, taking it, keeping it, getting it whatever way you can, is again at the heart of the picture, (and both Bush and Obama figure prominently throughout on any available television screen).It begins when small-time hood Johhny Amato hires a couple of drugged-up, spaced-out and even smaller-time hoods Frankie and Russell to hold up a card-game run by Markie Trattman who had previously organized the robbery of another of his own games. But while they get away with the money things start going wrong for them very early. In no time hit-man Jackie Cogan is hunting them down and never mind the collateral damage.Written and directed by Dominik, who also gave us that great elegiac western "The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford", "Killing them Softly" may be the first great gangster film to come out of the current economic recession. It's based on the novel "Cogan's Trade" by George V Higgins, who also wrote "The Friends of Eddie Coyle" all those years ago, (this, too, was written some time ago and updated by Dominik), and talk, really good talk of the kind the movies used to give us a lifetime ago, is as vital to the film as the several spectacularly executed killings, one filmed in slow-motion showing the bullet leaving the gun before crashing, first through a car window and then through the victim's skull. And talk of this quality needs good talkers to carry it off and it gets them in the ensemble of Brad Pitt, James Gandolfino, Richard Jenkins, Ray Liotta, Vincent Curatola and two brilliant, relative new faces in Scoot McNairy and Ben Mendelsohn as the bubble-headed robbers. Indeed this may be the best thing Pitt has ever done and in a just world Gandolfino should be clearing space for his Best Supporting Actor Oscar. Come to think of it, this may be the best film I have seen so far this year; yes, it really is that good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film noir of our times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film got a pretty good reception in Cannes although it was absent from any prizes and seems to have been forgotten as far as awards buzz go for now. It's a shame because it's very well done and is definitely a film of our times: although the context (it's actually more than a context or subtext, it's really a plot line all by itself) of the economic crisis is handled in a sometimes obvious fashion, it never interferes with the main plot or storyline since almost every situation in it is naturally connected to said story, at least if we follow the interpretation of Andrew Dominik, which is quite straightforward yet pretty brilliant at the same time. So the film includes about a dozen times these excerpts from the radio or TV of speeches given by Obama or Bush, talking about the economy or even the state of the nation in general, but every time it reinforces the scene in question, giving it a deeper meaning but without hammering it into us. The way Dominik found and included all this footage into the story is pretty neat, I thought. Good examples are the flashbacks in the first act, the fact that the mob that hires Jackie is never present and doesn't get any names (just like the financial powers at the top, which are also "killing us softly") or the last sequence, but in general it always works.Having said that, without this context the film wouldn't be as memorable, but it would still be pretty powerful, given that its main qualities come from the dialog, the performances and the atmosphere/directing style. Most noticeable of all is probably James Gandolfini, playing a worn down, alcoholic gangster whose wife is leaving him, at the prospect of going to jail again. It's a character of interesting pathos and surprising complexity, since it could've turned out to be a one dimensional, almost stereotypical impersonation. Also worthy of notice is Brad Pitt, delivering an effortless turn in his portrayal of Jackie Cogan, quite a cynical yet somewhat vulnerable character. But all actors involved give strong performances, and the conversations between them (almost always between two characters, thus more intimate or enclosed) are delightful to hear and watch. And the film acquires its unity through its dark, stylized atmosphere, with more showy moments like the killing of one particular character or more brutal situations like the beating of that same character: scenes of violence that break the calm the film occasionally seems to be going for with its prolonged scenes of dialog, thus keeping the viewer in constant tension. How the pieces come together in the last sequence also provides said unity under a narrative angle and makes the film all the more satisfying.So this isn't a flawless film, but it's an ambitious one, one that, after Drive last year, brings us back one of the genres we love the most while at the same time shedding new light on it. It takes its chances and delivers both as an intense and thought-provoking picture, and as some kind of broader entertainment. It's an art-house film in a commercial frame. And a hell of a good one. ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For a film littered with violence, this is painfully dull. Writer/Director Andrew Dominik wants to be Tarantino. He wants to be Scorcese. He is neither. The characters are unappealing, un-smart and un-funny. The dialogue has all the meandering of Tarantino's, and not one ounce of its wit or drive. The violence is in-your-face and lovingly shot, but has no visceral impact because of the aforementioned unattractiveness of the characters. The soundtrack is hip but jars, instead of enhancing the action.Several scenes are ripe for witty or gritty dialogue (the robbery scene, the beating scene) but instead opt either for violence or silence.The acting is good, as you'd expect, but it quickly becomes obvious that stars of the calibre of Gandofini and Pitt have been attracted by sheer screen time, rather than quality. There are long tedious shots of talking heads, saying nothing interesting, and a few monologues that peter out lamely, as if they have been ad libbed.There are possibly three laughs in the film, but they don't make up for the rest of the dirge.To add insult to injury, the movie has ideas well above its station. Not content with being a lousy Tarantino rip-off, it is intercut with hopeful Obama election campaign speeches pouring from every electrical appliance, which is somehow meant to highlight just how cutthroat the world of these lowlifes is. Tell us something we don't know. It's a very immature piece of political paradox.I would have been happy to walk out, but I'd taken my boyfriend for his birthday. Afterwards he said he'd hated it too, leaving us both filled with the double regret of having chosen to see it in the first place - and then felt compelled to stay put by the niceties of social convention.A very poor effort all round.</fullReview>

The story fell on the first hurdle of scriptwriting which was that there was none or little interaction between the three main stars. There is no plot. The film and it's sporadic violence leaves you cold and disinterested. I really wanted to see this movie as soon as I heard Brad Pitt, Ray Liotta, and James Gandolfini and Vincent Curatola from the Sopranos were starring. From now on, I have pledged never to watch a film based on its actors alone. A good film requires a good story and a good director more than a good cast.</fullReview>

Imagine if you got the opportunity to follow a bunch of vagrants all day and smell their never ending brain farts. This is the result.Remember, Jackie (Brad Pitt) is an enforcer/killer, so you have to ask why does he need backup to kill two losers?

Well-cast yet ponderous post-Tarantino honor among thieves story based on George V. Higgins' novel "Cogan's Trade" about the knocking off of a mob-run poker game by a pair of jerk-offs who face the comeuppance by a world-weary hit-man (Pitt in very low-key mode, who produced as well) facing a nitpicking middle-man (Jenkins) and a gone-to-seed crony (Gandolfini in a mail-in turn). Directed by Andrew Dominik (who also adapted the screenplay) with some style but very little substance; a disappointment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic...Americana at its best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Today I watched a classic, a near damn perfect movie! "Killing Them Softly" is one of those rare movies which occur only once in a while. I was not a huge fan of Brad Pitt's previous collaboration with Andrew Dominik, "The Assassination Of Jessie James...", but in this subsequent outing both Pitt and Dominik have hit their stride. This is movie-making at its best in all aspects, form the acting to the directing and all else in-between. I had to pick-up my jaw of off the floor after seeing how good Brad Pitt was in this movie. He exists only to serve the movie, the character and the story and not the other way around. All ego and pretense have been stripped away here from ALL actors, and Pitt and his fellow cast members disappear in their respective roles. I was never sure about Pitt and his acting abilities, but this performance puts any lingering doubts and questions to rest. As good as his performances in movies like "Seven", "Twelve Monkeys" and "Fight Club" were, this one tops them all by a wide margin, it leaves "Money Ball" in the dust also. I fear that perhaps this movie will fly over many people's heads, who will instinctively dismiss it as anti-American propaganda, if so they could not be more mistaken. In addition, the trailers are, I find quite misleading. This movie is not a crime caper, it does not glamorize crime nor criminals, nor are there heroes anywhere to be found here. I would actually venture to say that through its profoundly cynical outlook and nihilistic nature, this is an anti-crime movie which goes against the grain of the established formula in this genre.In truth, the film really plays on the old adage "Crime doesn't pay". Not out of some spiritual, self-righteous or moral attitude, but in a very literal sense. The characters in this movie are not some big time hustlers and crime-lords with riches and power at their disposal, these are small time crooks, living a bleak, almost nightmarish existence on the outer edges of society, caught in a vicious cycle with very few if any options and choices. There are no exit signs anywhere to be found.This a gritty, dirty, raw and bloody film, and I mean that as the highest compliment. It is beautiful in its stark, cold, ugly and ultimately unforgiving portrayal of nature and reality. At times I had to remind myself that this movie was shot and filmed in the US, because the imagery resembles at times something out a post-apocalyptic vision. In the film even the criminals are broken and beaten down, as effectively portrayed by James Gandolfini's worn out character. The power of the movie resides in the filthy, raunchy and dirty dialogue, while all action there is and the ensuing violence are as basic and bereft of any heroism, mysticism or bravery as possible, it is uncomfortable and disturbing to watch and the reason why it is so effective. People die badly and miserably, there is no way around it. Though I must say that Ray Liotta figures in one of the more breathtaking shots I've seen in a while in movies! "Killing Them Softly" takes place around 2008 during both the financial crisis and the elections. Politicians such as George W. Bush, Barack Obama and John McCain, and an assortment of "pesonalities" talk in the background throughout the movie almost as a dour, hypocritical and utterly non-sensical soundtrack completely at odds with what you see on the screen. This movie is as close as there is to a post-mortem of the American Dream, which nicely ties in with a morgue scene towards the end of the movie. The result of the post-mortem: it is a failure. While some may find that the movie beats its viewers over the head with its themes and subject matter, I for one think that that was intentional and it works. These days people have to be hit with a sledgehammer so as to be awaken from their apathy, lethargy and complacence. For me the movie succeeds at doing just that.This film is brilliant in its single-minded obviousness. There are no surprise endings, no twists, the movie is smarter than that and does not insult its audience with cheap parlour tricks. Whatever you think will happen, will probably happen, the people you suspect will die, will most likely do so. There are no good guys or bad guys here, just grey guys in various shades (no pun intended). Cogan (Pitt) is not a villain, he is just good at his trade, which makes for a nice reference to Higgins's novel and original title of the movie "Cogan's Trade". He is a survivor, because he is a cynical individual, not a touchy-feely one, he does not have an overabundance of sentiments, as he says, he likes, when talking of his victims, to "kill them softly from a distance and not get involved with feelings or have to think about them" (I'm just paraphrasing here). He survives because he accepts all this cynicism and fatalism as a state of being. In "Killing Them Softly", Andrew Dominik studies the American experiment and gets to its heart, and the conclusions he draws are not pretty. America now belongs to middle management types (Richard Jenkin's character) and everything is ruled by committee, even crime.The post-script, or epilogue, to this movie is something to behold. It is not what Pitt says, but how he says it, it goes something like (paraphrasing again), "Don't make me laugh...I live in America, and in America you are on your own...This whole country is a business, now f **king pay me!". That there pretty much sums up the entire movie.If there is any cosmic justice left, this movie will get the recognition that it deserves, but just like the movie, I won't hold my breath for it to happen!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When the mob 'sort things out' it's more serious than returning the dosh.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prior to Killing Them Softly, Andrew Dominik had written and directed two very different but equally good films: Chopper and the cumbersomely titled The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford. The first was harsh, intense and violent while the second, though also murderous, was far more cerebral, relying on the silences and dialogue to set the tone rather then the actual violence. Killing Them Softly falls somewhere between the two films but lacks the impact or intensity of either.Perhaps a better title would have been 'Scroats and Lowlifes' but I'm sure George V. Higgins, upon whose novel, Cogan's Trade, this is based, would have something derogatory to say about that. However, it would tell you instantly what to expect. Welcome to the dark, depressed end of Louisiana in the months before Obama becomes president. Lowlife Frankie (Scoot McNairie, star of 2010's superb Monsters) and scroat Russell (Ben Mendelsohn from The Dark Knight Rises), decide to hit a mob-protected card game run by Markie (Ray Liotta). They succeed; all is well. Except Russell can't stop his mouth from running and word get's back to the big guys who bring in their enforcer, Jackie Coogan (Brad Pitt) to sort things out. And when the mob 'sort things out' it's a little more serious than simply handing back the dosh.Dominik appears to be aiming for a darker cousin to Pulp Fiction and fills the 97-minute running time with elongated monologues that, like Tarantino's masterpiece, have little to do with proceedings but give flesh to characters who would otherwise be mono-dimensionally awful. Unfortunately it doesn't work in Killing Them Softly and the time drags on and on and on as the stage whisper from the girl in the back row attested: "I'm struggling to stay awake." It should be sharp, it should chill, but it serves only to bore and there's the overriding impression of Dominik yelling "You WILL appreciate every syllable of my screenplay!" As a result, there are a few superb monologues that will have drama students drooling over their audition piece potential but mostly they are rather too self-conscious and aggrandizing. The dialogue is littered with expletives and obscenities that don't add spice but form the infrastructure of the language. Remove every 'f**k' and you could probably reduce the running time by a good 15 minutes. It's not offensive, just incredibly tedious, like watching a great film on US TV but never being able to be fully absorbed because every ten minutes there's another commercial break. I say it's not offensive but my companion for the evening departed after thirty minutes because he didn't want to face any more of the barrage of abuse and violence from the despicable characters upon the screen.I understand his reasons entirely but, clumsily portrayed as it is, that is entirely the reason for it. The creatures imbibing, stabbing, shooting, bitching on the screen are despicable. We're not supposed to like them; we're intended to pity them in their squalor and cross the street hurriedly if we ever meet them. James Gandolfini's Mickey is a contemptible, brain-scrambled, alcoholic hit man and even the nameless driver (Richard Jenkins), the bloke who could easily be your friend's dad, is a moral cesspit in a body. It is testament to the degradation on display that Coogan, a cold, unpleasant killer for hire, is a charismatic hero compared to the human junk around him. In creating that, Dominik has excelled. Pitt is effortlessly captivating as the killer with a brain who lulls his prey and colleagues into a false comfort zone and either offs them himself or arranges for others to remove them from his path. He's no sadist seeking the high of another torture; rather he views those with chemical dependencies as weak and pointless. Coogan is in it not for the kicks but for the cash. It's his job, he takes pride in it and he's coldly proficient.In my review for Savages I eluded to the work of the music supervisor and the skill in selecting recordings that enhance the film. In this instance it is Rachel Fox who weaves the musical magic opting not for songs of the period but taking the approach that anything up to the period is usable. It works beautifully. Possibly the standout moment of Killing Them Softly is a slow motion ballet of bullets, blood and glass to the accompaniment of Ketty Lester's Love Letters that is shocking, captivating and everything that Dredd hoped to be but failed as absolutely as is possible. Rewind buttons were made for this scene.Alas it is a rare blossom of exquisite, filmic beauty in an endless desert of gloom and tedium.For more reviews from The Squiss subscribe to my blog at www.thesquiss.co.ukLike the Facebook page: http://on.fb.me/RpitOG</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tarantinoesque</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yet to be officially released in its country of origin, Killing Them Softly is more than likely to fulfil the appetite of the film loving citizens of the United States, come 30th November 2012.In stylistic terms, the Tarantinoesque narrative, patience, themes and cinematographic techniques are admirable and the most sensationally constructed aspects of this feature. The synchronisation of beating hearts throughout the theatre audience envelop as we encounter the countless instances of unpredictable tension. The concordant silence of the juxtaposed peace of the viewers and slow, quiet rising action of the narrative beautifully create a wonderful cinematic experience that defines the concept of escapism. The built-up tension throughout is comparable with Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds (2009) in its ability to leave you gasping without a sound, comfortably at the edge of your seat, and incessantly questioning the outcome of a given scene or sequence of events prior to its elaboration.The premise is rather basic, not generic, just solemnly basic. Our protagonist Jackie Cogan (Brad Pitt) hunts for those responsible for an intricate (from their perspective) gambling heist, though must do so with brief precaution, assistance, and an economic motive. The continuous, overtly presented political undertone is rather obscure throughout the 97 minutes; well perhaps until the final of those, consequently resulting in an expository finale.Killing Them Softly by no means succeeds in all its qualities. Mickey's (James Gandolfin) negligible contribution to the events ensued are perplexing in that one wonders the necessity of this character's inclusion. The buildup for his involvement is one of a stale nature, whereby our phenomenally assembled tempo and the engaging experience are lost amidst a fairly dull existence in character. Ambiguously introduced, we expect a revelation of his significance; however, this does not occur. Not that I condone temporarily departing from a theatre during a screening of any film for any reason, though if one were to require a release of fluids, a telecommunication necessity or alternatively, the intake of overpriced fluids, then the appropriate time to partake in a voluntary absence from the film would be when James Gandolfin is introduced, as wandering away for his twenty(ish) minutes of screen time would cause minimal alteration to our perception of the narrative. Nevertheless, following his departure, there is a revival and return to the superb quality of filmmaking, in conjunction with superior storytelling.Killing Me Softly as an overall motion picture is not necessarily a breathtaking masterpiece, though it may prove itself to be one of 2012's features that are more memorable than many of the other dishes we tried. We were served with a delightfully satisfying starter that fulfilled our appetite until a somewhat distasteful main course approached. Despite this, the desert saved the meal from becoming an exacerbated cliché in the world of cinema, and this is indeed a theatrical experience worthy of the time, expense and effort for any moviegoer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is being falsely advertised as a gangster shoot em up. it is nothing like that. Its an allegory for big business and politics. The film has some interesting ideas but little else. It is a satire that isn't funny, a thriller that doesn't thrill, a talking piece with a message that doesn't hold the attention.The cast do their best, but the quality of their best varies. Brad Pitt is one of , if not the, most over-rated actors working in Hollywood today.he has never impressed me as an actor in anything he has ever done and he pretty much fails here as well.Probably one to catch on TV...in my personal opinion its not worth paying to see at the cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Man, I love gangster movies. Anything by Scorsese, William Monahan, Guy Ritchie, Terence Winter, or just about anything from the genre, whether its based on a true story or simply fiction. Then why was this movie so bad? One, is your leading actor isn't on screen until 30 minutes in, and you only see the side of his face, leaving no impact whatsoever and making him less relevant. Two, there's no music at all until 40 minutes in. Up until then its only speeches by Bush and Obama, and some FTC hearing speeches, some as old as eight years old. I understand that the message was to say that these gangsters were products of the environment and times we live in, but as the movie progresses we see they are just genuine low-lives, not interesting as characters. Three, the fight scenes seem overly glossy, like I'm watching a music video, with an over saturation of blood and crunching noises.Those are just some points, as I quickly found myself losing interest in the characters, and the movie as a whole. Looking at who directed it, I guess it's no surprise, "Jesse James" was full of bland characters and uninspired dialogue.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Killing Them Softly is a 2012 film based on a 1974 novel named Cogan's Trade by George V. Higgins. The writer and director Andrew Dominik, updated the story to our present day economic crisis, the movie deals with the situation where gambling is one of the financial fuel of in the American economy.During the movie, you get to see the political campaign between Obama and McCain during the 2008 American Presidential election. Other than the inclusion of Brad Pitt's fine acting this movie was boring and the dark comic relief that was suppose to keep you watching, kinda went over my head.The movie does not boast of fine cinematography also, shots taking from the car sometimes were a little not in frame and I kept wishing the camera will be taken in front so I can see their faces instead of their side face in a shadowy exterior. Then there is the dialogue which seemed awfully too long, before something started. Then there is the introduction of a character another hit-man named Mickey Fallon (James Gandolfini) whose presence or absence in this movie would not have made any difference. So it beats me why the writer included him.The movie plot is about a greedy proprietor of a gambling ring in New Orleans Markie Trattman (Ray Liotta), he decided instead of just taking the money the house makes, he wanted to take it all so he robbed the place. He did this by hiring two men to come in while he was there and rob the place, so as to look innocent. Many of the crime gangs and his bosses were not pleased by what happened so he was interrogated and he lied that he had nothing to do with it.Things died down for a while, then during a timeout with his guys, drunk and excited he (Markie) tells everyone that he was the one who robbed the gambling house, now everyone knows, but he is left alive and no one takes a whack at him, till.One small time crook gets an idea in his head, why not he rob Markie's gambling house again, this time people will think Markie did it again since he got away with it first time, and also it will open some old wounds and this will make Markie take the fall and they get away with the money.Things were going well till Brad Pitt as Jackie Cogan was brought on board to bring order to the situation, his introduction brings out the name of the movie as he said he likes, "Killing them softly" shooting them at a distance so he doesn't have to witness the emotions of begging.The thing is independent film makers sometimes have a way to either make you run to the cinemas or make you wish you never took the chance. I wish I never took the chance.www.lagsreviews.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brad Pitt is Brad Pitt</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Australian writer-director Andrew Dominik is perhaps best known for his slow, contemplative and slow 2007 work of art, The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford ? a film whose length lived up to its long-winded title (and did I mention it was slow?). But the assured, masterful direction by Dominik compelled me to seek out his debut film, Chopper. The 2000 release was one of the very first Australian films I've seen ? I'm discounting Finding Nemo here ? and it immediately turned me into an Andrew Dominik believer. The movie is also largely the reason I've forgiven Australia for its cricket team, and Eric Bana for Hulk.Because where The Assassination of? was a carefully constructed, atmospheric, epic western, Chopper was a wickedly funny, dark, twisted and stylish crime film, that never took itself as art but had all the makings of it. And it was not long. Or slow. It is the movie Dominik should and deserves to be known for.In Killing Them Softly, Dominik returns to his Chopper roots, but mixes it up, every now and then, with the considered deliberation of The Assassination of? and some blatant social commentary, to give us his most accomplished film to date, though one that falls short of being the masterpiece it is being hyped to be.The film follows the aftermath of a mob heist by three amateur crooks, who are admittedly "not the smartest guys", when the mob calls in a trusted enforcer, Jackie Cogan (Brad Pitt), to investigate. Billed as a crime thriller, the movie's plot is about as predictable as Brad Pitt's elf-like, immortal good looks (he's never going to be good for your ego), but it's what Dominik manages to conjure on the path to the movie's inevitable climax that constantly surprises you and is worth your ticket's price.Set in sparse New Orleans, the movie builds one of the most dramatic and tense heist scenes on camera, relying not on suggestive music but instead on silence as the operative prop, offset only by the nervous energy of actor Scoot McNairy. Then there's the reinterpretation of the mob shakedown scene where the audience is subjected to just as much of the raw, gritty and stomach-churning treatment that Ray Liotta's character is. There are also Tarantino-esque conversations between goons, black comedy like only the Coen Brothers can manage, and a warped nod to David Chase's Sopranos through James Gandolfini's pitiful Mickey whose conversations with Pitt's Cogan set Dominic's take on contemporary mafia apart from the recycled versions we've seen too many times.And then there's style ? slow motion shattering of glass during a hit, use of Johnny's Cash's 'The man comes around' to introduce Cogan, and a surreal take on a hilarious stoner conversation, all establish Dominik as a uniquely gifted director. He is of course helped by the fantastic cast he has lined up in the movie ? from Animal Kingdom's Ben Mendelsohn, who brings about the biggest laughs as a zoned-out goon, to the dependable Richard Jenkins, who is the lawyer face of the recession- hit mafia, and everyone in between.All these elements should guarantee a classic, but the movie's in-your- face social commentary makes it seem like Dominic's trying a little too hard. The movie takes place during the 2008 recession and Obama's 'Yes we can' pre-election hope campaign, and draws parallels between corporate America and the mob. And if anyone missed the 40,000 instances where the campaign videos are playing in the background, Pitt's Cogan spells it out in the end too, so we get a quotable line for our Facebook status messages and believe that the movie is far more layered than we have discerned.The pace of the movie is also uneven and at times, it veers so far off the point that the point then seems like a hair follicle on Anil Kapoor's chest. There's also something to be said about Brad Pitt, whose charisma lights up every scene he is in. The biggest hurdle Brad Pitt has faced in his movies is that he is Brad Pitt. Because no matter how good an actor Pitt is, there are always those moments where the movie star breaks out of the mask and the audience goes, "That was so Brad Pitt!"If the sum of the movie's remarkable scenes make for a great film, then Killing Them Softly deserves all its laurels, but seen as a whole, the movie's like those exotic restaurants where delicious comes in such finite quantity that you need to go home and chomp on a box of Pringles to satiate your stomach. If you do the same, seek out Chopper, while at it.- Nikhil Taneja (Firstpost.com) www.twitter.com/tanejamainhoonFor more reviews: http://www.firstpost.com/author/nikhil</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When three small-time crooks decide to raid a mob-protected card game, things don't quite go according to plan, and slick hit-man Brad Pitt is brought in to wipe every misjudged mistake-maker out of the picture. Andrew Dominik's imposing new crime drama aims for a realist aesthetic, making excellent use of fixed-camera chat scenes and hand-held-shot brawls against a familiar Obama vs. McCain backdrop. Hopeless drunk James Gandolfini, razor-sharp dialogue and satisfying character depth make for solid entertainment, and the film's strongest scene: a Tarantino-esque slo-mo car shooting is arguably the greatest cinematic moment of 2012 thus far.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A slow pace movie that relies on patience and witty dialog. One can not ignore the fantastic cast of veterans within this vision of violence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Responsible for Chopper (2000), Andrew Dominik carries his violent imagination onwards and beyond The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (2007), revealing the dark and twisted character of Jackie Cogan (Brad Pitt); a gun for hire who unlike most assassins, the thoughts of killing his target from a distance is quite pleasuring.Following the heist of a mob protected poker game, the two amateurs involved are Frankie (Scoot McNairy) and his not-so trusty side-kick, Russell (Ben Mendelsohn). Both guys work for low-key puppet Johnny (Vincent Curatola) who runs a business around Frankie and Russell, with a pay-day depending on the job Johnny supplies.It is no routine job this time around as Johnny convinces Frankie and Russell to hold up a poker game hosted by Markie Trattman (Ray Liotta), who previously, organized his own cohorts to hold up a protected poker game, leaving himself reveling in the mobs cash. So it is when Johnny sees the second time round an opportunity for some easy money, as well as sticking the blame on Markie's head, opening up a whole new can of worms for everyone involved.Looking for an immediate response and a possible conclusion to this mess, it is when associates within the mob begin to question those responsible, hiring Jackie Cogan (Pitt) to investigate and wipe out the gang behind the heist.Killing them softly is not much different from your basic mobster concept, but it does supply two factors; the social setting that reveals the harsh reality of the economic downfall within the slums of America, and a violent drama that although moves at a slow pace, the overall scenes of murder and dialog result in a movie supporting realistic fashion.Andrew Domink's latest does carry a lot of pro-American substances, but balances the concept quite well as the cast of characters shed light on the real America, reflecting on a minority of lower class individuals looking to find richness through violence and corruptness. As Jackie Cogan puts it, he represents a personality in business...the killing business.Although quite short, Killing them softly is a delightful watch, showing the violence and portrayal from all angles. Unfortunately the movie did feel the need to over exaggerate the dialog element of the film. James Gandolfini's character Micky, who is also brought in by Jackie, had so much potential to make a real mark in filming, but was overlooked by some humorous, sometimes dragged out scenes that failed to express the character he was brought in to represent.The plot is a no-brainer as the main ingredient of the movie was to invite the audience into the lives of certain individuals such as Frankie, Jackie, Micky and many more. Although the constant dialog is smartly written and at times really funny, an hour and fifteen minutes is built up to a climax that ends just like you expected, but all too soon, and without any character development.Some will enjoy the short concept from Andrew as his vision resembles cult classics such as Reservoir Dogs, Mean Streets and Snatch, which are relatively short, characterized movies, but succeeded in having a memorable impact on the audience.Killing them Softly is a fine example of a film that does not need high-octane action to wow the viewers, instead it teases by nit-picking at the shots of realistic violence and the aftermath of emotions.Overall; A refreshing movie with fantastic performances from all of the cast involved. Killing them softly is unique in its own way, supplying a nice soundtrack to match its gritty ambiance. Lacking the action the majority might have expected, the concept is not for everyone.

		<fullReview>You know how these corporations go, one makes a monster movie and the rest follow? Well I was Lincoln recently and thought that was the most boring film of 2012....until I watched this! So maybe this is the time of boring movies, with too much dialogue for no apparent reason other than to confuse you, lead you down dead ends in the script, and ultimately leave you perplexed and regretting ever sitting down to watch this! It is impossible to find anything positive to say about this....except perhaps, if you're positive you want to bore someone rigid, then this is certainly the film to do it with.With this cast you would expect great performances, but the pointless dialogue and script dead ends simply leave you asking what the point of each scene is and ultimately what the point of the movie is?Is there some hidden meaning in many of the apparently meaningless scenes?Is the George W Bush/ Barack O'bama (well he is Irish) soundtrack significant?

		<fullReview>Honestly I don't get what the critics saw in this movie and highly praising Brad Pitts work in it. When I saw the poster for this film I thought there was going to be plenty of action but boy was I wrong. There was basically no plot!! I didn't understand what the heck was going on. The characters were completely unlikeable. Swear words like F you were overused. The length of the film was VERY slow going that I attempted to fall asleep but couldn't thinking something was going to happen to keep me engaged. I literally felt like walking out of the theatre like four people in the theatre did earlier. But the worst part was the end. It was like someone writing a novel on paper and you can tell there is still more to be told but... it just ended abruptly. But I didn't care!! Was I glad to walk out there. The worst film I've ever seen in my life so far.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I could not believe that how such a dark and bad scenario put on scene, how Brad Pitt convinced to take a role in this movie. My family and our friends felt ourselves cheated by the movie posters and by using Pitt s name to attract people. Mr. Obama and the bad guys in the film had more speeches than Pitt, and BRad only killed 3-4 people nothing else. A bad guy 's her-in session and a hired killer's past family story (not related to the movie) took 15 min of the film. Imagine a movie with Pitt that almost one third (optimistic) of the scenario lyrics are "fuc-ing" and its derivatives; unbelievable. We all felt very bad and angry after the film, against the producers, and marketing groups of this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Looking at some of the other comments here, I'm not sure if I and other reviewers have seen the same movie...A movie must involve a skillful work which has a big event an introduction, body &amp; conclusion... But, "Killing Them Softly" has nothing inside even there was no story mechanism... Terrible scenario and acting... I guess, Hollywood needs new ideas, directors, script writers &amp; projects. "Killing Them Softly" is totally, loss of time... There is no "big event" and/or excitement in the film. I get surprised cause Brad Pitt never took place in that kind of simple way of money making projects before... I could not show patience till the end. Even 1 point is too much for it.</fullReview>

We kept looking at each other like "this WILL get better, right??" VERY bloody scenes, script was very dull, just a bad all-around movie. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!Amazingly, we were going to see Playing For Keeps, but it got worse ratings that this one did.

I did sit through this awful movie just to see if it would improve. It didn't get any better!!! I expected a gritty hit-man/mob movie. With actors like Ray Liotta and James Gandolfini, I expect a gritty complex crime drama. Instead I got a convoluted crappy movie. The characters were not well defined. The political background noise of President Bush was done as a political statement for President Obama but I didn't understand why it was there. Brad Pitt's attacks about Thomas Jefferson were inaccurate and offensive. If I ever have the chance to meet Mr. Pitt I will demand my money back and ask him to some how restore the time I lost watching this movie which I consider the worst movie I have ever seen!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

The title actually should be Killing audience softly. I would advice people not to even thinking of watching it.

It is the worst film (if I could say the word film for this...) i have ever ever seen. Casting texts are very boring and are about nothing. I sympathize such a good actors but they had to do hard work because they had to speak in such long long and uninteresting texts... And now when I am writing this review I can not write more than two lines about this film. Sorry for this and I am repeating but I have to write 10 lines so i can say that it is the worst film i have ever seen. And I highly do not recommend to watch it. Yes the trailer seems to be interesting but the film is so boring... I have never seen that about 10 people left the cinema hall after 15 minutes and at the end of the film there were about 20 people (including me) in the cinema hall from about 100 people... I think this would say everything about this film DO NOT WAIST YOUR TIME AND DO NOT SEE IT!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am going to start out by saying that there was so much wrong with this film that I don't even know where to start. Emma saw this film before I did and I have not seen her review, but I know she had to be thinking after she saw it that "Catt is going to hate this film". You know what, she would be right. When the film first started there was this really creepy music playing that had me thinking whether or not I walked into the wrong theater. The music got weirder as the film went on. I also want to know what the deal was with all the financial broadcasting about the economy in the background of almost every scene they shot. Maybe it was some kind of subliminal messaging, but I sure didn't get it. It was more annoying than anything else. They even found un-clever ways of incorporating the president into some of the scenes. Were they trying to say that it is the president's fault that people have to resort to crime in this economy? Who knows? The only thing that I found remotely interesting was a scene that was shot in slow motion so that you could get the full effect of a violent act. The film mainly centers around the activities of Frankie (Scoot McNairy) and Russell (Ben Mendelsohn), who are two junkies looking for a way to score some quick cash. When things go bad, Jackie (Brad Pitt) is brought in to rectify the situation. I am not sure why Brad got top billing in this film. He really didn't do a whole lot in the action department, but when he did; it was brutal. However he did manage to do a lot of talking. I guess they just needed a big name to draw people into the theater, because the story was definitely not going to do the trick. I am not really sure why Mickey (James Gandolfini) was even in the film. They could have left his character out completely and it would not have changed the outcome of the film one bit. Markie Trattman (Ray Liotta) is the catalyst that gets the ball rolling in this film. I found his character to be one of the stupidest. I was truly bored in this film. When the film was about three quarters of the way done, I could have sworn that I heard someone snoring in the theater. This film was killing me softly in the theater. I give it a red light.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Killing Them Softly is a film that loves the sound of its own voice. It is so convinced that it is a good film that it purposely over-indulges in utterly pointless and yawn-inducing monologues and conversations seemingly to try and boast the writer's ability to fill pages with dialogue instead of thrills. Adding to the irksome scenes of banal conversation is an entire LP's worth of jazzy tunes set to painfully bad ultra-slow motion shots that are supposed to look artsy fartsy. There's no underlying purpose to the silly photography full of pretentious tricks, self-indulgent slow motion and grainy filters. Simple is often best. The excessive slow-motion robs the audience of any understanding of what is going on. Leaving the stupid shooting style and hedonistic screenplay to one side, the plot? Who cares? I didn't. When the 90 minute crime flick finally climaxes, nothing much has actually happened on screen. Being on the verge of falling asleep after several scenes of tedious, non-stop dialogue, you'll be happy just for it to be over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>America's Not a Country, It's a Business - Killing Them Softly Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Killing Them Softly' is not for the optimists in the world. It is a very dark comedy and a damn cynical film about the state of American society. But if you love to indulge in the cynicism of films such as 'A Clockwork Orange' and 'Taxi Driver,' coupled with the visual style of 'Drive,' 'Killing Them Softly' will take you for one hell of a ride, albeit a talkative ride.Brad Pitt stars as Jackie Cogan, an enforcer called into town after two young men rob Markie Trattman's (Ray Liotta) mob-operated poker game. His job is simple, eliminate and contain the fallout as quickly and quietly as possible. The situation is in many ways a detailed MacGuffin, allowing writer/director Andrew Dominik to meditate and ponder where we, as a society, find ourselves in the aftermath of the 2008 financial collapse, which is occurring as the film plays out. Each character and group serves as a stand-in for a party involved or affected by the collapse (the U.S. government, Wall Street, the American people), and Dominik intricately weaves a narration from former President Bush and then-Senator Barack Obama to help propel the story forward. While this narration is a little too on the nose at times, it does serve as an effective tool for those looking to have a more analogous experience watching the film. There are overt political themes running throughout the film, but Dominik is careful to not swing the narrative too far in favor of one political party over the other. Despite being clearly anti-Capitalist, neither George Bush or Barack Obama come out of this film looking quite like the heroes their respective parties want them to be, nor does Dominik place the blame on America's current situation squarely on either one of their shoulders. Instead Dominik tackles the broader issues he believes are hurting America, the spoils of Capitalism, the ineffectiveness of government, and the ease at which American people are willing to stop trying and give in to despair.The film is by no means performance driven, but that doesn't stop the main cast for turning in excellent performances. Brad Pitt is very solid in one of his unforgiving roles, he gets lost in this character in a way we don't usually see from him. Between this and last year's double feature of 'Tree of Life' and 'Moneyball,' Pitt is on a roll, and it would be a shame to see him retire from acting, as he has been hinting at doing, anytime in the near future. James Gandolfini and Ray Liotta are also standouts in limited scenes, but, more than any performance, 'Killing Them Softly' is primarily a visual driven picture.Director Andrew Dominik showed with 'The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford' that he has a unique flair for visuals, and he only continues his growth behind the camera with 'Killing Them Softly.' It's hard to pin down where he draws his inspiration, but there seems to be quite a bit of Malick in his use of camera in that he doesn't necessarily following his characters across the frame, he follows the story. Whether that means lingering on the desolate and depleted sidewalks of New Orleans, on staying with the television set showing Barack Obama addressing Congress, Dominik isn't afraid to force his viewers to sit down and really examine the message he's trying to present.If there is one flaw in the film, it's that it all flies by so past (it's a brisk 97 minutes) you don't have much time to get to know any of the characters outside of Cogan and Gandolfini's Mickey. While it mostly works for this type of film, there are several minor characters, whose actions all play significantly into how the story plays out, who get little to no screen time at all. This is directly a result of Dominik being forced to trim an hour of footage out of his original, two and a half hour cut, so it's hard to really criticize him or the film for what the studio forced him to do. That being said, a director's cut sometime in the future would be much appreciated.Despite the film's achievements, it seems unlikely to be acknowledged by the Academy. An adapted screenplay nomination and possibly a cinematography nod seem to be the ceiling of the film's awards potential, as it will be far too divisive to gather any steam come December and January. That being said, 'Killing Them Softly' is truly an excellent film that stands as a highlight in what has been a slow and mostly disappointing year in film.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's been a long wait. "Killing Them Softly" won't disappoint Andrew Dominik fans.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been a long wait. Admittedly, the wait for The Assassination of Jesse James, my all-time favourite film, was way more torturous, even though it was significantly shorter. I couldn't even imagine a followup. I was extremely excited by the potential of the image of Brad Pitt with a gun when it was posted online the first time a few years ago with the title Cogan's Trade. The genre and the collaboration feel like a winning combination. When it had the re-brand of Killing Them Softly (which they eventually make work in the film), I did lose quite a bit of anticipation, along with early preview showings having a mild response. Where Assassination can be overwhelming, Softly was more likely to underwhelm. I had low expectations. I had no idea whether I would warm to it as immediately as I did for Assassination, especially after reports that it resembled the gritty coldness of Chopper. I hoped I would. One minute in and I was hooked.Like Jesse James, the narrative drive is pushed back and there's a greater focus on characters, their opinions and what they represent. It does have quite an interesting and tragically ironic if unsympathetic story, even though the resolution is rather basic and unsurprising. It's how its handled that makes it engaging. Similar to the Wood Hite/Dick Liddel standoff in Jesse James, it holds that heart-in-throat tension throughout the majority of its confrontation scenes with long takes in real time, attention to detail and pregnant pauses. It's thoroughly thrilling and intimate. In contrast, the rest of the film is devoted to conversation scenes, mostly either involving Scoot McNairy's robber Frankie or Brad Pitt's hit-man Jackie Cogan, which gives the film its art-house edge. These scenes are very fascinating even if they slow the pace sometimes and involve trivial stories and anecdotes that later show parallels to the main story. The film's biggest charm is its dark sense of humour and memorable assassination and violent scenes.The driving force of the film though is its pessimistic and slimy tone (many of the characters are constantly sweaty). It's gritty in character and subject, featuring grimy cinematography and great desolate set pieces with a dark black/grey colour scheme. While Jesse James focuses on the grand and grizzly beauty of the old west, Killing Them Softly is smaller scale, with a very shallow depth of field to the point where only a part of a face is in focus and the background is dramatically out of focus. There's a distinct use of centralising characters (particularly Frankie) in the center of the screen and while the frame starts at a distance, disconnected from the characters, it gets closer and more invasive during high tension scenes. There's little interesting experimental styles all over the place too such as an instance where they attach the camera to a car door while it slams, extreme slow motion and intentionally jarring editing within the opening scene. It's also got a fantastic and inventive use of sound design, whispering and crackling to the point of feeling aged.All the performances are fantastic but the standout is Scoot McNairy, whose nervous yet confident performance is the most endearing, emotional and funny. Brad Pitt's Jackie Cogan is a character with many ambiguous dimensions and is fascinating to watch but only sometimes to listen to. James Gandolfini and Richard Jenkins' roles are limited to a few conversations with Pitt but they are still very engaging, perfectly expressing the greed of Gandolfini's character and the paranoia and guilt of Jenkins' character. While the film focuses on interactions with no more than three characters at a time, it makes the network of characters seem bigger which makes it justified to say that a prominent amount of the cast are Goodfellas and The Sopranos alumni, with Ray Liotta, Vincent Curatola and Gandolfini. Just as The Sopranos took off from the highly stylised world of Goodfellas to continue the gangster culture in a more realistic way, Killing Them Softly does the same, making it even more gritty.Snarling gangster films like Killing Them Softly turn up in times of economical turmoil such as Bonnie and Clyde and the original Scarface. They're the best metaphor for an inner economy and desperate measures (in this instance, even comparing the lack of money to lack of women). There's a very significant amount of attention drawn to period politics, in particular the McCain/Obama race of 2008 and their analysis of the country and promises. It's directly referred to in the opening and ending but otherwise in the background of many of the scenes which does render it quite heavy handed, but the parallels drawn are necessary, if obvious. The ultimate message of the film is about personal responsibility and how that can be skewered, with even victims of the main plot's crime being punished despite knowingly innocent and comparing that to how America works despite the country's leaders never drawing attention to it. Some have considered the film too short, but I felt it ended at its most powerful moment. A very satisfying, intelligent and raw film from one of the best if slowest directors of contemporary times.9/10</fullReview>

Christ that's ?25 down the pan, this film better be good! Oh Dear!I'm not going into massive detail here but basically, it really was that bad ? I can give you what I thought up to about 35 minutes, no more! Why? Cause I walked out, its complete dribble &amp; utterly predictable. The best bits, were its humour ? there is an Australian character that does well &amp; is key around the films humour, I liked him (watch out for how fast he eats the ice lolly in the beginning of the film, one frame it's there ? way down, the next frame ? gone!). No, seriously though, he's good.The big problem for me was, what's the point to the film? It's so predictable ? I could see where it was all going &amp; I thought what's the point in wasting another 60 minutes ? I left and took the wife for a meal.She didn't like the 'beating scene' but hey, you get them in 'gangster films' ? but I wasn't expecting it from these 'gangster', as these gangsters listened to party political broadcasts on there tele's whenever near a goggle box &amp; insisted on listing to political talk radio station on guess what... yeah that's right 'politics'. So I was expected a big debate, not a beating!What was with all the politics crap, I didn't stick around to find out ? maybe you don't get to find out. It was just so poor, poor, poor, and poor! Thought Brad Pitt was really scraping the bottom of the barrel here, I really did. I didn't think the acting was up to much either, sorry to contrast you seasoned reviewers but really ? Brad in the car having his paddy was shallow, again poor.DO NOT go and pay to watch this, if you must watch it ? wait till it's on Sky!I have learnt a valuable lesson here, only ever go to the cinema and watch what you set out to, if like me the projector is broken, go to a pub &amp; happily spend ?25 on your wife or girlfriend on stupid named cocktails that you'd never in a million years do otherwise ? the missus will love you until the intoxication where's off at least.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frankly, this is my worst film experience in years. I was not really enthusiastic about Andrew Dominik's previous effort, but came to see his new film with an open mind considering the praise it is receiving everywhere. Let me tell you : do not believe any of the good critics. Firstly, there is no plot to speak of, then every single character is absolutely disgusting (physically as well as morally), the violence is extreme and "stylized" in the most vulgar way, and lastly the sets and images are depressingly ugly... The director tries to build his film around discussions that are mainly digressions from the plot that is primarily established... and promptly abandoned. A.Dominik tries very much to make a film like Tarantino or Guy Ritchie, but with even less talent ! Who wants to hear a fat drunk killer ranting about his sex life with whores for 10 minutes ? The worst part is that the director weaves his film with debates that surrounded the 2008 election, with speeches by Obama, George W Bush and others... The message is clear : A. Dominik feels disappointed with Barack Obama. But he didn't have to throw at me that depressing and filthy excuse of a film posing as art (look at those ugly killings in slow motion or subjective shots of people high on drugs!!!).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First time i walked out of a movie theater, before the movie ended that is. First review online. I just had to.I love most of the cast, and they do play their roles well (pitt, liotta), but the movie itself offers nothing, in my opinion. It has the pace of a drama, but no story, emotion, thread to hang on to; the depth of your typical action movie, without the action, the twists and the plots. Just meaningless dialogs. I wish i could call it mental mastur**tion, but im not sure the creators intended this. It has "something", i will give them that. A "glimmer", a shiver, something that kept me sitting there for 1 hour, thinking, it must be worth it.It isn't. It wasn't. I know where they were going with this, but the creators had lost themselves, and the movie,trying to prove they can make an old fashioned crime drama, movie just goes on, with physical comedic pauses to draw out a laugh, but the "alternative-crime-drama-70s art" point was pushed point till the end, it seems, for creators own sake. At least 25% of the cinema walked out before i did.Movies like these, with such great cast, make it easier to download illegal copies online, for those who decide on such acts.(for disclosure, i enjoy TV shows/movies such as Boardwalk Empire, Lost in translation, Jeff who lives at home, War Horse, Legend of Jesse James, Tree of life, Bored to death, etc)</fullReview>

The story revolves around 7 characters but there's no character development or back story to a character. I just waited and waited and waited for something that would " thrill " me but it just dint happen and went on as a never ending drama with political speeches by Obama in the middle. The only time I was thrilled was when I left the cinema after the credits started to roll. It is all political, this film. Indirectly lets Americans know about some of Obama's mistakes. What's the message ? Don't vote for Obama. That's what the whole point is in this film. I wasted my time and money on this.</fullReview>

You must be thinking why I went to see this film in the first place if it was that bad - well, it was a last minute plan with friends, and since we all met up straight from work, neither of us had the time or an opportunity to do some background research about this film.All the others were on a late show or they looked rubbish from the trailers, hence we had no choice but to go for this one...Overall, let's just say that I was a couple of extreme violent scenes away from throwing up in the cinema hall. Call me a lightweight or whatever - I don't care - but this is officially the worst movie i've ever seen. EVER!</fullReview>
