		<shortDescription>"Dum Spiro ? Spero" - While there's life there's hope.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would not argue that there could be better films made before and after Cabiria. Perhaps. But there never will be another "Nights of Cabiria" - the last Fellini's film with the linear structure, his third and the most successful collaboration with his actress wife, Giulietta Masina, his immortal love letter to her. Of all his characters, Fellini once said, Cabiria was the only one he was still worried about. Of all the characters, I've seen in the films, Cabiria is the one I often think about - what ever happened to her? Did she survive? Was she able to find love? I've never seen the face so alive, changing its expression every moment. If the face is the soul's mirror, Cabiria's (Masina's) face reflects her every single emotion and how effortlessly she goes from bitter cynicism to wistful yearning, from despair to hope, from tears to smile. While there's life there's hope. As long as Cabiria smiles in the end of this tragicomic masterpiece, there is hope for all of us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The "grandest finale" ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to tell which Fellini's film leads the way; "8 1/2", "La Dolce vita", "La strada", "Amarcord" and so many more, you just can't choose.But, when it comes to this beautiful picture, things become clearer. It's not just the amazing perfomance by Giullietta Masina, it's not just the wonderful, semi-crazy characters wondering around the screen and emphasizing Kabiria's sad and lonely world, it's -and that's the film's greatest quality- this sense of optimism that Fellini wants the viewer to take with him/her as he/she is leaving the theater. The master takes everything from his heroin but at the end he wants to convey one simple, eassy-to-grip but so essential message: "Please, don't give up". The power of the film's last ten minutes is unpreceded in the world of movies and, sad to say, never again have we seen such an amazing finale. This is a must-see film, and, most important of all, a film so generous to its viewers that one time is not enough. A total 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Federico Fellini, the genius of the Italian cinema left his imprint in all the films he directed for all of us to enjoy forever. "Le Notti di Cabiria" stands as one of his best because of the character of that invincible woman at the center of the story: Cabiria! Having recently seen the excellent copy that was shown at NY's Film Forum, this is a film that like good wine gets better with age.Fellini was the man whose idea was translated for the screen with his usual collaborators, Tulio Pinelli and Ennio Flaiano. Pier Paolo Passolini contributed to some of the dialog. Essentialy, this is a timeless tale of a woman that despite adversity, bad times, and all that is wrong around her, keeps her chin up and never begrudges a thing. In fact, Cabiria, despite of her profession, is a woman with a highly moral character.The film takes us back to another, more innocent era. We are shown a prostitute with a heart of gold who is always cheated by most of the men who comes in contact with her. Cabiria is never resentful, or bitter at the hand life throws her way.One of the best realized sequences of the film involves Cabiria being picked up by a handsome and popular actor, Alberto Lazzari. Alberto is about the only one in the movie that treats Cabiria with any semblance of warmth. Unfortunately, nothing happens between them because Alberto's lover, the gorgeous Jessy, arrives at Alberto's apartment to claim what's hers, leaving Cabiria shut up in a bathroom. If only her friends could see her then! Nobody would believe it!There is not a moment out of place in the film. Of course, Fellini had the incomparable Giulietta Masina playing the leading role. Ms. Masina is just too wonderful for words. She makes us believe she is Cabiria, and that's that, which in itself it's something other actresses try harder, without the same results. Ms. Masina's face reveals all that is going on within Cabiria. Together with all her other creations in other Fellini's films, this is perhaps her own triumph as an actress.Franca Marzi, who plays Cabiria's best friend, is also excellent. Amadeo Nazzari is perfect portraying the matinée idol, Alberto Lazzari. This was one of his best appearances in a distinguished career in the Italian cinema. The rest of the cast is wonderful.Fellini's masterpiece is a film that satisfies any time one sees it thanks to his vision and the presence of Giulietta Masina.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Giulietta's smile.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What do I love most about Federico Fellini's wondrous THE NIGHTS OF CABIRIA?I love the opening scenes when Cabiria (Giulietta Masina) is robbed and dumped in the Tiber River, and the bikinied Roman boys jump in to save her, but she is annoyed that they have saved her life because she wants to know what happened to Giorgio, who she thinks ran away because "he was scared." He's the one who had robbed and nearly drowned her.I love the many nocturnal scenes around the Passeggiata Archeologica in Rome where the gargoylish prostitutes, like angelic gargoyle Cabiria herself, are selected by their customers approaching in cars, and the wild and saucy humor that accompanies those scenes, particularly when they deal with one elephantine hooker named "Bomba Atomica."I love the scene at the religious shrine of Divina Amore, where everyone comes to vociferate their desired favors, and Cabiria pleads to be released from her life as a streetwalker, and the old lame man falls at the foot of the altar, unhealed. The intensity of the build-up, the virtuosic camera work, the faces of the pious, are all breathtaking.I love the famed scene in the sleazy theatre where Cabiria, at the hands of an unscrupulous hypnotist, relives a tender and poignant scene from her youth in front of a crowd of louts.I love the scenes in and around Cabiria's Ostia Road hovel, and the little boys who climb giant Jungle Jims and call out her name, and she waves back.I love Cabiria's friend Wanda (Franca Marzi), whom she loves dearly. She is a million times less vulnerable that our heroine and takes Cabiria's rants with gracious generosity.I love the scene of that night Cabiria spends in the luxurious villa of a movie star (Amedeo Nazzari.) She is totally out of her element, doesn't recognize lobster, cuddles a cute puppy as fragile as she is, butts her head against unseen doors.I love the deity-kissed music of Nino Rota, lilting us, as it captures the soul of Fellini's lovely wife, Giulietta/Cabiria. And I love the overwhelming and moving finale, when Cabiria is robbed by water once more, this time by a cruel scammer feigning love and for whom Cabiria was ready to start life anew. She rises from her anguish, and as she follows the road revelers, turns and smiles to us, to ME!?the most eloquent smile in Italian artistic creation since La Gioconda.Smile at us, Cabiria, or are you Giulietta Masina smiling now? Or both of you at once? We truly need that smile.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Film I Know</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not much in favor of "best" lists--I wouldn't make it in Cusack's "High Fidelity" world--but I can usually offer a range of titles of films that I consider the most powerful experiences I have had in front of a screen--Bicycle Thief, Ran, Ordet, Seventh Seal, Citizen Kane, L'Avventura, Rear Window, Blade Runner, quite a few others. But if I had to pick just one title, it would be Nights of Cabiria. I saw it when it first came out in this country--I was a junior in high school and fortunate enough to live near a theater that showed foreign films. It ran for several weeks and I kept going back to see it over and over, giving myself permission by dragging friends to see it. No one was ever disappointed, though only a couple of friends developed a comparable enthusiasm with mine. I have continued to seeit every chance I get, though I have not had the opportunity to see the latest reissue--I probably will have to see it onvideo or dvd, since the city I now live in rarely shows any foreign films. Giulietta Massina gives not just the greatestperformance of her career, but surely one of the greatestperformances ever recorded on film, and the sequence of Cabiria's experiences, at first seemingly random and insignificant, adds up to one of the most profound statements Fellini ever made about human life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unbelievably Great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the most perfect films ever committed to celluloid. It involved me more than at least 99% of other films I've seen, and the main character, Cabiria, is a character to cherish and love forever (of course, we who have seen La Strada are already partly familiar with the character). I've hardly ever cared more about a character, and even after only five minutes into the film, I wanted so desperately to protect her. Giulietta Masina is so masterful in her performance, and Federico Fellini, her husband, is as masterful in his direction. I did not believe that they could match their success with La Strada, but, in fact, they succeeded in surpassing it. Bravo. 10/10. One of the best films ever made, plain and simple.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Nights" of Fellini and Masina</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A prostitute whose life is a veritable study in the resilience of the human spirit is the subject of `Nights of Cabiria,' directed by Federico Fellini. Giulietta Masina stars as Cabiria, a gentle soul at heart who manages to maintain a positive outlook even in the face of adversity. Experiences that would leave those of lesser mettle jaded she is seemingly able to ward off and emerge from intact, with a guarded optimism that nevertheless leaves her open to whatever ills life may have in store for her next. But it is just that optimism and her sense of joy in the simple things that makes her so endearing. She is proud, for example, of the fact that she owns her own house, hovel though it may be. Though not one to be easily duped, she is vulnerable to sincere persistence, which has in the past rendered her victim to those who would take advantage of her, which is succinctly established in the opening scene of the film. Fellini's film is a study of how good may succumb to evil, and yet still triumph in the end (though open to subjective interpretation). It's something of an examination of endurance; how many times can one be knocked down before finally being unable to stand back up again. At the same time, however, it's an example of how purity can prevail against even the utmost cruelty. There is a humanity manifested in Cabiria that somehow gives absolution, not only to her lifestyle, but to those who would willingly do her harm. And it is in that very same absolution that we find a message of hope and redemption. As Cabiria, the diminutive Masina gives a performance that is nothing less than superlative, filled with nuance and expression. She has a face and a manner that convey an unbelievable depth of emotion, and Fellini captures every bit of it with his camera to perfection. It sometimes seems that she is a sprite merely masquerading as a woman; she has a light, almost ethereal presence, though at the same time she exhibits an earthy quality that gives her character such complexity, which removes any semblance of stereotype one may assign to her character as a `lady of the evening.' It is a heartfelt, memorable portrayal that quite simply should have earned her an Oscar for Best Actress. Turning in a noteworthy performance, also, is Francois Perier, as Oscar D'Onofrio, the stranger who comes into Cabiria's life with an offer that ultimately seems too good to be true. The supporting cast includes Amedeo Nazzari (Alberto Lazzari), Aldo Silvani (The Hypnotist), Franca Marzi (Wanda), Dorian Gray (Jessy), Mario Passante (Cripple in the `Miracle' sequence), Pina Gualandri (Matilda), Leo Cattozzo (Man with the sack) and Polidor (The Monk). `Nights of Cabiria' is a film of extraordinary depth that is beautiful as well in it's humanity; Fellini has created images, both visually and emotionally, that are stunning and indelibly realized. Highlighted by the performance of Giulietta Masina, this is a film that begs to be embraced, one that will stay with you long after the last shadow has passed from the screen into darkness. In Cabiria, Fellini somehow touches something eternal, for there is a lasting sense of innate goodness about her that simply cannot be forgotten. For seekers after wisdom and truth, this is definitely a film that must not be missed. I rate this one 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>on the timelessness of Fellini's overlooked masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a film-lover, there are movies that I've outgrown, movies that disappointingly lose their connection to me as I age and mature. Fellini's "Le Notti di Cabiria" is one of those movies that seems to grow with me. It grows richer with each yearly viewing. I never tire of it; I am moved in different ways each time I see it. Fellini and his amazing muse, Giulietta Masina, created one of those rare movie masterpieces in 1957 that comments on its time, yet remains fresh and contemporary as well. But I lament that this gem is so little known today. I trust its recent restoration will help remedy the movie-going public's oversight. The film's rich concluding scene alone (and Masina's glance into our eyes) remains one of the most magical moments ever projected on a screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life is a river: not gently flowing, but a hostile swallower of the marginal.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gorgeous early Fellini, often considered the mid-point in his career, between the more obviously reflective, supposedly realistic early work, and the bleak extravaganzas that followed. But Fellini was never a neo-realist in the dull way Rossellini was: his use of landscape was always heavily symbolic or subjective. Here Cabiria lives in the middle of a bleak wasteland, which perhaps serves to figure the emptiness of her life, the sterility of life for women in macho Italy, or a comment on post-fascist Italy itself.It doesn't really matter. The sentiments of the film are actually quite trite - women are treated badly in Italy, etc. What's riveting and astonishing is not the experiences of Everywoman, but the experiences of one particular woman. Although there is a great variety of locales, and Cabiria seems to be always moving forward, the film is actually a melodrama. Cabiria never escapes, whatever her adventures, wherever she goes, she always ends up where she started, at home. Even when she finally sells her home for a supposed new life, her last (in the film; we just know the circle will never be broken) mirrors her first in a depressing circularity.Yet the film, for all its melancholy, is anything but depressing. Fellini is most famous for being an indulger of frail male egos, but CABIRIA's strength lies in its imaginative sympathy with its heroine. The film's structure mirrors her situation - the film has no plot as such, just an accumulative series of self-contained episodes which follow the same pattern: escape, hope, betrayal. In each episode, the further Cabiria moves away form her 'neo-realist' base, the more dream-like (verging on the fantastic) the film becomes, as if she is stepping into an enchanted world (this is made literal when she follows the actor into the nightclub, like some mythic warrior entering the dragon's lair). And each time she gives into the dream world, the illusion is rudely shattered - the scene at the hypnotist's is as heartbreaking as anything in CHIMES AT MIDNIGHT. So while the reality/illusion dichotomy is facile as an idea, it is extraordinarily powerful as cinema experienced through character.Fellini's filming is as beautiful as anything in 50s cinema, that decade mirabilis: more restrained and grounded than later, with less obvious flourish, but the mixture of realism and dream is made all the more convincing with the gentle, coaxing camera movements, beguiling us as well as the heroine, but with the strange editing, and sometimes disruptive composition giving us a distance she can never have.Giuletta Masina gives the most sublime performance by an actress in Italian cinema- an exuberant mixture of hope and resignation; her gorgeous big eyes not quite ready to give up yet, even at the end, although the submitting to the youthful racket seems as hopelessly bleak as 8 1/2. Her seemingly unprepossessing body is actually an instrument of unparalelled grace, and the comparisons with Chaplin are not unwarranted - when you see this performance you'll realise how unexpressive most actors' bodies are.The Chaplin model is not always helpful - there is a mawkishness and emotional manipulation towards the climax that almost grates, but by then you so adore Cabiria, and so hate everybody else that thought doesn't really come into it (although doesn't it seem that many male viewers seem to prefer her as helpless). Throw in a lovely, playful Nino Rota score and you're in movie heaven.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing Transformation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I almost turned this film off. I'm so glad I stayed with it. It's one of the best films I've seen. Cabiria, the street prostitute, is not sympathetic. She's rough, vulgar, not very attractive, a showoff, loud, proud, inelegant. I just didn't feel anything for her character at the beginning. But Fellini must have been reading my mind. He purposefully played it that way to draw the viewer in.The streets of Rome are unforgiving and harsh for a prostitute. There are those who sleep in caves and in the archways. Cabiria braggingly says, "I've got my own house...here's one girl who's never slept under the arches. Well, maybe once. Twice maybe." By the end of the film I was completely hooked by her charm, desire, and hope. For hope is what keeps Cabiria going. A great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The two emotions that make this film unbelievable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think there's just two reasons to make make this film the most beautiful thing I've ever seen on screen. I have yet to see a more beautiful movie. I'll explain below.The first is the play of emotions. At first Cabiria is upset after falling in the water. Then she smiles and laughs. Then she's upset. This transformation of emotions makes you throughout the movie want to see her smile. And when she laughs you're in heaven. With her. This is one reason: transformation of emotions, and your wish for Cabiria to get to laugh.The second thing that moved me with all my emotions was her reaction to sufferance. In her life she suffered before the movie (bad parents, prostitution, social status, poverty), throughout the movie (although her way of living rarely show you her sufferance in the movie, you feel she's very happy), and probably after the movie ends (again, bad future most likely). At the final part of the movie the pain is excruciating. She loses everything that connects her to the life (all her money &amp; house), love (lover), social status (marriage) and some hope (in life and Virgin Mary). This is all in one scene. Actually, all she has left are her friends and possibly a suitcase. And then it happens: she's happy. In the very final part her reaction is: she yells, while crying, to the rubbing lover to kill her. She repeats this. And the final scene is a victory on life. Sure, her life was, is (oh, boy, what must her feelings be right now) and will be filled with pain. But he takes this reality, a certain fact, nothing's more concrete than this, and twists it: she's happy. In a face of tears, after a horrifying painful experience, she looks at the unsuspecting people around her that are joyful, happy, friendly, and takes their feeling: she smiles, almost laughing. There is no reality. The sufferance is beaten. Life has no hard touch on her. This is much more than hope. She is not wishing for a better future. She's living it now. Life is transformed with her final joy.I have yet to see a better movie. It's the one movie for which: I registered on IMDb, I voted, I read all the comments, I wrote this comment. No second place. My current top movies: this movie and below this everything else. There's not another movie I would recommend to anyone older than 15.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fellini at his best - Spoilers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`Le Notti di Cabiria', Federico Fellini's 1957 Academy Award winning film, is a poignant, touching and timeless work of Italian cinema. The film details the life of Cabiria (played by Fellini's wife Giulietta Masina), a `night bird' who leads a cynical life of prostitution on the streets of Rome. Throughout the film, Fellini guides us through her search for true love, refuge, and eventual salvation. Her poetic story is one of sadness, hope, and the unending search for a true place to call home. Giulietta Masina's brilliant performance draws her audience into her ravaged world and leaves them forever changed.Cabiria has been a prostitute since her youngest days - she recollects entering the streets at 15 with `long, dark hair', unaware of what she was getting into. As we learn in the opening scene, she has been consistently taken advantage of by men, yet attempts to walk a fine line between clinging to them in a search for true happiness and remaining ever independent and self-sufficient. As soon as the film opens, she is robbed by her pimp, and later spends the night with a self-consumed wealthy director. However, the director throws her in the closet as soon as his girlfriend arrives and in the morning quickly escorts a sad Cabiria out of the house, with all her hopes crushed. During the film Cabiria is frequently enticed by the promise of a new life in her encounters, yet consistently meets impending doom.The most heartbreaking theme of the film is Cabiria's hopeless search for happiness and salvation. We see that her friends in the business are no better off - Cabiria's story is a universal account. She is cynical and cold only because of the tragedy she has suffered when she has chosen to share herself. However, she makes a gradual transformation throughout the film as soon as she meets D'onofrio - a handsome, intelligent and caring man who finds Cabiria at a comedy show. Cabiria is at first doubtful and aloof around him, but as the story progresses becomes more open and loving. She has finally found the answer in D'onofrio; she proceeds to sell her house and gather her life savings to live the married life as her mother had with D'onofrio. In the end of the film, her hopes are once again crushed as Fellini brings us to a cliff overlooking a river, the same setting as the opening scene in which Cabiria was robbed by her pimp and thrown into the river. Cabiria recognizes why D'onofrio has taken her there, breaks down crying and asks for him to throw her over the cliff. D'onofrio takes her life savings and leaves her on the cliff to her sorrows. Fellini ends the film with a shot of Cabiria looking into the camera smiling through her tears - she still has some hope for humanity inside her.It seems that no matter how desperate her struggles, Cabiria can not leave her life on the streets. She tells D'onofrio that as a teenager she and her friend Wanda had tried to escape the streets through starting a newspaper stand and could never get it off the ground. Perhaps it is something about Cabiria that keeps her working on the streets, perhaps it is her eternal hope in the goodness of mankind. She will never stop believing someone good is waiting for her out in the obscurity of the night. While at a holy site where Mary was to have appeared, she begs in tears for Mary to change her life. Her prayers, expectedly, are not answered. In `Le Notti di Cabiria', Fellini breaks our hearts through Giulietta Masina's brilliant portrayal of an infinite search for love amongst a dark world ravaged with deceit and pain.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My friends went to see The Queen last night - I was too tired and decided to go back home. I put in the DVD and got into bed figuring I would watch an half hour or so and fall asleep. At the end of nearly 2 hours, I was sitting up straight, wide awake, awestruck at the genius in the direction and acting. This is cinema at its finest. I have seen La Strada before and I now rank Fellini's earlier work as among my all time favorites (along with Ozu.) Masina's tearful smile at the camera at the end is pure magic - so much dignity and hope captured in a single second. Her performance throughout the movie was a revelation - she got innocent hope and graceful charm to shine through her foul-mouthed vulgar acting character. I simultaneously cared and despaired for her - this movie pulled me in like no recent Hollywood movie has for a long long time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fellini's humanness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Le Notti is a very rich,thematically, and diversified movie:the freshness and the concreteness,a strange inebriate detachment (in the "Alberto" the movie star episode),men's wickedness,the horrible baseness,the sordidness,the suavity,the gentleness and the bitterness,the irreverence towards the Christianity,also themes from previous (Il Bidone,La Strada) and even future (La Dolce vita,Toby Dammit,the easy-going eccentric Roman inebriate night life,Rome's night life) films.Fellini no longer believes in,or no longer practices the Shakespearian notes he used in Il Bidone,that kind of Shakespearean intensity.Anyway,like "Il Bidone","Le Notti" changes register in its last part,and offers that unsparing insight deeper than the reality itself.Transitional movie,"Le Notti" is at once a recapitulation of themes from previous works,and a preparation for his future essays (the 4 great movies from the '60s).The epic texture is still important.I don't think that Fellini ever bets on the "social document",etc.,and his ephemeral,or,at least,temporary association with some Neorealists in the '50s is generally misunderstood and made to mean something it never was.A thin-skinned prostitute,"Cabiria",meets a bashful accountant.Seen through Cabiria's experiences,her tribulations,the things she sees, tell more about her own mind,she is not,as such,the director's representative,though Fellini depicts reproachfully the malice of some of those met by Cabiria in her way.The world as presented in "Le Notti ..." is,at least partially,seen through the prostitute's eyes,hence the touch of grotesque and even some kind of a twisted naiveté,a la Sue.In this world seen by Cabiria,there are some landmarks of concrete humanity,e.g. the philanthropist met by the prostitute,or the Friar.It is always surprising,but also heartening, to see a man of great intelligence needing to give goodness and humanity a place in his work.(Kusturica,who refused any resemblance with Fellini and denied any influence,uses the same kind of endowing the sleazy worlds he explores with at least one firm landmark of goodness,so this world it is not left to its own degeneration and cowardice.)I see in this lapidary insert that never patronizes the sign of a distinguished deftness.(In "Il Bidone" such a character misses.)Albeit mixed with irony and sarcasm (those of an exceptional mind ),Fellini's compassion is none the less authentic.His relative neutrality,his neatness in handing this humble epic stuff do not make him an indifferent witness.(As a youngster,Fellini planned to make a movie about a "little wildflower of grace", Serenella ;more interesting is to note that this "little wildflower of grace" was,for Fellini,one of "the two faces of the Church".Fellini had opinions,had ideas about real life,goodness,etc..Fellini even had a very keen and salubrious idea about the true task of Christianity for man,to "restore him to his divine greatness".)He was also known to admire humility, simplicity,and he knew to be politically incorrect in this."Le Notti" may be Fellini funniest movie:it abounds in comical things,and this comic is always tasteful and intelligent.It also has a certain quality that can be simply described as gentlemanly.Also,let us note that in "Le Notti" Fellini avoided the cruelty's altitude reached already in "Il Bidone",but maintains a more comical and grotesque register.In "Le Notti ..." Fellini still has a narrative thread;he gives shape to various intuitions,feelings, perceptions,dreams,in an impressionistic and fancy but well-conceived and finely molded way.His enjoyment of the clownish aspects of the reality is a relish.Cabiria's world is explored with Fellini's appetite for the concrete.He connives with the prostitutes and the hussies,sends Cabiria in the medium of the rich,in that of the religious pilgrimages....There are some powerful vignettes,displaying Fellini's gusto and skills for seizing various facets of the social life.His mastership in depicting realist scenes that none the less have a bizarre and ambiguous twist is obvious in Cabiria's tribulations.With the air of making a purely reflexive and intransitive work,Fellini still expresses freely,with an Un-faked ingenuity, his thoughts about life,people,etc..While affecting to leave outside his feelings and opinions about everyday life and the common experience,Fellini none the less slipped his own thoughts and reactions,because he did have them and was not sank into some kind of impassibility,placidity and indifference.Fellini's ironic detachment,caustic sometimes,was,in his '50s movies,a good way to perceive the reality and to depict it without being patronizing or Thesist.The man was very refined and subtle and he refused to be encapsulated,enclosed,encompassed in an artistic formula;he believed in the richness and irreducible character of both life and art.This playful man wasn't a joker.Fellini passed a judgment on certain aspects of life,and resented the cruelty and the wickedness,without ever being didactic or moralist;but it must be said that,as director,he was both very intelligent and ironic,and ingenuous,natural,spontaneous;one,no less than the other.He was as impassible and as ingenuous as his very keen intelligence made him to be.Nobody was farther than Fellini from conforming himself to a theoretical model about how should man be and create.I want to praise "Cabiria"'s actors' genuineness,beginning with Mrs. Masina;this was her fifth movie with her husband.She was ever more than a "Fellini actress".Her ethereal and funny approach denotes a very mature understanding.(But it is true that Fellini wanted for his movies real actors, great actors,not puppets,he favored the creative skills of the actors.) François Périer's performance is simply gold;it has that sensitivity,delicacy,nuances and fineness that are compelling."Cabiria" is on the iridescent side of Fellini's '50s career,the other side being the "realist" and narrative one.This iridescent side is irreducible to schools and trends,expressing Fellini's refusal to use the standard methods and to work within a common code,and favoring,at first through this poetry of the Faubourg,the experimental and a new Apprehensibility.It is important to notice that Fellini was a great experimenter,and one that never cogs;he is probably the most famed cinema experimenter.( "I have one great limitation",said Fellini,"not having general ideas about anything".)Fellini agreed,once,that "all my films revolve around " the "love toward one's neighbor".Those who are used to receive this only in a conventional,didactic way,won't even recognize it in Fellini's works.Averty did the best homage to Fellini,considering him one of the three directors that never made a bad movie,and unable to make one.I subscribe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Masina Might Be the Best Film Actress Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love Federico Fellini, but I dread his early works like La Strada because they are so sad. Poor Giulietta Masina, one of the greatest film actresses of all time, she always gets the short end of the stick and because the movie magic is so intense, our heart breaks right along with her.Fellini is the Great Director Italian style. I don't mean he isn't the greatest director, better than Hitchcock, Welles, a modern like Scorcese. I'm looking at his work, have seen most of them, and I can't make up my mind. He might be the greatest that ever lived. His films in black and white, the Neo-Realism of Italian film after the war, the incredible original vision, the writing, and directing, it's as though Michelangelo came back as a director.Masina is a prostitute, but her loves turn out to be pocketbook grabbers. Her physical well being is not high on her boyfriend's priority list. She's such a little women, frail, and in Nights she plays a tough, brawling, whimsical, and hopeless romantic. Her acting style is over the top, almost carnival character as she had played it in La Strada, but as Cabiria, she's older, but not necessarily wiser. The final revelation with French actor François Périer is so heart rendering because after an hour and a half of Cabiria's, laughter, trials, and disappointments, we identify with her completely. And then, in one last scene, the carnival returns with hope.There is so much more to say about this film. You could write a book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Giulietta Masina gives the greatest performance of cinema history in this movie........</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nights of Cabiria is another neo-realistic Italian cinema that took us down-right to the world of misfortune,despairing,unloved world of a prostitute.The story of a woman Cabiria who dreamed up of finding true love in her life.The story follows Cabiria in her quest for love where she wanders the streets of Rome during night awaiting a wonder to happen when one day she will find the love of her life,but ironically in her quest she always get betrayed,disrespected and used-up by the different men she encounters in her journey.In this tragicomic tale,Giulietta Masina portrayed the role of innocent and naive women which is one of the greatest performance i have seen from any actress in my life.You will gravitate towards her wide,round glittering eyes and her innocent smile.You will grieve for her griefs, felt sympathy for her and when she smile,the innocence and purity of her smile compel you to smile and rejoice for her, when she pray to Madonna in a shrine i felt like praying with her.Her character was so energetic,full of passion ans positive attitude towards life,no matter how much she is in pain and grief she always found a way to laugh.Nights of cabiria is certainly one of the most perfect and equally powerful movie ever made.There is not a single flaw in the direction of Federico Fellini.The movie was more than perfect in every department from plot development,cinematography,performance to editing you cannot point-out a single sign of blemishness in the movie.This movie was entertaining throughout, perfectly paced that allow the audience to get deeply involve with the story and also prevent from boredom.The scenes were shot with precise details, perfection and beauty,whether the scene of the prayer in the shrine or the tension and sadness build at the climax ,every scene was exquisitely brilliant.This movie have one of the most tragic ending i have ever seen.The movie ended like it started,when she get betrayed again by another man she fell in love, in-spite of being sad and severely honest to audience about the harsh reality of world all the time, movie still inspire us at the end same time to never to loose hope. Nights of Cabiria is not a chick flick,this movie has an insight ,the character study of a misfortune women.Just like a mirror,this movie shows us the reality of life,true depiction of the cruel and unaffectionate world we live in but still inspires us.Sometimes,I wonder how can i relate myself so much with a movie that is not even near around to my culture,language,era and the country.Nights of Cabiria is one of those movies.this movie was made in 1957(the year even when my parents were not born) and from the country of Italy,i hardly know anything about it's culture and language.But still love the movies from Italy,the country where one of the most beautiful movies of the world are made.It is because of that these movies have boundless emotions that flows beyond the border of any country,passes all the hurdles of language and time and equally capable to penetrate the emotions of audience,irrespective of it's language and country.The movies like Nights of Cabiria are like Diamond which have no influence of time,only they get more and more beautiful as the time passes.The world will never forget the cinematic gems like this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fabulous, Fabulous Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before viewing "The Nights of Cabiria", I had never seen a foreign film (yes, I know, it's a shame... but then again, most fifteen year olds haven't). However, "Sweet Charity" being one of my favorite musicals when it appeared on Sundance one Saturday night, I couldn't resist. And I'm glad I didn't. Frederico Fellini is a skillful and masterful man. His direction is absolutely AWESOME, to say the least. And words cannot describe the glorious performance of his wife, Giulietta Masina. Fellini did for Masina what Bob Fosse did for his wife, Gwen Verdon on the stage when it was transposed to "Sweet Charity." Masina is so believable and so real... with that street-urchin appearance, those huge, sparkling eyes, that wistful smile, and her petite figure... she is absolute perfection in the role of Cabiria. This is one film that is a MUST SEE... and if you've already seen it, SEE IT AGAIN. Two thumbs up!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A prostitute that gets under your skin...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a way "Nights of Cabiria" is the companion piece to "La Strada", both directed by Federico Fellini, both starring his wife and muse Giulietta Masina and both dealing with a woman and her struggle with life. And yet the movies conclude quite differently. Cabiria is one of those characters that really get under your skin in the progression of the film - it's a woman who seems difficult to understand at the beginning when she's saved from drowning, yet doesn't even have a word of thanks for her saviours and heads off ranting. What follows is grand character development. Episode by episode we get deeper in Cabiria's heart and mind, her hopes and dreams, see her praying for a miracle, but again and again she fails, is used, ridiculed, ignored. Cabiria is not just a naive girl stumbling into her doom, she rather seeks salvation in simplicity and belief when everything else shatters to pieces. She's actually quite a complex character - emotional, earthy and proud in her own way, yet vulnerable and always on the brink. And we are swept away with her when eventually that turn in her fate is actually happening, the change for which we've all been rooting by then.It all leads up to one of the most striking final scenes in cinema history - Fellini's camera work and Masina's performance invoke pure movie magic: Never before is a greeting from a total stranger as heart-warming as here, never again will a well-timed nod into the camera be so electrifying as Cabiria's. Maybe you already know what I mean. In any case I conclude with: Buona sera!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nights of Cabiria is one of those timeless old films that will always remain poignant and relevant. It carries that old innocent cinematic charm of an era that can never be duplicated.Masina, is so talented in this film and this character is SO unforgettable. WHAT TALENT!! This woman doesn't even have to say anything!! You just have to look into those huge pupils and watch the variety of expressions on her face that convey so many emotions without a single word. I would but it in comparisons to Masina as a circus clown, who can just do everything with her face.The film is a good play on life and redemption in general (done very well might I add), and for that it rates high for me personally. It is also very funny and charming. I can not comment on how it compares to Sweet Charity (which is based on this film) cause I have not seen it.The film slows in certain sections but is never boring. GREAT FILM!!Rating 8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Fellini's best...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...alongside La Dolce Vita, 8 1/2 and Amarcord. Fellini's films are not for everybody perhaps, but I admire them how well made made and directed they are, some of them like Amarcord and the peacock in the snow have breathtakingly beautiful images that stay long in the mind, for his choices in composers and actors, for his deliberately paced and sometimes ambitious stories(8 1/2 is especially true of this) and also that the characters are not always what they seem at first glance. Nights of Cabiria I have seen before criticised as grating, sentimental and self-indulgent(the latter being a criticism of Fellini's films in general and him also actually), and while I am understanding, I personally don't agree.I find Nights of Cabiria to be one of his accessible films, and along with La Strada also his most moving. Again it is incredibly well made, with beautiful scenery and cinematography. The images are again very memorable, and done with much emotional resonance, the best of which being the ending which is both tragic and uplifting. Fellini's direction is superb, the personal nostalgia that is apparent in all his films is here and you do identify with the story and the titular character. The music has much beauty and nostalgic charm, while the story perfectly tells of the sheer happiness and then tearful sorrow of unfortunate Cabiria's life. Cabiria, the titular character, is one you can identify with immediately, feeling pity and also her conflicting emotions as she tries to remain positive even in the face of adversity. Giulietta Masina gives a bravura performance, her face and eyes are beautifully expressive and she is just heart-breaking. Francois Perier also shines as the stranger who makes the offer that is almost too good to be true.Overall, a truly beautiful film and one of Fellini's best, certainly one of my favourites as well. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little woman, a big mouth, a gigantic heart ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like Maria Falconetti in "The Passion of Joan of Arc", Meryl Streep in "Sophie's Choice" or Gena Rowlands in "A Woman Under the Influence", Guiletta Masina in "Nights of Cabiria" displayed, with a poignant authenticity, the courage to overcome the adversity underlining her vulnerable condition.Coincidentally, like Gena Rowlands with John Cassavettes, Masina was directed by her husband, Federico Fellini. And I believe this is the key of intimacy that liberates the actress in front of the camera and allows her to express every single emotion with intensity, and no fear of being over-the-top, the man behind the camera takes care of everything. And "Intense" to describe Guiletta Masina's performance is an understatement, so is the very word "performance". Masina lives Cabiria, with an endearing generosity and universal appeal. Rarely have I felt so much empathy toward a character who happens to be a loud-mouth thirty something prostitute.Cabiria is introduced as a joyful woman living a passionate romance with Giorgio, she kisses him, embraces him, then he suddenly steals her purse and pushes her into the river, where she nearly drowns before being saved by a group of young men. The opening scene is intriguing by its setting, an industrial area far away from the city, and the broad daylight, and its cheerful tone followed by a tragic twist, then an optimistic resolution. Basically, after a first viewing, you simply realize how the first minutes, in their tragicomic aspect; represent the movie in microcosm. But the emotional trap not to fall in is to consider Cabiria as a pathetic woman on which bad luck keep going on, Fellini's film is the chronicles of a series of misfortunes punctuated with optimistic statements about human nature, and it's up to the viewer, to Cabiria, to see the half-filled or half-empty glass.Cabiria's surprisingly ungrateful reaction after she's rescued is another indication of her unique temperament. She trusts any bad intentioned smooth-talking Don Juan over any genuinely caring person. In the following scene, her best friend Wanda seems very concerned and friendly before being harshly dismissed. Cabiria has the sweetness and the temper of a child, and her tragedy is that she never displays the right reactions at the right time, making the general mood of the film fascinatingly unpredictable. Cabiria never misses an occasion to dance, with her unique charisma; she steals the show and creates an eccentric cheerful mood even inside the prostitute's circle. Her positive attitude is a personal way to rise herself above her condition. As she likes to remind everyone: she owns her house. She has an almost childish way to brag about the fact that she's not like any prostitute. Indeed, we never see her in activity, she embodies the condition of being a prostitute, disdained, insulted, taken advantage of, and her eternal suspicious attitude toward any sign of kindness is an unfortunate professional bias. Both tragic and comic, Cabiria reminded me of two classic movies notorious for having inspired Fellini.Cabiria's appearance is almost comical, she's short but doesn't embarrass herself with high heels, instead she has these white socks worn with very unlikely sandals, and eyebrows a la Mickey Mouse. During the Mambo part, every eyes stare at her. She dances and moves a bit like Chaplin in "Modern Times", Cabiria is a sort of female clown with the right mix of pathos and burlesque, the Tramp with the umbrella as cane-like accessory. And when she gets in the beautiful house of the rich movie star, and he starts developing a fondness on her, we expect a disillusion to come, like the Tramp with the Rich Man in "City lights". Mickey Mouse or Charlie Chaplin, Cabiria is the female incarnation of the universally appealing figure of "little fellow who does his best" in a quite hostile world. The music of Nino Rota embodies the playful mood of Cabiria's misadventures until the sense of urgency in her quest of a new life started to remind of another masterpiece: De Sica's "Bicycle Thieves". Like the new bicycle changed Ricci's life, a new love would transform Cabiria, and the desperation growing deeper and stronger as indicated in that scene where she joins the pilgrims and asks the Virgin Mary to change her life, was a powerful reminiscence of Ricci visiting the Wise Woman.This is the dilemma that inhabits "Nights of Cabiria", romantic or realistic. When after having been so mistreated during a magic show Cabiria was approached by the kind accountant Oscar, played by François Périer, I wanted her to keep her guard up. And as he seemed genuinely in love, convincing her after several meetings, to marry him, and leave everything for him, my heart pounded as I was expecting the worst to happen. And then came the climactic scene in the cliff when Cabiria understood Oscar's dark motives, just like Giorgio's, and she started sobbing, my heart literally melted. Cabiria is the quintessential romantic person, in the denial of the world's reality, and the pain in her heart, was her realization that the vision she always tries to reject was true. But she pulled herself together, started walking when a group of happy young people dancing and playing music formed a cheerful parade around her. This was the "City Lights"-like ending the movie needed: the ultimate triumph of the faith in human spirit. Cabiria is like reborn in this scene, her eyebrows are natural, her smile genuine, her wounds healed, as she feels in security again, hence her quick glance at Fellini, behind the camera, or was she simply thanking us, viewers, for loving her?Kabir' means 'big' or 'powerful' in Arabic, and I wouldn't be surprised, if the name was a derivation from that Semitic epithet. Cabiria is a character defined by a personality that transcends the limits of her tiny little body. Size-wise, she's everything but Cabiria, street-wise, she has one hell of a big mouth and as a human being, her heart is simply gigantic ?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That glance,that nod, that smile.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the first Fellini film I ever saw (and thank heavens I saw it on the big screen); I absolutely FELL IN LOVE with its now-legendary star Giulietta Masina (in the title role of Cabiria). Watching the movie, I wanted to shout to her to "watch out!" and to jump into the screen to take her away from the parasites who wanted to feed on her. So entranced was I by Masina's performance. Telling the surface plot is unnecessary here; the film's substance happens between the lines: Cabiria's emotional depth between the devastations, her perpetual longing for better and, despite it all, her indomitable happiness. It's the story of predators and prey (Cabiria), and it's a picture of the enduring human spirit. Only an actress of transcendent powers could pull off such a task, and Masina manages it beautifully. Look at the IMDb "Awards &amp; Nominations" page for this film: in 1957 Masina won "Best Actress" at Cannes; in 1958 the film won the Oscar for "Best Foreign Language Film;" and in 1959 the film was nominated for a British Academy Award for "Best Film From Any Source." Three of the film's magical moments: 1) the "Hypnotist" scene. 2) After falling asleep atop a cliff where one of those "predators" had taken advantage of her, she awakes and the sea below this cliff is now covered by a misty shroud (you interpret what "being above the clouds" means). And 3) after a final personal devastation, she joins a small troupe of carefree youth in their singing and dancing as they walk the road. Joining them, her dirt-smudged and tear-swollen face regains its radiance and we feel happy that she's smiling again. But the real brilliance of this moment - one of the most affecting in all cinema - is when Cabiria glances briefly INTO THE LENS, smiles and nods AT *US* that she will be alright. Watching this movie that first time I was happy that she was smiling among these young troubadours, but not until she glanced, smiled and nodded directly TO ME did I feel released from my need to rescue and protect her, free to leave the theater and let her go on her own (without me). Personally, no other actress has ever been able to penetrate so completely to my emotional core. Brilliant director, brilliant actress. SEE THIS MOVIE.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ms. Masina (Mrs. Fellini), is simply one of the most superlative actresses in history. Yes, we all know the infidelities and troubles Mr. and Mrs. Fellini had in their life-long marriage. Like every other marriage we know.What is astonishing are the artistic treasures they left us."Nights of Cabiria" is one among many of the finest films ever made."Sweet Charity," the musical rip-off of this masterpiece, cheapens the entire enterprise. Good intentions notwithstanding.We don't need Bob Fosse, and certainly not Shirley MacClaine replacing Giulietta Masina, nor second-rate Cy Coleman's score, to "musicalize" what was already a brilliant musical (thanks to Nino Rota and Bonagura).Fellini's film "sings" on its own, thank you."Sweet Charity" is a perfect example of Hollywood and Broadway making a travesty of art."Sweet Charity" -- film and stage performances -- are hollow, shallow exercises compared to the original film. Yeah, Shirley and Chita Rivera and Paula Kelly dance up a storm. Nothing to do with the story or the characters. Everything to do with making a "musical." What fun! Unfortunately, Broadway and Hollywood cut out the heart. Dancing zombies.Fellini's film is the gem. Polished to within an inch of its life, though pretending to be a diamond in the rough. Like all Fellini's works.Giulietta Masina IS the tiny hooker you want to love. No Hollywood "star" "playing" a hooker: she simply is. Like all (few) great actresses.Fellini knows what he has, in a wife, in an actress. He's genius enough to turn the camera on her and let her genius shine.Don't think she's a genius? Try "La Strada." "Juliet of the Spirits." "Ginger and Fred." Or her non-Fellini-directed turn in "Madwoman of Chaillot" with Katherine Hepburn.Giulietta Masina is as gifted a cinema actress as there ever was.Federico Fellini is as gifted a cinema director as there ever was.Marriages between geniuses are rare.Fellini is without peer.Give the actress, and her director husband, their due.Cinema has never seen their likes before or since.Fellini and Masina. Incomparable.And let's raise a toast to Nino Rota -- their equal, musically.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Performance and Movie for the Ages</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie for the first time last night, and I have to post my first review on the site to say it is really wonderful. Giulietta Masina's performance is truly one of the most impressive I've ever seen - her face is as expressive as Buster Keaton's or Charlie Chaplin's.The movie is a deceptively simple story about the day-to-day encounters of a prostitute who does the best she can to make a living and maintain her hopes and dreams of a better life. Her relationships with her neighbors, friends, and street-corner associates are a major focus, as are her relationships with the many men that come and go in her life. In the latter regard, it is obvious that this film was the inspiration for many other plays and films, including Sweet Charity. The series of people encountered by Cabiria in the movie shows us the full range of human reaction to life's adversity - some respond with cynicism and prey on others without remorse, some respond with generosity and hope, some respond by clinging to certain belief systems that don't really help them in a material way, etc. Cabiria definitely stands out as a unique character within the gritty, grimy community of post-war Rome, where there are stark differences between people of different classes and livelihoods. We can see that she is a good person living in a world that is not always humane or fair.I won't give away the ending, but I will say that it took a lot of creativity and inspiration to include the ending of this movie as it is - I'm sure it was as startling and unexpected to audiences in 1957 as it is emotionally moving still today.The direction, photography, and acting are all first-rate in this classic. Everybody involved was obviously engaged in a labor of love. I cannot recommend it more highly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is being a very typical Fellini movie, with a Fellini style and look to it as well as some of the typical characters and story developments. And I must say that this is probably one of my favorite Fellini movies! As basically all Fellini movies, it has a very simple concept and an extremely straightforward storyline. It's simply following its main character around, who is in search of love and happiness. The story is getting told almost like an adventure movie, as the main character visits lots of different places and is meeting a wide variety of characters. The movie is foremost a drama but it also has a strange comedy tone to it, making this still a very entertaining movie to watch as well.The message you can take from it is that you shouldn't desperately search for happiness and then expect to end up getting more happy than you were before. That's a lesson the main character in this movie learns the hard way. But luckily it really isn't a movie that is being preachy in any way. It never tries too hard to get its message across or to try to get any emotions out of you. It's a far too subtle and superiorly made movie for that.Most credit of course needs to go to Federico Fellini, who does a wonderful job with the storytelling. But the cinematography also is an important aspect. The movie has some very dynamic camera-work in it, that makes the movie a very lively and warm one, even thought its shot in 'cold' black &amp; white.But just as much credit needs to got to Mrs. Fellini, or rather said Giulietta Masina, who plays the lead role. She goes through some amazing transitions throughout this movie and she was an actress that could act just as well with just only her eyes and facial expressions. Truly a wonderful performance and all a real pleasure to watch. It's probably even a better performance than the one in the other Fellini movie "La strada", which was also a movie that I just loved.Simply storytelling and film-making at its very best!9/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beaten and bruised soul that cannot be hindered</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was simply a beautiful testament to the strength of the soul, beaten and bruised and left for dead, how the anguished still find purchase to lift themselves up and continue on, a sip more weary, but still clinging to the hope that their dreams of contented happiness might still be fulfilled. Out titular character is perfectly captured by the wonderful Giulietta Masina, a doe-eyed beauty that captured the viewer's heart so completely that we truly wish to know of her fate after the credits have rolled. The story meanders in a splendid fashion, with scene after inspiring scene, each of which serves to portray the feminine strength of Cabiria as she picks herself up time and again, no more bitter than before. Fellini's direction was of course magnificent, but that is merely stating the obvious. A wonderful account of the majesty born of hardship, Nights of Cabiria should serve as a monument of hope for the downtrodden masses. Merci beaucoup.Genruk of Evil Eye Reviews</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love story with audience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The real love story in this classic is between the director Fellini and his life-long wife, Giulietta Masina. The person who falls in love with Cabiria is you sitting in the audience. In the audience, we share a number of intimate moments with Cabiria like when she is alone in the movie star's bathroom, and when she is praying to the Madonna for a better life, and when she is preparing hopefully for her marriage. No character in the film ever gets to know her as intimately as we do.In the film's denouement, she is sort of walking off into the future with us as her adoring audience. We share with her the little smile when she sees reason for hope among the young people playing music.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Le Notti di Cabiria'; A grand cru when it comes to the history of film-making.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like some others mentioned before: this film is like a good wine. It comes with age. Now I can't disagree with that, because in a certain way it does, but I most definitely can't agree with it. I would describe it differently, although the comparison with wine will still be relevant. The thing that makes this film great, in my opinion, is its 'aftertaste' . While I was watching the film, I was stunned by the acting of Masina, yet not in another way then with 'La Strada'. When the film ended I was very impressed, yet not as much as when I saw 'Otto e Mezzo'. The thing is, I'm finally realising how much I loved this film, while I'm writing this. Maybe the acting wasn't superior to 'La Strada's' acting. I actually liked the rest of the cast better in 'La Strada' (which included Quinn and Basehart besides Masina). Nor was the film as challenging and sophisticated as 'Otto e Mezzo'. But 'La Strada' didn't have a story like 'Le Notti di Cabiria' and a divine character like Cabiria. And 'Otto e Mezzo' didn't have Masina in it. That's what makes 'Le Notti di Cabiria' as memorable as it is. And because of that, this film can be called Fellini's true masterpiece and, by saying that, one of the best films ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've only recently become a foreign cinema fan in the last 5 years. Was exposed to Italian horror films many years before that but in recent years have watched more of the classics, non-genre type stuff. Saw La Dulce Vita last April and loved it. last week, this was watched. Boy, this is good. Very oddly constructed scenes at time and the B&amp;W really sets the tone for this odd tale of prostition. Lots of symbolism about religion and class in 1940's Italy.Fellini is a true master. The lead actress seems like a real person, not an actress, and so many of the extras as well(they probably were not actors),...it really gives you this odd feel. Never too many cuts of C-U shots either, which i like.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fellini' Genius is Beyond Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The world of Federico Fellini was ,is and will be holding us captives as long as Cinema as Art exists. "The Nights Of Cabiria" is no exception.Though chronologically it belongs to the 50ies of the 20th century ,it is a strong message to us all, to our children, to those who will come after:hope against hope;never give up;the darkest moments in life will pass, blind and irrational (as it seems)belief in human goodness always prevails, whereas blind religious fervor always fails ( we should not forget that Fellini had always been critical of the Catholic Church). Julietta Masina is a superb actress who had actually sacrificed her might-have-been outstanding career(in fact, what she had accomplished is remarkable,but she could have done much much more as an actress) for the sake of her husband, and that makes her even greater as a human being.Of course, her "smile through tears" is unforgettable. Nino Rota's music does not just add to ,but co-creates the atmosphere of the film , the rarest case, when two genii(Rota and Fellini)found each other as wonderful partners-in-art, never trying to overshadow each other. I teach a course in European Cinema at a university in Taiwan, and I always show my Chinese students "The Nights of Cabiria".Their reaction and feedback are amazing:they FEEL the characters of different time and culture with an amazing intensity.It just proves once again that true ART has no boundaries.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nights Of Cabiria</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nights of Cabiria saw Giulietta Masina get the award for best actress in the European version of our academy awards.Like Bette Davis in 1937 and 1938 who was nominated for in Human Bondage and lost an award everyone thought was hers only to win on her next nomination for Dangerous.Masina should have won for La Strada in 54 but won on her next nominated performance in 1957 for Nights Of Cabiria the awards people obviously not wanting to be seen as having missed the boat twice in three years.That being said Giulietta put in a performance worthy of award status.Cabiria a streetwalker has her own home, a small bank account,and is fiercely independent.She has the same hopes and dreams of everyday middle-class people.She and her friend Wanda seem to want a normal life but have somewhat resigned themselves to making the best out of the life!She takes pride that her and Wanda whenever possible try and get picked up at the higher class locales,that she has only slept under a bridge once or maybe twice,and the fact that she staunchly refuses to accept a pimps protection.she would like to have real love in her life but is practical about her expectations,partly due to negative experiences of such.The cinematography makes you feel like you are in Italy as Fellini takes his camera to the streets of Rome and her provinces.There is no pre-fab Hollywood sets here.Cabiria like Gelsomina will remain in your mind and heart long after this film has been watched.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I don't say this lightly: My all-time fave</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my favorite film of all time."Cabiria" is why Fellini is hailed as one of the world's great artists.Back then he had that rare gift for crafting--heck, channeling--no nonsense stories whose import is at the once unflinchingly mythical and trenchantly practical in its examination of what it is to be a part-ape/part-angel human. All that, and he could do the million-and-one other things necessary to create what is, after all, a treasured objet d'art that speaks to the masses about what is universal and important; true love. And it does all this absent a cop-out "feel good" ending!I'm so thankful for the recent restoration and DVD, including the reinsertion of the "man with the sack" scene. I was particularly thankful for De Laurentiis's angle on the story of the original excising of that segment. It only serves to impress upon us that Fellini was in no wise kidding when he characterized himself as a professional prevaricator. Amen to that! And see this movie! The greatest bittersweet lie ever told, with the power to change the way you see yourself and others.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fabulous, Fabulous Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before viewing "The Nights of Cabiria", I had never seen a foreign film (yes, I know, it's a shame... but then again, most fifteen year olds haven't). However, "Sweet Charity" being one of my favorite musicals when it appeared on Sundance one Saturday night, I couldn't resist. And I'm glad I didn't. Frederico Fellini is a skillful and masterful man. His direction is absolutely AWESOME, to say the least. And words cannot describe the glorious performance of his wife, Giulietta Masina. Fellini did for Masina what Bob Fosse did for his wife, Gwen Verdon on the stage when it was transposed to "Sweet Charity." Masina is so believable and so real... with that street-urchin appearance, those huge, sparkling eyes, that wistful smile, and her petite figure... she is absolute perfection in the role of Cabiria. This is one film that is a MUST SEE... and if you've already seen it, SEE IT AGAIN. Two thumbs up!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Towards the character of Cabiria</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cabiria is a wretched prostitute who in spite of her vulgar bravado is sensitive and fragile like a child. She would never let anybody know, that her dream is to love and be loved. Seeking a man who will cherish and protect her, C. becomes an easy prey for scoundrels. They can just show interest in her to make her give them everything she has.Giulietta Masina found a great gesture for Cabiria - a wry smile, the smile of shyness and despair, loneliness and uneasiness, and at the same time of great dare and resoluteness. And it is this smile that makes us love and sympathize with Cabiria - a delicate and awkward child who has to overcome herself to earn her hard living. But she is the one who has guts: robbed and betrayed, deceived and disillusioned, she is never beaten; she goes on living, no matter how hard it might be.Although filmed in 1957, "Nights of Cabiria" is still exciting and revealing, since it touches the inmost human feelings and depicts true human characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Christian Marxism of Fellini and Pasolini?an elegiac social and religious commentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It would be far too simplistic to feel that the film merely presents an optimist's commitment to live and enjoy life in an imperfect world. "Nights of Cabiria" has always intrigued me among the many Fellini films that I have seen?-it is great cinema that asks more questions than it provides answers.Question one?who is the altruist who provides alms in the night to the wretched of the earth? The only reason for the addition of this character seems to be that Fellini wants a contrasting figure who works in the night?one who gives sustenance to others in a commendable way?a way Cabiria would have preferred to live her life if she had an option. It was amusing for me to find out that this entire sequence was deleted in earlier released versions of the film. My guess is that this sequence was an addition of screenplay writer Pasolini, as it would fit into his style of Christian Marxism, more than the neorealism of Fellini. Interestingly, this is one of the three males in the film (others being the actor who invites Cabiria home, and Brother Giovanni) who seem to have a pure heart and good intentions?all the others seem to have a predominant evil streak.Question two?-Brother Giovanni leaves a profound effect on Cabiria. Confessing to him (she thinks he is a full fledged priest) and having Mass celebrated by him was Cabiria's wish but the cold response she receives from Giovanni's colleague, who is apparently a full-fledged priest, seems to be Fellini's/Pasolini's comment on the Church?otherwise why have the scene? Question three-?Cabiria's eyebrows change their shape as she contemplates a married life. This is not in line with Fellini's Cabiria, who would think about the effect eyebrows will make as she switches gears in her personal life. Or is Fellini suggesting that as Cabiria steps on the threshold of marriage, the personality of Cabiria changes to a more calculating woman, in contract to the earlier simple, waif like personality.Apart from questions such as these, it is unquestionably one of Fellini's finest films. I preferred "La Strada," another Fellini film with his wife Guilietta Massina in the lead role, and his later less talked about "Orchestra Rehearsal," made some 20 years later, in which social commentary takes center stage and storyline the backstage.I am surprised that most Fellini viewers are taken up with performances and the story each Fellini film offers. The more poignant world of Fellini revolves around the commentary on the divide between the rich and the poor, the honest and the dishonest, the religious and the agnostic. The allure of Fellini to me remains his social commentary?-he underlines this with Cabiria, in the final shot looking at you the viewer, bringing up the nexus between the character and the viewer. In fact, this final shot ought to wake up the sensibilities of the laid-back cinema viewer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loved it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the very first time I see an Italian movie, and I loved it! This was very adorable movie. It was a nice journey, that I am glad I took. The movie was produced in 1957, set in the beautiful city of Rome and directed and co-written by Frederico Fellini.The story of the movie is about a pretty crazy prostitute who we join in her journey of life, she looks for love and salvation. It's funny and true. She is an optimist who sings, dances and swears a lot.The idea is really nice, I don't know how often was a prostitute's story shown in a movie in the 1950's, but it's defiantly an interesting idea. Let's see what I loved, I loved how open minded and independent was Cabiria (main character) in the movie, she owned her own house and was so proud of it. She wasn't looking for marriage as much as love.She wanted to change her life and didn't accept just how things were.I also enjoyed how although she went to church and asked for grace from virgin Mary, nothing changed in her life, because she kept it as it.I thought the directing was very good, it kept me interested and enjoying the movie. I loved the scenery and acting of all actors. It was fun, lots of fun, even the soundtrack is fun, please listen to itMy favorite scene involved Cabiria hypnotized and revealing here true innocence in front of many people on stage.I still had few comments that I didn't like, when she met a father in the church, he told her you must get married, it's women's duty to have children and be wives, that was a little lame. And it made me feel as if its sending a message that those who want to be independent, must be bad and that they should go back to their "natural" duties. Also it kinda made me sad that although she such an optimist, things never turned out right for her. I absolutely loved the ending scene, brought a smile back to my face.At the end, I would recommend the movie and would say it's very enjoyable. Oh, almost forgot that the Italian language is awesome, extremely lovely to hear. Definitely worth of being on the top 250 list.its-lalas-land.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most beloved character I have ever had the pleasure to know</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most of us watch a lot of movies in our lives. I saw "Nights of Cabiria" twelve years ago in a friend's college dorm room. We were all sitting around, and my film student friend popped in "Nights of Cabiria." I had no idea what to expect. I had never even heard of the movie. Talk about the proverbial sucker punch! Cabiria has stayed in my mind ever since, and I find myself thinking about her all the time. That's the power of this film. There's no need to comment on the acting and directing, which are simply astonishing. What makes this movie so exceptional is the fact that the audience cannot help but fall madly, tragically in love with Cabiria (and of course with Masina). Throughout the movie, as others have noted, I just wanted to jump into the screen and hug her, save her from those around her and her own naivety. At the end of the day, it is our affection for Cabiria that pushes this movie to the heights of raw, emotional power.And that phenomenon is displayed so beautifully in the famous, magical closing ten minute sequence. I have to admit, when Oscar stole her money on the cliff, and we saw her (yet again) go from the euphoria of being in love to rolling on the ground, begging him to kill her, I was furious. How could Oscar do that to our beloved Cabiria? And more importantly, how DARE Fellini do this to me!!!! And that was the magic of Fellini. He KNEW that, by this point, the audience was so totally invested in Cabiria that her heartbreak was our heartbreak. Widely hailed as one of, if not THE most emotionally powerful endings in film history, Cabiria's final walk through the forest is simply beyond words. The explosive power, again, lies in the fact that we care SO much for this character, and when she smiles through her tears while walking among the festival goers, she looks in the camera (and in our eyes) and nods, letting us know that she will be okay. It's the most generous moment I have ever witnessed in film. I have chills just thinking about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>On a scale of one to "Casablanca", this film is an "About Schmidt" (2003).</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Review:I think you can make the argument that Fellini's "Juliet of the Spirits" (1965) is the female counterpoint to his "8 ?" (1963). Both are films that analyze a central character whose life seems to be coming apart at the seams, in large part due to extra-marital affairs and existential concerns. In "8 ?" we have the Guido, who wants to tame all the women in his life to restore a semblance of continuity in his career and in his existence. With "Juliet of the Spirits," we follow Juliet, a woman who has been shattered by her cheating husband and who decides to leave him to restore that same sort of continuity of existence Guido sought.But before "8 ?" and "Juliet of the Spirits" Fellini made two other films that serve as gender based counterpoints ? "La Dolce Vita" (1960) and "Nights of Cabiria." (1959). Both films explore similar characters and similar themes. Fellini's heroes in these films are the bottom rung of society and we watch as they try to scrape their way out of their positions in search of greater meaning and purpose. While "La Dolce Vita" is the superior film, "Nights of Cabiria" still holds its own.In recent years "Nights" has joined Fellini's "La Strada" in accruing a wider and wider audience. Slowly, these films are becoming as widely seen as "8 ?" and "La Dolce Vita." "Nights of Cabiria" tells the story of Cabiria, a tiny and cute prostitute whose innocence is her greatest charm and weakness. Fellini buffs will note that we have met Cabiria once before in Fellini's first feature "The White Sheik" (1952). Both times she is played by Fellini's wife, the great Giulietta Masina.Masina always has such an expressive face. In some scenes she can exhibit the angelic demeanor of a child and in others she can look as morose as an old, dying woman. "Nights of Cabiria" begins with Cabiria's pimp stealing her purse and pushing her into a river. She nearly drowns. When she is saved she is discouraged to understand her pimp valued her life less than the 40,000 lira he stole with her purse. Cabiria leads a sad existence but she is indomitable. She does not give up, no matter how dire the circumstances.Like with Marcello in "La Dolce Vita," we follow Cabiria through a series of episodic adventures that mostly take place at night. One night she gets picked up by a famous movie star who's had a falling out with his finacee. Another time, Cabiria follows a rhapsodic crowd that longs to have a vision of the Virgin Mary. Another night she meets a Good Samaritan handing out food to the homeless. With this Samaritan, Cabiria meets an older prostitute who used to be a beauty, now living destitute in a cave outside of Rome. For Cabiria, this woman is a forecast of things to come if she doesn't change her life.Thus, when a nice man comes out of the night, expressing love and his intentions to marry Cabiria, she sees her way out. Are these man's intentions true and honest? I will not give it away - but I will say that Fellini has a tendency to bookend his films.The final scene of "Nights of Cabiria" is beautiful and one of Fellini's best endings. It is a synthesis of a parade and a party with Cabiria at the center, staring with quiet determination into the camera. Of all Fellini's vivid images, this one may best encompass his vision of the human experience.Rating:On a scale of one to "Casablanca", this film is an "About Schmidt" (2003).Rationalization:I think you'd be hard pressed to find a person who wouldn't admit that sometimes life can be a series of low-blows and inequities. And yet, we struggle on, trying to make the best of our situations in an otherwise cruel and indifferent world. Movies like these make me grieve and hope for humanity, showing us what is best in our natures while never denying we are pathetic creatures with a loose grip on even our own lives.http://iamdatabasefilmjournal.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a beautiful, sad, uplifting film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Never before have I seen a film so sad and happy at the same time. The film stands at the midpoint of these two diverse feelings, and somehow the ending is able to reconcile the two into a coherent and understandable scenario for our favorite Italian prostitute, Cabiria.This is a story that really hinges on the performance of the lead, and it could have gone either way despite Federico Fellini being behind the camera. Fortunately, his wife was in front of it, and Giuiletta Masina's performance does far more than carry the weight of the plot. She transcends practically every scene, basing her performance on Charlie Chaplin and dancing as much as she can. Of course we love her, but more than that we sympathize for her; despite her job we see her as someone we might know, sweet and gentle but very naive.Also to be commended is the style in which Fellini documents this journey; we are taken through the seedy undergrounds of Rome some 50 years ago. Cabiria's life has its most unpleasant moments, such as the opening sequence and when she goes home with a famous Italian movie star, but Fellini always feels for her and so do we. By the time the ending arrives, we are utterly ensnared in the short, rather unusual looking woman. And it is because of the husband and wife team of actress and director that we care about any of these people and are so moved by what is easily one of the best final scenes in movie history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fellini knows how to direct a story, and this one tugs at all of your emotions. It is a simple tale of a woman who wanted better in life. Of course from the poor side of the tracks and as she grew up her life hadn't gotten any better, she did have one thing: her dreams. And that, with her spirit, makes watching the film all worthwhile.Fellini wants you to hope for the best for his character Cabiria (Maria) and Giulietta Masina plays her well. As her life unfolds as a prostitute, she never loses her Cinderella dream while those around her crush it in every which way possible. But she does meet her "prince", and she is led to believe her story will end "happily ever after", and that's when we the audience is let in for a shock of horrific proportions. But, as we sit and watch this unfold, Fellini delivers skillfully what only Fellini can; and in that, we sigh with relief as we are still on Cabiria's side of love and hope.Filmmed in Black and White (subtitled) with all the artistry and rawness of Fellini, this is the type of picture that makes you fall in love with film and story. No special effects, no contrived love story. This is done as if these are folks you know and see everyday. You can't really turn away, you want to know what's next. Excellent film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fellini always creates great characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never seen a Federico Fellini movie that I didn't like, and "Le notti di Cabiria" is certainly another great one, telling the story of naive but self-standing prostitute Cabiria (Giulietta Masina) wondering through Rome looking for love but never finding it. Whether she gets pushed into the river (and then gets angry when the boys saving her don't know where the man went), or acts out a childhood scene for a hypnotist, or gets involved with a movie star, Cabiria never loses faith in her aim.I thought that the two most effective scenes in the movie were the church and the movie star's house. In the church, there's an invalid hoping to get cured, but it doesn't happen, much like how Cabiria never attains her goal; not even in the seemingly holiest of places can people come across what they seek. In the movie star's house, she has to walk up a staircase to get to his room. The camera angle faces up, making it look as though she is walking up to heaven and can finally get what she wants. But she doesn't, and then walks back down the stairs. They film it from above, so that it looks as though she has to leave this fantasy world that she had entered and come back down to reality. (Note: this is all conjecture, so don't quote me.) All in all, Fellini accomplished another masterpiece here. Part of what's so great about the movie is how he introduces the characters. Not just Cabiria, but also her prostitute friends, and how men pick them up. It's a movie that I recommend to everyone. Even if you're the type who only likes Hollywood movies saturated with mindless action, you at least gotta give this movie a try.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen many great films, many films that I would have to admit are technically greater than this. But very, very few films have ever evoked such beauty and warmth than Fellini's "Nights of Cabiria". There is a certain poetry and honesty that haunts every frame in this film, and while the writing is beautiful, after the film is over you don't remember the dialogue, or even the story. You remember the moments, the faces, the images, the places where this film takes place.I have never cried during or after a movie, and I don't think I ever will. But "Nights of Cabiria" moved me as close to tears as I think any film will ever have the power to do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this film at 22. As the lights came up in the theater I was openly weeping- Not just tears but actual sobs. I sat there alone a goodly amount of time until I believed the theater was empty. When I looked up another woman and a man were still seated. We all smiled at each other, and left without speaking. Masina is called a female Chaplin by some- Frankly, she is better.I have also read criticisms of her for this. Why? Must we separate theater and film? Her facial expressions confirm that communication is only 40% verbalThe "man with the sack" scene was not censored by the church- If anything this film is very pro- catholicism; temptation vs salvation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If there is empathy in cinema, it is here...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disagreeing with many of Federico Fellini's opinions, I don't deny that he has not belonged to the list of my favorite directors. Some of his movies are really difficult and a bit psychedelic. However, I have to admit one thing clearly: Fellini was one of the few men in cinema who was able to create something really powerful, captivating, enthralling, controversial, something really innovative: and that is what one may undeniably say about NIGHTS OF CABIRIA, his 1957 movie where again, after marvelous LA STRADA, he cast his wife Giulietta Masina in the lead, a performance that may be regarded as one beyond any awards. But let me analyze the content of the movie first before I comment on acting.Cabiria, an outsider among outsiders who is "living the life" is a Roman prostitute whom we find rather individual and with whom, from the very beginning, we can easily empathize. She is robbed, thrown to the Tiber River and, fortunately, rescued by a group of men. From this "in media res" opening moment, we start to get to know her. In spite of Cabiria's profession, she is not that "immoral." What Cabiria gets through is disappointment. She cannot understand that someone who always said "I love you" stole a few thousand Lira and was going to kill her. Although she seems to have a friend at her side, Wanda (Franca Marzi), also a prostitute, she feels lonely and desperate. The director masterfully supplies us with Cabiria's physical and psychological journey through different places, realities...something very life-like. Therefore, the movie appears to be built upon various worlds=various moments that do not have much in common with one another but which constitute a perfect integration at a higher level of life analysis. This is rather a series of events than a linear plot and... these events are really unforgettable being embedded in highly unpredictable action.Perfect harmony, wonderful insights into social realities, memorable, innovative, brave (as for these times) MOMENTS. Fellini appears to draw a parallel between Cabiria's experiences and everyone's life. Consider, for instance, the main motifs why she goes to these different places: she wants to find herself, looks for happiness, looks for love. Does she find it? Difficult to say... I particularly loved the moment she is so confused in a luxurious house of a famous film star, Alberto Lazzari (Amedeo Nazzari), but, from the social point of view, so lucky to get the autograph of his. But does this autograph give her satisfaction? A different must see moment is the visit to the Sanctuary of the Amore Divina - a pure realism of people in prayer trance shouting "Grazie Madonna!" Cabiria seems to be touched by them but is she able to ask Madonna for the right thing? Events are one factor why I really appreciate this film.Another reason for my love to this movie are the top notch performances. The cast, particularly Giulietta Masina (foremost she), make NIGHTS OF CABIRIA nearly a masterpiece. Giulietta Masina patterns her acting on purely original building block of cinema's charm which is FACE. That is where you can read her feelings, that is where you realize what is going on. As a matter of fact, dialog is only an additional aspect when applied to her. From portraying anger, disappointment, confusion, trance, hope, to affection, sorrow and yet an optimistic smile, Giulietta is a marvel! I would not compare her acting to the ones in other Fellini movies, including LA STRADA and JULIET OF THE SPIRITS, because she is unique as Cabiria, the same as she is unique in the roles of Gelsomina or Giulietta! The supporting cast also give fine performances, particularly Francois Perier as Oscar D'Onofrio, Amedeo Nazzari as Alberto and Franca Marzi as Wanda, seemingly Cabiria's real friend.But for me what will always play a decisive role after seeing this movie is the specific Italian charm of long ago. This is something I found in many old Italian movies and and that is something Fellini managed to entail here like other geniuses of cinema from his country. The film is nice to watch but not light to watch, it has reflections but also relaxation, all is in its right place. Moreover, all is enriched by the wonderful music by Nino Rota, a genius with whom Fellini worked with many other movies.As one reviewer before me has already stated, NIGHTS OF CABIRIA is like Cabiria's or Giulietta's smile, the smile of optimism, the smile of long ago, the smile that after 50 years still moves us and uplifts us. What was happiness for Cabiria? Was it the luxury she found in Alberto's life? Was it a group of pilgrims she joined? Was it Frate Giovanni who insisted on maintaining the Grace of God? She illusively found her angel in D'Onofrio; yet the truth occurred entirely different. What is happiness for us? Have we found it or is it just like in Cabiria's life...it passes by as such an unnoticeable, simple thing and we look for it and expect it in totally wrong places? Great movie as a real experience and touching empathy with the heroine. 9/10! If it's one of the first Fellini's films that you see, you're on the right track!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oooh, it's a lady! One of the sharpest, most highly entertaining "chick flicks" ever conceived</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Federico Fellini directed his wife, Giuletta Masina, in some of her and his most memorable screen work. Nights of Cabiria may be high up there, perhaps the most exciting. The film carries an episodic storyline that follows our heroine Cabiria as she has to use a hard act of cynicism and street-wise attitude to cover up a girlyish interior. Run-ins with a celebritie and other louse-abouts, a visit to a church, and a life-changing bit on a magician's stage, and most of these sequences are filmed superbly. Not only is there Fellini's usual under-current of laughs, but a perfect sense of imagination behind the on-location sets and real-life actors.I've seen this and La Strada now (Masina's other notable work), and I feel a little more inclined to go with this one as the better. Some critics have written that Fellini's films, in the evolution of his career, show a gaining momentum up till 8 1/2. Although I'd have to see both each a second go-around, Nights of Cabiria had me enthralled and amazed for the whole two hours. There's something so appealing about a character like Cabiria that's pulled off without a hitch, even into the seemingly 'easy' third act. Add another fantastic Nina Rota score, fascinating supporting cast, and a genuine ideology behind the environment of Cabiria's world, and it's a winner. This is the kind of film that COULD have appealed more so to women than men, but as it stands, the film holds up as a great romantic character study for anyone. A+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cabiria is a prostitute in her 30s. Short and not as pretty as her colleagues either. She lost her parents when she was little so she was never educated or cultured and you can see all this in her character.The first scene shows her being pushed into a river by her boyfriend (pimp too I guess) who just wants to steal her handbag. She gets rescued by some kids and some local people but when she wakes up she absolutely doesn't care about them and is very rude and bad to them. She has had such a hard life, a life where people just use her, a life of no love or respect that most of her mind is just callous.But as we spend time with her, we slowly see that, just like anybody, she too just wants to be loved. But its subtle. She has been burned so many many times that trust is 'extremely' difficult for her.By the end of the movie, we will fall in love with her. You just want to hug her close, kiss her and tell her that she is truly loved for who she and that she will not be harmed. That is how good the acting by Giulietta Masina is (the story too). She has the most expressive eyes that I have seen on screen. If she was in Hollywood, she may have been one of the greatest actresses of all times! This movie is also not for everyone. Its a sort of slice-of-life of just one person, so it doesn't have a conclusive ending. Its not a, she lived happily ever after or she died or she achieved that, kind of movie. And you really need to be older, seen pain, understood the meaning of loneliness, what society is, what people want, etc., to see the heart and reason behind everything.Movie is on the levels of Tokyo Story, so do see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fellini's bitter-sweet classic: funny, sad, sweet, cynical and very engaging</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rome, 1957. A woman, Cabiria, is robbed and left to drown by her boyfriend, Giorgio. Rescued, she resumes her life and tries her best to find happiness in a cynical world. Even when she thinks her struggles are over and she has found happiness and contentment, things may not be what they seem.Wonderfully engaging movie from Federico Fellini. There's a lightness and sweetness about the main character that makes her easy to support. Some great comedy too. It's not all wine-and-roses though. There is a fair amount of struggle, bitterness and cynicism involved. The ending is particularly cynical, possibly too cynical. I am generally not in favour of Hollywood, happily-ever-after, endings but this story deserved a bit more happiness and closure than it ended with.While Fellini pulls the strings to perfection, it is the performance of Giulletta Masina as Cabiria who makes the movie. Street-wise and sassy yet sweet and vulnerable. Very funny, yet able to convey great sadness and struggle too. Some of her physical comedy is Chaplinesque in its brilliance. Her performance spans the whole gamut of human emotions and expressions and she does it incredibly well. Incredibly engaging and it is this engagement that makes the movie so great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a potent feminism manifesto from Fellini and a master-class performance from Masina</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>NIGHTS OF CABIRIA, Fellini sixth feature film, which marks that he has assertively reached the full- blown phrase in his creativity and sleight-of-hand at the age of 37, and anticipates the acme of his career, LA VOLCE VITA (1960) and 8 AND A HALF (1963). The story (with Pasolini inside the coterie as a collaborator), is a tale of woe about a roadside streetwalker Cabiria (Masina) in Rome, whose real name is Maria Ceccarelli.In the opening long shot, we see Cabiria gambols with his beau on a Sunny day in the field near a river, and quick as lightning, he grabs her handbag and pushes her into the water. Cabiria is almost drowned, the same course of events will (almost) replicate itself in the arresting culmination, this time, with another suitor, a well-groomed but greasy self-claimed accountant Oscar (Périer). Why Cabiria hasn't learn anything from her miseries? It is much easier to shoot out pointers in post- mortem, in fact, as we audience follows closely to these non-interrelated episodes of Cabiria's experiences, her wretched destiny doesn't strike more like a subjectively injudicious decision than a fusillade of flak targeting at the injustice of contemporary society and the worst of human vice.Cabiria is petite, petulant and starry-eyed, apart from a narrow escape from death thanks to her dastard boyfriend, she is perfectly content in her own achievement, her self-reliant means of earning secures her a house of her own and some savings in the bank, even during her serendipitous "one-night-stand" with a famous movie star, Alberto Lazzari (Nazzari in his Erroyl Flynn suaveness), in his palatial villa, she is not ashamed of her bog-standard house. Only when she peers from the keyhole of the star's bathroom when Alberto romantically reconciles with his trophy girlfriend Jessy (Gray), she realises there is something missing in her life.A pilgrimage with other working girls jolts her out of her hard earned fulfilment, she transforms from a non-believer to a devotee, daydreams a miracle will bestow on her. After religious epiphany, next in line is prestidigitation, Fellini cunningly alludes to the collusion between them, religion seduces a simple soul and illusion brings her the undoing. In the hypnotic performance, a cynical Cabiria unwittingly reveals herself, the inner child, a love-longing Maria Ceccarelli, which instigates Oscar, a spectator in the audience to conspire his act. Since manifestly Cabiria is not an accomplice of the magician (Silvani), then her state-of-hypnosis is indeed real, which is boldly against the common savvy, and can be perceived as a further tactic to turn realness-and-illusion topsy-turvy, with the sudden arrival of a Prince Charming, willing to marry her and doesn't want to know anything about her past, only with an ulterior motive.Giulietta Masina, what can I say, such a godsend to her hubby, a force of nature can effortlessly entice a viewer to vicariously discern and undergo her character's emotional trajectory, all the more she provoke immense sympathy along the way, the suspense-heightened final revelation is so gut-wrenching to watch yet it is completely captivating and emotive (bolstered by Nino Rota's sublimely emotionally manipulative score). What a triumphant performance, Cannes' BEST ACTRESS honour has never been so worthy!NIGHTS OF CABIRIA won BEST FOREIGN LANGUAGE PICTURE in the Oscar race, a consecutive second win for Fellini after LA STRADA (1954), unlike its tragic protagonist Gesumina, also played by Masina, who succumbs to the hardship and abandonment, in the coda, Cabiria manages to squeeze a smile through her tears with a parade of people singing and dancing around her, like a phoenix back from the ash, the message is uplifting, she may be homeless and penniless, but she has a true friend Wanda (an ace Marzi, in her very naturalistic mien) to rely on, she can go on working the next day and start every from the scratch, what can not kill you only makes you stronger, girl! Such a potent feminism manifesto, one might not expect it from a Fellini's creation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Federico Fellini's Masterpiece Le notti di Cabiria is about a young woman's odyssey,who is by the way a prostitute,throughout Rome.During this odd adventures she comes face to face with her dreams but she never accomplishes them.She in a nostalgic climate looks back when she was younger and more innocent.She is a human being who admires people who give love and are selflessness.In the end she gets charmed from one people like those and in her kindness she believe's him but him tragic conclusions.The trust that she shows to people throughout the film is the reason she gets deluded,but those characteristics make her,even she doesn't realize it one of those people she admires.The ending although it seems sad in total,the last taste that the audience takes is the view of a fighter,a human that looks everyone in the eyes and doesn't fear to show feelings to anyone.The movie might seem boring to some people but when they'll reach to the ending they will be remunerated.The ending climax and the landscape of one of the most dramatic scenes in cinema is outstanding.The viewer draws away from the happy turn the movie has gotten and is thrown for another time to cruelty of the world,but for another time people have to turn their backs to heartbreak and death and fight again.The viewer suffers with the character in a silent scene where both the actress and the director prove their talents.Summing up the movie is totally worth watching.Having a clear mind while watching it will help to get all the meanings many of which have escaped this review.Highlight of the film:The Ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cabiria (Giulietta Masina) is a street walker in Rome. She is first joyfully with her boyfriend Giorgio. Suddenly, he pushes her into the river and steals her purse. She almost drowns. When she regains consciousness, she screams at her rescuers and calls for her boyfriend. Life is hard for her. Giorgio is gone with her money. She's not pretty. She's not the brightest girl. She's frustrated. A vaudeville magician hypnotized the woman as she acts out a date with her dream man. Accountant Oscar is impressed with her honest love and proposes marriage. Cabiria sells everything she has to get 400k lire so that the couple could open a shop. However, her struggle to find love may not come to the happily ever after that she wants so much.Cabiria is an unique character. She is not always likable. She is angry at times. She is an idiot at other times. Federico Fellini creates a damaged character who can't seems to get it right ever. It does meander for much of the first half. The most interesting section starts with the vaudeville show. It ramps up the energy of the movie. The last half of the movie is riveting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nights of Cabiria</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From director Federico Fellini (Amarcord), this is another film, in the Italian language, that I found inside the pages of the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, it is one I liked the sound of as well. Basically Maria 'Cabiria' Ceccarelli (BAFTA nominated Giulietta Masina) is the wide-eyed street walking prostitute with not many friends but a seemingly good outlook on life, and despite living on the poor end of Rome she does have a small house, a bank account and her dreams to keep her going. The story follows Cabiria through a few nights (and days) spending time with various men who have the same thing in common, they all treat her rotten and disappear very quickly. These mistreating men include a man who steals 40,000 lire and almost drowns her with her inability to swim, a movie star who pays little attention to her, and a man of god giving to the poor but again not drawing to her in any way. All Cabiria can do is spend a little time with her friend Wanda (Franca Marzi), and religious services to pray to the holy one in order to have her dream of a better life come true, including finding a man who truly loves her. After helping an illusionist/hypnotist act on stage she meets accountant Oscar D'Onofrio (François Périer) who seems genuinely kind and as they get to know each other liking the idea of a future together, at first she is cautious and suspicious, but she does fall in love with him. They marry within only a few weeks, and during their honeymoon they spend time walking through the woods and towards a cliff overlooking the lake, and Oscar becomes very suspicious indeed. Cabiria realises he intends to push her off the cliff and steal her money, so she just gives up her purse and lets him get away, but walking down the long road back home she can only smile through her tears in a parade of people, she must be hopeful that things will be alright. Also starring Amedeo Nazzari as Alberto Lazzari, Aldo Silvani as The Wizard, Dorian Gray as Jessy, Ennio Girolami as Amleto, Mario Passante as Uncle of Amleto and Pina Gualandri as Matilda the prostitute. In the leading role Masina, also Fellini's wife at the time, is wonderful with her quirky facial expressions, venerability and child like attitude, she is pretty much the key to why this film is so watchable, the character having all these misusing men are the most interesting scenes, it is a thought provoking and enjoyable masterpiece, a great drama. It won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film from any Source. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extraordinary, even for Fellini</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like others, I'm tempted to say this is the greatest film I've seen in my whole life; and I am already 73! That's a lot of movies! This is the greatest of all! I can't say it's on account of Masina; an actress of wonderful talent. Because, in some of her other Fellini roles, she didn't come across as this stupendous. Then it must be what her husband, the inimitable Fellini did for her acting. That's more likely. Everyone knows he was a genius. Giulietta Masina as Cabiria may have been a stroke of that genius, matched with an unforgettable Nino Rota film score, and the undying magic of Rome. Masina was a RIOT of feminine personality and rose to Fellini's greatest occasion in film. All the actors in this gem of a movie are splendid! Now; there is a lovely spiritual aspect to Nights of Cabiria. I suspect hardly anybody in the millions who have seen Cabiria over many years realizes it. Now we'll have a spoiler with the secret aspect realized: Despite her facade of insouciance and exuberance; Cabiria is dejected at the squalor of her prostitution; and how men have exploited her once-innocent youth. She reveals it for a fleeting moment. Before the ostensibly miraculous image of the Virgin, Cabiria breaks down and pleads: For a change in her hopeless life.In the following scenes, disappointment sets in. Both for her and others in the so-called pilgrimage. Her acting, of a slightly rummy prostitute laughing at the notion of innocence and faith, becomes literally heartbreaking. Only Giulietta could have played these scenes.Rather than continue on the spoiler sequence and a final denouement; I suggest viewers hereafter pay attention during the much-admired ending. Everyone knows by now she's leaving Rome. She's disposed of her property and for love's sake Cabiria puts her past behind her. Then we're led to see her last agony toward the end. While Rota's absolutely smashing score is played by a group of adolescents, she sheds one last tear and smiles into Fellini's camera. Because her prayer before the Virgin is answered. It's been very painful, but her life has changed at last!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Miracle of Giuletta Masina (Mrs Fellini)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm sure, like many, I first set eyes on the then Mrs Fellini, Giuletta Masina, who stars as Cabiria, as the stray little clown in La Strada, who was sold to Anthony Quinn's cruel one-man performing act. I'm glad that I bought and viewed the two DVDs in this order.How the character developed in La Strada was extraordinarily compelling and at its conclusion, I was in distress and tears. I was also in tears at the end of Cabiria, for different reasons, of which I'll keep to myself, so as to not spoil for others.Cabiria, is a plucky little prostitute in a poor, run-down Rome area whose sassy lip and terrier like fight-back saves her bacon, many times. From an attempted drowning at the start, to being a distracting plaything for a film star who gets back with his mistress in front of Cabiria's eyes.There's always that fiery competition and catty dialogue one presumes street-girls the world over are forever rattling off. Bettering themselves, moving on, meeting Mr Right etc. Her entanglements are counterbalanced by that other Fellini (La Dolce Vita especially) fascination, the Catholic church. Cabiria isn't a fallen angel, just one that's stuck in a degrading and constricting 'profession', always at the mercy of someone else.Eventually, she believes she meets her Intended-to-be. The immense joy that radiates from that wide-eyed face of hers then; but at other times can send rods of acute sadness through you in seconds just by a held expression. Maybe, she's the original Meryl Streep, in that, even without dialogue, her face alone can express a whole scene. Direction from one's husband obviously helps.Really very good films generally don't get more than a 9/10 from me. There is always a sliver of room for improvement in 99.9 of films. To get a 10, it has to have a profound, personal effect on me. This did and whilst not having any idea how the film was going to end, my emotions went through every scenario - and back again. When it was in an unexpected way, I just knew that it was the only way that Cabiria, as we'd got to know her, and love her, WOULD have made it.This is an absolute must for anybody and everybody, who has a TV (or PC, or Ipad, or whatever). I'm still bristling with feelings from it, 12 hours after seeing it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my first comment on a movie so be nice, thanks. It is hard to describe exactly what I felt during this movie but I was really moved. Directed beautifully by Fellini casting his beautiful wife as the star. She has the most amazing smile and wonderful facial expressions. I loved Oscar, he seemed to be just like me, except for the ending. He acted out his love with passion and even deceived me, a little tearjerker. My favorite part was when Cabiria encountered the magician/hypnotist. He gave such thought to his words and had such poise and was a great entertainer, reminding me kind of like Edward Norton in the illusionist. Oscar then took me away with his beautiful words. The first couple lines are his best. I love how at the end she is torn and sad walking down the street with all the kids playing music and dancing ironically next to her. She uses that to cheer herself up which brings that great loving smile of hers to show us that she is still living and the worst is hopefully over, this gives us hope! I love how everyone keeps calling her a nut yet she still tries showing everybody that she isn't what they think, even though it's not what other people think of you that matters but what you think of yourself. Showing other people just helps bring it out and who wouldn't want to show other people how you have changed for the better. Everyone is in search for happiness but happiness lies within. Many people don't know that but it's how you think of things that brings happiness. A mind is a great thing. I would definitely watch this movies more times to come and hope to get it on DVD. This is an art masterpiece. I've heard much about Fellini, and this was my first movie of him I've seen. He greatly influenced David Lynch, my favorite director and one of the best artsy movie directors, as well as Stanley Kubrick. I look forward to seeing 8 1/2 which could be more comparable with Lynchian works. PS The only reason that I give it an 8 and not 10 is because I want to leave room for improvement which there always is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finale Scene</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My lord, how they scream!! AHAHA I laughed so much with this movie! Of course, it's a classic, but I don't think I'll see it many times, but on its way, it worth my time. The character's naivety gets on nerves, but we know there are people like this in the world, and I can say, who never were naive in life? It could not be in the same outrageous levels of Cabiria, but anyway...Well, the final scene is the best, it demonstrate how life really is. You are there, crying, during a terrible moment in your life, when something simple as a "hello" makes you smile again, and hope come back to your life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Night of Cabiria</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Night of Cabiria (1957) **** (out of 4) Oscar-winning drama of prostitute Cabiria (Giulietta Masina) who has very little in this world except for her dream of finding someone who really loves her. It seems each time someone serious takes an interest in her, it's for some reason other than true love. I still haven't seen too many Fellini movies in my life but the ones I have seen have left me rather cold even though I was highly impressed with the talent shown in them. I was really looking forward to this one and as it would turn out this here is my favorite that I've seen from the director so far. I read quite a few reviews before watching this and each of them seemed to have a different opinion on the film. Some called it a chic flick. Some called it a black comedy. Some called it a depressing nightmare. The one thing I agreed most with was a critic who compared it to a female version of Chaplin's Little Tramp character. I think what works so well about the film is that it contains a little bit of everything and all of these emotions are perfectly pulled off by Masina who turns in a masterful performance and really makes this character one of the most memorable female roles in film history. I think she perfectly nails the darker side of the comedy in scenes like the beginning when she returns home after her "true love" trying to drown her by pushing her in the lake. The scene with her on the bed is so sad it's hilarious. I think she also does a great job in terms of being a woman simply wanting love. The innocence of this dream really comes across as something very touching and something we want her to find. Then, there are the darker moments that I won't ruin but she again nails these perfectly. There have been countless films with women playing prostitutes and quite often people joke that this is the type of role any actress would want to play and I can't help but wonder if that feeling started here. I guess it goes without saying that Masina was overlooked at the Oscars this year. Fellini's touch is also on hand and I thought that for the most part he kept the film moving very well, although I didn't care too much for the scene that was added to prints in 1998 with the mysterious man delivering the blankets. Outside of this scene the director handles the various emotions quite well and the beautiful photography really jumps out at one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>splendid film, splendid creation of Giulietta Masina</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Le notti di Cabiria' is a wonderful film who survived very well the half century since it was made and can be seen today with the same emotion. Much of the secret of this survival over time is due to the splendid creation of Giulietta Masina, who in the role of Cabiria creates one of these universal characters that belongs to the family of Chaplin's Charlot - a woman who dreams to overcome her condition and keeps her humanity and her determination despite the repeated hits that life and destiny pour on her. Over an over again she is brought to believe that she can reach absolution and happiness, by means of dreams, by means of people, by means of religion, yet every tie she is deceived, just to raise again and get back to fighting life with her unforgettable smile among tears. The film is very well made, and represents a milestone of the evolution of Fellini from the neorealistic films of the first part of his career to the more sophisticated and aesthetic movies of the next decades. It contains some of the best elements of both periods in his creation, and the result is human, moving and beautiful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before Federico Fellini became the audacious and surrealistic film auteur of the 1960s he was a lauded and accomplished Italian Neorealistic film director of the 1950s, more in league with Vittorio De Sica and Lucchino Visconti, and no film better represents this era of Fellini's art than his sterling 1957 film Nights Of Cabiria (Le Notti Di Cabiria), written by Fellini, Tulio Pinelli, and Ennio Flaiano (with Pier Paolo Pasolini scripting the Roman street slang), and starring his wife Giulieta Masina. It won the 1957 film Oscar for Best Foreign Film, and deservedly so. The film deals with the trials and tribulations of the impoverished and downtrodden in a humorous but realistic way that Hollywood still does not dare to do. Yet, even in this film, one can see the filmmaker that Fellini was to become in a few years, for, despite its seeming realism, there are many neat touches of Absurdism, Symbolism, and Surrealism?. In many ways, the film is a picaresque of one of the oldest clichés: the hooker with the heart of gold, but such a generalization utterly disservices the 'how' of how art affects one, and how it does its task. Masina's brilliant performance, which won the Best Actress award at the Cannes Film Festival, is often compared to Chaplin's tramp character, even though it is more like Lucille Ball's TV character of Lucy Ricardo, from I Love Lucy, albeit with depth, delicacy, and heart; such a depth of a character that a lesser actress would have let descend into burlesque. Yet, Cabiria's expressiveness is more subtle and true than either Chaplin's or Ball's characters, for they exist only in comedies, and Nights Of Cabiria is not a comedy, despite some funny moments. Cabiria exists in a far more complex and realistic world than the Tramp or Lucy Ricardo. Her face contorts into twists of pain Lucy Ricardo never dreamt of, and which the Tramp simply shrugged off, or responded to with wild slapstick. Cabiria is wary, mistrusts, and does not seem to learn, frustrating both her and the audience she has gotten to root for her. I knew many such women in my New York neighborhood while growing up. And they can be tough, street smart, yet still gullible enough to fall for an Oscar. That said, critics have disagreed, over the years, over whether or not Oscar was conning Cabiria from the start. I think it's clear he was, for from her answers to the mesmerist he felt she was an independent woman of means, assuming a poor woman would never even go to such a show. One can even see from their scene of meeting at the train station that Oscar is putting on an act, changing his facial expressions the moment he sees her, dropping a toothpick from his mouth, after looking like the consummate con man, and then assuming a weak demeanor to lure Cabiria into his trap. That the woman who makes her living in sex is still so na?ve to the ways of emotional sexual involvement says a lot of Fellini's prescience in parsing out realities of character development. Then, when he found out she was a prostitute, he felt a bit guilty, as if preying on someone from his own class, and thus wanted to not know of her 'job'. A part of him, it seems, wants to not con her, at the cliff, and this was why his demeanor is so different. Yet, ultimately, he's a con, she's a whore, and reality dictates they act their parts. But, unlike Giorgio, he is no would be killer. The only question is what his initial con was to be- to marry a woman of means, and then, failing that, to just take Cabiria's money the moment he saw it, knowing his original plan was dead, for he could not sponge off of her. Such small ambiguities, even if not pertinent to Cabiria's ultimate unhappiness, nor the film's ending, makes Fellini an artist of the first rank, for only such artists pay attention to such things. These things, not the great things, are often the difference between greats and minor artists.These sorts of subtleties in common folk are never even broached, much less dealt with, in modern Hollywood films. Such is the richness of this marvelous study in class and self-deception, where humans live in small concrete boxes they call homes, as if lab rats. That the film does not follow a conventional narrative format is a good thing, for it heightens the realistic sense of the film. It also subtly repudiates religion, although not so much in the overtly religious scenes, where Cabiria's spiritual entreaties go unheard, nor where she mocks the religiots as fools, but in those scenes where Cabiria reveals her most human side, the non-fantastic, which is ironic, since she works in a profession that deals with fantasy. The film also deals with survival, at its basest level, for Cabiria barely grows intellectually through the film. Yes, by film's end, one could argue that her latest user and abuser, Oscar, is a step up from Giorgio, whom she began the film with, but has Cabiria really ameliorated?To close, Nights Of Cabiria owes much to City Lights for its focus on the poor, as well as to De Sica's The Bicycle Thief, for its realistic view of life at a certain time and place, especially its end, which simply ends, with no indication of whether or not Cabiria will be better off or not, and this helps viewers more strongly identify with her, because we all are unknowing and uncertain of our futures, and even though Cabiria's uncertainty is half a century removed, the tingle we get in our bellies, at the film's end is a recognition of our fears in her gaze toward us, and despite it's unsettling effect, such butterflies still flap their wings for the future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film as Miracle Prostitution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.I suppose there are many who believe this to be a character study, or perhaps social criticism. I don't think so -- I believe this to be Fellini's first film concerned with the nature of what film is: part prostitution, part promised miracle; part mesmerised fantasy; part romantic pretense.And that's how this film is constructed, four set pieces dealing with these four ideas:-- The film actor as reluctant prostitute-- The masses flocking to the madonna based on the magic of the ritual performance-- The audience being hypnotized by watching someone be hypnotized-- The play that is behind love, and all it is, is a play for money (which connects to the small sequence in the beginning)This is definitely worth watching, and it has historical significance as well. But I think it s pretty weak Fellini so far as the visual elements and the narrative adventure. So many of the dramatic metaphors are peculiarly Italian -- somehow they don't translate to the universal as well as say the Japanese of Kurosawa.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A waifish prostitute (Giulietta Masina) wanders the streets of Rome looking for true love but finds only heartbreak.I do not feel confident critiquing this film, as it is the first Federico Fellini film I have seen. Sure, one should be able to judge a film on its own merits, but I feel like it would be more fair to put this one in context of his overall career, seeing as this was 55 years ago...Bosley Crowther gave the film a mixed review, saying "this one is aimed more surely toward the development of a theme than a plot. Its interest is not so much the conflicts that occur in the life of the heroine as the deep, underlying implications of human pathos that the pattern of her life shows... But there are two weaknesses in Cabiria. It has a sordid atmosphere and there is something elusive and insufficient about the character of the heroine. Her get-up is weird and illogical for the milieu in which she lives and her farcical mannerisms clash with the ugly realism of the theme." I include this here merely to show how time has aged this film well -- no critic today would come down so harsh on Fellini.What I actually found most interesting was the producer being Dino De Laurentiis. Now, that in itself is not strange, because he has produced a great many things (and other Fellini films). But again, looking back 50 years, Dino is known for his involvement in horror and science fiction. It is interesting to see he had such a distinguished beginning. Most people in film start in horror and then go legit, not the other way around.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bleak portrait of a bleak person</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever since I was bored to tears by both 8 1/2 and La Dolce Vita; Federico Fellini hasn't been at the top of my favourite directors list. However, he went up a little in my estimation after I saw La Strada, and Night of Cabiria ensures that my opinion of him has risen further still. The film is a very bleak portrayal of the life of a young woman in Italy, who becomes the victim of several men; but isn't completely blameless herself. The film starts with a sequence that sees this woman, named Cabiria, dumped into a river shortly before her purse is stolen by her supposed 'love'. Any sympathy we have for her is quickly lost after she is rescued by some helpful villagers, and proceeds to mock their rescue by being very rude indeed. The central character is very hard to like, as she's seriously lacking in good points; but this seems to be the point of the movie. Cabiria doesn't treat others very well, and as such; she doesn't get a good deal very often herself. The character is never really allowed to develop - she always has the same motives, but her situation changes around her - and Fellini gives us a cinematic interpretation of the old proverb 'a leopard never changes its spots'.The film takes place largely in the downtrodden areas of Rome. Fellini does an excellent job of enforcing the character's situation on his audience, and the black and white cinematography helps to ensure that the movie always looks suitably bleak. This film represents a reunion between director Federico Fellini and his La Strada star Giulietta Masina. Masina delivers an energetic performance, which ensures that the film is never boring; but it also means that her character often appears over the top, and the film loses credibility because of that. To be honest, I don't think this actress suits the film too well. She fit her role in La Strada like a glove, and it may be for that reason that she is hard to accept in such a different persona. Anyway, the style of the film is great; Fellini ensures that the film feels very Italian, and this combined with the energy from the lead makes the film more enjoyable than quite a few similar art films. The ending is great, and fits everything leading up to it brilliantly. This is the only way the film could have ended properly; making the climax both fitting and satisfying. Overall, Nights of Cabiria is an excellent classic film and one that I recommend to fans of art cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An ingenious examination of illusion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Some spoilers below) This film is about illusions, and how everybody - individuals, governments, performers, religions, actors, prostitutes, film directors - exploits them for their own ends. Some do so in ways which are harmful to others. Some, like Cabiria, harm themselves.Fellini's examination of illusion draws on a rich tradition, particularly in European theatre (the dominance of "seeming" over "being", illusion and deception over honesty, goes right back to Hamlet and beyond).The film is structured around a series of expositions of illusion, involving a bogus lover, a famous actor, a pilgrimage, a variety show, and, finally, to close the circle...a bogus lover again. Add in the fact that the central character is a prostitute...I think you're starting to get the picture.So if all is illusion, why watch the film? Because the central purveyor (and, more importantly, victim) of illusion (the prostitute Cabiria) is a convincingly-portrayed, complex character who exhibits a tough, life-affirming drive to take on the world (in the best Camusian, post-war existentialist sense). It is this that makes the film such an exhilarating experience. Millions of people in Italy and all over Europe in the 1940's and 1950's had to live in a world which had utterly collapsed. In this world, one did what one could to get by, and religion, love, sensual pleasure, and, of course, the cinema, offered only brief respite from the everyday realities.The classic neo-realist edge-of-city building-site sets add the requisite touch of alienation and barrenness to the action. But this is not the kind of hardline neo-realist tract satirized by Nichetti in "The Icicle Thief". Fellini's natural sense of cinema as fantasy enables the viewer to feel good at the end of a film where no conventional feelgood factor is offered. And surely that's an achievement in itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Picaresque Feminism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this masterpiece by a great director, Fellini tells of the prostitute Cabiria who spends the entire movie searching for love without ever actually having sex. I know what you're thinking: "Ra-ra; that sounds boring. Wrong.At the heart of this film is a feminist who is coming into her own. The audience feels her heartbreak as she goes from man to man looking for "the one." As a guy, I must say that I started to hate men. I guess that's sort of the point. Cabiria's character is essentially an innocent, and it is hard to watch people take advantage of innocents (and innocence). Well Fellini makes you sit through it, and the effect is awesome.When it finally seems as if Cabiria has found the right man, the viewer cannot help but to be wary after all of the s**t she had to go through with the others. Is the viewer right? What do you think?The final shot gives me chills (the good kind). It stands as a testament to the independence of womankind and their strength to persevere when they are left with nothing.Awesome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So Characteristically Fellini</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With her short stature, small round face, big eyes, and ponytail, Cabiria makes for a memorable character. And actress Giulietta Masina plays the part well. She exudes emotional depth, and an abundance of animated expressions. But through most of the film, Cabiria's attitude is too belligerent to render her sympathetic. Yes, she has lots to complain about. But early in the film, we don't know that. And the expressiveness that makes her so endearing in the last Act makes her callous at the start."Nights Of Cabiria" is a typical Fellini film, in that it lacks basic plot structure. Instead of weaving a unified story from an underlying premise, the film mostly presents viewers with a series of unrelated vignettes. We see Cabiria in varying situations, and how she reacts to an assortment of secondary characters. But these vignettes are presented in structural isolation. Only toward the end does Fellini begin to connect the dots, and thereby compose a cinematic portrait that is thematically coherent.Not only does the screen story lack structure, the dialogue is maddeningly talky. And again, most of the chatter is battling and argumentative. It gets stale, quickly.Visually, the film looks great. The B&amp;W cinematography conveys wonderful lighting contrast, especially in the nighttime scenes, along with a variety of camera angles and interesting compositions. The background music also contributes to the film's artistic feel.Overall, however, the film's structural weakness, the expressed hostility, and the talky dialogue burden the film to the point that I just can't recommend it, except to viewers who naturally gravitate to Fellini's unorthodox style of film-making.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fellini's Neverending Circus</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Federico Fellini's "Nights of Cabiria" is of all his films perhaps the most representative of the filmmaker and his art - it displays his cinematic genius, his ability to draw out fantastic performances from actors, his deluge of empathy, and his greatest weakness. Allow me to explain; for Fellini, much of life and art are a circus. This can be seen in the comic touch of "I Vitteloni", the farcically random events of "8 1/2", and in the three-ring music of Nina Rota. The theme of life as a circus is all very well, but it sometimes leaves you hanging - as if the movie will continue forever but you, the viewer, will not. This is the problem with "Nights of Cabiria" - it is the tale of a young prostitute who is trying to find some kind of salvation. She at first tries to find it in boyfriend, moves on to a movie star, then attempts to attain it through religion, and finally tries to discover it in love - but salvation seems forever out of reach, for each of those things listed above ultimately fail her, and thus the movie fails to really end; it simply goes on piping and marching as the viewer sits wondering where s/he is left. For these reasons, "Nights of Cabiria" doesn't fully work; but this is not to damn it, for it is for the most part a heart-wrenching, beautiful, and powerful film. 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is almost considered heretic to write something negative about Fellini. As a matter of fact, Fellini succeeded to create an ambient of adoration around him like possibly no other film director ever. However, all is not gold that glitters.In Fellini's "Cabiria" we see some whores of Rome, although they are bitterly poor and misused by their pimps, jumping and dancing in the streets, merrily laughing, having fun with drinks and food all together enjoying their lives. Even the pimps are there, and if something bad happens than it is a curse or a smashed car-door, not more. And when they fight, it is less harmful than amongst children. Even in one of the last scenes, where an old whore is shown who must live in an earth-cave: she is happy, and as long as the angel provides her with food, she thanks god that she is allowed to have such a miserable existence. Fellinis whores have no diseases, and when they suffer, than because of loneliness and not from hunger, gonorrhea and bloody limbs.It is hard to believe, yet true, that the screenplay of this movie was written by Pier Paolo Pasolini, by the same Pasolini who portrayed the world of the whores of Romes in a quite different way than Fellini did. In film theory, one tries to absorb this difference by a notion of time: Fellini is "realistic", Pasolini is "neo-realistic". In literature one would speak about the difference between realism and naturalism, and in truth one has to speak about the difference between the blissful stupidity of Fellini who by guarantee never has made a step down to Ostia and Pasolini who lived there and was killed there. Pasolini's "Mamma Roma" is not a childish grinning clown-esquire puppet like Masina's "Cabiria" with her school-girlish white socks, but the Academy Award went to Fellini's wife and not to Anna Magnani. Clearly, Fellini who resided on one of the 7 hills of Rome made the money, Pasolini was 36 times before court and was poor almost like his friends in Ostia.This is bitterly sad because it is objectively false. One of the main reasons why the big earthquake came in film in the Sixties, called "Nouvelle Vague", "Neue Welle" of "New Wage" is that film makers in whole Europe were fed up with rose-red lies, conformism, idealistic prosthetics of fascism and other wonderful post-war achievements. In Germany, Fassbinder ended brutally the "Schulmädchen-Report"- and "Lederhosen"-culture. In France, the "grandfather of Nouvelle Vague", Jean-Pierre Melville, lead the level of the French gangster film up to that of the best American Film Noirs. And it Italy? In Italy where the fascism was almost more popular after than during World War II, supported by the Catholic church, Fellini continued his artificial sugar-sweet artistic, astonishingly untouchable by any critique who wanted to make film besides Fellini. Less than 20 years after "Cabiria" was released under his own collaboration, Pasolini knew only one answer to the deplorable and miserable intellectual situation in Italy: his gigantic masterpiece "Salo" (1975).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Fellini film is NOT my cup of tea!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I used to hate the films of Fellini, I have recently seen several more and re-seen a few and have a greater appreciation for the director. In particular, I did not like LA STRADA the first time, but now think it is a wonderful film and his earlier "forgotten" films are exceptional. My particular favorite of all his films is the segment he did for BOCCACCIO 70--it was very surreal and hilarious. However, despite my increased appreciation, I STILL don't particularly like Le NOTTI di CABIRIA--though I liked it a little more the second time because at least I could see that it was technically well-made. However, the story itself of a prostitute who wants to be loved and cared for is unrelentingly awful and depressing--so much so that I never want to see it again. Part of this might be because I am more a romantic at heart and part of it is that I just feel the film is wildly overrated. Sure, Giulietta Masina did a fine job--she was a fine actress (as well as Fellini's wife), but this doesn't make the movie. The problem is that the movie is so unrelentingly realistic and grim. Sure, in real life prostitutes don't find love and are often abused--but do I really have to see this movie to know this?! The film starts with Masina getting beaten up and nearly killed by her "boyfriend" and the film ends much the same way. Everything else in between is leading us to believe that this inevitable ending might not occur, but it does. Now I am not saying I want a vacuous and insipid film about a prostitute with a heart of gold--after all, my review for PRETTY WOMAN was savage (I truly, truly hated that movie). But other than a grim lesson that life sucks, I really can't see why I would recommend this film. It's good, but not at all pleasant. For people that can stand all the emotional pain, you may like it a lot more than me--I just want something a little more uplifting and likable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I fail to understand why a group of people connected with the "Partito Comunista Italiano" decided to turn the neo-realism into some kind of "blessed are the idiots, because theirs is the kingdom of heaven"...To me, Federico Fellini tried to imitate the contemporary "Réalisme Poétique" of France, but he had not the dramatic writing powers of say "Jacques Pr?vert". Fellini's approach to the cinema is that a drawer or painter, that's where he started. He had then to find partners to write the script and found only third class ones.The great writers of WWII times in Italy like Moravia, Caesare Pavese and others were not invited, or refused...Fellini was never an active fighter of Mussolini...The result is that Fellini's movies have no dramatic structure... They are mere vignettes. The musical equivalent is Moussourgski's "Pictures at an Exhibition". This became a masterpiece only after Maurice Ravel orchestrated it to perfection..In films like "La Dolce Vita" and "Otto et Mezzo" this lack of dramatic structure is quite acceptable. In Amarcord, which is my favorite Fellini's movie, it is not needed, because it is so close to the truth as a documentary , rings so true and therefore becomes beautiful.But in Cabiria it is badly needed and is missing..When Amedeo Nazzari, in bed, after drinking champagne, prefers to listen to Beethoven's 5th instead of making love to Cabiria, who he does not wish to humiliate, on the contrary, this is the work of guys that know nothing about whores, women or the meaning of Beethoven's 5th.The ending sequence is stupidly pathetic.No wonder that the OIC (Vatican's Movies Office) gave this a prize.Fellini kind of redeemed himself next year in "La Dolce Vita" dressing Anita Ekberg as a "Putana Monsignore". It was too late..</fullReview>

The title character is unsympathetic, irritating, and nasty, and the person portraying her cannot act at all. It is like watching an eighth grade Italian Kabuki presentation.I have seen and enjoyed many Fellini films. Many have the characteristics seen here, but also include some redeeming qualities; fine acting, attractive people, an engaging story. Not this turkey. Cabiria would have done better to have drowned, as was threatened in the opening scene. Of course she was saved (or there would be no movie) and promptly chews out her rescuers. Just because a film is European, black &amp; white, and done on the cheap does not make it art.I am so glad I rented this instead of buying it or paying to see it in the theater.
