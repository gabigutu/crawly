		<shortDescription>Slow build-up to a clock ticking climax...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>TRUE CRIME is a sophisticated crime thriller that takes time to delve into its lead character--CLINT EASTWOOD--who promptly turns out to be very much like the Eastwood character we've already seen in a dozen or so films--boozy, insolent, direct, and relentless when he's on the trail of a killer or playing detective with everyday citizens.It isn't until his newspaper partner is killed in a driving accident that his conscience takes over and he decides to pursue the case that intrigued her--a case involving a man she believes is innocently awaiting sentence in California's death row.He pleads with his newspaper boss (JAMES WOODS) to give him more time to insert himself into the case and track down the real killer. This leads to a black woman who inadvertently gives him a clue he's been searching for and to their desperate attempt to reach the governor in time to stop the execution. Scenes of the state preparing step by step to begin the process are cross-cut with Eastwood's car chase to alert the authorities in time. It makes a smashing, riveting climax.Basic storyline seems awfully familiar for anyone who has seen a movie from the '40s, CALL NORTHSIDE 777, all about one man's attempt to save a man from the chair whom he believes is totally innocent. And there too, the clue depended on a piece of evidence seen by the naked eye.Eastwood's acting and direction is above reproach--he's fine and totally in control in both departments. In fact, all the supporting roles are extremely well played. Well worth viewing--and has something to say about race relations too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fairly Engaging</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>True Crime is a fairly engaging movie that has some good performances. Eastwood as the director stages the action well and moves the plot forward. Only in the scenes where he takes his daughter to the zoo does the film tend to lose a little momentum. Then again, a scene like that helps illustrate the character that Eastwood is playing. He'll follow a story, but he'll try to make time for his daughter. Eastwood the actor, he seems to enjoy the roles of the tough but flawed theme. His character in True Crime is a womanizer, and a former drunk. Good characters always have flaws and Eastwood can play them with his eyes closed. The supporting cast is well rounded and helps advance the narrative. The only qualm I had was that Eastwood the director, should've tightened the running time and made the story that much more urgent. We've all seen the beat the clock films and this one's no exception. What could've made this movie better is a brisker pace, but Eastwood the director chose a more laid back style. After thirty years in the business, Eastwood can do whatever he wants with his films. He's earned it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clint soars again with a good cast, adding lustre to routine story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll be perfectly frank; it's difficult for me not to have bias in my reviews of Clint Eastwood films because I admire his persona as a actor and director a great deal. However, saying that, I never shy away from giving credit when credit is due. I praised "Bridges of Madison County," raved "In the Line of Fire," okayed "Absolute Power," and failed to see the point of "Midnight in the Garden..." Clint's latest effort, entitled TRUE CRIME, is another good mystery that can be added to Clint's stellar works of the nineties. I will admit that it doesn't necessarily give us a story that we haven't seen before, or give us a Clint that we failed to notice previously, but the acting is so top-notch and the story is very well-paced, it's very hard to knock this film. Clint is a journalist for an Oakland paper who is famous for turning print media into crime-solving reports. He is also far from saintly, sleeping around with various women of assorted age groups (one of them happens to be his supervisor's wife), and of course, he drinks up a storm. Amidst all these turn-offs, he still has the guts to prove that a young black man (Isaiah Washington, in a fine performance) is not guilty of killing a convenience store clerk in cold blood. He has less than a day to prove it because, it so happens, Washington is to be executed by lethal injection at San Quentin by a minute after midnight, that very night! Sound familiar? What does work very well in TRUE CRIME is the way in which the film is paced. Clint cuts right to the chase, giving us just the facts, keeping the suspense taut throughout the whole film, and maintaining our interest. His cast is well chosen as always. Washington is a fine new talent, doing an effecting acting job here. James Woods appears in a few entertaining scenes as the head editor of the paper, humorous and stylish as usual. Denis Leary, very subdued this time, is Eastwood's protege. Frances Fisher even turns up briefly as the district attorney who handled Washington's case six years before. TRUE CRIME is a good thriller, told with quick pacing, effective acting, and good direction as always by Eastwood. The only major problem I have is that it doesn't provide us with any new plotlines or intricate complications. But then again, how often do we get something like this from Hollywood anymore? It is certainly not a lot. Rating: Three stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good character driven story ? but usual `race against the clock' conclusion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When his colleague is killed in a car crash, worn out journalist Steve Everett inherits her story ? a human interest piece on a man due to be executed at midnight that night. Everett tries to balance his collapsing personal life with his feeling that the condemned man, Beachum, is innocent. He begins to search for the vital evidence that will prove his feeling correct.This sounds like you know where it's going ? a worn out journalist (alcoholic), an innocent man on death row, an investigation etc etc?.but for the majority this manages to avoid all the usual pitfalls. It does this by being very well written, instead of caricatures we have characters. Everett is a mess, and Eastwood lets us see this ? we're used to seeing rogue cops and journalists sleeping around, drinking etc, but here we see the consequences of this. Likewise we are made to feel for the Beachum family and get a feel for the human stories that exist in the support characters. However, with 30 minutes to go, we have the usual twist and countdown thriller conclusion that spoils it a lot, but not completely.Eastwood is excellent as a director, but he's even better here as a actor. At times he plays it too light, but for the majority we can see him weighted down by the pressure of his quest but also the self inflicted collapse of his personal life. This is not an ego-driven project. Washington however steals the show with a great performance, you can't help be moved by his dignity ? Denzel is not the only Washington who is under-rewarded. Lisa Gay Hamilton is also superb and works really well with Washington ? together they take some scenes that could have been soapy or melodramatic and make them powerful and emotional. Woods is good and has good banter with Eastwood, but a times feels out of place with the mood of the film ? but he does provide some humour. Leary is great in a non-comedy role, he is the representation of Everett's selfishness. Diane Venora is OK in a small role as Everett's wife (the casting director had clearly seen her similar role in Heat). And we have small roles for McKean and a strange role from Lucy Liu ? very small considering she had already done a few big movies.We get some `jobs for the boys' but they don't affect the quality ? Eastwood has his wife (at time of writing!) Dina Eastwood and his daughter Francesca in side roles.Overall, it may fall into the usual crime thriller cliché of a big twist, but up till then it is an assured character driven piece that is very enjoyable to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of the surprisingly good suspense films of 99</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood's True Crime shows how even at the ripe old age of 69 (or 70) he can still make a film that has an equal level of skill and practical entertainment value to his older ones. It's nothing great as art, however, and I doubt that it'll be put along the ranks of his great westerns of really chilling cop thrillers. But I remember seeing it twice in the theater (the second time as it was the only movie I could see as being worth seeing among the lot of movies that were out in the theater that time of the year), and thinking well enough of it both times. It's a perfunctory, suspenseful look at a flawed-man though hard-edged journalist (Eastwood) who is trying to find the truth of a death years earlier to save a man's life on deat5h row (Isaiah Washingon is convincing as this man). Denis Leary and James Woods give their all for Eastwood here as co-stars, and there's always a sense of other good character actors in the mix as well (Michael Jeter anyone?). With moments of sorrow mixed with touches of dark comedy, and a finale we all know is coming but keeps us biting the nails all the way, it's not bad at all. If I wouldn't rank it right up there with the best of Eastwood's it might be because of its pat predictability and somewhat lack of interest in the core case in the story. B+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing many other reviews for this film, my interest was dulled, but when it aired on TV, I said "hey, why not", and I ended up being pleasently surprised. OK, it is formulamatic, but it is undeniably suspensful, and always entertaining. Its another film that shows that our justice system is not perfect. Also, great cast as well, James Woods(Videodrome, Casino), and look quick for Christine Ebersol(Amadeus), and even Anthony Zerbe(Papillon, The Dead Zone), he plays the governor for a few seconds near the end, if anyone cares. Once again, its a really good film, deserves at least 7.0 user rating. I'll give it 8.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cliché Ridden</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the most hackneyed piece of trash I've ever sat down to watch. Everything was predictable, from the car crash in the beginning to the supposedly exciting finish.The opening of the movie was the best part. The viewer hasn't a clue why this man is being examined or why they are taking down all this trivial information. But then we move into a bar where an aging Clint Eastwood is sharing a cocktail with a twenty-something colleague of the opposite sex. She's very attractive, and I'm not sure how much they paid her for her short part, but being forced to swap spit with someone old enough to be her great grandfather should have made her eligible for hazardous duty pay. I'm sure there are a few aging baby boomers who still find Clint sexy, but that scene was done better in Scary Movie 4, and much more appropriate in a comedy.Now who didn't see the car crash coming? A young lady has a few drinks, leaves the bar, the scene outside was heavy with fog and foreshadowing. Then we see her fiddling with the radio in pouring rain. We all know what's going to happen and thus the crash is absolutely gratuitous. Gratuitous and over the top: what could have taken less than a second seems to go on forever and ever as the tires screech and car spins again and again and again. Later we learn that she died on "Dead Man's Curve." Can you say "cliché?" The clichés don't end there. In fact, they just don't end. Eastwood plays a recovering drunk, on the way out, hoping to reclaim his lost reputation. Everywhere he turns, he finds brick walls. The district attorney is a cliché: convinced that the person about to be executed is guilty. Eastwood's boss is a cliché: on his case, wants him gone, sure he's back on the bottle. Eastwood is the only one convinced that the convict is innocent and he's got just a few hours to save him. The stuff exciting endings are made of.But then we see a flashback of the actual murder. The accused, played by Isaiah Washington, is in the store's bathroom, when the victim is shot. He runs out, drops to his knees, and panics. He calls for help and tries to give the girl mouth to mouth resuscitation, when in walks a customer wanting to make a phone call. He stands up and then suddenly remembers he's a cliché of a black man. We can almost hear his thoughts: "Oh geesus, I's be black. Dat white man gonna think I done killed dis white girl. Feet don't fail me now!" and he runs from the scene of the crime.Good lord. Nobody, I repeat, NOBODY in the middle of a life or death crisis who is trying to save the life of another human being breaks out of that mode of thought to think about his own petty personal world. This was the bullcrap upon which this whole story turns? Well, at this point, they lost me entirely.I jumped ahead to the exciting final moments with Eastwood driving his beater recklessly to the Governor's house with his "witness" in the car with him.Just in the nick of time.Finally, to fulfill the cliché ridden beginning and middle, we end with a Christmas cliché. Eastwood is out shopping, he exits the store, looks up, and sees the convict whose life he saved out shopping with his family. Yes, two perfect strangers brought together by coincidence, with one alive only because of the hard work and determination of the other, will always meet later during the season of joy. Believe me, I did not get the warm and fuzzies.If I ever see this title listed in my television's guide, I will immediately say to myself: I'd rather be waterboarded.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>1999's best film thus far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"True Crime" was a real surprise for me. I expected a good movie, but I didn't expect an excellent movie, and excellent movie is what I got. Clint Eastwood is a truly gifted individual, both as an actor and as a director. This is by far one of his best achievements, and is the best film of 1999 so far.The film is the story of a sexually promiscuous journalist, Steve Everett played by Clint Eastwood, who is assigned to interview a man just before his execution. The man on death row insists that he is innocent, and Steve having a "nose" for sniffing when something is astray, believes him and desperately begins an investigation with the hope of saving his life. At first, the film seems to be trying to send a message about the death penalty, but soon we realize that this is not the case. There are many other integral issues being explored. I mentioned earlier that Steve is promiscuous in that he has had sexual relations with a number of his coworkers. He describes himself as "searching for love". Considering that he is married, he seems like a lonely man. There are a number of crude sexual innuendos thrown around the office at the Tribune and at first they don't seem to make sense. At points, they are incredibly funny, but they seem out of place, but it becomes evident that this is a further reflection of Steve's lonely character. He is a lonely man who lives in the articles that he writes for the Oakland Tribune. Perhaps this is why he gets so involved in them. Here he wants to save a man from being executed, a year before he tried to prove that a man who had committed rape was innocent. Steve seems to live in this sort of reality. In a heartbreaking scene, Steve's wife says that she is not one of his articles.One of the most interesting aspects of "True Crime" is the references to Santa Claus. We see a homeless man on the street trying get get some money and sex. We later see him in a Santa Claus outfit, and he says that if you're going to be Santa Claus "you're going to be alone" What is is that Santa Claus supposedly does? He gives us presents, right? The figure of Santa becomes a metaphor for Steve's life as a journalist. He gives people their presents by writing good articles, but is in fact alone. In an earlier scene one of his coworkers tells him that he can't be Santa because he doesn't exist. Metaphorically however, he can exist, and Steve represents him as a journalist. One may ask, why use Santa as this metaphor. I suspect it's pure irony. Santa Claus is typically seen as bringing people together at the joyous time of Christmas, but maybe one could view the mythological being as someone who is also lonely because he spends so much time trying to make other people happy. But the whole notion of Santa is mythological and even spiritual, so one can conceive of him as doing things only for other people and being happy, but human beings like Steve have a need to pursue their own happiness, and it is here that Steve's character is torn, thus creating the tension with significant others in his life.Ultimately, the film is about loneliness, and I must say that it is one of the only films that I have seen that has effectively implemented both humor and tragedy in a useful way. The story in itself is is no way funny, but there are many moments of hilarity that work effectively. Unlike other films, the humor is not used to distract us from the tragedy of the events that occur in the plot, but rather are a clever representation of Steve's character and the irony of the situation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unfocused</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a good movie in here someplace trying to get out. The main problem is a lack of focus. Is it a character study of an unlikable guy? Is it a murder mystery? Is it a polemic against capital punishment? The answer to all three is "yes." As a result, it does all of them reasonably well, but none of them as well as it might. I will give Eastwood credit for taking on a character who is so difficult to like. Of course, I must join the legions on IMDb decrying -- and laughing at -- Clint for making his character a ladies man. Maybe if he had been hitting on 55 year olds instead of hot 30 years olds it would have been more credible -- and less distasteful. But as a screed against the death penalty this movie is effective, though the deck is stacked because the accused is innocent as well as likable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is another piece of magnificent work by Clint.I only have two problems with this film.Firstly, Steve looks too old to have such a young daughter, who looks more like his grandchild, despite the fact that she is really his daughter. I mean, films are made to suit viewers' normal perception and not necessarily reality.Secondly, when Frank meets Steve in the last scene, how can he acted so coldly when seeing someone who had saved his life, his family and everything he owns? Normally, Frank should have given Steve a big hug and plenty of grateful words. He couldn't have just raised his hand and walked away with his family indifferently after what had happened in the film.Otherwise I enjoy the rest of the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's one of the best non shooting action movies with Clint Eastwood, who's really brilliant. Steve Everett, Oakland Tribune journalist with a passion for women and alcohol, is given the coverage of the upcoming execution of murderer Frank Beachum. His attractive colleague Michelle died in a car accident the night before. Bob Findley, Steve's boss and husband to Steve's current affair, wants him dead and gone as soon as possible. You can see a man with family problems like everybody else, who loves his work and can use his work for helping somebody. When Steve stumbles across the possibility of Frank Beachum being innocently on death row, Bob feels his time to have come. Now Steve only has a few hours left to prove the innocence of Frank and to be right with this theory, as he definitely will be history if he's not. I really think You should see this film. Good work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There was so much laughter in the theater when I saw this movie. It was making me mad, because I had paid a fair amount to watch this thing. However, as the movie went on, I found myself having a hard time not laughing either. The script as awful. The acting was terrible. The direction, horrific. It was just a really bad movie that looked like it was made by a first time director, with a learning disability. Then there is the total lack of any realism. Growing up I was such a big fan of the actor that was Clint Eastwood. As an adult, I cannot believe how truly terrible he is as a director. And the uncomfortable romance scenes had be squirming. Hey gramps, quit being a pervert. But I digress, horrible and unrealistic movie.</fullReview>

Clint kissing a girl almost 50 years younger, Clint with a kid, while he could be her grand-grandfather etc. These are hopeless scenes, to be forgotten as quickly as we can. But with James Woods and is his pursuit for the truth it is still the good-old Clint Eastwood. Unfortunately the story isn't strong enough to tip the balance. The film drags on till a ridiculous ending that fits in every Hollywood tradition, but is just a little bit too optimistic about the working of the judicial system for my taste. Oh, what the heck, I still had a good evening in front of the tv.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into this movie with a great attitude, hoping to see a fine cinematic masterpiece. Needless to say, that's not what I got.True Crime is little more than a character study of Eastwood's protagonist wrapped up in a thin mystery. I found Eastwood totally unconvincing in his role as Everett, with too much 'Dirty Harry' to actually enable us to connect with him in any way.In fact, the only saving grace of this movie were the roles of Alan Mann (James Woods), and Frank Beachum (Isaiah Washington). Woods is simply hilarious as the wise-cracking Mann, and Washington is very convincing, and touching, as Beachum.Overall, we have a main character we can't relate to, and a six-year mystery solved, however unbelievably, in a single day. My advice: stay as far away as possible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh Clint! How could you! I know that they've not all been utterly marvellous, but Unforgiven and Josey Wales could have absolved you from quite a bit of guilt. This one is the most horrible, self-indulgent mess.What is it supposed to be about? 1)An aged guy who has squandered his talent and messed up his life, and that of others? 2)The barbaric horrors of capital punishment? or was it, perhaps,3)nothing more than an irresistible desire to pretend that you are still young and sexy in spite of the wrinkles? or, is it 4)supposed to be nothing more than a cliffhanging drama? or is it 5)making a serious statement about the oppression and exploitation of black adults in the States?If 1)then it lacks the tragic dimension and relapses into bathos with Ev's attempt at the end to pull the girl in the toy store, having acquired no self-knowledge through the events of the film, and permitting so much extraneous detail that the thread is totally obscured.If 2)the point is well-made in the prison scenes, but again obscured by the other events. And is it really necessary that the black family be quite so saintly - the point would be well made if they were allowed some convincing human frailty and emotional messiness.If 3) then the whole film is ridiculous and offensive. The presentation of Clint in all but the final scene as a hard-drinking, heavy-smoking, neglected, shabby loser deprives his pulling-power of all credibility - particularly when he conquers such luscious and glowing bodies as the boss's wife. Yes, I know that the most luscious young women can be seduced by old men who are sufficiently rich and powerful, but this guy! what must he smell like, for a start.So perhaps it's supposed to be an encumbered cliff-hanging drama. Oh, please. The ending has to be the most ludicrous in years. We are to believe that Warren's granny would, during the 10 seconds allowed her by the demands of the plot, forget her role in the earlier scene as the dignified exemplar of black oppression, and when shown the connection between her pendant and that round Amy's neck in the photo, leap without hesitation to the conclusion that her grandson was the killer. Not only does she accept this preposterous conclusion - how come Frank couldn't have dropped the pendant he'd just ripped off the corpse and innocent Warren picked it up and taken it home as a present for his gran? - but she sets off in Clint's filthy and dangerous car (driven by a drunk)yelling that the innocent young man must be saved. Please, Clint, do us a favour!The only reason I have awarded it 3 out of 10 is that it is occasionally redeemed by the acting. James Wood especially and even Clint himself on occasion. Yes really.</fullReview>

The story line is mediocre and unoriginal (oops, the wrong guy has been sentenced to death), and the majority of the plot is laughable. From ridiculous scenes, like the "Speed Zoo" scene, to the just plain absurd ones, like the "Bomb squad sent to find a crayon" scene, the movie just kept making me wish it was over. The biggest piece of nonsense was Eastwood evading 3 police cars on a wet road at 60 mph while driving fall-down drunk. By the time this movie was over, I wasn't even paying attention anymore, and didn't care how it ended. I was actually hoping Clint would NOT be the hero. This movie isn't even worth a 3 am showing on TBS.</fullReview>

The innocent condemned man, the hard-nosed battle scarred journalist with the marriage on the rocks thanks to an affair with a colleague's wife and the condemned man saved from the fatal injection at the last possible moment (perhaps even beyond it). And while I realise Steve's on-screen daughter is the real-life daughter of Clint Eastwood, there is a perception of disbelief at a man looking on the wrong side of 70 having a kid of about 5. Add to that this man who appears to be a nursing home candidate having a wife looking more like a daughter and having a fling with a woman who had a husband in his prime and finally in the last scene flirting with a girl who should have called him "grandpa", the credibility got a little lost. And did I mention the clapped out old clunker of a car held together with gaffer tape in the style of Columbo? Don't get me wrong, Eastwood is a damn fine actor and director but the lead role in this one should have gone to someone thirty years his junior. Still a good story told but in the end, nothing we haven't seen before.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Directed &amp; starring Clint Eastwood is usually a sign of decent entertainment, but not here. From start to finish, Eastwood takes us through a series of set-piece clichés that you'd think even he would have been bored with by now.I'm so tired of the fallen-hero-propped-up-by-booze whilst being indulged by others on the basis of his past achievements that I think I could play the role myself. Eastwood doesn't miss a single crock in either the role or the plot.It's a race against time to save some schmuck from execution. Our hero slowly begins to grasp that he may be innocent and the challenge to prove it begins to wean him from his vices. The ending is such contrived &amp; silly nick-of-time nonsense as to be a complete anti-climax. There's no shocks, no surprises, no interesting script or conflicts, nor even imaginative use of camera.If anything, this seems to be an advocacy against the use of capital punishment. The in-prison scenes in which the accused is permitted family visits from his tearful wife and doting little daughter are almost nauseously self-indulgent, and resemble the sort of mawkish schmaltz more typical of Spielberg. Eastwood is of course free in matters of conscience, but I reserve the right to decide for myself. If he means to use a 'thriller' as a morality vehicle, I for one reserve the right to both reject and resent his presumption. The fact that a death sentence brings tragedy to the murderer's family is a matter for the murderer, not the state. This individual may have been innocent, but the vast majority who are executed get what they deserve - in my opinion.Even beside this gripe, it's very inferior work by any standard, never mind Eastwood's, more like a matinée made-for-TV piece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It has bits and pieces sporadically going for it; but Eastwood here directs with more verve than he leads, whilst its distinctly heavy feel throughout is unwelcome.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The unexpected catalyst, that eventually comes to propel the lead, through Clint Eastwood's 1999 detective thriller True Crime and into a realm of investigation; intuition and towards the truth arrives when a young female journalist on a very specific job is tragically killed in a road traffic accident. It is deemed, by most therein, that the woman was a great girl; a wonderful person and really good at her job ? a woman who was "really on top of things" at the time of her death, and yet it appears was careless enough to be doing something around sixty, late at night and on a rain-sodden road having had the odd drink and on a stretch of track notorious for a certain deadly bend. Such stark differences between assumed sentiments and gruff realities having taken a good look at the situation are at the core of True Crime; a film driven by the force of Eastwood both on the screen and off it, in what is a film all about murky underestimations combating with hard-up truths. Fittingly, it is a film about a man placed into the same situation as the aforementioned deceased young journalist; a situation that has already run its course in terms of trials, allegations and musings although doesn't necessarily come out infallible to meaner, stone-wall truths which our lead eventually comes to suspect are omnipresent.Eastwood's character is Steve Everett, a California based journalist with years of experience but a debilitating marriage and a wavy track record of cracking open big stories though making bogus claims when all appeared right to him. The character is one of those old and wily, without necessarily being particularly nice, archetypes of movies of old whom just have that natural gift of being able to work their way through grisly problems and to both spot and comprehend things no one else seemingly can. He enjoys a drink and the company of a younger woman, whilst symptomatically struggles with his wife and infant daughter. His credentials are somewhat impressive, in that he managed to expose political sleaze, in spite of his own lifestyle, more broadly linked to that of the town's mayor, although the attempting to prove a rapist's innocence prior to their controversial confession was an instance in which his ability failed him.He works for that of a hotshot journalist chief named Alan Mann, played in that spitfire fashion by James Woods; a character of whom we are introduced to by way of a long tracking shot down and through the corridors of his building, as he spouts everything he needs to say - the scene concluding in his office which is rife with qualifications and journal covers of past newsworthy events. The case Everett ends up inheriting is that of the reporting on the execution of an African American individual who was given the death penalty for a store robbery and murder. He is Frank Beechum; a man, like Everett, with a wife and infant daughter and is played with effective understated regret by Isaiah Washington. Beechum is due to be killed via lethal injection in a few hours time, immediately rendering what eventually formulates as the crux of the film as a dramatic race against time ? the manner in which he will be killed is somewhat agonisingly outlined to us with a measured precision by the warden and his staff, in that we are granted access to the chamber; steal a glance at all the switches and buttons and realise the magnitude of the situation. Additionally, the sheer chasm between the staff there and the likes of Everett, in regards to law enforcers or those of whom merely seek justice, is made prominent when one staff members shrugs upon being asked for an opinion and allows Beechum's court verdict to stand for his stance.The core of the film is Everett's attempt at uncovering something a little more concrete on why it is one would suspect Beechum of innocence; Eastwood doing really well to keep the film moving along, even if we don't necessarily buy into him as the sort of character Everett is - a younger, more aggressive presence in the mould of what Woods pulls off perhaps required. The film carries somewhat of a Bad Lieutenant vibe to it, as this tale of a man with some considerable power and questionable priorities charges through a world attempting to get to the bottom of proceedings plays out. Despite this, the film arrives with much more of a grounded; more accessible procession to it, and veers away from a more hardened edge of anti-heroism and such to the point that it perhaps required to be more dramatic and more biting.The film's element of its lead and his race against the clock is clumsily surmised every so often with inert insertions into proceedings of compositions of clocks or clock faces in some form; a persistent reminder that time is indeed running out, and an element overall which, try as it might, does not necessarily feel as prominent as it might have. In spite of what's at stake, there appears very little on the urgency scale and it lacks a wounding, cut-and-thrust dynamic which may have worked really well. Principally, Everett fights for a truth which will allow a victimised man to return to his wife and young daughter, as he himself disparagingly neglects that of what he has in that exact form. Running on this theme of redemption or righting wrongs, it is an opportunity for him to correct what happened in regards to that case of the misjudged rapist from years gone by; the film functional without necessarily being overly involved, a film which isn't necessarily dull but is safe, uninspiring fare which happens to conclude with the sort of sequence Robert Altman was actually sending up mere years previously in his Hollywood satire The Player. Whoops.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's not just Clint who's showing a bit of wear around the edges here.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>True Crime is directed by Clint Eastwood and is based on Andrew Klavan's 1997 novel of the same name. Eastwood also stars in the film as journalist Steve Everett, who whilst covering the execution of a death row inmate played by Isaiah Washington, discovers that he may actually be innocent.A box office failure for Eastwood that is pretty standard film making all told. The plot we have seen a number of times before, be it a cop/detective or a journalist trying to save a death row prisoner, the song remains the same. Throw in some racial prejudice, bureaucratic nonsense and a flawed hero in waiting (Eastwood's Everett is a skirt chasing alkie who resents authority), and bingo! A by the numbers thriller with absolutely no surprises what so ever. Perhaps more annoying, tho, is that the clunky script and fodder story drags Eastwood's direction down with it. Whilst a man of such ability and integrity really should have known he would be miscast here. There's some fun to be had with James Woods' performance as the newspaper boss trying to keep Everett in check; tho that too is cliché riddled. While the best acting on show comes from Washington, notably during the scenes in prison when visited by wife and child. But this is a misfire of a movie, one that's consigned towards the bottom of the DVD pile of Eastwood completists like me. 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>At times it rolls, but it relies on Eastwood, who can grate on you if not already a fan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>True Crime (1999)This is a pretty good story in some ways, and it's filmed with solid professional force. There are some good side characters, a strong central them, and a great clock-is-ticking scenario, as is often the case with death row dramas. It'll make you sympathize correctly, and hope to the end for a miracle. For the result, you'll have to watch it. The title, True Crime, has more nuance than the movie, however. If the implication is that the system is criminal, or the idea of the death penalty, this isn't really worked with. It's simply played up in the expected (very expected) ways. Still, the facts follow with good logic, and if you can ignore the canned relationship problems, and a tossed-in cute daughter who serves as a comic and sentimental distraction, the basic plot of a reporter with a nose for injustice works.But I'm trying to avoid saying this is a mediocre and sometimes aggravating film. It is overly calculated to be a last minute death row cliff hanger. And if you've seen Clint Eastwood movies in general, you'll see some familiar threads, like the old man hitting on young women who seem to enjoy it (and this is the character they enjoy, not the movie star, who probably would have luck with women like this), with no sense of moving the plot forward. So it ends up being an action adventure male fantasy movie, where the down-on-his-luck cop/reporter/whatever (in this case a reporter) has to come to the aid of the otherwise hapless world. This is enough sometimes, but I've been there too many times before, and often with Eastwood at the helm (he directed, too), and I'm tired of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A routine thriller, and not a very good one at that</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another day, another film about a black man facing the death penalty and about the gallant white man who rides to the rescue. This sort of story may have been ground-breaking in the days of "Intruder in the Dust" or "To Kill a Mockingbird", but today it is just standard fare. The main difference in "True Crime'' is that the white knight is not a lawyer but a journalist. Steve Everett is a reporter for the Oakland Tribune who is assigned to write a story about the last hours of Frank Beachum, a Death Row inmate convicted of killing a shop assistant in the course of a robbery. His editor intends that this should be a routine "human interest" story, but Steve begins to suspect that Frank may in fact be innocent, and sets out to find the evidence that will clear him.Steve may be the hero of the story, but he is not a clean-cut hero; Hollywood today prefers its heroes a little (or more than a little) rough around the edges, and Steve is no exception. His private life is a mess; his professional life ditto. He has already been fired from one job for "screwing the newspaper owner's under-age daughter.'' He is now married with a young daughter but is nevertheless having an affair with his editor's wife. (Steve's wife Barbara discovers the truth about this affair in the course of the movie). He was lucky not to be fired from his current job after getting his facts badly wrong on one big story. For good measure, he is also a recovering alcoholic. Steve's quest to save Frank can therefore also be seen as a quest for personal redemption.Clint Eastwood not only produced and directed the film, he also starred in it, which in my view was not a good idea. Some of Eastwood's other films from the nineties- "Unforgiven", "In the Line of Fire", "The Bridges of Madison County", "Absolute Power"- were deliberately made as older men's films, with his age important to the plot. (Similarly, in the recent "Gran Torino" his character is a retiree in his seventies). In "True Crime", however, he succumbs to the temptation of taking a role which should really have gone to a younger man. He was 69 at the time of this film, and whereas it might be possible to find 69-year-olds who are holding down demanding full-time jobs well past normal retirement age, who are married to women young enough to be their daughters, who are the fathers of young children, and who still have enough sexual energy left to conduct extra-marital affairs, I still feel that Steve would have been more credible as a man, in, say, his forties rather than his late sixties.I was interested to note that in Andrew Klavan's source novel (which I have not read), the wrongly-convicted defendant was white and that Eastwood made him black for the film to "make it more relevant". This change would only be relevant if the film was intended to make a statement about race relations as well as about the criminal justice system, but in fact it does not succeed in making a meaningful statement about either. There is no serious attempt as there is in some recent films, such as "A Time to Kill" or "Ghosts of Mississippi", to use the conventions of the courtroom thriller to examine the problem of racism in American society. The film, moreover, does not really work either as a critique of the death penalty. Despite the title "True Crime", this is a film about a fictitious crime, and real-life miscarriages of justice provide a much stronger argument against capital punishment than do fictitious ones. In any case, it is perhaps hypocritical of Eastwood to argue against judicial use of the death penalty when he has been responsible for films such as "Sudden Impact" which have sanctioned vigilante justice and revenge killings.My other problem with this film is that the pace is too leisurely for what is supposed to be a thriller about a race against time. There is some tension towards the end as Steve desperately searches at quite literally the eleventh hour (the execution is due to take place at midnight) for the evidence that will save Frank's life, but overall this is a rather ponderous, slow-moving film with too many diversions into its hero's complex private life. Eastwood is capable of making, both as actor and as director, some very fine films, but "True Crime" is no more than a routine thriller, and not a very good one at that. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Formulaic, But Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's one of those movies that's basically been done before but still manages to hold our interest -- and hold it fairly well. Squinty Clinty plays an over-the-hill newspaper reporter who sniffs a bigger scoop when assigned a human interest story about a death row inmate hours away from execution. It seems his fine shackled friend is really innocent, but can our hero prove it in time?It's hard to pinpoint what elevates TRUE CRIME above its formulaic tendencies. Though not in top form, Eastwood is intriguing despite his character's occasional unlikeability. Isaiah Washington, playing the innocent inmate, is well cast and able to stoically earn our sympathy. Eastwood's newsroom antics would seem tired in many other films, but decent writing and supporting performances help keep things moving at a reasonably smooth pace. And although we know Eastwood will prevail at the end of the day, we're not always quite sure how.TRUE CRIME is a picture some will appreciate more than others. What's for certain is that there are much worse ways to spend 127 minutes. It's worth a look on a rainy night.</fullReview>

I watched the movie the whole way through but it was so slow moving(strange for a movie that takes place over just a 24 hour period.) that I don't think it is worth the effort it would take to see it again or for anyone else to use the 127 minute running time to watch it for a first time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not much to say here, except that this may be the worst film Clint ever directed. Horrible casting, borderline acting by the principal characters (other than Isaiah Washington who has strong moments as the accused), and a cheesy storyline with no surprises. In addition, the overall feel of the film is as if it is straight out of 1975 with the overacting and bad soundtrack. Eastwood's character is an alcoholic, sex crazed, aging reporter and not someone you can develop any sympathy for. As well, all of these subplots in the character he portrays, have absolutely nothing to do with the storyline of the film. It's as if all of these character flaws were designed just to fill time so they could hit a 2 hour run time. James Woods is awful as the over the top newspaper editor, and he must have studied J. Jonah Jameson from Spiderman to develop the character. And Dennis Leary is equally as bad as Eastwood's supervisor, who doesn't have the guts to stand up even when his wife steps out on him; and again this little subplot does not contribute anything to the film. Leary could have been left completely out of the movie, and there would have been no loss to this horrible piece of celluloid.Don't waste your time, not even worth it on free TV.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>True Crime is a very mediocre film with a reasonably developed storyline and a terrific cast. The performances are certainly the highlight, the characterization for the majority of cast members is superb, with some very inspired acting from Clint Eastwood playing a character very different from his usual roles, the best scenes were the ones between him and Isaiah Washington, they are intense, emotional and the only parts that gave me any bit of a thrill. It shouldn't have been advertised as a thriller or a mystery, it shouldn't have been given the name True Crime, because with those genres and that title attached to it, you're going to expect to be put at the edge of your seat, some high level intensity with many exciting moments, and none of that is evident here, it mostly consists of the characters, normally just two, in a room together, talking, whether or not the performances are good, there comes a time when this simply becomes boring. There isn't as much conflict as there should be in this film either, Eastwood's character always has hope that he will crack this case, there's never really a moment where he loses it, a scene where he hits rock bottom and it dosen't seem like there's any way he can come out of it, this should be evident in every movie, but Eastwood seems to get his way far too often that it is unrewarding once the conflict is resolved in the end. Terrific performances sadly aren't enough to save a boring movie, and I wouldn't recommend True Crime to anyone. A journalist comes across new evidence that helps a man on death row.

The rest of the cast are also of top standard with Isaiah Washington playing the accused and Lisa Gay Hamilton as his distraught wife. Both co-stars give sensational, gripping performances and are indeed the film's highpoint (even shadowing Eastwood). James Woods also soars as Everett's strict yet sleasy employer.

		<fullReview>After watching Clint Eastwood's "True Crime" for the first time, I didn't what to think of it, so I get it another chance. Eastwood plays Steve Everett, a journalist that works for the Oakland Tribune and is still haunted by his past and his dirty habits (alcohol &amp; women). Everett is asked by the newspaper's editor Alan Mann (James Woods - The Virgin Suicides) and a calm excutive Bob Findley (Denis Leary - The Thomas Crown Affair) to interview Frank Meachum (Isiah Washington - Bulworth), a Death Row inmate who is to be excuted by lethal injection at a prison in San Quentin at midnight. Everett takes the assignment and notices that Meachum is innocent. The sub-plot is so-so and that's about Steve's marriage with his wife, Barbara (Diane Venora - Heat). Eastwood has assembled a very solid cast and the peformances are great, most notably, Eastwood, Washington, Woods, and Bernard Hill as the prison's confident warden. There are a few lines that Woods says to Eastwood and Leary that made me chuckle. This film's ending is good as "In The Line of Fire" is. Jack N. Green's cinematography is good as Lennie Niehaus's musical score. Despite the so-so subplot, "True Crime" is terrific .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been a Clint Eastwood fan since his Spaghetti Western days, but I avoided seeing True Crime in the theaters because of all the negative press it got. So, after renting the video last night, I was delighted to find out that Clint's latest offering is up to his usual high standards. As the star, he glides through this film with his familiar effortless wit and charm; as the director, he's assembled a dynamite cast and done a terrific job with them. Just seeing three of today's biggest "macho personality" actors -- Eastwood, James Woods, and Dennis Leary -- together in one scene, is more than worth the price of the rental. The dialogue between Eastwood and Woods, talking about Leary's character behind his back, is unbelievably smutty and hilarious.The only shortcoming, a problem which wrecked Eastwood's Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil for me, is his use of cute ethnic stereotypes for comic-relief minor characters, that borders on being obnoxiously racist. This is especially surprising since, in both this film and others (e.g., Bird), Eastwood shows himself to be one of the few white directors capable of crafting respectful and honest main roles for black actors. But, if you can ignore the cute homeless guy in True Crime, you'll enjoy the rest of the film.</fullReview>

To throw a veil created by Hollywood over every movie ever made that comes with a dose of action and a nice tidy "happy" ending would make the world a very boring place. The Movie Formula of late is predictable, as is life most of the time, and that is what is being portrayed here, life. If every movie were made to sell tickets and popcorn I'm sure there would be some happy people out there, but then why not just spend the rest of your days watching Pleasantville or the Truman show over and over again, because that would be the end result.

Was it anti-racist?, anti-death penalty? or simply anti-poor justice / don't kill the wrong man?The characters were all allowed flaws (especially Clint - who even showed us that he is not growing old with dignity - or at least his body isn't) and there were scenes which register true emotion. The comparison between the two fathers dealing with the daughters ("speed-zoo" and all that) was excellent). The film was spoiled by the need to introduce too much of a cliff hanger (was he / wasn't he guilty), an action sequence (most implausible and unnecessary car chase ever!) and the ultimate last second rescue! I seriously wonder and would love to know if the original script / version has the opposite conclusion, with the final phone call actually arriving too late. How much more powerful that would have been?I really felt cheated by the last 10 minutes of an otherwise well-made, thoughtful and well-observed film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was beginning to think that a great storytelling drama had gone the way of the typewriter. This film tells a great story with not a lot of pomp and circumstance. I feel the character development was just enough to make you care, and not enough to get too involved in the characters' lives which would have distracted from the overall story the movie was trying to tell. It was like reading a very good "Reader's Digest" version of an enthralling book. I was glad to see James Woods and Clint Eastwood together, and they play well off of each other. It's a pleasure to see two veteran actors with a good script. I very much enjoyed the emotional scenes in the prison with the family. The film did not go for the "cheap" tear, but instead opted for some real and true emotion which brought with it the response from my emotional inner-self. The film was not, like so many police-type dramas, too complex for the average once-a-month movie person to grasp. It was straight forward and proved to be a lesson in reality. The dialogue did not get "preachy" when it came to death penalty issues and I'm grateful for the director allowing the audience to make up their own minds concerning a subject that has been talked to death-no puns intended. It was a great story with great actors. It's why I go to movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very suspenseful film that leads you to pull for the down on his luck reporter that has lost a lot in his life, but still manages to follow his senses for the truth. I really like Eastwood in these aging roles where he still exhibits a tough skin, but it is tempered by the frailty aging. Also, how can you say too much about James Woods, an actor whose recognition is still due. Not only is his rhetoric comical and clever, he is one of the most articulate actors today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood has directed himself in an intense drama of a journalist who has been given the assignment of interviewing a death row prisoner (Isaiah Washington) on the day of his execution. The fly in the ointment is that Eastwood's nose for the truth leads him to believe the man is innocent of the crime. Eastwood portrays a flawed character who is a womanizer, and irresponsible father and a recently reformed drunk. These chinks in his armor become apparent as he goes about the business of trying to ferret out the facts that he hopes will lead to the prisoner's exoneration.The performances are uniformly excellent. Washington distinguishes himself as a man facing death as he subtly reveals the pain and anguish seething just beneath the surface. Lisa Gay Hamilton (currently burning up the screen in TV's "The Practice") will break your heart as Washington's wife. On the minus side, Eastwood is getting a little long in the tooth to be paired with some of the young actresses he is shown with here. In addition, the climax is a bit cliched and mechanical, but strangely satisfying. The race to the midnight execution is a bit reminiscent of the film-within-a-film in Robert Altman's "The Player". Only in that film it was meant to be slightly tongue-in-cheek. These faults aside, "True Crime" will keep your attention even though you might correctly be predicting what will happen next. The reason for this is the impassioned performances Eastwood has drawn from his first-rate cast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very predictable, yet unique project.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the Premiere of this film on Monday, March 15, and the following are my comments. Clint Eastwood did a remarkable job casting, acting, and directing in this film. Be prepared, he looks older than he is, but that is appropriate for his character, "Ev." Isaiah Washington was outstanding. It was obvious that he did his homework, as I am sold on his performance. His screen wife was great as well. An impressing performance by Diane Venora is also noted. Although her part is rather small, she brings a reality to "Barbara Everitt" that is near unprecedented. Watch for her few scenes. (Note that the writer approached her after the Premiere and gave her praise on her performance) James Woods and Clint had some great scenes as well; the ad lib'ing they did was very well executed. Enough of the actors. The Plot: As I said in the "One Line Summary," True Crime was very predictable, but had a certain uniqueness. I mean there are a few slants that were thrown in. Appropriately. You'll have to see those for yourself. My girlfriend was biting her nails throughout most of the movie, which should speak for itself. I guess that's enough about this movie. Go see it. 'Til next time, Moviola-6 (thought I would be original with a name like that, but I guess other editors have passed through).</fullReview>

Everett discovers that Beachum is innocent, but has less than a day to prove it.This movie keeps you on the edge of your seat until the very last minute. It's definitely worth seeing. The mixture of drama with several very funny dialogs between Eastwood, James Woods (editor-in-chief) and Denis Leary (local editor) makes this a movie for almost all audiences. 130 min.

		<fullReview>"True Crime" is a very good, if derivative film directed by and starring Clint Eastwood. We've seen the whole thing before, but it goes to show that if something is well done and well performed, the viewer will become very involved in it. A rogue reporter, an off and on drunk, who is assigned a human interest story of a man on death row comes to believe in his innocence and must find a way to stop the execution. There are some strong performances by Isaiah Washington, Lisa Gay Hamilton and Diana Venora as well as Eastwood's smooth direction. James Woods to me seemed a little over the top, if only because Eastwood is so relaxed.I have the same problem with this film as I have had with past Eastwood films, and that has to do with his age. Eastwood is 68 in this film; his character is still working - no mention of retirement; he's a ladies man and at the end of the movie he's trying to pick up a 20-something; he has a four-year-old or so daughter. I'm just taking a stab at this - the character is supposed to be, say, 10 to 20 years younger? One assumes then that there is a young wife at home - well, she's young for Eastwood anyway - it's Diana Venora, with whom I went to school. What's the story with this marriage? Is it a recent one? Frankly I'm surprised that Eastwood, who insists on playing roles he's 10 to 20 years too old for, would have tolerated a woman in her forties as his wife. Maybe in his mind, they're the same age. He was running through the forest like an Olympian in "Absolute Power" while he looked like Father Time; he had ropes in his neck for "Bridges of Madison County." Meanwhile, the film "Premonition" cast Kate Nelligan, age 57, as 43-year-old Sandra Bullock's mother and in "Postcards from the Edge," 56-year-old Shirley Maclaine as 41-year-old Meryl Streep's mother. These women evidently lived in states that allowed 14-year-olds to be married.My point is, Hollywood can never get the ages right. Women are pushed into old age in their fifties and the male stars get to play 40-year-olds when they're pushing eighty. At a certain point, it becomes insulting. If this film had been made last year, I suppose Diana Venora would have been playing Clint's mother.So though I like Eastwood very much and his directing very much and found this film compelling, I was distracted - as I have been in the past - by these little details. We shouldn't be expected to have to suspend reality with the ages of the characters as well as everything else. Once in a while, I'd like to focus on the story.</fullReview>

Whodunits tend to have the problem that they are utterly without re-viewing quality because the next time you already know who did it. 'True Crime' is a breath of fresh air in that it simultaneously takes a very realistic approach without boring the audience to death.You get a great cast of characters, but you also get a story that is interesting to watch. What's nice is that the movie keeps up the suspense without gun-play or a high amount of action-scenes, which is quite an achievement from Clint Eastwood.This is a solid piece of film that is easily wort eight stars. The extra one comes for not ending the film in a lame and sappy way, but instead like a true Eastwood-film, with coolness.</fullReview>

However, after researching the case more throughly Steve is convinced of Frank's innocence and races against time to save him. At the last minute he finds out that the real killer was a punk and a thug who is now deceased.In the end Frank is saved and exonerated of all charges. He is finally set free after six long years of hell. This is one of the problems with our justice system, you can't just jump to conclusions, listen to all the evidence carefully.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood is hot in Hollywood and that also shows on television. A week can't go by without at least one movie with Eastwood in it. I'm not exactly one of his greatest fans (I hated the "Dirty Harry"-movies and some other movies like for instance "Heartbreak Ridge" weren't that great either), but I have to admit that he has done some good work. So when I get the chance of seeing one of his later movies, I won't hesitate."True Crime" is about a subject that is up-to-date even today, because executions still exist, even in a so-called civilized country like the USA. This movie tells us the story of an alcoholic and womanizing journalist, Steve Everett (Clint Eastwood) who is given the coverage of the upcoming execution of murderer Frank Beachum. Bob Findley, his boss, hates Everett because he sleeps with Findley's wife and tries to find a way to get rid of him, but hasn't yet found a reason to fire him. Until now. Everett gets convinced that Beachum is innocent and that he was falsely accused. He'll do anything to find out the truth, much against the will of his boss...I must say that I had a good time watching this movie, even though it is all pretty predictable. As soon as it starts, everybody already knows how this movie will end. Nevertheless I must admit that it is able to create quite some suspense and to keep it all interesting. That has also a lot to do with the acting. Overall the acting is OK, but I just want to emphasize the fact that this time I enjoyed Eastwood's role. For once he wasn't the grumpy old man who doesn't seem to be able to speak two words in a row. I really appreciated that.All in all this is a pretty decent thriller. It may not be the best of Clint Eastwood, but it's a lot better than much of his previous work and it sure is worth a watch. I give it a 7/10.</fullReview>

And as many real life cases has shown: innocent black men being sent to death row after a summary trial by a white jury and judge is not a myth; it's a reality.On to the movie itself... The role of a worn out reporter with a little too tight relationship with the bottle is no match for Mr. Eastwood. He doesn't stick out in any direction but does his job well. The one actor that really makes an impression in this movie Washington. Very convincing! Over all I think it's the story and the topic that are the important things in this movie. I think Eastwood really tried to keep the characters slightly low-key in order to keep the story in focus. And that works very well for me. Well spent 127 minutes... maybe you should see it with some friends and plan for some beers and and a round of discussions? :)7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent ending to the 5th decade of Eastwood's career</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw the most outstanding "True Crime" for the first time I was stunned when I walked out of the movie theater. Clint Eastwood's previous movie, marvelous and stylish thriller "Absolute power" (released two years earlier in 1997) was quite a spectacular masterpiece and I never would have guessed that his next will be even better. After "The Bridges of Madison County" (1995) which was a highly emotional and romantic love story, I was pretty damn scared that it will be Eastwood's current course on account of his remarkable age. I liked the film but it wasn't exactly what I wanted to see from Clint. Afterwards I felt like I was blessed with "Absolute power". Considering that my rating to it is definitely 10 out of 10 and I find the film practically flawless in every way the fact that I was still convinced "True Crime" goes higher tells something about this film.Clint Eastwood's splendid performance as persistent and unyielding journalist Steve Everett will certainly be remembered as one of his classic roles. Scenes with he and James Woods' character Alan Mann are magnificent, including absolutely terrific dialogue. Isaiah Washington is probably having the role of his life as Frank Beachum. Story is pretty clever and once again old Clint proofs that he's still the finest actor/director around. Nowadays I have great difficulties in choosing which one is actually better, "True Crime" or "Absolute power" but since I love 'em both very, very, very much it's not even really an issue of any importance. All I have to say is that "True Crime" - Eastwood's 21th own direction - is an incredible motion picture and simply brilliant ending to the 5th decade of his career. He really made one of his finest films of the 90's. 10/10.</fullReview>

Clint Eastwood being his cool self and especially the scenes with James Woods are often very funny and sharply written, but don't seem at place in a film about the death penalty. Also, the characters of James Woods and Denis Leary(to name a few)are very underwritten. Sometimes the film even succeeds in being downright laughable.

		<shortDescription>Would have been a B Movie in the Old Days</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood is a legend, and has given us some truly fine films over the years, but "True Crime" won't add to his laurels, I'm afraid. This movie is lean and unpretentious, like all Eastwood films, but unfortunately, its also implausible in the extreme, overly self-indulgent, and awfully sloppy, even amateurish in spots.Perhaps the biggest problem is that Eastwood is simply the wrong actor for his part. He should have cast someone at least 15 years younger, and more dynamic and versatile for this particular part. Clint, iconic screen presence though he may be, is particularly outclassed in his scenes with James Woods, who brings a lot of snap, crackle and pop to his role and magnifies Clint's own limitations as an actor. Also, as many other commentors have pointed out, its downright ghoulish watching Clint put the moves on a woman young enough to be his granddaughter.The film was also hurt by too much usage of stereotypes. The prisoner on death row is portrayed with such incredible nobility that you wonder who in the world had the utter audacity to ever put him in jail - nauseatingly p.c. Also, as an accountant, it especially pains me to see the CPA witness in this movie being played by Hollywood's nerdiest, most mannered actor, Michael Jeter, replete with bow tie and glasses, of course. And gee, what a great message to send out in today's society to have the hero drive drunk in the big car chase! Hello! Wake up, Hollywood!On the plus side, Clint always stays true to himself, even in his occasional bombs like this one - you gotta hand it to him. And it was amusing to see notorious nicotine fiend Denis Leary cast as the "no-smoking" enforcer in the newsroom.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mr. Eastwood is evidently trying to usurp Bob Dole's position as the Viagra poster boy. He starts this movie hitting on a woman who appears to be at least 35 years younger than he is. But he's no lecher: the woman playing his wife is only 22 years younger than he is, and the woman playing his mistress is a scant 29 years younger than he. And, of course this 69 year old man has a daughter who appears to be 3-4 years old. Eastwood plays a fallen investigative reporter, who is partially reformed: on the wagon, but sleeping with his boss's wife. He is tasked with writing a story about a man being executed at San Quentin that night.Is there any chance the man was wrongly convicted?Is it possible that there is some evidence overlooked by the convict's attorneys on 6 years of appeals?Is there any chance that Clint will figure all of this out in less than 24 hours?Aside from some pretty obvious plot contrivances, I'm getting a little tired of Clint's on-screen persona. When Eastwood made "Unforgiven" and "In The Line of Fire", I thought it showed great promise for a renaissance of his career. Both of those movies showed a tough guy grown older, men who were used to being tough dealing with the frailties of age.His persona in "True Crime" seems to be daring you to root against him.

And the character's quest, to save a condemned man in one day after six years of appeals have failed, seems truly ridiculous. James Woods has the most entertaining lines in the film.

Clint went through a real low period in the late '90s ("Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil" apparently didn't even follow the book) before rebounding in the 21st century ("Space Cowboys" was a good one!). I recommend this one only if you want to hear James Woods's hostile comment (it was a pretty funny one).Also starring Isaiah Washington, Michael McKean and Lucy Liu.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood has made a lot of good movies and a few great ones. True Crime doesn't fit in either of those categories. It is a very formulaic film badly marred by Eastwood miscasting himself in the lead. Clint, bless him, hasn't had any work done on his face and looks every one of his 68 years when he filmed this. Which makes it all the creepier at the start of the movie when he puts a move on a girl young enough not only to be his daughter but his granddaughter. Yick! A drunken has-been he is inexplicably attractive to the younger women who play his wife and his rival's wife who he's shtupping on the side.When Clint takes over for his younger colleague, killed in a car crash, who was scheduled to cover an execution you know he's going to solve the crime and prevent a miscarriage of justice. All in less than 24 hours before the execution. In other words, it's like the movie in The Player where Bruce Willis sweeps in at the end to prevent the execution. The ending of this movie is made even more ridiculous as Clint races from Richmond, CA to the governor's mansion which in reality is over 70 miles away. Just ridiculous.</fullReview>

Clint looks about 90 years old in this movie and the idea of him spending half his time in bed with various women takes the biscuit. The convict (played by Isaiah Washington) is also unconvincing, having apparently transformed from a small time criminal into some sort of philosopher.

		<fullReview>I don't know why this film doesn't get much credit. I thought Eastwood's directing and acting were superb. He plays a writer on his last legs like no one I can imagine. He's a loser, a womanizer, a reformed drunk - no one can do that like Eastwood can.The story is powerful. It is no surprise that there are many on death row who are innocent. The police and prosecution want a quick arrest and conviction to silence an angry public. They ignore evidence, lose evidence, manufacture evidence - they do whatever it takes. This isn't supposition; it is a proved fact over and over and no one ever gets punished for doing it.Isaiah Washington of Grey's Anatomy (well, not any more) was excellent as the innocent man.Give this a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Golden Oldie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Eastwood was 69 going on 100 when this film was shot and he does himself no favours as either actor or director: the early scene in the bar when the imminent septuagarian chats up a lady going on half a century younger than himself is either pure directorial bravura or a failure of the lighting cameraman to wear prescription lenses.But then, True Crime does no favours to anyone anyway, audiences included. Andrew Klavan, who seems to have had a hand in the screenplay, penned a clinically brilliant novel, one which by its very detachment showed the whole execution business to be what it is: squalid, shameful, and an indictment of civilised Society. Quite what he contributed to the screen version of his work isn't clear, but at times he must surely have despaired of celluloid's invention.The novel is, of course, black and white, and all the better for it. The film is in colour. Strike one. The novel has a semi-believable hero in his fifties. The film has Eastwood nudging 70. Strike two. The novel has a range of characters whose existence (as in all good fiction) serves not only to drive the narrative forward but articulate particular points the writer wishes to make without recourse to editorialising about the issue to hand: capital punishment. The film has a narrow range of characters of simple delineation overly preoccupied with articulation of a different issue to hand: Mr Eastwood.It's a film, then, that's worth seeing if only to appreciate what can happen when the complexities of a finely-honed novel are reduced to almost nothing in a linear movie running from A to Z with standard screenwriter plot points (jump cuts, car chases) at standard intervals (around H and Y).It's also worth seeing for the way in which the treatment of one character alone -- the Rev Shillerman -- signifies how bad movies can be made of good books. In the novel, Shillerman's character is pivotal, a being suffused with pious cant whose presence is a lesion on the face of Justice. In the film, he's a tiny pimple, his presence reduced to a minimum and his purpose seemingly to flag up how wunnerful the Governor is.But then, characters in editorial service of others is pretty much the hallmark of the film, with a vastly disproportionate amount of time being given to (who else?) Eastwood via high-flown news room dramatic conflicts in which all and sundry are wheeled on to show how repulsive / creative / maverick / original / exhausting Eastwood's character is. Why the writers didn't have someone voice the line: 'You're an ageing wreck at the end of your career but you may redeem yourself yet' isn't clear: a considerable amount of running time could've been saved.Much has been made by other contributors of the naff ending, and rightly so. The ending's the same as in the book, yet on the printed page it works infinitely better, this the result of Klavan's remorseless piling on of dreadful detail to the point where the reader is there on the gurney in the execution chamber too, waiting for the needles to prick and the oh so sterile lines to connect up to machines of a judicial death.True Crime provides no such involvement, its focus more outward than inward, its emphasis on the externality of Eastwood rather than the internal hell of an innocent victim.Though being politically incorrect nowadays isn't yet a capital offence, the wrath of the righteous is still courted when pointing out the obvious. Here, the obvious needs stating unambiguously: not only is Eastwood old, Eastwood is too old to go around pretending to be journalism's answer to Dirty Harry.Though there'll always be a place for someone as talented as this behind the camera, Clintwood really will have to be much more careful when choosing scripts which place him in front of the camera.Be a Golden Oldie, by all means -- and celebrate the fact, too. But don't pretend that the clock stopped in San Francisco back in '73 with Siegel, or out in Spain's nowhere land with Leone in '66. It didn'tEastwood is an original. It would be nothing less than tragic were he to now make himself into mere parody.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fair thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another fairly dreary thriller from Clint Eastwood based on a best-seller. As a broken down reporter hoping to redeem himself by saving an innocent man from death row, Eastwood might have been able to make something out of his role, but his insistence, at age 68, to play a ladies man, one who is even seen shirtless, sabotages the effort, as does his decision to play Steve Everett (which sounds like the name of a character Elvis would have played in one of his race car movies) as a chain smoker. Like Dustin Hoffman in "Straw Dogs" and Kevin Costner in "The Untouchables," just the way he holds the cigarette convinces a smoker like myself that health nut Clint is a pretender to the nicotine habit.Still, unlike "Absolute Power," his previous starring vehicle, "True Crime" manages to work up a fair amount of suspense as Eastwood races against the clock to save a man's life and to save his own career. There's also a fine cast. Unlike his potboilers of the 70s and 80s in which the supporting roles were usually filled by good actors whose careers had nonetheless seen better days, here, as in most of his films from the 90s, Eastwood is surrounded by other "name" actors, including James Woods and Dennis Leary, both of whom have enough intensity to keep Eastwood awake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"True Crime," directed by and starring Clint Eastwood, is a taut thriller that goes to the wire as Steve Everett (Eastwood), a journalist and recovering alcoholic, tries to find out what really happened that fateful day when Frank Beechum (Isaiah Washington) entered a convenience store to buy a bottle of steak sauce and wound up being convicted of murdering the store clerk. It's not a campaign born entirely of compassion, however; Everett has had a checkered career that has taken him to the top of his profession, only to have his own errors of judgment (attributed to the bottle) precipitate a swift decline that has ensconced him in a job at a large paper in the Bay area of Northern California writing personality pieces and sidebar profiles. He's not a man of tremendously high ideals or great conviction, and his moral character is somewhat ambiguous, but he demands one thing from himself and everyone else when it comes to reporting a story: The truth. In that he is adamant, and he pursues it without compromise using the one tool in his personal arsenal that has never (when he is sober) failed him, his "nose" for news, that innate sense that unfailingly leads him to that which he is seeking.At first, "True Crime" could be considered as another movie about capital punishment. Well filmed, with a good rhythm and convincing actors, this movie is the perfect movie to rent. But take a second look at "True Crime" and you won't be disappointed. This movie can be seen one, two or three times, it will still unveil a lot of goodies. One can admire how Clint Eastwood compares with subtlety the destiny of Steve Everett and Frank Beechum by using descriptions of similar situations: for example, the two little girls harassing their fathers with multiple demands at a crucial moment. Let's also observe how Clint uses a clever editing to pass from Beechum's cell to Clint's scenes: cigarettes, paintings (the green pastures) for instance are themes that bind the two destinies. Eastwood still has the nose for the truth in this good script. If you favor capital punishment, you may think it through again after seeing this film.Overall rating: 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>some bad filler in functional investigation movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steve Everett (Clint Eastwood) is a womanizing married recovering alcoholic. He returns to his journalist job at Oakland Tribune after rehab. A young reporter dies in an accident and he assigned her interview with death row inmate Frank Beechum (Isaiah Washington). Beechum was a troubled youth until he became born-again and married to Bonnie (LisaGay Hamilton). He's scheduled to be executed in a few hours for the murder of a pregnant store clerk but Everett starts to wonder about his guilt.There is a functional investigative crime mystery in this movie although the plot isn't very surprising. Clint Eastwood has filled it with too much uninteresting filler. Some of it is really cheesy. I think he wants Reverend Shillerman to be comic relief which really doesn't work. The most annoying is the Hollywood high speed chase to end the investigation. It's utterly ridiculous. Maybe he could call the governor or the prison or the wife. It's a bad attempt to make it artificially exciting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As Oppose to Untrue Crime?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>True Crime (1999): Dir: Clint Eastwood / Cast: Clint Eastwood, Isaiah Washington, Denis Leary, Michael McKean, Lisa Gay Hamilton: Typical Clint Eastwood thriller where an innocent victim is arrested. Title regards Eastwood as a reporter and the reality he is undertaking. He is a womanizer who is well aware of his lifestyle. A female friend dies in a car accident and a story she was doing prior catches his attention. Isaiah Washington is sentenced to death by lethal injection in 24 hours for the murder of a pregnant woman. Eastwood visits the crime site and comes away believing the guy's innocence. I could have lived without the on screen needle injection. Eastwood makes everything uncertain despite its lackluster visual appeal. He is effective as a man who goes to great lengths to insure the truth. Washington is well cast as the inmate who waits for the clock to tick down. Unfortunately supporting roles are not nearly as interesting. Denis Leary has a dreary role as a co-worker whose wife was involved with Eastwood. Michael McKean plays a corrupt Priest and this will no doubt turn off religious crowds. It doesn't have as much intrigue with the locations as Absolute Power does in the White House and a two way mirror. This is not one of Eastwood's best films as is Absolute Power, but it does contain a strong theme that regards sacrifice and justice that pull through despite its recycled concept.

Clint is famous for removing dialog and "extra" stuff from the screenplay, but this stripped down version has little of the "clock is ticking" tension and the witnesses are actually doing their best rather than embellishing to just convict the guy the police and prosecutor have pegged. The characters are not as well defined by the dialog or the direction/editing. The motivations and intensity of the characters is lacking as well.That said the movie is good, but a huge let down from the book.</fullReview>

However, something doesn't seem right to him and as a result he goes out on a limb to find out more about the crime. Meanwhile, the execution time draws nearer with no evidence to support Steve's hunch. Additionally, Steve is also facing the consequences for his own indiscretions while investigating this story. Now, rather than give the entire story away and risk ruining the film for those who haven't seen it I will just say that I thought this was an exciting movie which managed to maintain the suspense until the very end. I liked the performance of Clint Eastwood but I kind of wished there hadn't been as much emphasis on his home life as there was. Even so, I liked the movie and I rate it as above average.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clint Eastwood saves Isaiah Washington from execution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"True Crime" is an interesting concoction of comedy, detective story and anti-capital punishment movie. The comedy centers on Clint's affairs with the wife of his newsroom boss (Denis Leary) and the latter's attempts to get Clint fired by boss James Woods. His boss Woods gets to deliver his trademark hyper cascade of often comic lines. Then there is a running skein of political correctness gags throughout revolving around Clint's smoking, feminist frictions and some sex remarks. Clint himself portrays a comic character in his relations with almost everyone, including his daughter in a funny zoo sequence. He jokes about himself too, including his nose for news. His seduction attempts are likewise humorous. The script writers have written clever comedy throughout.Running right along side this is a serious detective story, as Clint in one day attempts to free an innocent man from being executed for a murder he did not commit. This is quite well done. The use of flashbacks is exemplary.And within that story is the most serious part of the picture altogether, a depiction in detail of what Isaiah Washington, the man on death row, is going through and what his family is going through.The story is thinner than most. Much time is spent on Clint's character and Washington's ordeal, his character too.I didn't for a moment believe in the reality of Clint's character and saw the whole newsroom thing as shtick. I didn't believe either in the one-day detection miracle. Yet, as a combo of entertainment and seriousness, I felt the whole picture came out as better than the average Hollywood product.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Crusty old Clint! He seems to have taken, as grizzled journalist Steve Everett, a piece of every TV detective cliché, stuck them all in a bag of M &amp; M's and given it a good shake.So, of course he's a boozy old swine, who neglects his much younger wife and inconceivably conceived young child of a daughter, drives a rusty old convertible that overheats and has repair patches on its roof. Naturally, he's sleeping with his boss' wife and is constant fear (wish?) of getting fired. And, of course, he made one giant wallop of a mistake years ago, when someone went free and they shouldn't have and that hangs over him like his worst hangover.Meanwhile, a six year old murder case and the accused, a black father and husband is on his last day of his life, before a lethal injection will claim him. So, of course, everything is left until the last second to prove his innocence.Clint is amiable enough, haphazard in a slightly appealing way but the film is long and there are many distractions and detours to endure along the way. If you're undemanding and don't need to go to bed etc. then you won't complain too much, but don't expect it all to be profound and meaningful police deduction techniques. There's also some rather cloying emotional stuff going on with the death-row prisoner and his daughter that may seem a bit overdone, depending on your point of view.There are, of course, worse crime thriller/dramas and thankfully, a lot of much better ones, too. The fact that it's Clint goes an awful long way and it might just have been unbearable without him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A relentless and wisely-directed crime-thriller focused on the search for justice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That Clint Eastwood is a great man who deeply loves justice is evident in all his movies, and "True crime" is no exception, indeed it's a movie focused on a desperate search for justice, against a whole insensitive judiciary system. A system which seems to disregard the most evident proofs of innocence, and just needs a guilty one to prove its efficiency. I was captured by the story progressing with mounting tension till the last second, and towards a finale that was not so predictable. I liked the character of Everett, however disdainful, unfaithful, even annoying, Eastwood creates a perfect antihero, ironically but lucidly demolishing the brutal and often absurd American judiciary system, surrounded by latent but still strong racism, and often supported by the connivance of common people and even by a merciless clerical intrusion. As in all Eastwood's movies, the director is in full control of the difficult theme handled, he offers the viewer all the necessary elements to rebuild the story, offering a wide perspective of analysis, but leaving the viewer the right to judge the events narrated. The usual honest look of a very wise and sensitive director, who also respects the intelligence and and freedom of thought of his audience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood has always been great at playing anti-Heroes, but this time, he went full out, playing a recovering alcoholic reporter who uses the case of a death row inmate to refurbish his career.You just don't like his character in this movie. He's a horrible husband, father and so on. He doesn't care about justice, he just cares about winning a Pulitzer. There's really nothing admirable about his character at all.Still, Clint does a good job here, and he has a great supporting cast, such as Isaiah Washington as the convict he is trying to save, or James Wood as his cynical editor. Also look for Lucy Liu as a store clerk before anyone knew who she was.I also kind of get the feeling that this role was written for a younger actor. One you could believe plausibly as the father of a six year old. The movie drags in places and is quite uncomfortable to watch in others.

The erratic screenplay plays a spoilsport in the second-hour. Eastwood's Direction is completely under-stated &amp; well-done, how one wishes if the screenplay had been tighter.Performance-Wise: Eastwood is mediocre. Isaiah Washington gives a fantastic performance. James Woods shines in a brief role. Denis Leary is effective. Lisa Gay Hamilton is impressive. Bernard Hill is passable.

		<fullReview>Directed by and starring Clint Eastwood, I didn't know anything about what this film would involve, and I will be honest in saying that it was purely because of the leading star, and his good supporting cast, that I decided to watch. Basically Steve Everett (Clint Eastwood) is an alcoholic and womanising reporter and journalist for the Oakland Tribune, and he is covering the story of Frank Louis Beechum (Romeo Must Die's Isaiah Washington) who faces execution for murder. The verdict of whether he killed a pregnant woman who owed him $96 was guilty, and he will be put to death at midnight in a few days, and Steve, who is also feeling grief after the death of his wife in a car accident, has to see if the sentence is fair. As Steve covers the story closer, he unearths undiscovered evidence from the night in question, that may prove that Beechum is in fact guilty, but his boss Bob Findley (Denis Leary) doesn't want to listen to him, since he is a disruption, and he slept with his wife. It comes to the point when Steve finds the substantial evidence that proves Beechum is indeed innocent, because of missed witnesses or something, and he races to stop the execution as it is about to happen, and in the end thankfully he stopped it just in time. Also starring Lisa Gay Hamilton as Bonnie Beechum, James Woods as Alan Mann, Bernard Hill as Warden Luther Plunkitt, Diane Venora as Barbara Everett, Michael McKean as Reverend Shillerman, Michael Jeter as Dale Porterhouse and K-PAX's Mary McCormack as Michelle Ziegler. Eastwood directs reasonably well, but his screen presence as the grizzled but determined investigator is a good performance, and the other good names in the cast get just about enough time to show their talent too, it is a simple of story of reporter trying to prove a man he is writing about innocent, but it is a near enough satisfactory crime thriller.

Clint Eastwood also stars in the film as a journalist covering the execution of a death row inmate, only to discover that the convict may actually be innocent, together with Isaiah Washington,Denis Leary,Lisa Gay Hamilton and James Woods.In the story,Steve Everett is an Oakland journalist recovering from alcoholism, given the task of covering the execution of convicted murderer Frank Beechum. Everett discovers that Beechum might be innocent, but has only a few hours to prove his theory and save Beechum's life. Eventually Steve learns that a young man named Warren, who was stabbed to death three years previously, killed the victim but is unable to prove it. After seeing a necklace belonging to the victim on TV, Steve remembers Warren's grandmother wearing it when he visited her, and he returns to her house, where she has come to the same realization about the murder and rushes off with Steve to alert the governor as the execution starts. They reach the governor and tell him what they know and he calls the prison and pardons Frank just in time to save his life.True Crime is another film that could be classified as a Dirty Harry film wherein the movie presents a flawed anti-hero who comes through in the end.Although the viewer would suspect what would become of the movie from the beginning especially with Eastwood starring and directing the movie,it was still handled professionally and magnificently.Although it was definitely not one of his best works due to its formulaic plot and somewhat predictable events that are to come,it was still an above average film.Although the mystery does not succeed,the study of character of the protagonist makes up for it.</fullReview>

Swap Dirty Harry's nose for his reporter's nose in this bilge...it's like Mr Benn trying on a different uniform each week.I loved Dirty Harry but those films became formulaic...and so has much of his acting since.

		<shortDescription>The true crime is this movie's shallowness.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>TRUE CRIME has the potential to be a powerful thought experiment, exploring the psychology behind the perception of what True Crime truly is. Aside from implicit racism, no real issues are broached in this dialog-driven Clint Eastwood actioner. From an Andrew Klaven novel, TRUE CRIME is merely the tale of a wrongly-convicted murderer on death row, Frank Beechum (played stolidly by Isaiah Washington) and curmudgeon reporter, Steve Everett's (Eastwood) 11th-hour hunt for the truth to grant his stay of execution.The question of what criteria constitutes True Crime is never raised. The plot involves a young black man robbing a grocery store and accidentally killing the pregnant female clerk, while Beechum happens to be in the store. Beechum is convicted for the crime on the tried-and-true Whitey charge of "Being Black And Nearby." To really bite at the meat of the movie's title, we would be exploring who is more of a criminal: the robber-murderer, or the congressperson whose mismanagement of social policy created the necessity for the robber to turn to crime for survival in the first place.In other words, is the bottom rung of society to blame for their survival instincts, when those instincts are only brought into prominence because white-collar criminals create a disparity of wealth in society to begin with? Well, slap a little racism in there - keep the deep thinkers at bay. For a second.There are a few too-convenient plot points and pulp coincidences, and we shudder to think how a less talented director might have made a mush of them. Only Eastwood directing Eastwood can get away with contrivances like Everett knowing the governor personally and later calling in a favor in the dead of night when the clock is ticking down; only Eastwood directing Eastwood can make sexagenarian Everett a convincing skirt-chaser, involved with a fellow reporter's (Denis Leary) wife. Only Eastwood directing Eastwood, Etc.For the simple story it is, TRUE CRIME hits its marks and pays off: dialog is snappy, especially the uber-masculine repartee between Eastwood, James Woods (as his editor) and Denis Leary; the principals give nuanced performances - Lisa Gay Hamilton as Washington's loyal wife, Diane Verona as Everett's estranged wife, Michael Jeter as a slimy eyewitness; Bernard Hill as a sympathetic warden and Michael McKean as a boneheaded priest. Eastwood's real-life daughter, Francesca Fisher-Eastwood (from ex-wife Frances Fisher), plays his cute little daughter.--Review by Poffy The Cucumber.</fullReview>

After that vision even the sexually suggestive banter with these girls brought on a sick feeling.The film is flawed, but the performances submitted by the wrongly accused black convict and his wife were exceptional. James Woods is fantastic as usual, not sure why Dennis Leary was cast in the part he played, his special talents were not utilized, but he did just fine as the low key editor.

		<fullReview>Over the past 12 years, Clint Eastwood has won over the critics who had slammed his films of previous decades, attacking on their quality and commenting that their existence was merely for box-office purposes. However, in the late Eighties, Hollywood's greatest veteran began a wave of world-wide successes and hits that continued throughout the Nineties and is still going strong in 2000 (Space Cowboys).True Crime is therefore Eastwood's swansong to the 90's and, yes, he's back as star, producer and director and, yes, its another winner. Eastwood's recent roles have all been well characterized and unforgettable, and the same applies to his subject here - burnt-out, womanizing reporter, Steve Everet. The story follows Everet and Death-Row convict, Frank Beauchamp (Isaiah Washington), over the course of the night and before the prisoner's execution. Everet's colleauge, due to interview Beauchamp, is killed in a freak car accident and so 'on the day' its up to Everet to ask the condemned his last questions. However, in-between his assignment and the scheduled execution (not to mention office confrontations over his affair with the wife of another co-reporter) Everet begins to sense that Beauchamp is in fact innocent.What Clint's given us here then is another riveting, race-against-time thriller. Once again, as with so many of his other pictures, he keeps us guessing and skillfully avoids cliches by bringing forward a series of neats twists. The sub-plot is particularly effective and well-handled, with James Woods giving an amusing performance as the editor who both cares and doesn't care about Everet's steamy misadventures. The other cast is also quite impressive and likeable and share a number of magic moments out between them. Finally, the story's short-time span brings freshness as it gives Clint something new to build and devise from, and increases the tension, with the trusty High Noon method of the ticking clock coming into a play.Overall, True Crime is not one of Clint's best and biggest films but is still a worthy and likeable winner of a thriller. not one of his best films so don't expect another In The Line Of Fire, but its an admirable and effective effort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clint Takes It To The Wire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a jaded reporter gets an eleventh hour assignment to witness an execution at San Quentin, it turns into a personal quest for justice as he spends the last hours of the convicted man's life in a last-ditch effort to get to the truth of the case. `True Crime,' directed by and starring Clint Eastwood, is a taut thriller that goes to the wire as Steve Everett (Eastwood), a journalist and recovering alcoholic, tries to find out what really happened that fateful day when Frank Beachum (Isaiah Washington) entered a convenience store to buy a bottle of steak sauce and wound up being convicted of murdering the store clerk. It's not a campaign born entirely of compassion, however; Everett has had a checkered career that has taken him to the top of his profession, only to have his own errors of judgment (attributed to the bottle) precipitate a swift decline that has ensconced him in a job at a large paper in the Bay area of Northern California writing personality pieces and sidebar profiles. He's not a man of tremendously high ideals or great conviction, and his moral character is somewhat ambiguous, but he demands one thing from himself and everyone else when it comes to reporting a story: The truth. In that he is adamant, and he pursues it without compromise using the one tool in his personal arsenal that has never (when he is sober) failed him, his `nose' for news, that innate sense that unfailingly leads him to that which he is seeking. In the case of Frank Beachum, Everett's nose tells him he is innocent; but he's only got a few hours to prove it. And it's been awhile since his `nose' has been put to the test; the last time turned into a debacle that cost him his reputation. This time, not only his job, but a man's life is on the line. And the clock is ticking. Behind the camera, Eastwood is a master storyteller; he exacts winning performances from his actors, delivers his movies with a deliberate pace and cadence, and knows how to keep the tension on the edge right up to the very end. And this film is no exception. As an actor, he's reached a maturity that lends itself perfectly to characters like Everett, imbuing him with a been-there-done-that countenance, from the expressive lines in his face to the way he carries himself physically, that not only makes him an interesting (if not entirely sympathetic ) character, but adds nuance and credibility to his overall performance. Washington and Lisa Gay Hamilton (Bonnie Beachum) also give excellent, emotionally stirring performances that anchor this story of a desperate family that finds an unlikely champion in Everett, in whom their only hope for justice and survival lies. In a terrific supporting role, James Woods plays Alan Mann, the editor for whom Everett works; it's a dynamic performance that produces some great and memorable scenes between his character and Eastwood. Denis Leary is also outstanding as Bob Findley, Everett's boss, and he turns in a subtle, understated performance that works as a perfect counterpoint to the characters of Everett and Mann. Things really ignite when the three of them are in a scene together. Also memorable in supporting roles are Diane Venora (Barbara Everett), Bernard Hill (Warden Plunkitt), Michael McKean (Reverend Shillerman), Michael Jeter (Dale Porterhouse) and Mary McCormack (Michelle). Be advised, `True Crime' is a movie that will put you through your paces. From the beginning, you realize that it's highly unlikely that Everett will succeed; there just isn't enough time. But you also know that `it ain't over ?till it's over,' so you hang on to that slim thread of hope, and through that you are readily able to relate to Beachum's situation. And it makes you realize that if hope is all you have, at least it's better than nothing. After all, sometimes in the end, it all pans out for the better. I rate this one 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Finally, the movie I've always dreamed of. A fast paced mystery suspense thriller, just without any mystery, suspense or thrills. And also slow paced.SOME SPOILERSEastwood reaches down and pulls out every screenplay and plot cliche for the above mentioned genres, and yet the final product still doesn't live up to the standards of a cliched generic suspense film. Start with a so-so idea: an innocent death row inmate and a rouge journalist who's going to uncover the truth as the clock ticks toward the execution, and then completely abandon the plot for 90% of the film as we pursue completely uninteresting subplots. Like the affair that Clint has with his boss's wife (that goes nowhere cause it turns out his boss doesn't care and Clint and the woman don't really like each other anyway). Strike one. Clint's alchoholism. Intriguingly raised, but ends up playing no part in the real story (the death row stuff). Strike two. Clint's estranged wife and neglected daughter. First of all, why does every action hero need a cute-as-buttons daughter? Notice it's always a daughter, always an only child, always between the age of 8.5 and 8.75. The point, obviously, is that the hero can be multidimensional if he's forced to balance work and family, but in True Crime's case, Clint gives us no juicy plot to justify neglecting the family. The estranged wife subplot only works if we, like Clint, feel the need to get back to the office to crack this interesting case. But here, our appetites aren't whetted at all. Why does Clint think he's innocent? Turns out that he is, but how did Clint know? What smelled funny? I guess the audience doesn't need to know. Strike three.So what's the deal with this plot? Clint's fateful, important face to face meeting with the convict ends up not being fateful or important. The guy doesn't plead with Clint to save his life, doesn't put Clint on the scent of the evidence that could clear his name. Doesn't really say much of anything really. He looks kinda bored. A good mystery needs to provide the audience with clues all along the way. All of Clint's interviews with witnesses, all his investigating the murder give the audience nothing that can be described as important in retrospect. When the truth is revealed in a good mystery, we should be thinking about all the clues that were shown to us that we didn't pick up on. Here we get nothing. Clint's moment of detective brilliance comes about five or six minutes before the end of the movie and wasn't in any way related to all the investigating he had done up until then. It was basically a random stroke of luck.And finally, Michael McKean as the priest? Was Kevin Nealon unavailable? He was the least convincing clergyman since Eric Idle in Nuns on the Run.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The most entertaining thing is reading the video box, where a couple of quote-whores managed to offer a few absurdly positive gushes. It mentions a razer-sharp cast, which must refer to their performances in any other movie other than this. Everyone is wasted. Eastwood wanders through the movie looking weak, while his character supposedly is a ladies' man of some sort. The script is credited to three people. Between them and a novelist, they haven't come up with anything you haven't seen before except a few unexplained, undramatic, and pointless motivations. Eastwood's 21st film has no excuses for being as listless as it is. Eastwood covers many scenes just intercutting between two medium shots, with no particular style. There are scenes begging for music or anything to help them along, but there is nothing. I was surprised when someone got credit for music at the end. The unjustly accused man at the heart of this movie has well-acted moments that should be gut wrenching, but by then you are likely to be hostile enough to overlook anything that works. The scope of the production is closed-in enough that you feel it is a low-budget knock off so cast members could meet contractual obligations and collect a check. Scenes come off like bad read-throughs for a high-school play. Eastwood has a reputation for shooting one take, or few takes, because he hates waste. But if you see this movie, he will have wasted your time. This is the first time it LOOKS like first takes or rehearsals. This is not the Bridges of Maddison County, Unforgiven, or even the weakest of his action films which do at least have a pulse. I will give Clint benefit of the doubt that maybe he was going through serious health problems at the time. The movie is so weak that, believe it or not, I am holding back out of respect for the bulk of his career.. . .A year later, I catch this film on TV in different company and although the ending still feels out of place it is not the disaster I thought it was and the performances are not bad at all. I'm tweaking and adding this little note because my first impression was too harsh. Instead of a 1, I rate it a 5. Many of Eastwood's films improve on second screening, but they usually go from 6 to 9.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie truly stinks. First of all, Clint's character crams about a week's worth of investigating into less than 24 hours. Second of all, he actually thinks we want to see an almost 70 year old man with his shirt off. Yuck! Thirdly, the idea that young, attractive women would willingly sleep with his character (even the wife of a colleague) shows how inflated his ego has become. And he was actually shocked that this movie bombed? The viewer is subjected to the noble Clint valiantly acting as the great white knight saving the hapless death row inmate from a wrongful execution. And lo and behold, the real killer turns out to have been snuffed a few years before (which Clint speedily uncovers). How convenient, how black and white, and how incredibly unrealistic. James Woods proves to be the only saving grace of this film, but he is woefully absent from most scenes. Clint, your Rowdy Yates days are over. At least in Unforgiven you acted your age.</fullReview>

He'd be more adequate portraying a man with prostate problems. I really don't know what he was thinking when he agreed to do this one.If you add some fade-out's with loud music in the background you can turn True Crime into a mediocre TV movie. Have trouble sleeping? Get in bed, put this one on the VCR and wait a few minutes... no pills, no magical solutions, just a piece of crap that will have you snoring in no time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie seems like one of those party games where you start with one line, and as you go around the room, each person adds another bit of the plot. Clint's a drunk trying to stay on the wagon, he's making his boss' wife, he's grieving over a young reporter he tried to put the moves on, he's neglecting his little daughter, he's involved in witty repartee with his boss' boss, he's trying to save a death row inmate on the very day of execution, on and on. The movie is difficult to watch because Clint's voice is so unbelievably raspy, you miss about 30% of his dialogue. Then there comes the matter of the convicted murdered that he is trying to save. Why is he trying to save him? Because he thinks the guy is innocent. Why does he think the guy is innocent? No reason, just his "nose". There is a powerful movie hiding here about redemption and truth and justice, but this is not it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Film Since Unforgiven(1992)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>True Crime is the best movie that Clint Eastwood has done as director since the early 1990's. After less than impressive movies like Absolute Power(1997), and Midnight In The Garden Of Good &amp; Evil(1997), he has finally done a film that is excellently done and an interesting one about the issues of the death penalty. True Crime(1999) also gets some nice performances from character actors like James Woods and Denis Leary. It is about a journalist who has to clear a man's name in order to prevent his date with destiny.True Crime(1999) deals with similar themes shown in The Green Mile(1999) like the negative aspects of the death penalty and the American Judical System. This is the first film in which Clint Eastwood behaves like a person his own age. It is a shame that True Crime was not nominated for a few Oscars including Best Picture as it is better then most of the movies nominated. This is another gem in the filmography of Clint Eastwood the director.</fullReview>

These are not only sustained in the good narrative tact that he demonstrates, but in his favored film icon self refers. This time is an incurable journalist philanderer. For worse mixed up in the worst of sins of the American press: it spreads to the inflated plans and not very practical. Their marriage goes to the shipwreck, its employment also since he went to bed with its boss woman. Even so he takes charge of saving a convict to death (Isaiah Washington) in a environment that in spite of everything continues being obsessively racist. In True Crime in spite of its melodramatic insistence, it reigns the sobriety, the irony and the romanticism to the mute that is it that more it moves in the cinema of the great East.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Day in the Death of Frank Beachum</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's the old story of a convict on death row protesting his innocence and the crusading reporter taking up his cause. An old story line to be sure, but Clint Eastwood as producer/director/star manages to pull it off and make this a very good movie.Eastwood plays Steve Everett, an over-the-hill womanizing, boozing reporter who has seen better days and whose marriage and job are in jeopardy. Through a twist of fate he is assigned to interview Frank Beachum (Isaiah Washington) on death row on the day he is to be executed. Everett believes the man to be innocent and sets about to prove it in a race against the clock.Washington is excellent as the doomed man who has accepted his fate after six years of legal battles. Lisa Gay Hamilton also excellent, plays his wife. The scene where Beachum says his goodbyes first to his daughter and later to his wife will have you reaching for the kleenex.As in all Eastwood movies, there is a stellar supporting cast. Dennis Leary plays Eastwood's yuppie supervisor who seems threatened by the veteran reporter. James Woods (in what amounts to a cameo) appears as the paper's editor. Diane Venora is effective as Eastwood's wife, Christine Ebersole has a brief bit as a co-worker, Michael McKean is good as a prison chaplain as is Bernard Hill as the warden. Also along in brief roles are William Windom and Anthony Zerbe.Eastwood the director, maintains the suspense and keeps the movie moving a good pace while playing up the apparent hopelessness of the situation and the race against time.After some 45 years in movies, it's good to see old Clint still able to take his shirt off and make love to ladies one-half, and in one case, one-third of his age. He doesn't pack that .44 Magnum anymore, but in a concession to his earlier movies, there is a good car chase in the picture.True Crime is a good movie but I had to deduct marks because it's hard to believe that after six years of litigation, nobody was able to uncover the evidence that the Eastwood character suddenly finds in less than eight hours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Faceless, crooning non-thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>* * (2 out of 5)True CrimeDirected by : Clint Eastwood, 1999Overly narcissistic Eastwood movie, starring and directed by the big E. himself. I like the way that Eastwood goes about himself in his more serious movies. I like his slow, crooning style, his tone of voice ? like he is running out of breath merely opening his mouth ? his hazed, tired voice, his eyes that roll to the side as he stiffens his neck and head back. I like his wry smile. I like most of his movies, even the old ones and, hell, I even like the Dirty Harry sequels.But this is overdoing it. Ouch! Eastwood plays a (famous) newspaper man, Steve Everett, who drinks (although we hardly see him with a bottle) and smokes (he comes across looking like a teenager lighting up for the first time the way he fondles and pulses while exhaling his shortnecked Camels), is a total ladykiller (at his age?), and is assigned the task of interviewing a death row inmate hours before his execution. Everett has that reporters `nose' though, and he smells something fishy. Maybe the guy did not do it.There`s more. Everett has also got a beautiful wife and a wonderful daughter at home. Problem? There is absolutely no chemistry between Eastwood and anybody in this movie. James Woods is fed a lot of clichéd `editorial' lines and comes across sounding more like Mr. White from the Superman movies than like a hotshot straight out of the Watergate story (which is clearly the intention).Denis Leary looks tired and restless and he has a hopeless role from the get-go. Diane Venora, as Eastwood`s wife is rather faceless also - but again - her role is thankless. There is absolutely no chemistry between husband and wife. Only Isaiah Washington as Frank Beachum ? the black man wrongfully sentenced to the death penalty for a killing he did not commit ? and the scenes and flashbacks concerning him come alive and make this a somewhat worthwhile watch. Also; the issue and debate (death penalty) is still needed.Another plus is the cinematography; as always the Bay Area scenery is spellbinding in Eastwood`s hands, but this supposed thriller would have made for a great documentary instead. Now, there`s an interesting thought.</fullReview>

More disconcerting is that Clint Eastwood (one of my favorite action characters) just does not have the acting capacity for such roles. The other actors in this movie were working around Clint as they would with the equivalent of a cardboard cut out. In addition, Clint's former attributes of an impressive presence, physically and psychologically in past Westerns and detective flicks, is gone. He is now a thin, old man, with lots of facial hang, and his credibility as a ladies' man or physically tough guy is just not there. I think Clint should stick to producing and go light on the acting in such roles. Overall the movie is a 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>dull, shallow social drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"True Crime" demonstrates what happens when a film tries too hard to tell what should be a simple, straightforward narrative. Unlike the brilliant "I Want to Live" and "Dead Man Walking", which stayed focused on their emotionally wrenching examinations of capital punishment, "True Crime" wanders all over the map, attempting to be a meaningful social drama, a challenging journalistic whodunit and an incisive character study all rolled into one. The attempt may be an admirable one but the result, in this case, is a slow-moving, overstuffed and, above all, remarkably unconvincing entry in the cinematic death penalty sweepstakes.In what is fast becoming his own personal stereotype, Clint Eastwood portrays an aging alcoholic, philandering reporter for the Oakland Tribune, who takes over the job of writing a human interest puff piece about a 6-year old murder case literally on the eve of the condemned man's execution. Amid mounting personal problems at home, Eastwood begins to question the man's guilt and to unravel, in less than convincing fashion, the true facts of the case.The primary weakness of the film lies in its basic lack of credibility: we are expected to accept, on faith, that this over-the-hill reporter - after a full trial, endless appeals and countless journalistic investigations - is the one person who, in less than 24 hours, can successfully solve the case.Which leads us to the second and, perhaps, more serious problem: the delineation of Eastwood's character, which is, essentially, a tired rehash of the secret service agent he portrayed in "In the Line of Fire", one of the finest thrillers of the 1990's. In that film, his character is haunted by his failure to protect President Kennedy in the crucial moments of his assassination, and who overcomes his feelings of self-loathing and self-doubt by foiling a later attempt on a modern president. In this film, Eastwood's reporter has obviously been burned by an earlier article in which he argued for the innocence of a rapist later on found to be the undeniable culprit. In "Line of Fire", the agony he felt was real and the would-be assassin played upon it for dramatic effect. Here, the situation seems like pure plot contrivance to help bolster the lack of faith each of the subsidiary characters displays in Eastwood. We have no idea, in this film, exactly what kind of redemption he is seeking.The screenplay also sets up a gallery of shallow secondary characters who often behave in ways contrary to common sense. Why, for instance, do the fellow reporters at the newspaper treat the death of one of their young reporters with such a cavalier indifference after she smashes head-on into a pickup truck in what is, admittedly, one of the least convincing car crashes in recent memory? Why is the prison chaplain portrayed as a smarmy creep, dripping oily religious cliches, antagonizing the prisoner and even publishing a phony confession for popular media consumption? And must the one crime witness be a Mr. Peepers reincarnation, replete with bowtie, nerdy mannerisms and complete disregard for the gravity of his position?We realize that the point of the enterprise has completely escaped the filmmakers when the film subjects us to a completely inappropriate beat-the-clock finale, complete with cop chase and last-minute rescue, an insult to the seriousness of both the subject matter and the audience. This final assault is, perhaps, the real "True Crime".</fullReview>

I haven't read the book, so I don't know how true to the original character of Steve Everett Clint was, but it really was a joke. The story was okay if not predictable. My main beef with the film has to do with Clint's direction It was too deliberate, no subtlety whatsoever.He wanted to pull at the viewers heart strings which is fair enough, the problem was we could see Clint coming a mile away.True Crime's saving grace lies in the cast. Stellar performances all round especially from James Woods (as usual), Dennis Leary was also on top form. The kids were annoying though and only helped to distract from the plot. Clint's attempt to endear sympathy from the audience by using those two brats was nothing short of of obvious. Don't get me wrong, the film isn't bad it's just not up to the standard you'd expect from a Great Director Like Clint Eastwood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thumbs down for Clint &amp; True Crime</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very disappointed in Clint Eastwood's performance as a journalist trying to save the life of a death row prisoner. Clint Eastwood portrayed Steve Everett a married drunk, womanizer, and someone who happens to be sleeping with the editor's wife.I love the idea that this story is based on, but the writer could have gone back to the drawing boards to revise the characters. After movies such as the dismal, nonsense of Midnight In The Garden Of Good And Evil and the mediocre Absolute Power; I would think Clint Eastwood would learn a lesson about what makes a good movie. The only actor I really enjoyed in this film was the talented but often villanous James Woods. Steve Everett's only friend if we can call him that was James Woods' character Alan Mann, who defended him to Denis Leary's character, Bob. The problem with this film was that the character played by Eastwood, Steve Everett didn't real care about what he was doing. Everett was an alcoholic who I think only cared about two things, his beer and his daughter. I liked the sub story involving his daughter played by his real daughter a lot more because he convinced me that he actually cared about something other than himself. By, the end of the movie the prisoner will either be executed or saved by Everett. I loved the ending because it was the only interesting, and suspenseful part of True Crime. As talented as Clint Eastwood, and James Woods are they could not have known they were going to be part of such an awful film. They did their best, but failed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>True Crap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was quite a struggle for me to sit through this bomb. Eastwood was disappointing as an actor, director, and intelligent human being for making this unbelievable attempt at reality. He totally miscasts himself as the loser journalist Steve Everet (whose own wife even calls him "Ev"). Eastwood is a screen icon of strength and respectability, and does a poor job portraying the womanizing, down-on-his-luck, investigative reporter. The only redeemable performance comes from the flawless James Woods, who steals every scene and would have done a much better job cast as the lead. I was shocked to read some of the external reviews of this film, namely the NY times and the trustworthy Roger Ebert, who gave glowing reviews to this garbage. Sorry Rog, but this film had no style whatsoever. It's a cheap rip-off of an overdone attempt at freeing the innocent man (see "To Kill a Mockingbird" for the original version). I could not help but laugh when Clint evades the cops on "dead man's curve", or when he makes a sad attempt at putting the moves on a 23-year old, or when he decides that Frank Beachum is innocent because the potato chip display blocked the witness' view of him. C'mon, how stupid is the audience supposed to be? The screenwriters should be shot twice for even putting their names on this flick.I had "The Player" in the back of my mind throughout this movie. Robert Altman satirizes this very plot in his intelligent send-up of Hollywood. I wish the fools that fund this junk would learn a lesson from their repeated cinematic failures, and stop making the same movie. I also hope that Clint realizes his age at some point, and either checks himself into a nursing home, or starts playing the elderly roles he is suited for. If Clint Eastwood can play a womanizing pervert with a 4-year old daughter and young wife, then Marlon Brando can start playing shirtless, action heroes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing wrong here.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reading through these comments, I was surprised to see so many talk about all the bad acting. I, for one, couldn't find one single bad performance. In fact, I think it's one of the best acted movies I've seen the last couple of years. Like the elder statesman of filmmaking, Clint has evolved into a slower-paced storyteller as he's gotten older. Nothing wrong with that, I like it. Because you can be sure about one thing when Clint's at the helm; They're always well told stories in a most classic way. And not many filmmakers can, or dare, to tell them this way in todays "try-to-dazzle-you-with-explosions- so-you-won't-notice-there's-no-story-whatsoever" film. So, by all means, keep them coming, Clint! But try to romance women your age the next time.....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but not great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>True Crime is a fairly engaging movie that has some good performances. Eastwood as the director stages the action well and moves the plot forward. Only in the scenes where he takes his daughter to the zoo does the film tend to lose a little momentum. Then again, a scene like that helps illustrate the character that Eastwood is playing. He'll follow a story, but he'll try to make time for his daughter. Eastwood the actor, he seems to enjoy the roles of the tough but flawed theme. His character in True Crime is a womanizer, and a former drunk. Good characters always have flaws and Eastwood can play them with his eyes closed. The supporting cast is well rounded and helps advance the narrative. The only qualm I had was that Eastwood the director, should've tightened the running time and made the story that much more urgent. We've all seen the beat the clock films and this one's no exception. What could've made this movie better is a brisker pace, but Eastwood the director chose a more laid back style. After thirty years in the business, Eastwood can do whatever he wants with his films. He's earned it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two Words: Bloody Awful!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The idea behind "True Crime" is as routine as it gets: a black man in a southern county is sentenced to death for the murder of a grocery store clerk he claims that he didn't commit. A washed-up, womanizing, alcoholic reporter (with more than a few personal problems) is given the job of interviewing him for the last time. What he finds is that he believes the man's story and launches his own investigation to try to get him off the hook.Predictably, he runs into troubles along the way, both with his boss and with his wife. From that alone, you can predict how the movie will turn out. After about 10 minutes, I knew where the movie was going. There is no real suspense, no real clever plot twists, nothing to hold my interest. This movie would work better as an Anti-Death Penalty propaganda film.The acting is mainly where this movie suffers. Clint Eastwood was a terrible choice for this movie. He hasn't really made a good movie in about 10 years, and he has definitely lost his appeal as the tough, headstrong leading man that he was famous for in movies like "Dirty Harry". He is boring, unconvincing, and seems to play the part in his sleep. The only real redeeming quality about this movie is James Woods, who manages to get a few laughs out of the audience. But other than that, just plain old Hollywood garbage.</fullReview>

When I saw the previews, I knew I wanted to see this movie, and was hoping I wouldn't be disappointed as has happened many times when a great preview turns into a lemon. Not the case here, this movie has it all: romance, excitement, compassion &amp; suspense. You will not walk away from this movie disappointed.

		<shortDescription>A laid-back suspense drama -- it's vintage Clint Eastwood fare in its own tempo and cadence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Eastwood is playing his own musical piece in cinematic form. A relaxing suspense. (Oxymoron? Yes. Isn't life full of contradictions?) There's nothing to dazzle you. He doesn't have to have special effects, or gratuitous commercial elements to please producers. It's HIS movie -- he can do whatever he wants with it. It is unhurried in his own rhythm. It's like he's enjoying a good cup of coffee -- taking his time, letting it brew. Mind you, there IS suspense, but it's not "in your face" treatment -- probably appreciated more by mature audience.It's a controversial topic -- not pleasant: it's about death row, and it's actually raising a serious issue on possible wrongful verdicts. Storyline in a gist: A veteran newspaperman (Eastwood) to report about an inmate due for execution by lethal injection at 12:01am the same day he was given the assignment. Being the super investigative reporter that he is, racing within the limited timeline, tackling various obstacles to his finding out the True Crime that was -- as he follows his own instinct that this person (Isaiah Washington portrays and delivers a subtle performance) has been wrongly accused and death-sentenced at San Quentin.The critical time element is present, but it's not outright obvious. There are numerous details offered to us in seemingly casual ways: the nuances of various characters are integrally presented, from the prison warden, prison guards, the death-row person's wife and young daughter, the assuming witness and neighbors, fellow reporters, the head of the newspaper (James Woods), the immediate boss (Denis Leary); and the different situations and retellings of the crime scene -- from the beginning run through of the lethal injection procedures, the casual exchange with his female colleague at the bar, to his visiting the inmate, meeting with the black grandmother, etc., all played out in moderato. Even the chase scene -- yes, there is a necessary one -- has a unhurriedness to it, in spite of the fact that they are beating the clock!Eastwood also took time to include small descriptions of his central character: vulnerable imperfections he has, e.g., scenes with his wife (Diane Venora briefly), outing with his own daughter -- how he bungles and stumbles. He's no hero, or is he? The intensity of the last half hour built up to a crescendo -- then, at the very ending, there is a rest: silence speaks louder than words.TRUE CRIME is true film appreciation -- no special effects necessary. It's the art of telling a suspenseful story yet not thrusting all the tense elements at you. It's relaxing watching the film -- trusting all the pieces will come together and we will have a worthwhile movie experience.The ending credits indicated Clint Eastwood did write a tune "Why should I care" with 2 other persons, and Diana Krall was singing it as the end credits rolled.Try Eastwood's directed "BIRD" 1988, you'd get to appreciate a fuller range of Diane Venora's performance opposite Forest Whitaker as Charlie Parker. Caution: it's 2hr 40mins, not totally pleasant -- it included drug addiction phase of the Jazz Legend's biography -- but great performances and soundtrack music of Bird's.Another recent film that takes its own pace and in an unhurried way is Luis Mandoki's "Message In a Bottle" 1999 with Kevin Costner, Robin Wright and Paul Newman. No particular effects -- a simple telling of a human story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A quiet, understated Eastwood film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>True Crime is the kind of film that is made by a man who has grown comfortable over his many years of both acting and directing movies. Eastwood's creased, careworn face and trademark expressions are very familiar to audiences. Over the years he has gradually grown from a spaghetti western star to Harry Callahan, the character he made famous in the Dirty Harry movies, to roles that explored deeper sides of human nature, such as Unforgiven and Absolute Power. He has also demonstrated a competent hand for directing action thrillers, such as In the Line of Fire.After Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, I wondered what Eastwood would do next. That film left me a little disappointed; it was full of colorful characters but lacked a compelling plot to carry them along. True Crime, a subdued thriller, is not what I might have expected but demonstrates that Eastwood is not afraid to tone down the action and go for characterization, and quiet truths.The movie follows Eastwood's character, named Steve Everett, a reporter for a major Oakland newspaper who is assigned to write "a human interest sidebar" about the execution of Frank Beachum, a man convicted of killing a pregnant store clerk in cold blood. Since Eastwood is the reporter, and the story involves the last 24 hours before the execution, we can predict, accurately, that his character will find it impossible to resist investigating the facts behind the case, and discover evidence that may suggest that Beachum is innocent.There is the sense that Everett is motivated by his inherent rebelliousness against his editors at the paper. (In one revealing scene, he tells an interviewee that he is writing a human interest sidebar and asks her if she knows what that is; she says no. He replies, "Neither do I"). His senior editor (James Woods) admires his skill at sniffing out a story and tends to go easy on him, but the associate editor (Denis Leary) feels that with other good reporters on staff he shouldn't have to put up with Everett's attitude. It doesn't help that Everett is sleeping with his wife, either.While the movie progresses along more or less predictable lines, Eastwood has pieced together the obligatory scenes with a style and skill that makes it fresh. I liked the scene in which he visits the Beachums at the prison and makes it clear that he is in this for the story, not Beachum's welfare. I also enjoyed the way he makes the warden into a sympathetic character, who is just doing his job (the real villain in the prison system is the self-serving chaplain). The movie also does a good job of acting as a reporting procedural, as Eastwood goes about his daily routine and goes where the story takes him. He has a nice scene in which he wheels his 4-year old daughter through the zoo on cart, in order to make it to a crucial appointment on time. Family and everything else are sacrificed on the altar of the job.I enjoyed the movie, even with its predictability. The final scene, which is carefully constructed, comes across as contrived and a bit hollow. I wish the filmmakers had had the courage to go for a bolder ending, instead of using the traditional Hollywood convention. But it didn't ruin the experience. True Crime is a well-crafted movie that is comfortable to be what it is, an intelligent thriller, and that was good enough for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Isaiah Washington shines, as does the movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The title of this movie is True Crime, which in an ironic way is not as true as it would lead you to believe. We've all grown to love, or not love, Clint Eastwood in his Dirty Harry roles, and the like. In more recent years, we've seen him mature into more emotional and, dare I say it, sensitive roles. Just remember the thief with a conscience in Absolute Power, and his memorable role opposite Meryl Streep in The Bridges of Madison County. In True Crime, Clint Eastwood plays a newspaper reporter, whose only real talent in life seems to come from making foes of his colleagues by sleeping with their wives. A story lands in his lap where he is assigned to interview a death row inmate, who is to be executed that very same night. Of course, upon reviewing the details of the murder, and the subsequent trial, Eastwood is immediately able to pick up on discrepancies that the trial attorneys missed. The convict is played by Isaiah Washington, who has a filmography of nearly 16 movies to his name, which with the exception of Bulworth, I don't think I've heard of any of them. But this is one actor that I want to see more of. His performance was superb,playing a man who is scheduled to be put to his death by lethal injection in less than 24 hours, and who is still proclaiming his innocence. The chemistry between Washington, his wife (played by the Practice's Lisa Gay Hamilton) and their daughter is magical. The characters have depth, and are believable. And on top of that, you want to like Frank, even though he is a convicted murderer. James Woods plays Eastwoods editor, who whilst questioning Eastwood on his conduct regarding sleeping with another colleagues wife, in a funny and likeable way, is only interested in finding out "was she good?" This movie is well acted, well directed, and thought provoking. I give it a 9 out of 10, and I close the balcony!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Close, but no cigarette</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like Clint Eastwood. I loved "Absolute Power", "Unforgiven", as well as his older ones: "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly", "Fistful of Dollars", and "Dirty Harry".Here, though, he perplexes me. What's he going for with "True Crime"?A touching, human-interest drama? If that, it works so-so. We get a moving, skillful performance from Isaiah Washington. A dependable, workmanlike leading-man from Eastwood. James Woods is as good as he's ever been, Diane Venora is a plus as usual, and Dennis Leary can steal a scene without even trying. On the other hand, he cast two of the worst child actors in recent memory in the roles of Washington's and Eastwood's daughters. Also, there's a clumsily edited, acted, written, and scored scene involving Eastwood's character taking his daughter to the zoo and, being a Bad But Well-Meaning Father, screwing it up. At the end of that scene, which must go down as the weakest directorial efforts ever to be credited to Eastwood's name, there's the obligatory shots of disapproving onlookers, probably mumbling "Oh, what a bad father that guy is." Did anyone else suspect that the entire sequence was surgically transplanted from "Kramer Vs. Kramer"?If it was a drama, it's not a complete one. What else could it be--is it a comedy? James Wood's entire performance, which includes a visual gag where he's told something so shocking he can't even bite into a Snicker's bar, seems to suggest comedy. There's a lot of slight, peripheral attempts at humor--Eastwood seems to be telling us, "Hey, this is serious, but not THAT serious." and "My character may be a drunk, but he's a FUNNY drunk."Speaking of which (if you'll allow me to digress a bit), what's the drunken-driving message here? In the beginning, a sober woman is killed in a car crash, but at another point, another character gets completely toasted and proceeds to drive with all the skill and precision of a Navy fighter pilot. Clint, I have two less Aunts than I ought to due to a drunk driver. Why don't you pour yourself a tall one and think about that?Off the soapbox, I still admire Eastwood as a director and as an actor. He put together a hellified cast here (except, of course, those two little girls), and his story is moderately compelling. It's serious subject matter he's tackling here, but "True Crime" shouldn't be taken TOO seriously.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Movie--If You're Braindead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where to begin? I guess maybe I'll start with the absolutely unoriginal, cliched, predictable plot. This story has been done 1,000 times before, and been better every single time. Secondly, the editing in this film was horrible. There is one scene where Eastwood's character pulls his car up to a building, gets out, and tries to jimmy the lock of a metal door. The movie then cuts to something else, and cuts back to Eastwood at a glass door next to a garden. Yes, maybe he went around to the other side of the house. But why wasn't this shown? It just made the movie seem ridiculous. Now for the worst part of the movie: the casting!! I can only imagine what an ego Clint Eastwood must have to think that he can possibly pull off this role. He begins by flirting with a 23 year-old (who is actually receptive to his advances, and not completely disgusted as was the entire audience.) Later he is having an affair with a woman in her late thirties and struts around with no shirt on. He has the body of an 80 year old! Worst of all, his character has a four year-old daughter. A 4 year-old!! She's young enough to be his granddaughter, if not his great-granddaughter!! Clint needs to get a clue!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not That Great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can understand liking this movie in relation to a lot of the crap that's out there, but on its own, really, I don't think it was as great as everyone has said it is.I agree that Eastwood is a little cringeworthy portraying a guy who is supposedly a sexual magnet to young women. And Clint-- keep that shirt on. There was a clear tension throughout the audience during that entire scene.Many of the plot contrivances are good ideas, but don't come off entirely. For example, the hours Eastwood's character (Everett) fritters away before really becoming involved in the case (not knowing that these could be vital hours in saving Beechum's life) SEEM like they're meant to build tension-- but they just don't really. The relationship between James Woods and Eastwood is good-- I liked the way Woods respected Eastwood-- but Woods' one-liners came close to undermining his character and making him a stand-up comic inexplicably in the midst of the story. Finally, the crucial tension that SHOULD have existed when Everett has given up, and suddenly receives the clue that will tie the case together, just doesn't work. The climactic scene is played well, and is affecting, but I wish I could say the same for the whole film.Eastwood can be commended for taking the road of subtlety through the film, but what the film needs is a little more focus of tone and theme. The screenplay is wildly disjointed, and as a result the film is still struggling to establish a tone well into the second half.The performances are uniformly good, though often overwritten. The worst example of this, aside from Woods' overcomedic turn, is Eastwood's LONG speech about what a badass he is, during his 15-minute interview with Beechum. I'm sorry-- that man is going to die-- isn't it a little narcisisstic to talk so much about yourself just now? I was surprised at how good Dennis Leary was. And the script was kindest (and the least choppy) to him.I felt this script needed one more revision and a lot of evening out before going to the cameras.

		<fullReview>"True Crime" is yet another example of how Clint Eastwood knows how to let a story be told without being in a hyperkinetic rush. Most younger so called "cutting edge" filmmakers are in such a hurry to get story elements out of the way and get on to the business of wowing and blowing the audience away with their quick cut editing and break neck pace visual virtuoso (Michael Bay?). This is usually not the best way to tell a story; Clint Eastwood knows that you have to let a story unfold naturally and not be so preoccupied with the "wow" factor. As he did in "Absolute Power," "A Perfect World," and many others, Clint Eastwood marvelously makes a film that is not afraid to let a story be told. Even his more action oriented films such as "Firefox" and "Outlaw Josey Wales" take the time to let the story happen. Younger filmmakers and filmgoers could gain priceless knowlege by paying more attention to the way a Clint Eastwood makes movies than following the ways of a say, Quentin Tarantino or Robert Rodriquez. "True Crime" is a social thriller for intelligent thinking people of all walks of life who appreciate a director who does not dumb things down or condescend to his audience. See "True Crime" if you like "true" movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood takes a typically cliche ridden plot of a grizzled old alcoholic womanizer reporter and builds enough story around it that you wonder how come no one else does it any more. This story feels like it was written in the early 70's when stories were character driven and avoided too many chase scenes and shoot-outs. There is so much extra dialogue between characters, so much atmosphere, that we can ignore the few weak points in the story. The ending shot is sadly Spielbergian or John Hughes-like, but the stuff with James Woods is solid gold. We pick at movies like this because we can identify somewhat with the events or situations and we enjoy movies like Unforgiven because we weren't there then: but this movie has as much to say about people and relationships and the search for redemption.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have so much admiration for Clint Eastwood, it's silly. The man is a dynamic director. Choosing atmosphere over content, I am consistently impressed by his movies. The languid pace may put many off, but I revel in his antithesis to the current crop of MTV hacks. `True Crime' is another example of this. Filling this movie with just the right amount of extra fat, Eastwood successfully creates one of the better death row dramas I have seen.The story itself, based on a book, is excellent, if a smidge cliched. I really enjoyed the whole cast that Eastwood assembles here. James Woods and Denis Leary are a stitch as two bickering newspaper editors. Isaiah Washington's portrayal of the man awaiting his death for a crime he didn't commit is amazingly detailed and heartbreaking. I loved all of his scenes. Eastwood does his usual scowl, but in `Crime', he lets in some bizarre moments of comedy and drama that you rarely get to see him do.The last 20 minutes of the flick resemble a bad 1970's TV movie. That hurts the overall impact. But up until then, it a sturdy drama with surprising depth and a decent cast.----------7</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A story about a faded, jaded journalist (Clint) who starts to suspect the man on death row he is supposed to be interviewing is in fact innocent. Is he right? Will he get the evidence in time? I watched this from the point of view of someone trying to write screenplays that can be shot on a low budget. With that in mind, I was very impressed. The movie makes good use of a small number of sets and a small cast. The story is gripping enough. The characters are well developed. There was never any doubt in my mind what would happen at the end, but it was engaging non-the-less.My one quibble would be the resolution - those last 3 or 4 minutes right at the end. The rhythm of this seemed slightly out. I can't go into details without giving the plot away. But let's face it, I could guess what had actually happened at the climax of the movie. There was no point in trying withholding the facts any longer. That just left us with a slightly cheesy moment in the ending sequence.However, this is a very watchable, if somewhat unremarkable movie. Gently entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a bad one..try it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of my bad habit is; I use to check the reviews here when I rent my movies before actually watching it. Upon reading the reviews I too was a bit reluctant in watching this. OK..I thought of giving it a try anyway. And surprisingly; this movies turns out to be very engaging, fast moving, and keep you 'glued' to your seat one! There is humour, suspense, emotional at times and keep you edge of your seat climax. Eastwood plays and directs Steve Everett, a womanizer and a broken husband who accidentally gets the chance to interview Beechum (Washington)behind bar and who is on his last minutes to death sentence. Everett believes that Beechum is innocent and then tries to find the truth himself before it gets too late. Story is good, characters are interesting. The scenes between Washington; the soon-to-be-died husband and his wife (Hamilton) and their kid is well written and done. The 'suspense factor' revealing scene could have been better.Not definitely a must watch but a not to be missed one to an extend!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Routine, With Lively Spots.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to pin down why this film isn't more satisfying. There are small scenes that are quite successful. A funny one, for instance, in which Eastwood (as a reporter facing a REAL deadline) rushes his little girl on a stroller through the zoo, telling her that they're playing a game called "Speed Zoo." "We go FAST," he shouts and he runs past the flamingos. There's a dramatic scene in which his wife, Diane Venora in a good performance, gives him back his ring and then, despite his entreaties, begins to cry and begs him to get out. He does. And he doesn't get back in. And he doesn't wind up with another babe on his arm at the end of the movie.There's another good scene in which he deals with an embittered black grandmother, desperately trying to squeeze some life-and-death information out of her while she excoriates white people for not caring about her and her neighbors. "It's not that kind of thing," says Clint desperately. Both actors handle it well.But, well, that's an example of how you can turn a couple of decent scenes into a story that looks like a jury rig made up of disassembled parts, some kind of Rube Goldberg device. Near the end of the film the black grandmother turns instantly into an apologetic and cooperative witness, overcoming in a matter of minutes the resentment of a lifetime. It doesn't work.There are three basic subplots. (1) Eastwood is an investigative reporter on the skids who rushes around feverishly trying to stop the execution of a man he believes to be innocent. He's got about twelve hours to get the job done. (2) There is Eastwood, the family man. The failed family man, actually, which probably gets more screen time than it deserves. (3) There is the black guy on death row, waiting to be strapped down on the table. He is visited by his family -- a loving wife and a cute little girl, about the same age as Eastwood's.The main theme really ought to be Eastwood's investigation. That's where the tension is. But we don't see enough of it, and what we do see seems simple minded and improbable, turning on the position of a potato-chip stand in a convenience store and a locket that shows up at exactly the right time.The drawn-out theme of the man on death row is harrowing. The details of planned, legal executions are always harrowing. That's why we see so many of them in the movies. It's a cheap way of dragging the viewer in. One of the first, and perhaps the best, was in Susan Hayward's movie, "I Want to Live." That about said it all. What we get now is a kind of putrid exposition of exactly how the law goes about taking someone's life, about what that someone is feeling and thinking. It may not be a necessary part of the narrative but it excites some morbid part of us, the part that buys supermarket tabloids containing pictures of former celebrities now grown old and fat, the part that gawks at highway accidents. It's so drawn out and detailed it almost torpedoes the film.Even the title, "True Crime", shows a flagging of someone's imagination. Column A: True, Lethal, Deadly, Fatal, Absolute, Basic.Column B: Passion, Crime, Instinct, Vision, Murder, Attraction, Power. All in all, given the absence of extras in shopping malls during the Christmas season, and given the haphazard collage that is the plot, you don't get the impression that Clint was trying very hard on this one. Still, the best-written scenes, which I take to be from the novel, are the barbarous and vulgar insults flung back and forth in the newspaper office between three mutual enemies: Eastwood, James Woods, and Dennis Leary. More of that, and less of the death row anguish, would have helped.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood certainly doesn't have to prove himself any longer as the man who was immortal in the 70's with his Dirty Harry-image is now one of the better cineasts around in Hollywood. Eastwood plays a reporter who passed more hours behind the bar then behind the typewriter and when out of a sudden he is asked (more forced...) to report about the human feelings from someone who will end up on an electric chair the coming 12 hours, Eastwood decides it's time to investigate the innocence of the condemned...no further comment on here. The movie certainly has its black holes (why can a drunk journalist find out something in an hour?) and its cliches (of course it's a black guy who will be sent to the chair) but it's a moving one and it once again reopens the question about the death penalty. Eastwood plays brilliant as well, but as he is a pensioner now it'll be time that his wifes in movies aren't played by young babes. Ok movie, but better skip the laughable end though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If we try to separate the wheat from the chaff in Eastwood 's movie ,it's rather easy.What's good,it's for sure the scenes that deal with the black family:the man and the woman,both full of dignity,the little girl crying for a green crayon to color the green pastures;the faith and the courage the unfortunate I.Washington's character shows in his terrifying ordeal. The preparations for the lethal injection are impressive as well.When they explain to the condemned man how the "things" will happen,it's almost unbearable.The minus side concerns the star/director;in the past years ,Eastwood championed the oldcinema and he often brilliantly succeeded:the thriller ("a perfect world" ), a return to Sirk melodrama ("the bridges of Madison County" which featured a marvelous Meryl Streep),a TennesseeWilliams atmosphere (the overlooked "midnight in the garden of good and evil")But here ,as some users point out,he's much too old for the part:he casts himself as the father of a ten-year old girl.And his investigation is rather rudimentary:the medallion trick ,it's a shameless easy way!Forgetting what's good and what's bad in his movie,we can share Eastwood 's disgust for the death penalty.But his movie cannot cut "dead man walking" and "I want to live" as far death row is concerned.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*minor spoiler* (although that term hardly applies)I don't get it. I watched this movie and checked imdb to expect a rating of 4.3 or so, but was shocked to find way too many positive reviews.The actual idea of a man trying to keep an innocent man from getting executed can be made into a good movie. Well that's what I thought, but Clint Eastwood's effort was bone-headed, uninspired and pathetic. All those dreadful scenes with the convicted guy and his wife, and the clueless storylines concerning Clint's domestic issues really bored me to death. No character development, no interesting dialogue, no nothing.God, and then the dragging part where Clint needs to find the clue. "THE NECKLACE, IT'S THE NECKLACE YOU IDIOT!" I found myself shouting at the TV for half an hour. And when he finally gets it the real pain begins, as the movie leaps from one embarrassingly unrealistic and annoying and scene into another, to finally end so stupidly it's unreal. It's a disgrace to tackle such a weightily subject with this amount ignorance.Sigh... I really needed to get this out of my system... feeling better now...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like Clint Eastwood as an actor. I even like some of his directorial trips (The Unforgiven, for example). But this movie was a big, BIG disappointment. I understand that part of movie making is asking your audience to suspend their beliefs but I think in this case it was asking too much. I had no feeling for Eastwood's character; the death row inmate was very black and white (no pun intended); I have NO idea where they were going with the possibly-evil-warden bit and the story was just too unbelievable for words. It would have been MUCH better if they had stretched the story out over several days or even WEEKS but cramming everything into one day was just bad, bad, bad. And the little tip-o-the-hat between the two main characters at the end was corny. Tsk, tsk, tsk.</fullReview>

Not a believable moment in this movie, from the sadly aged (and sagging) action hero flattering himselfas a still attractive womanizer to the obligatory "nail biting" endingyou can't watch seriously if you've ever seen Altman's "The Player". If Clint didn't see that satire he most surely agreed with the sellout Hollywood insiders it was attempting to scathe. Another disappointment in a vast ocean of laughable Eastwood directorial efforts for nearly 30 years. Thank god he still manages to screw up and make the odd good movie like "Josey Wales" and "Unforgiven." At least "True Crime" counterweights the crass bad acting of James Woods with a dignified performance from Isaih Washington as the man about to be executed. But it's the script that should have been executed before either were hired. For insanely loyal Clint Eastwood fans only.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is so formulaic. The renegade reporter who has ruined his marriage, is sleeping with everyone's wife, and uses unconventional methods to find stories, has an interview with a condemned man. He decides quickly the man is innocent, based on some pretty casual observations. The movie than degenerates into a series of touching moments with the wife and daughter of the man saying goodbye and all the usual stuff leading up to the needle. Meanwhile, Clint to the rescue. Most of the coincidences and discoveries are so far fetched, we can't buy into things. I won't ruin the ending, but I will say I really felt unfulfilled. Clint is good as the sober, totally immersed guy who has been trouble wherever he goes. James Woods is the crusty Perry White guy who hates what is going on, but then gives his blessing. Dennis Leary is a schmuck. It's just a pretty weak effort from someone we've come to ask for more. He certainly delivered it later.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why Should I Care ?!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I quite caught the rhythm of (Clint Eastwood) or understood his policy. It is one Oscar winning movie, then one so so or brainless. A movie for the audience and the critics as well, then a movie for the audience only. You can summarize it by the irony of making (The Unforgiven) then (Absolute Power) ! So here, obviously it's the second case (maybe the secondhand one !). The story of the loser whom rises like a phoenix wasn't done successfully. The plot wasn't good at parts, in fact (Eastwood) seemed ludicrous when he was asking seriously in Dirty Harry's biting style "And What About The Potato Chips?!!!". (Eastwood) was 69 years old at the time, so the myth of him here as a ladies man was even more laughable. There is strangely massively boring scene at Eastwood's office in the newspaper, that was DEADLY. (Isaiah Washington) is highly provocative. The solution of the whole thing was so easy and not convincing. The concept of (True Crimes) looked simple to naive extent. If it was meant to be pure entertainment (with message), so they've done it yet in mediocre way. The real perfect thing was Diana Krall's "Why Should I Care", unfortunately in the closing credits only, however as higher than the whole thing. Watch its clip too, it's more effective than the movie itself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>True Crime is one of Clint Eastwood's trilogy of dullness, with Absolute Power and Blood Work as the bookends. There's just something so lifeless and TVish about these movies. You could snip out the cussing and the occasional burst of mayhem and you'd have a CBS Movie of the Week.It doesn't mean the True Crime isn't engaging. It's got interesting characters and a slam dunk plot--maverick reporter finds out a walking dead man is really innocent, but it all looks so ordinary. Eastwood's a better director than that and you can't help but wonder if he's just doing it for the money or practicing for bigger, better projects.True Crime is a lot like out-of-the-box macaroni and cheese. It's filling but you eat it when the cupboards are bare and the paycheck is still a few days off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely Corny But Polished And Enjoyable Condemned-Man Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steve Everett is a washed-up newspaper hack. Frank Beechum is a convict on death row who protests his innocence but is about to be executed by lethal injection. When Everett is assigned to interview Beechum he uncovers some cracks in the case, and the race is on to prove the condemned man's innocence before it's too late.This is a good crime thriller, solidly made and beautifully acted by a great ensemble, especially Woods as the supersleazy newspaper editor and Hill as the polished, considerate prison governor. It has a big flaw though, and it's the plot, taken from a book by Andrew Klavan. To say it's hackneyed is like calling Marilyn Monroe a bit of an exhibitionist; we have a man on death row whom teams of legal experts have failed but one journalist saves in an afternoon, the drunken womanising hasbeen whose family life is a disaster and whose nose for a good story is the only thing that can save him from oblivion (and who is sleeping with the boss' wife), witnesses with the credibility of used-car salesmen, and even an last-minute phone call to the execution room. I half expected Lassie to show up at some point and bark in the direction of the overlooked evidence. What saves it from hilariously misfiring of course is the talented cast and crew, and the immediacy they bring to the characters. It's also a good film on an important and very divisive subject - capital punishment - although ultimately by proving Frank's innocence it doesn't really explore the issue fully (unlike, for example, the much more powerful Dead Man Walking). All in all though, a suspenseful and enjoyable picture, worth catching if only for the cast alone. Trivia - Eastwood's daughter in the film is played by his real-life daughter Francesca with actress Dina Ruiz, who also has a small role.</fullReview>

So when Eastwood's name came up on the credits, my heart sank.Having just recently seen Mystic River, I was shocked and appalled.

		<fullReview>Frank Beachum was in the wrong place at the wrong time. As an African-American with a past, he was seen by two white people running away from a convenience store shooting. Even though he had cleaned up his act and become a Christian, he was still sent to death row.Once Frank's appeals ran out, former investigative reporter Steve Everett was sent to do a human-interest story on him. Steve could not limit himself to do what he was assigned. And amazingly, he was able to do what had not been done in the trial or in years of appeals: find evidence that could free Frank. In the process, Steve managed to neglect his daughter Kate and alienate his ex-wife Barbara.Clint Eastwood and James Woods are known as good actors, and they delivered as expected. Nothing spectacular. The little girls playing the daughters of Steve and Frank did wonderful jobs. I thought they seemed like real kids, not actors playing kids. It was heartbreaking to watch little Gail Beachum leave the room for the first time after finding out she was never going to see her father again. Lisa Gay Hamilton did a nice job as Frank's wife, and she too gave us a sad performance when the inevitable was about to happen. I also liked the panhandler who annoyed Steve once early in the movie, and later showed up again as Santa Claus, using language Santa wouldn't use.I like movies like this where the main character crusades for the truth after seeing injustice done. The premise was implausible, of course. Steve had just hours to find out what lawyers couldn't over the course of years. It was still enjoyable to watch ...SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ... especially toward the end. The movie hit a dead end when Steve ran out of leads, but while sitting in a bar he put the last piece of the puzzle together and the race was on! A wild car chase (and Steve was drunk, too) complete with cops alternated with he slow suspense of Frank's final walk. Would Steve make it? It could have gone either way. What a terrible moment for Frank's wife. It made the movie entertaining, anyway. And we almost didn't find out the outcome. They really made us wait!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An alcoholic reporter is sent to cover the last day of a killer on death row but seems convinced that he is innocent. Can he find the evidence &amp; stop the wrongful execution in time!Clint Eastwood is not only an acting icon but a very good director from Play Misty For Me to the multi-Oscar winning Unforgiven. True Crime however is a blot on a career which has for the most part been of a consistently high &amp; entertaining quality.The problem with True Crime is that it comes across as a TV movie or at best a 50s B-movie. The characters are cliched from the washed up reporter to the Newspaper Boss with a grudge &amp; everything has been seen before, better done. Who do we blame for the films faults? The script doesn't thrill or excite &amp; the whole film is a mass of contradictions which is not helped by uninspiring direction &amp; by the numbers acting. Is it an anti-death penalty movie, a light thriller or a comment on the treatment of ethnic minorities by the legal system of America? I doubt if anyone involved in this film knows. For example, more could have been made of the Prison Governor, who in one small scene hints at his doubts as to his prisoners crime. This idea could have been expanded - a man whos job it is to incarcarate questioning the guilt of those he must punish.The finale of True Crime has to be one of the most unintentionally hilarious in cinema history &amp; anyone who has seen The Player will find it laughingly familiar. Also the way in which we get to it is quite uninspiring, no mass of clues coverups &amp; false evidence here just a total change of heart by one of the characters in the space of a couple of seconds! No in-depth detective work from Mr Eastwood apart from a quick interview with a witness, a stack of crisps &amp; a lucky break involving a piece of evidence all of which surely must have come up during the trial.Overall this is a totally pointless film which neither thrills when it should or pulls at the heartstrings at the right moments. An unfortunate choice not only for the legendary Clint Eastwood but James Woods who has done far better than this mess of a movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a movie with a very good story-line which, unfortunately, requires a viewer to suspend logic a bit. Clint Eastwood does a good job as an aging, alcoholic reporter assigned to do a story of a soon to be executed convict, and in the midst of researching the story he becomes convinced of the man's innocence. The movie revolves around his race against time to exonerate the condemned man. The build-up of the suspense is well-done, and Isaiah Washington does a very good job of portraying the condemned man, with all the emotions involved.The movie is not without its problems, however. It stretches the imagination to believe that a reporter knowing nothing of the case could accomplish what Eastwood's character did in the space of twelve hours; the sub-plot revolving around Eastwood's womanizing is irritating and adds nothing to the story; the prison chaplain is an offensive caricature of Christian clergy; finally, the movie's ending left me a bit empty - that was the best they could come up with?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've said it before and I'll say it again, Clint Eastwood has to be one of the, if not the, most boring men in Hollywood. He will continue to be this lonely stranger with a secret past, or a drinking problem or whatever.This film is another edition to those slow thrillers that Eastwood loves to do. Granted, In The Line Of Fire was a decent enough film, but that was because of the quirkiness of John Malkovich and Dylan McDermott.True Crime is about an alcoholic reporter(eastwood) who is given the routine task of interviewing a prisoner on Death Row. Of course Eastwood gives us the cliched line "i think he is innocent" and from that moment on, True Crime starts to remind us of those other Death Row films where you actually feel something for the prisoner at the end. Most of the major stars have been there-Sean Connery and Laurence Fishburne, Susan Surandan and Sean Penn, Chris O Donnell and Gene Hackman, Sean Young and Tim Matheson, Christian Slater and Kevin Bacon(murder in the first-the best one yet) and now Clint Eastwood and Isiah Washington(who, i'll admit is nothing short of brilliant).The are a number of scenes where the film starts to perk up a little-James Woods and Clint Eastwood talking about their female conquests, Isiah Wahington with his family hours before his execution and flash backs of the crime itself-but on a whole, Eastwood shoots blanks.

		<fullReview>I would have preferred something stronger for my Saturday night movie, but I don't feel betrayed either. I just am indecisive about whether to judge this movie as a parody of cliche journalist-saves-death-row-prisoner films or as a representative of such cliche films. Nevertheless, I was amused by brilliant dialogues, hated lousy acting, especially by a way old Eastwood, loathed the totally unconvincing and unbelievably clumsy "green pastures" metaphor, and overall, thought I saw another one of those ordinary Hollywood movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eastwood too old?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found myself distracted during this film by the fact that Clint Eastwood appeared far too old to have a young daughter,the scenes between them were unconvincing.This spoiled an enjoyable if somewhat predictable drama. It was interesting to see Bernard Hill, playing the warden,more than holding his own in distinguished company.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>TRUE CRIME is populated with performers who have proved in other venues that they can deliver the lines. This film had no lines to deliver. The total failure of the screenplay was a very unfortunate waste of an exceptional cast and of the fan's time. I felt the IMDB rating of 6.6 was inflated by more than 4.4.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Overall nothing really new here. Eastwood may have been better off quitting while he was ahead. The script was a little egocentric, and tended to draw excessive attention to his archetypal promiscuity-almost like Seinfeld (notice how all of his girlfriends were gorgeous). For the most part it was entertaining, and the death row situation was engaging at times, but as already mentioned, a little "bread and butter" Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not a bad movie. It was a good step by step of what happens during an execution. It broke stereotypes. The guards were not mean and unfeeling. The warden was a professional. The womanizer doesn't have to be young and good looking... On the down side: The story was not tight. Some of the time lines didn't add up. It is worth a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood's one of my favorite actors and one of my favorite directors; I can't think of any other film figure who fits in both categories of favorites.Even so, I could only give this film a "five," and even then felt I was being a bit over-generous. The plot has logical potholes in it; the acting is often really bad; some scenes are so sentimental they made me cringe and want to hit the DVD fast-forward button (but I restrained myself). On the plus side, the film has that "Eastwood look" that I love; it can't just be the California sunlight--so many films are made there. (Besides, the night scenes have that trademark look to them, too. He has a masterful eye, I believe.)And there's just the presence of Eastwood himself to enjoy. I agree with another commenter that he should have had a somewhat more mature film wife by that stage in his career! But I understand he's devoting himself solely to directing from now on, so that's an issue in the past.Just to witness that special brand of toughness that his characters invariably display, is reason enough to watch any Eastwood film. I wonder if it doesn't speak to something, often repressed, inside many of us. I know I often find myself thinking, "Damn. That's just what I would have liked to say under the circumstances." And then, naturally, feeling grateful that I don't find myself under the circumstances of his characters!</fullReview>

I am sorry I wasted the time watching this picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What in the world?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie about two months ago and I'm still trying to figure out what in the world was going on. First of all I wish Clint would keep all his clothes on. This is supposed to be a thriller, not a horror film. Why in the world he felt compelled to partially disrobe at his age I'll never know, but it is painful to see. I also thought there was a peculiar chemistry between himself and his real life daughter who appears as his daughter in the film. The real life mother of the little girl who plays the daughter, Frances Fischer, is also in the movie. She is Clint's ex-girlfriend before his present wife. Confused yet? I honestly think Frances Fischer and James Woods were the only people in the film who could act. It was just a disjointed, weird film. I am sorry I paid good money to see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Are you kidding me?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the worst movies I have ever seen. As a straight formula movie, it adds nothing to the world of crime films. Not a new wrinkle, interesting subplot, or a single bit of intrigue. But for the relatively nuanced performance of Isaiah Washington,the acting was bland and impotent. Clint was asleep at the wheel playing even more of a cliché than normal. Was James Woods the publisher? His faux-anger/wink-wink attitude toward Eastwood's conduct ("Really, how was she?") is offensive more from an artistic perspective than anything else. Like a publisher, or at least a higher-up in a modern-day major metro newspaper would ever act like that. And, as the Metro Editor, Leary did nothing but sit at his desk and stare balefully at Eastwood. He didn't do a single thing as an editor - not one! He didn't make a call, review an article, (maybe have him edit something -- there's an idea), assign a story, nothing. The awful thing about this movie was that they wren't even interested in faking it with any degree of ambition at all.I could go on and on, but it's not worth it. This thing sucked. Period.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Predictable and overwrought</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think that Clint Eastwood is one of America's great directors. Nevertheless, his "True Crime" disappointed me. Eastwood a man of nearly 70 when the movie was made, cast himself in a roll for which he was at least 30 years too old. The talents of James Woods and Denis Leary, as the Eastwood character's bosses, were largely wasted in parts that were caricatures. This should come as no surprise, I suppose, because Eastwood's character, a burned out reporter, was so overwritten, it just didn't work for me. Finally, the premise of an innocent man under a death sentence for murder being innocent and then saved at the last minute by a drunken, philandering, emotional basket case of a reporter required a suspension of disbelief beyond my ability to effect. Perhaps my negativity is enhanced by the knowledge that the movie's quality was significantly inferior to that which Eastwood has proved on multiple occasions he is capable of producing ? "Mystic River," "Million Dollar Baby, and his latest, the wonderful "Letters From Iwo Jima," come to mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay, but not good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This one was pretty okay, however I wouldn't really call it good. The storyline was there many times before and some of the scenes seemed really awkward to me, so extremely staged. The acting was ok too, but again not really good. Woods' appearance was quite entertaining, in some scenes Washington was acting really well, but there's not much else to say about this movie. Innocent gets accused, some bastard of a journalist bring in the relieving proof in the last second. It could've been better.My ratings: story 4/10 (been there lots of times), acting 6/10 (wasn't breathtaking, really), drama and tension 5/10 (cheap): overall 6/10.You decide yourself. If you're an Eastwood fan you might like this, if you know how what good cinema is you might be distracted a bit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What is going on with Clint in the 90's? He has botched three terrific books in a row. "Absolute Power" "Midnight..." and now "True Crime" the least well known of the three books but as a book it is my favorite. I never read "Bridges.." so I can't comment on how he ruined that one. His biggest mistake with "True Crime" was casting himself in the main role. The guy is going through a late life crisis. At one point he describes seducing an 18 year old and he tries to get in the pants of a 23 year old. I mean the whole image is kind of disgusting. The book is not an easy one to film, as it is one of those race against time plots that seem to work so much better on the page than on the screen. Skip the flick.. read the book. 6 of 10 and that's only because of James Woods enjoyable performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like watching a soap opera; poorly written with dry, predictable circumstances. *1/2 out of ****.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>TRUE CRIME / (1999) *1/2 It has been over five years since Clint Eastwood has won an Academy Award for his film contribution of "Unforgiven." Subsequently, this actor and director seems to be growing weary of his talent, and continuously presents audiences with unsuccessful movies. "True Crime" falls into that category. Eastwood has no clue of what this production is about. Within a lengthy running time of 127 minutes, we receive plots detailing adultery, divorce, murder, occupation, automobile accidents, a trip to the zoo, and a man on death row. "True Crime" is truly a waste of time. The film's main character is first seen drunk out of his mind at a local bar with his associate (half his age) Michelle Ziegler (Mary McCormack). They discuss matters of their lives after a hard days work. The man is Steve Everett (Clint Eastwood), whom is, along with Michelle, is an Oakland Tribune journalist. Steve is also cheating on his wife with a woman married to his direct editor and boss, Bob Findley (Denis Leary). Currently assigned to Michele is a human interest story about a prisoner named Frank Beachum (Isaiah Washington), sentenced to death at midnight the next day for the shooting murder of a pregnant woman who owed him $96. Later that night, however, Michele dies in a car crash and Frank inherits her story. The basis of the setup is a series of unbelievable coincidences. Due to the development of Everett, we do not care that much about the main character. The corporate leader of Oakland Tribune, looking for decent stories regardless of the cost, is introduced with more thought. This is the only character with a mind outside the boundaries of the script. Playing him is James Woods, who makes the audience smirk with his startlingly blunt and humorous conversations with Steve. The picture cuts back and forth between Frank and Steve. Everett believes Frank is innocent after he questions the two main witnesses and experiences a hunch they lied about what they saw. What is Steve's motive for even considering Frank to be free of guilt in the first place? He has no real reason to investigate or dig deeper within the case; this character is attentive with no angle. There is no momentum behind Frank, anyway. We have no idea whether to believe he is innocent or guilty. This is one of the reasons this character is no where near as empathic as the ones being sentenced to death in "Dead Man Walking" or "The Green Mile." The first day we meet him is his last day alive; there is no introduction, explanation, or development. That factor is probably the reason the filmmakers used subtext like "I feel isolated?fear," to develop Frank's terror behind bars. "True Crime" plays like an overly sappy soap opera. Of course Frank is full of superficial religious motifs and belongs to an emotional, loving, spiritual family with a little girl. All these clichés are present to make us feel sorry for Frank. However, the audience does not know if this man is innocent or guilty of his convicted crime. Naturally, when Beachum explains his story to Steve, we hear a blameless perspective, but when we ultimately do witness the truth, it is already too late for the film.  Clint Eastwood is too melodramatic and common in his role. His involvement's with adulterous affairs, high powered business persons, passion for booze, and hunches of wrongdoing are misused and pointless. He obviously pictures himself as a muscular, highly attractive young man who magnetizes women. However, I did not believe once in the film that any of the story's females would even give Everett a second look-yet he beds several.  After watching "True Crime" I felt guilt and remorse, mainly because I was looking forward to the execution so highly established in the movie; it is the only event of any interest in the entire production. Even under the well-prepared circumstances, however, the formulaic conclusion falls though. There is no meaning, suspense, or feeling behind this motion picture. Watch the better "Dead Man Walking" or "The Green Mile," to see an effective production about life on death row. Watch "True Crime" only if you missed the latest episode of "Days of our Lives."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well made film with a, almost, laughable ending.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a well made and particularly well written movie that overcomes an ending that is not up to the high standard the rest of the movie sets. The scenes between the main character, a journalist played by Clint Eastwood, and the managing editor of the paper, played by James Woods, are very well written and acted. Even Dennis Leary plays a believable editor in this drama/suspense directed by Eastwood. The only problem with the good writing, good directing, and good acting in "True Crime" is it makes the ending that much more disappointing. After watching the first half of the movie I am sure most people will know what the ending is going to be. I certainly did-even though I hoped I was wrong and that some brilliant twist would take place that would save the ending. While that didn't happen the rest of the movie is well done enough to recommend to someone that they see it. It just takes a movie that could have been an 8 or even a 9 and makes it a 6 or 7.</fullReview>
