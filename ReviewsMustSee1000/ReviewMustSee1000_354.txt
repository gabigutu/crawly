		<shortDescription>What happened to Blade?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why is Wesley Snipes sharing screen time with Ryan Reynolds and Jessica Biel? Who cares about Hannibal King? I paid to see Blade kick butt, just like in Blade 1 and 2. I didn't pay to see Ryan Reynolds joke for half the film. I didn't pay to see Jessica Biel (hottest body in Hollywood) fake fight. Who cares about Whistler's daughter? Blade the Vampire Hunter was a good film. Strong villain. Strong hero. Good story. Blade 2 was even better. A rare sequel that bests the original. Two strong villains for Blade to fight against. Good supporting cast. Good story and a director who gets it. Blade Trinity is a joke: literally. The villain, warning spoilers ahead, is Dracula, if you don't know by now. Dracula: the original vampire--the baddest of them all. What a way to end the series, then to have Blade fight the first and the greatest of his kind, but Dracula does basically nothing throughout the film. He doesn't pose any real threat to Blade, or anyone else. He is just there, and Blade has to kill him, because that is what he does. The other vampires in the film seem to have no other purpose either than beating up Ryan Reynolds' Hannibal King, while the latter cracks one liners. I didn't pay to see a comedy. Jessica Biel is hot, but I didn't pay to see a Jessica Biel movie. I paid to see Wesley Snipes as Blade, and yet it is like he is cast aside for younger models. Wesley Snipes is the star. He has charisma, on screen and off. Jessica Biel does not, and I don't care about Ryan Reynolds. I paid to see Blade. What happened to Blade?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will The "REAL BLADE" Please Stand Up!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As most negative reviewers(people who know what they're talking about!) stated : "Blade 1 &amp; 2 kicked ass and was in a class of it's own in the action/comic book movie genera!"This excuse, of a "made for TV" movie is not just an embarrassment to the Blade franchise, but to the entire industry!Where do i start?&gt;&gt; Firstly:&gt;&gt; the movie is called "Blade", so where is he? Wesley Snipes is simply brilliant as Blade (no other actor could have been more convincing), now all of a sudden he's an 'Extra' in his own movie wandering in the Background looking ever so bored, with a cast of "American pie" wannabe actors taking the lead (they're even on the poster!). &gt;&gt; that's like having Britney Spears featured on a Public Enemy or Linkin Park track!&gt;. Is this another ploy from "white Hollywood" bringing in the "snow-white" crew to diminish the lead black actor's presence??Blade works alone&gt;&gt; imagine Superman, Spider man or the Hulk with 2 human sidekicks?&gt;&gt; Ridiculous! They're more of a liability than assistance!!Secondly, while we're on the 'sidekicks'&gt;&gt; since when are humans able to kick Vampires' asses? (that's like a Rabbit beating up a Lion!) What's the point of having Blade around?&gt;&gt;They're barely afraid of the vampires&gt;&gt; Fighting for your life from a bloodsucking demon with your i-pod on?? Cracking wise-ass jokes every chance u get , even though a Vampire has almost killed u more than once&gt;&gt; "give me a f#*king break!" 3rd-ly: Where's the Intensity, Darkness, and Mind Blowing Effects from the first 2 movies?&gt;&gt; This was like watching a cross between a, B-Grade action flick(Chuck Norris)&amp; a bad episode of Friends!Then &gt; we come to the casting and acting&gt;. All Round Poor!!&gt;&gt; Why is Triple-H in this movie????? Why does Dracula look and portrayed even lamer than the one in Vanhelstink? (looks like a euro-trash porno actor) Ryan Reynolds?? Jessica Biel??? (with leading roles??) wtf! ** the casting director is obviously a genius!!!**Blade 4 :&gt;&gt; Either kill Blade off in an attempt to keep his dignity! Or get Del Torro back to make up for this "Mtv Teeny- Bopper" Butt-Hole Fest!!0.5 / 10&gt;&gt;&gt;</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not what I was hoping for, compared to the first two movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unfortunately this movie didn't have the impact on me that the first two did. I've been a big fan of Vampire movies in general as well as the first two movies of the Blade series, so I'm an avid fan of the subject. While this movie offered more in the comedy &amp; comic book feel, it lost the originality, horror, and suspense IMO.Pros ? Cool new weapons &amp; some plucky comedy. Cons ? Lacked any kind of suspense / horror feeling, wasn't serious at all, more of a popcorn movie than the first two. Also a comic book cinematography feel that kind of bothered me.Throughout this movie I never felt a single hint of being in a horror movie, but more so like a super hero movie (like with all Marvel comic movies). Now granted I'd say that the Blade series lingers more on the Sci-Fi / horror fence rather than just horror, but this movie was more like a comedy action and lacked any kind of suspense / horror. The first movie was pretty original, the 2nd was more darker and the mutated vampire strain definitely gave a good creepy &amp; suspenseful element while building off the original storyline. However the third movie lacked any suspense at all as the main bad guy (Dracula, or rather his modern name 'Drake') seemed to lack any substance or omnipotence at all. You didn't fear him or see him as any real threat at all other than his ability to morph into other things which wasn't really used well; hence the suspense went down the tube?The acting was okay, there was a much more comical feel to this one rather than the few one liners of the previous two movies and I guess that rubbed me the wrong way, mainly instigated by Ryan Reynolds (Mr. Van Wilder). While he was certainly physically fit for the part as seen in his torture scene, his relief comedy ways totally change the tone of the movie. Interestingly you never see Wesley Snipes all stripped down, wondering if he's been keeping up with his push ups? Jessica Biel is okay at best. She certainly kicks ass in the movie, but is not very believable in her character IMO and not very good eye candy either, so kind of a dud there. The other thing that really bugged me was her 'listening to MP3's' while doing battling, OMG this is so stupid and so Hollywood. You mean to tell me that she's willing and capable to give up her sense of hearing while fighting vampires, just to appear cool? Give me a friggin break. So unrealistic? Who ever thought up that idea should be shot, hanged, have there ears ripped off and never allowed to work in Vampire movies again? Wesley Snipes played his role same as the first two, kicking ass throughout and having a bad attitude to boot. I wasn't impressed by any of the fight scenes, yeah some of the new weapons were semi cool, but overall the action was nothing new, and the cinematography was so quick and close up that you really couldn't make out the action very well. The end / climactic scene was also a dud, quite befitting for the rest of the movie I recon?I guess the other thing that bothered me about this movie was the fact that in the first two movies you get the impression that vampires are stronger, quicker and more durable that humans (hence the need for Blade), however in the 3rd movie you have Jessica Biel (who is human) as well as Ryan Reynolds (a previous vampire now cured / human) kicking ass all over vampire city. If this were really the case then vampires wouldn't pose much of a threat to begin with. So this aspect really bothered me as the vampires in this 3rd movie came off really weak and ordinary. They didn't come of mystical or powerful at all; even Drake wasn't impressive in the least. This had the net effect of stealing away some thunder from the Blade character as Blade actually gets rescued by his Nights stalker groupies rather than the other way around.Overall the movie was just okay and is much more light hearted than the first two movies, for that reason it may appeal to a wider audience, but in doing so it lost me as a hardcore vampire fan. I couldn't take this movie seriously as the comedy aspect kept pushing through. Unfortunately when you mix Vampires with too much comedy you get crap for a result. Vampires are better suited for horror / suspense movies rather than this 'Hollywood / Please all' crap. Kind of a bummer?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, I have to admit to being really quite disappointed with this instalment of the Blade series. Two days after watching the film I can barely remember much of it at all. The first two were exciting, with punchy dialogue, impressive villains and most importantly, a hero, the man himself, Blade.With Trinity we have no idea who this particular group of vampires are, their social standing, history, source of their power are all a mystery. They were just plonked in the film to raise the ultimate bad guy from his crypt and provide someone for Blade's latest sidekicks to pulverise-badly.And then we have the ultimate bad guy, Drake, who isn't remotely imposing, let alone terrifying. Big boots to fill and I really don't think this guy is up to it. I was looking forward to someone imposing, sadistic, gleefully evil in fact. I didn't get it. What this guy reminded me of was Ram-Man from He-Man, but less frightening to his enemies.The only reason I gave this film 4 and not 1 is for Hannibal King (Ryan Reynolds), who steals the show from Blade the second he comes on screen. While Blade potters through the film not saying or doing much that I can remember, apparently this is whats called "brooding", King manages to keep all eyes on him.King gets all the best camera shots AND lines. As far as I'm concerned this was his film and should have been a Blade spin-off and not another episode. Ryan Reynolds is far and away the star here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wesley Snipes can stand alone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The main problem with Blade:Trinity is that the director - for some odd reason - forgot that Wesley Snipes can hold his own. He was the reason people went and saw the first two movies. As Blade, he is the king of badass cool. Trinity was disappointing because they siphoned all of his humor off onto Hannibal, and he lost a lot of battle scenes to Abby. This was unnecessary. I didn't go to watch either of those actors try desperately. I went to watch Wesley Snipes as Blade. And then, casting decisions? Who chose Parker Posey to play a vamp? Who did her hair? What insanity was going on on the set? And why, why, why, why didn't Paul Levanesque take his shirt off? Come on. Waste of money, and that from a Blade sci-fi fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Destruction of a one-time promising franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember the excitement my friends and I felt leaving the theatre after seeing Blade I in the theatre years ago (for the 3rd time). I remember telling my brother that I haven't seen a hero kick this much ass in a film since the 80's. This film, along with "The Matrix" and Jackie Chan helped bring martial arts back to Hollywood. I remember leaving Blade II being disgusted by the acting by the acting Leonor Varela, but pleased to see Donnie Yen's fight choreography and to see Wesley Snipes' Blade kick even more ass this time around. Not as good a story as 1, but cool and violent nonetheless.But trinity...wow. I'm surprised that Blade didn't have nipples on his costume with the immediate decay of the quality of the franchise. The responsibility lies completely on David Goyer as he finally was given the chance to direct he series he has written since it's inception. This film felt like it should have been on Sci-Fi channel or FX. Those good old days of Blade kicking ass are gone, replaced by Jessica Biel and Ryan Reynolds beating down brittle MTV vampires that couldn't hold a candle to Stephen Dorff's Deacon Frost. I don't even remember seeing Blade fight Dracula, with all the action geared towards his new sidekicks. That's like a Batman movie with Robin as the star. David Goyer now says he'd like to direct Thor......comic fans around the world should now panic as to what he sets his sights on next.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent third showing for Blade, but nothing brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was never a big fan of the original 'Blade', but I liked the sequel a lot. Doing away with the story building of the first one, Blade II captured a nice balance between plot and action and it was an entertaining ride throughout. For this third instalment, however that perfect balance has been interrupted, and calling this film 'action heavy' would be an understatement. While the action in the movie is well done and entertaining to watch, when you've seen 45th bad guy being smashed through a window, it loses it's impact somewhat. The talking scenes in between the action are either small plot details that the film needs to string itself together, or just another action sequence set-up. The plot is messy to say the least, and there's far too much going on for it to be streamlined into an engaging and satisfying story, but nevertheless it follows the vampires as they resurrect legendary bloodsucker Dracula and get Blade into trouble with the cops. However, Blade manages to team up with a ragtag bunch of vampire hunters and together they attempt to thwart Dracula and the rest of the vampires! Oh, and the cops.David S. Goyer, the man who wrote the first two Blade films has taken the director's chair this time round. He's obviously being watching too much Mtv too, as he seems far too keen to not allow the audience to know what is going on. The quick style Mtv editing is abundant, and it quickly becomes apparent that you will end up very dizzy by the end of the film. The director/writer has dragged together an eclectic cast to compliment Wesley Snipes, which includes the sizzling Jessica Biel, along with two more experienced actresses who should know better; Parker Posey and Natasha Lyonne, and Kris Kristofferson returns also; and WWF wrestler Triple H joins in the fun too. Wesley Snipes has made his name playing the human/vampire hybrid in this comic strip movie series, and with this performance he seems like an actor bored with his work. Whether or not that's because of the extremely thin caricature that Snipes has been given to work with this time round, or maybe it's because he's fed up of 'more of the same'. Anyway, Blade Trinity is quality entertainment. What it lacks in depth, it makes up for in coolness and action and if you liked the first two, you might as well see this one as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a seriously poor film... and I don't know where to start. The product placement of the i-pod? The fact that the production wants you to call Dracula Drake (in a hip move that makes you think of comics and naming conventions over the fact the guy is called Dracula!)? The stupid on-foot chase between Blade and Drake? The fact Whistler is beaten by the Feds, when he survived Vamps? The inappropriate comedy? The stupid blind woman? The fact Drake was just resting, wasn't in a tomb at all, and woke up when he chose to? The crapness of the script? The poor introduction of Whistler's daughter? The lack of tension? The horrendous ending?I can't go on... please kill me. I knew I should have seen Polar Express.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Blade: Trinity. 2004 New Line Cinema. Review: So, it's come to this. The last installment of Blade. Look up the word messy and Blade: Trinity will be seen as the perfect example of messy. This film is a total disaster. Let's go with pros and cons to sum things up.Pros: Wesley Snipes returns as Blade.Cons: Snipes looks embarrassed here.Pros: Jessica Biel is here. Great eye candy. Cons: Biel's character seems like filler than an actual person. Pros: Ryan Reynolds put on some serious weight. Cons: Reynolds can't fight at all.Pros: Triple H is here. His lines are delivered well and steals the show. Cons: Triple H is not used well here. No character development as well. Pros: The bad guy is Dracula.Cons: Casting of Dracula (or Drake) is terrible. Horrible actor. Character development is awful, and seems to be here just to fight Blade. Pros: Blade's mentor Whistler is back. Major Spoiler****Cons: Whistler is dispatched quickly. If you looked away for a second, you would miss the death scene. Worse yet, Whistler is killed by human police officers, and kills a bunch of them beforehand. Pros: Blade's muscle car is back.Cons: I'm running out of pros. Pros: Vampire dogs (it's original). Cons: Triple H and Wesley Snipes, the only two in this movie who know how to fight, do NOT fight in one-on-one combat. Instead HHH has to fight Reynolds. What's the point?!Cons: A human Reynolds defeats a Vampire HHH. So very wrong. Cons: Dracula wore gold chains here. Cons: Jessica Biel listens to her Ipod while hunting vamps. Lame.Cons: Triple H should have played Dracula. Cons: The night stalkers. Who? Should I care? No. Next. Cons: The blind woman that can read computer monitors??? Cons: Dracula talks of honor, but threatens to kill a newborn baby earlier. Cons: Dracula ran away from Blade. Why? Cons: The vamps bite like reapers from Blade two and no explanation as to how. Cons: HHH aside, the rest of the evil vamps are like MTV rejects, and are not menacing at all. Just annoying. Cons: Blade is in no real danger throughout this movie. Cons: A terrible way to end a good movie franchise. Ouch.The Last Word: Poor Blade. This is indeed the stake driven though Blade's heart. This is easily one of the worst of the year, or the decade. I'll stick with the latter. Skip it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well, it certainly was something...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whether it be intentionally or incidentally writer/director David S. Goyer succeeds in amalgamating the visual style of the two previous Blade films by making Blade: Trinity a sleek but raw actioner.The problem is Blade is not an action franchise. It's a vampire franchise. Both Guillermo del Toro and Stephen Norrington understood this. Vampires can be sexy, scary, enticing, and downright brutal, all at the same time. But the vampires in Blade: Trinity are sissies. They're pissy, corny, spent, and essentially useless. They're not sexy, scary, or smart. They're just boring. And thus, there is no sense of horror, or danger, or urgency, or mystery. You never wonder if Blade will come out on top. You know he will and you can pretty much guess how before it happens.Snipes' kung-fu-movieesque silent hero routine has grown tired. His character in this film lacks any real depth or complexity. Snipes is utterly boring unless he's kicking the crap out of someone, or at least threatening to.Instead of developing the characters he already has Goyer keeps introducing new ones. Much like in the previous film, Blade soon finds himself surrounded by a new group of allies to whom his disdains. But instead of vampires, this time around it's a bunch of wise cracking teenagers. Each one more clichéd and uninteresting than the next.And what should have been the highlight of the film, Goyer also manages to ruin. Through some broad stroke of banality Goyer even succeeds in making Dracula, the most favored and well known vampire in the history of literature and cinema, completely dull.Goyer implements too many different and contradictory ideas into a single film. And the result is a film that's visually impressive but narratively clunky. Many of Goyer's ideas, while contrived, aren't that bad. I mean. A group of wise cracking teenage vampire hunters isn't a bad idea. It might work as it's own film but it simply doesn't work in the context of the Blade universe.Despite enthusiastic performances by much of the cast and Wesley Snipes' strong presence Blade: Trinity fails due to underdeveloped characters and an unfocused plot. Lackluster writing and directing aside, this film still looks really, really good. Apparently the only people who really brought their A-game are cinematographer Gabriel Beristain, the entire art department, and visual effects team. Kudos to them all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, it's official.. Blade III sucks! I can't believe how someone with a normal brain efficiency could create something so awful from the excellent movie/character Blade.When is Hollywood gonna learn that the heroes don't have to be cool in every single scene? That it's OK if the good guys don't have the right haircuts in a few scenes? That cool fighting is much better than fighting cool? That there's no chance that a woman so beautiful like J. Biel could ever kick someone's ass while wearing that kind of sexy (thus really tight) clothing? Damn, I hate going to a movie and just seeing a bunch of attractive women or men handling very unrealistic weapons and with no reasonable plot at all (and no character density for that matters, but it's a detail since it's an action movie).But the thing that really really pisses me off is: why, why does the hero always has to be cool in every single shot? Why, in a middle of a gunfight or while escaping from some wretched fortress, the hero always has a scene where he just walks like he owns the place? Unrealistic at best and just pathetic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doesn't suck or bite, but it's still uneven.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I had some issues with the pacing, plotting and framing of Blade: Trinity, I still thought that this movie was fun to watch. I think the only real problem is that Trinity was slated to be the final film, and writer/director David Goyer seemed to have crammed two movies worth of material into one. I think New Line was a bit hasty in selling this as the final movie and he buckled under the pressure.There are some neat action scenes, but I would have preferred the Dracula/Blade fight to not have been intercut by Van Wilder's fight with Triple H. There was never any real characterization in the first two Blade movies so don't expect anything here, either. Back story is actually back-seated, with the exception of following up on the opening scene in the first movie.Blade: Trinity was more fun and humorous than the first two, but it certainly doesn't measure up in quality. We certainly needed more of Blade than Abigail or King.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who came up with this awful mess? Goyer? Hope he doesn't have much to do with any other Marvel movies coming out soon, or I won't be seeing them in theaters. Every part of this movie was awful. It's almost as if a child wrote it. The whole "back to the beginning" thing has been done so many times and this time was the worst that I have ever seen. This part of the storyline was especially disappointing, since I have always enjoyed the way the vampires existence was explained in the previous blade movies. Although, the acting wasn't stellar, I don't think they could be blamed for much. Seems like the majority of the blame falls on the writer/director. Character development was atrocious. Seemed like far too much time was given to unimportant characters .. Triple H .. and far too little on those characters around which the movie should have been centered.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty Good Action Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must say that going into seeing Blade: Trinity I was not expecting a masterpiece, I merely wanted to be entertained by this movie. With that said, it did a pretty decent job. People can criticize this film with having a thin plot, being corny at points, heck I know I will, but I don't think the makers were going for a great plot, and great acting, more along the lines of action/comedy and lots of fighting/explosions.The plot is this: a group of vampires bring back Dracula to help combat Blade, while they also get Blade to the top of the FBI's most wanted, now Blade needs help of his own, this comes from a group of new young vampire stalkers. These are not spoilers by the way, everything I say is included in the trailers. I must say that many times I was saying in this film "yeah right", but most of the time I was having a ball. I will say that one thing I found is that Blade: Trinity was less "dark" than the other two Blade movies, it just had a lighter feel to it. More comedy involved than before, which was nice because it was indeed funny, but I liked the atmosphere set by the other films that this one did not take.The newest additions, Ryan Renolds and Jessica Beil, do their jobs pretty well. I must say that Renolds had me laughing almost any time he was on screen. Beil was very nice to look at, she is just incredibly beautiful, and she does well considering the lines she is given. Paul Levesque, better known as Triple H makes a decent debut, I guess. He had some funny parts, but really I can't see how his job was that hard considering his role was to beat people up, and that's what he gets paid to do for the WWE so it's not a real stretch. Well overall the supporting cast did a good job and kept me entertained.On to the meat and potatoes of this movie, the fights. Much of the work was very well done in this film, Snipes is his usual acrobatic self and disposes of vampires in interesting ways while showing off his martial arts skills. Here is a part I didn't like, the fighting involving Ryan Renolds, at times he tries to be like Snipes, and it just doesn't work. I always say, if the actor doesn't know martial arts, don't make him try to pretend, it's just not the same. Beil did some nice fight scenes to. Triple H, well his fights were good, but I see it too much in the ring to really enjoy it, the whole time I was thinking in my head, "now when's he going to break out a pedigree ?", well that moment never came. The gun fights were really well done, and I thoroughly enjoyed them. Overall Blade: Trinity had awesome fight scenes.So that pretty much sums up my feelings of this film. It was a fun movie to watch just for the action, and comedy of Renolds, but not much else (did I mention Jessica Beil was very beautiful). I will say that out of the three Blade movies, this is my least favorite, but I still like it and recommend it to anybody looking for a good action movie, die-hard fans of the series will probably be conflicted with it. My rating is 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disappointing conclusion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Blade and Blade II were movies that were mostly visual masterpieces which thrived on the atmosphere; Blade II more than I. Quick transitions, scenes that mostly had only one predominant color. The Blue of the Ninja type fight, the amber of the night scenes, the red of the Moo Cow Factory where Blade and Whistler were finally reunited. Blade was to be a great modern vampire epic, where they were no longer regarded as immortal undead beings that were warded by celestial tokens and pure substances like water but rather as a recessive niche of humans that is either blessed or cursed by genetic defects that cause severe allergies to garlic, silver and sunlight. Blade II was a great second installment because it was dark, it was moody, the atmosphere was pressing, the story was good and the concept artists really did their best at it.Honestly, Blade III contains way too much sunlight, tries to be overly funny with one character that tries to crack jokes around every corner of the film, hopelessly tries to renew the legend that started the entire Vampire hype and in the process turns it to a story and an antagonist that are both too stupid to believe, honestly. Okay, I have to admit that Hannibal was funny now and then, but that's not what I watched this movie for. Drake, however, was the worst thing that could happen to this movie. His acting was completely dead and the story of his insurrection was completely far-fetched. And honestly, who would believe a man that is supposed to be the first born of all vampires, threatening to throw a baby off the side of a building, yet later when the final duel arrives, would speak of honor? His character almost seemed to be put together at the last stroke to form an inconsistent whole. Deacon Frost from the first movie on the other hand had no honor, so he had no problem with throwing a young Chinese girl in front of a bus, but then again he was exactly who he was supposed to be, an atrocious, power hungry little thug....In the first movie, Blade was a Vigilante with nothing to lose, a tainted soul with no way out other than killing or dying. In the second, after he had overcome the obstruction of not knowing who bit his mother, he learned to look further than his hate by secretly falling in love with one of his greatest enemies. In Blade Trinity, he is no longer the stoic, silent samurai he is supposed to be, but he tries to be - or is asked to be - too many things at the same time. Even in the aftermath of his best friend's death, he still tries to be too witty, too much of a drill instructor and he can barely relate to the new appendage to the vampire slaying team.Speaking of whistler's death; when he died in Blade I, which I think to be an admirable scene full of gravity and persuasion, in Blade III, you would miss it if you'd blink. His abrupt death in Trinity does both Blade I and II injustice, since they took all this trouble to get him back in the story only to let him die without any reverence.I have heard many things about this movie being extremely action packing, however most of the time, action, and I mean real action, is far away. In Blade II, the introduction to the main character was an excellent opening scene, Trinity's introduction was dull compared to that. I agree that on more than one occasion, the soundtrack was better and I am glad that the old Dodge Charger got more moments in this third movie. Admitted that it barely ran in Blade II, this little fact does not vouch for the conclusion. Trinity's ending battle between protagonist Blade and antagonist Drake was also extremely lacking, to say the least. All the fighting scenes in Blade II were superior than those in Blade III, except one or two that I really like better.The styling of Blade: Trinity was atrocious, in many ways. I cannot overlook how they have ruined blade's armor and gave him a pansy vest. Some of the new toys were interesting, but at the same time, some were far fetched and completely obsolete and I dearly missed the UV detonators from Blade II. There were little moments that incorporated special effects, but most of those were very disappointing.Guillermo del Toro said in his DVD commentary that he was very optimistic about what David S. Goyer would do when he gets his hands on Trinity, but, my conclusion is that when del Toro declined to do number three, he condemned it to a horrid fate. I'm actually surprised that it showed in TheatersI do not recommend this movie to anyone but the die hard Marvel/Vampire aficionado.** out of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blade: Trinity (2004) Defending an Underrated Sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't understand the complains and hate about Blade: Trinity a very underrated sequel to the success of the previous two movies. The first and second movie are awesome sci-fi action flicks.I read so many negative reviews how the fans and critics dissed this film and how are disappointed with this flick. I love it. I am not gonna say is the best movie, it is not but It' is a pretty good movie a worth of a watch an awesome underrated sequel. Blade: Trinity rocks! I am a fan of all Blade movies. Before this movie come out I kept watching Blade I &amp; II. It was been 7.years when I finally download and watch this movie, today I watch it on Blu-ray and Blade third installment rocks. Blade: Trinity is rated R! RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR not PG-13 It Is violent, action gore adrenaline sci-fi flick not for kids. I can't believe how Robocop (2014) remake is praised from fans and critics but Blade get's dissed and bashed from critics it is just not fair!My Reply and answer to a negative reviewer: "I didn't pay to see Jessica Biel (hottest body in Hollywood) fake fight. Who cares about Whistler's daughter?"........ Jessica Biel did a good job, with weapons, shooting bow and arrow and the fights she wasn't annoying and I honestly didn't see or noticed her hottest body, I was following the story. I don't know what is your problem? The third installment of Blade is very decent movie! "Why is Wesley Snipes sharing screen time with Ryan Reynolds and Jessica Biel? Who cares about Hannibal King? I paid to see Blade kick butt, just like in Blade 1 and 2. I didn't pay to see Ryan Reynolds joke for half the film."............ Why wouldn't he be? Wesley Snipes shared screen time with other actor and actress in Blade I &amp; II and other his movies. So why wouldn't he shared screen time with Ryan Reynolds and Jessica Biel? Wesley Snipes, Ryan Reynolds and Jessica Biel did a wonderful decent good job as a trio team that is why it is called Blade: Trinity! Blade did kick butt!!!! In the beginning he kicked ass of the vampires and kill them, he beat up the SWAT team, he fought in a sword fight with Dracula, well sorry Abigail helped him to kill Dracula so whatever! They don't make movies like this one today! I wish I would had sci-fi action movies like are this one today!! I really wish! I wanna see Blade again in action. Green Lantern get's hate and so does Blade: Trinity. I like action movies I really do and I really wish I could get action movies like are this one. It is 2015 and I haven't see any good sci-fi action movie like is this one today!!! They don't make them like that anymore!!! Blade saved a baby and he also talked to the little girl.Dracula was played from Dominic Purcell who also started in my favorite TV Show of all time Prison Break. Patton Oswalt from King of Queens was also in it. Here we have a fights, a little origins of Dracula the first and original vampire. Jessica Biel's fight, Ryan Reynolds so muscular in here and he fights pretty well. Also I don't care about the jokes he is telling as long he acts they way he supposed to do. Jessica Beil was so much better with Bow and arrow shooting the Vampires like Sylvester Stallone did in 1985 Rambo: First Blood Part II, she was so much better shooter with bow and arrow than Jennifer Lawrence in The Hunger Games is! She was so much better with using weapons than Jennifer Lawrence does! Blade shoots and kills and kick's the vampires. He use his particular hand guns and his other silver weapons. We have a great music themes and soundtracks! I know that while filming this movie there was a lot of problems between Wesley Snipes and David S. Goyer. That Wesley suffered from a mental breakdown and often would not come out of his trailer, he would only respond to the name 'Blade', and if he communicated with anyone, it would be via post-it notes. 'Ryan Reynolds' corroborated this while promoting the film. Saying that Snipes would ignore the entire cast but once acknowledged Reynolds by saying "Keep your mouth shut. You'll live longer." Still Blade: Trinity is pretty good damn sequel and that a good one, I love it very much. I love all three movies and I wish that there would be another sequel after this film. I don't get why people are bashing this movie so much? Underworld got three sequels and Blade only two but not three or four? I know Wesley Snipes and Kris Kristofferson were disappointed with the script and with the movie. But honestly it was a pretty damn good entertainment, I wasn't bored with it. Robocop 2 (1990), Spider-Man 3 (2007), Predator 2 (1990) and Kick-Ass 2 (2013) are getting so much hate and bashed this days for it. I still love them all. My best Blade movie would honestly be Blade II, I enjoyed the fights than is Blade I and Than Blade: Trinity.Anyway , it's a good continuation of Blade's story.There is nothing new here , but it's well executed. In the end it's one of those rare satisfying sequels. I give it 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blade: Trinity!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Blade: Trinity is a very good film that has a good cast which includes Wesley Snipes, Kris Kristofferson, Dominic Purcell, Jessica Biel, Ryan Reynolds, Parker Posey, Mark Berry, John Michael Higgins, Callum Keith Rennie, Paul Michael Levesque, Paul Anthony, Françoise Yip, Michael Rawlins, James Remar, Natasha Lyonne, Haili Page, Patton Oswalt, Ron Selmour, Christopher Heyerdahl, and Eric Bogosian! The acting by all of these actors is very good. Snipes is really excellent in this film. I thought that he performed good as usual. Purcell really surprised Me! I hope he'll be in some more action and horror pictures in the future. Biel was really terrific here. I was really amazed by her performance. I would like to see her in more action films as well. Reynolds was good. Posey and Lyonne were really good. I was surprised that Paul Michael Levesque AKA WWE's HHH or Hunter Hearst Helmsley was in this film. Having followed his WCW days as Terra Ryzing until recently it was wired to see another top wrestling is a big budget film. To Me he actually was pretty good and quite hilarious. I think in the future if he decides to be in more movies that he'll play very good characters and even in leading roles like fellow wrestlers The Rock and Hulk Hogan. Remar and Bogosian were very good as well. There are a few scenes that I thought were cool. The interview Bogosian did was really cool. The fight scenes in the very beginning were also very cool. I loved the police station scenes and how Snipes says Vampires exist and gives the scare to the shrink! Also cool camera following Blade in the police station as well! Just awesome! The thrills and action is really good and some of it is surprising. The Dracula character was really remarkable. In his monster form he reminded Me a lot of Imhotep from the MuMmy and the MuMmy Returns! The special effects are great! The movie is filmed very good. The music is great by Ramin Djawadi and The RZA. Great directing by David S. Goyer. The film is quite interesting and the movie really keeps you going until the end. This is a very good and thrilling film. If you like Wesley Snipes, Kris Kristofferson, Dominic Purcell, Jessica Biel, Ryan Reynolds, Parker Posey, Mark Berry, John Michael Higgins, Callum Keith Rennie, Paul Michael Levesque (WWE's HHH), James Remar, Natasha Lyonne, Eric Bogosian, the rest of the cast in the film, The other Blade movies, Horror, Action, Adventure, Thrillers, Fantasy, Comic, and interesting films then I strongly recommend you to see this film today! Movie Nuttball's NOTE: On the second DVD in the Blade: Trinity case there is a special nearly two hour making of the third Blade movie. It shows how the music, special effects, fighting, sound, and everything else was done by the actors and crew. Biel and Reynolds talk about a possible spin off movie called 'The Nightstalkers'. I wouldn't mind that and I certainly wouldn't mind another Blade film. In one of the other segments Jessica Biel talks about how hard she had to train and how difficult it was. She done her very best to make you happy. Snipes and Purcell fought the fight you wanted! The director tried to make this the most explosive vampire film ever seen for you and yet you people still complain! Thanks for reading!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh poor, poor Blade, one of the most underrated and under-appreciated comic book heroes finds some success with his big screen debut, "Blade" (1998) only for it to be followed by a sub par "Blade II" and then this catastrophic debacle of a film. To even consider this movie to be a "bomb" would be giving it more praise than it's worth, since "bomb" can be used in a positive meaning (i.e. it's da bomb). This film truly is a total pile of trash, a pile so trashy, not even the most desolate bum would eat from it. The main problem here with this cinematic nightmare, is the storyline is just plain goofy, at times too goofy. After twenty minutes or we find that Blade must again don his cool leather jacket and dark shades and face off against the evil forces once again. Let me take this sentence to say this, I think that Snipes is a total bad ass in all three Blade films, the final battle he has against Deacon Frost in the first Blade movie is one of my favorite fight scenes of all time. This film fails to carry such excitement, and instead, we are left with fight after fight of basically the same redundant fighting moves (stake through the heart, burn up the vampire, etc). Snipes does his best to carry this movie, but its just the writing is so bad. The greatest problem with this film is the ensemble cast, composed primarily of American Pie and Van Wilder rejects. Here's the rundown of their performances: Jessica Biel is hot yet she can't act to save her life. Ryan Reynolds (sheesh) boy what a mistake givin this guy a shot at fame, he basically ruins this movie with his smart-ass, or actually dumb-ass antics. Parker Posey does pretty good as the main villain even though as the movie goes on you see less and less of her (which isn't a bad thing). Finally, Triple H who basically brings his wrestling persona to his role, as well as some of his wrestling moves, does OK as the tough bad guy, although he would be better as say a tough evil Bond henchmen. Anyway, the storyline revolves around the vampires bringing back Dracula (Bram Stoker is turning in his grave I'm sure) and once they do Dracula will try and take over the world. Eventually, Blade and the rest of the gang, track down the evil vampires and a huge climactic battle ensues, which pales in comparison to the final battle from the original Blade movie. So there you have it, if you're the biggest Blade fan of all time, I recommend you still pass on this movie, and instead watch the first Blade movie on DVD or whenever TNT reruns it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of the three movies this one was amazing. The reason is it showed again that when put up against immense odds with the world seemingly against him as well Blade is able to stay true to his call. The thought process behind sequel is you have Blade doing what he does best and that is simply kill Vampires. But unlike the last film he isn't teaming up with foes to stop a new hybrid but rather he is up against the first of their kind. The integration of the other vampire hunter cells and their support tied nicely into the movie and gave Blade a viable new source to work with against seemingly insurmountable odds. The movement of the story didn't leave to many blank spots, gaps, or anything of the sort therefore it wasn't difficult to follow the story line. Now I am certain that there are always going to be areas that could've been improved on, but overall this movie had great action scenes with all the relevant characters, fantastic and very clear story line, and also what makes a hero a hero, the ability to stand against the odds and Blade is definitely a hero. This was a great follow up and highly recommended to any and all who like action hero movies, you will not be disappointed.Peace, Love, and All That Other Good Stuff, Dave....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welcome Jessica and Ryan!SPOILER</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Blade:Trinity is one of the exciting movie in 2004. This time, Jessica Biel and Ryan Reynolds join the cast to fight off the Daddy of the vampire, Dracula. Wesley delivers the same Blade as usual, but this time, more action and less drama on him.The action on him is so great that it can be compared to Alice in Resident Evil:Apocalypse and The Bride in Kill Bill: vol 1. It seems that the movie has planned too much on the action, that the audience does not see too much drama that should have been on Blade himself.The movie introduces Jessica Biel in a dark subway scene where it is entertaining and the fighting is beautiful but it only serves as a functional scene for Jessica to show her fight;maybe they could have planned a better scene to introduce her. Ryan Reynolds' entrance is awkward too. But we soon forget how senseless it is by a sequence of fighting and camera work that leaves the audience no time to think. And, this is nicely done by the director.The plot builds up so quickly and so tight that it has not been a movie like that for a long time. Blade Trinity is better than the first and second; especially after the joining of Jessica and Ryan. They make the movie more watchable and different form the first two. The ending is somehow well-done, but considered as a trilogy, it lacks the impact it should have and we just leave the cinema remembering only a 2 hour fighting.Parker Posey is fully transformed in her role as Danica that can almost compare to "Best Villain" Lucy Liu in Kill Bill, however her role lacks the power and calmness she should have. Dominic Purcell as Drake is somehow strangely dry. For example, he is asked to kill Blade but then he ran for 5 minutes away from him.That does not make sense to me. The fighting of the last scene between Drake and Blade should be more tense and not as simple as it is now. The visual throughout the movie is excellent, though.To conclude: Blade becomes cooler, Jessica is hot and Ryan is hilarious and surely an eye-candy. We hope to see them in the next Blade, if there is one. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blade what?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was sort of unhappy about the use of the Dracula character. Why use him. I felt like this was Goyers only chance to make something of the movies he's written by directing it himself. And sadly for him it wasn't done well. I think that his thoughts were too broadly spent to look at the whole picture to see if it all worked out. There were way too many holes in the plot to make it easy to believe.When there is the chance to doubt the actions of our society in the fictional scenario as viewers it is all to easy to dismiss the whole story. Like when cops with guns wait to shoot their targets until the $500.00 used car drives in to drive off with the Heroes. Or how a band of misfits can pool resources to fund a high tech bio/weapons facility unknown to us. That is where the movies loses me.Snipes was Blade as he was in all three movies. But this wasn't about Blade it was about too many other things.I did however like Ryan Reynolds in him. Talk about Van Wilder: Vampire Hunter. That should have been the title of the Movie. He was the same character as he was then, and I found him just as funny.All in all, it didn't live up to the first two. And Goyer will sadly pay for it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Honestly I liked this movie. A lot. Was it better than the first two??... No it wasn't; however, it was still a good movie. I liked the new characters and actors. Let's be honest. Nothing will be as good as the first two blades were. The actor who played Dracula, I cannot remember his name at the moment, is one of my favorite actors. Yes I don't think it was right that Wesley Snipes had the extra actors in there because he can hold his own but it was nice to see new people. I remember going out in renting this movie on on DVD and I absolutely loved it when I saw it. I was only 12 when blade Trinity came out. It's still a good action movie, and has a lot of funny dialogue between the characters. The last fight scene between Dracula and Blade was very funny and had a lot of action in it. Overall I give this movie an 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fine ending to the series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When it becomes apparent that staying in the shadows while engaging in the war with the vampires might be impossible, Blade forms an alliance with a motley crew of hunters to battle his largest and most dangerous enemy yet.There was a lot to really like with this one. The main thing to like here is similar to what worked so well in the previous entry, the fact that the majority of time this one plays up as an action movie so there's a ton of impressive scenes here. The opening warehouse assault is quite impressive and offers an explosive opening dealing with the fleeing vampires and leads into the full-throttle car-chase that ends up starting this very well, the FBI raid on the hideout to capture him or the great fun of the resulting rescue attempt as there's a fine flurry of explosive gun-play and shootouts to go along with the hand-to-hand brawling which gives this one some really enjoyable scenes. The later hunting scenes of the group going out for their individual stalking scenes and getting their information gets some nice action as well, and the utter fun of the foot-chase through the city streets in broad daylight culminating with mad racing through the apartment complexes that causes this to come off as fun. Still, the biggest scene here is the finale which is the incredibly fun and exciting raid on the vampire hideout, which has a ton of action in the actual brawling and beating before the break-in and tactual rescue forcing the long-winded series of brawls, gunfights and weaponry tactics throughout the building as everyone involved gets plenty of time to shine battling against the vampires while setting up the showdown fight at the end. This is a really impressive scene that goes from a high-flying sword-fight to letting them throw each other around with superhuman abilities and finally down to a great hand-to-hand brawl which gives this one such a fine pace here that comes from all this action. Along with this action, there's a rather enjoyable series of story lines here that gives this a really strong feel, from the vampires setting him up with the authorities, the appearance of the hunters coming to rescue him, the plans for the vampire plague and even their version of a harvestable blood bank all come together here to keep this moving along just right. Combined with the violence and gore, these here hold this nicely for the few minor flaws here. The main issue here is the fact that the main villain isn't really all that threatening here as there's really only one true scene here that gives us any real reason to fear him while he trends to spend the majority of the time here giving grandiose speeches about his reign and history through the ages instead, and it really makes it hard to feel fear for the main villain in such a manner. As well, there's also a pretty big flaw here in how much comedy is here, as not only is the introduction of it at this stage of the franchise slightly curious to being with but most troubling about it is the widespread use. The sarcastic quips aren't so bad, but much of the other comments here come off as trying too hard to be funny when it really isn't and really tends to make this too hit-or-miss to be consistently funny. Again, there's some troublesome CGI, but overall this ends the series on a fine note.Rated R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language.</fullReview>

I was surprised to see Patton Oswald in the movie though. He is such a smarmy little butt head in his stand up and a lot of his characters.

		<fullReview>After the stunning "Blade 2", one can only expect the same greatness for the third film. Too bad this isn't the case. Seeing as he's written so many great screenplays and Guillermo del Toro was busy with "Hellboy", New Line Cinema and producer Peter Frankfurt actually agree that letting David S. Goyer direct his own film would be a good idea. Too bad that back fired. Where as the plot is nicely done, Goyer had no idea what he was doing. Blade looks tight, but the whole atmosphere is off. We get the same kind of villains we had in the first film plus a horrible score; there practically isn't one!! Most of the score is hip-hop and techno beats. Even though Blade is black, I'm sure audiences would've appreciated a traditional score. Not only that, the action looks like I'm watching a Steven Segal/Matrix movie that just so happen to involve vampires.And, as much as I like Ryan Reynolds, don't get me wrong, there was too much humor in my opinion. One of the few positive notes was that we got a nice shot of Jessica Biel's ass. End of story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining but a let down in general</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first 2 Blade movies were excellent , it showed a war going on followed by the way we are taken into the war. However the layout was perfect for the third instalment in which we are taken against the Father of them all , Dracula. Unfortunalty Blade Trinty builds its-self up to be a little too big and thusly just falls down. The first big problem is the script and although I am aware it is a comic book movie , it just feels a little too superficial and thusly not very engaging. Be aware also that there are several plot holes in the movie which all go unanswered and Ryan Reynolds was a not THAT funny and lets hope his take on Deadpool is better! Wesley Snipes does a little more talking this time round but it feels with that he has lost that bad ass edge that made him Blade. Dominic Purcell was not the correct choice to play Dracula and although he looked as if he had tried , he was just given so little to play with that the interesting character that is Dracula ...just well seemed rather dull. On the plus sides , Jessica Biel was excellent , along with some excellent weaponry and action sequences which made this enteratinting and Triple H was fairly amusing as well although it felt like he was acting like a 14 year old with the insult he threw about. To some it up Blade: Trinty should of been the best one in the series but due to its very apparent problems it just goes out on a low, its not a complete waste of time and thusly I do recommend renting it.BLADE:TRINIY - 7.8 OUT OF 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a mindless entertaining sequel at best, that's nowhere near as good as the 1st two, the performances are fun though!. All the characters are cool enough, and the story while brainless is decent fun, plus Wesley Snipes is simply amazing in this!. It's got some entertaining fight scenes and Triple H while not a very good actor was amusing to watch, plus Ryan Reynolds and Jessica Biel added some great support in my opinion!. It's fairly well made, but the script isn't all that great, and there are lots of plot holes (like why didn't Danica(Posey) bite Reynolds when she got the chance, and I thought Parker Posey and Dominic Purcell played great villains, however the story is nowhere near as interesting as the 1st two!. I really found the whole psychotic bit annoying and unnecessary, and what also hurt the film was the lack of violence as PG13 didn't help matters, plus the ending leaves the possibility of yet another sequel in my eyes. You should be able to enjoy it if you put your brain at the door, and Wesley was bad ass as always, plus The final fight between Blade and Drake was good. This is a mindless entertaining sequel at best, that's nowhere near as good as the 1st two, the performances are fun though, and I say it's well worth the watch!. The Direction is OK. David S. Goyer does an OK job here with OK camera work, great angles some cool visual stuff and other flashy stuff, and the pace is good, however it could have been a lot better. The Acting is actually quite good for the most part. Wesley Snipes is amazing as always and is amazing here, while he isn't all that likable in this one, I could see why due to Whistler's death, still he kicked that ass, and took no bull crap, however at times he did look bored. (Snipes Rules!!!!!!!). Kris Kristofferson is OK with his grumpy old timer shtick but is hardly on screen, since he gets killed off quickly. Jessica Biel is incredibly gorgeous and does great in her role, she was extremely sexy, and kicked that ass, and was entertaining to watch, as she really surprised me with her fighting skills. Ryan Reynolds is very funny here and brought some much needed humor to the film, I loved him, this guy is seriously underrated in my opinion. Dominic Purcell and Parker Posey are both very good as the villains, and were fun to watch, I liked them. Paul Levesque is not a very good actor but was amusing to watch nonetheless since I am a huge WWE fan, he looked cool and had some nice moves, so yeah he was fun to watch if nothing else. James Remar and Natsha Lyonne are fine in there roles. Rest of the cast do alright. Overall well worth the watch!. *** out of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Canada Day celebrations haven't seen this many fireworks....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Marvel's mutant vampire hunter returns in this third installment of the series, and considering the plethora of vampires killed in recent movies, it's a wonder that any of the rapacious bloodsuckers still exist. But apparently they are still here wreaking their havoc, with only Blade (Wesley Snipes) and his mentor Whistler (an even more grizzled than usual Kris Kristofferson) around to stop them... This newest adventure has Blade pursuing none other than a resurrected Dracula (Dominic Purcell), now known as Drake and looking like a 1980's Goth rocker. Oh yeah, it seems that Drake was napping in a crypt in Iraq, making him the only weapon of mass destruction found there to date? funny!In Blade : Trinity, Blade finds himself being pursued by police, thus teaming with a tiny but earnest band of guerilla vampire-hunters who call themselves Night stalkers. They would have opted for the name "Care bears, but that was already taken", as the wisecracking Han Solo type named Hannibal King (Ryan Reynolds) put it. The group is led by Whistler's daughter, Abigail (Jessica Biel), who officially breaks out of the 7th Heaven leash after her shower scene. And finally, Sommerfield (Natasha Lyonne), a blind scientist working on a more permanent solution to the vampire problem. Their nemeses include a particularly strong-willed female vampire (Parker Posey, taking a break from earnest indie films), her cohorts (Callum Keith and WWE star Triple H), and about a billion 'n' a half vampires. Who seem to die at the drop of a silver bullet or the flash of an ultraviolet light, and their deaths are downright festive. They light up like golden x-rays, and then explode into a shower of sparks. Canada Day celebrations haven't seen this many fireworks in it's 135+ years of existence, what are we thinking? The ending suggests that there may be more "Blade" films, but the prospects seem far-fetched. After Dracula shows up in your vampire flick, is there anywhere else to go? This is by far the most humorous "Blade" flick, and it has surely topped the trio?</fullReview>

Posey is superb her character. eccentric, witty and quite amusing, making up for the main villain Drake played by Dominic Purcell who is very weak in his role, or as women might call it,he's not there to speak he's just man-candy. Renolds keeps those one liners coming, and Beil, well Beil just has a loverly bum, oh and her performance is very good also, given the material, She has proved her worth before in the superb Texas Chainsaw remake.Unfortunately blade is not the center of the film, which would have improved if he had been. Snipes created a great character that was focused and intimately portrayed in parts I and II. There was something very classy about Steven Norington's Blade and Gullumero Del Toro's Blade II, They where stylish, subtle, moody and very unique from each other. I can't blame snipes for being angry at Goyer and New Line, He made Blade his own and deserved to have his say on a director, considering he did have directors approval, What Goyer has done is created a hybrid of Norrington and Del Toro's Vision, he's also trying to tap into that MTV thing, which just isn't working. An entertaining feature, but not the grand operatic blade climax we where hoping for. If you ask me, i think Blade II was a pretty good finale to begin with, to me Blade Trinity is just a fun spin Off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Going out in a Blade of glory</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wesley Snipes returns as the hybrid mortal vampire for the highly entertaining third instalments of the vampire hunter series in Blade Trinity. What could possibly be done in this Blade movie that hasn't happened in the previous instalments? well make the biggest baddest vampire of them all as the main villain, Dracular (played by Dominic Purcell) or Drake as he goes by in the movie.Add a team of vampires that includes a WWE superstar and you'd think that this movie has to be a failure. Yet it ends up being a fantastic thrill rise from start to finish, although the movie does sag slightly in the middle. Blade (Snipes) now a target for the FBI, after being caught in an attempt to kill a Vampire who ended up being a human after all, is caught up in the conspiracy to evolve Vampires with the help of humans, or become Day Walkers as they put it.During an FBI raid, in which trusted sidekick Whistler is killed, Blade is arrested by non vampire believing agents who think he is crazy. after being caught by the FBI Blade is put through psychological tests by Dr Vance (John Micheal Higgins) who is actually out to help the vampires kill him. Blade seems likely to be killed by a team of Dracular worshipping vampires, that is until he gets help from an unlikely source, a team know as Night Stalkers lead by ex vampire Hannible King (Ryan Reynolds) and Whistler's estranged daughter Abigail (Jessica Beil).Hannible King (Reynolds) proves to be the comic relief, well tries to be anyway, adding as many but cheek and penis jokes as he can in his scenes. Abigail Whistler is the heroine in the movie as Beil puts in a top notch performance as almost the female version a Blade (without the half vampire part) and at times is almost Black Widow-esque, and Snipes is in top form as usually is the case.As for Dominic Purcell hes been given the hardest character of the movie to play in Drake/Dracular, which really makes him the weakest actor of the movie. Parker Posey, playing Vampire Donica Talos, ends up being a better villain than Dracular with her twisted take on the character. In the most surprising aspect of the lot Paul Levesque, better known as former WWE champion Triple H, almost does enough to steal the show as vampire Jarko Grimwood despite being a supporting character due to his mixture of physicality and comedy.All in all it leaves you feeling satisfied despite being called the weakest film in the franchise by many. With decent acting and a good script, there's not much to dislike about Blade Trinity, just try not comparing it to the movies that came before.Best quote: Hannibal King: "We call ourselves the Nightstalkers. " Blade: "Sounds like rejects from a Saturday morning cartoon." If you enjoyed watching:...Blade, Blade ll, Underworld...you'll enjoy watching Blade Trinity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blade not quite as sharp this time around.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The third outing for Blade (Wesley Snipes, still great in character but there are moments when it's clear that the off-screen tensions affected his performance/willingness to co-operate) sees him finally against the daddy of all vampires, Dracula himself (played by Dominic Purcell). To help him out this time around he has a group of young vampire slayers known as The Nightstalkers (with the focus being on Whistler's daughter ,played by Jessica Biel, and Hannibal King, played by Ryan Reynolds) but it's still a tall order and should make for Blade's toughest fight yet.Generally disliked by a lot of people, I have found that Blade: Trinity has grown on me with every viewing. It's far from perfect but certainly forms a decent instalment to end the trilogy on (if, as I hope, things do end with this one instead of trying to spin the concept off into new directions). The Nightstalkers may put off many people (including Snipes himself, who was disgruntled by the shift of focus away from his character in favour of the youngsters) but it's pleasing to my eyes to watch Jessica Biel kick ass and the one-liners thrown out by Ryan Reynolds are pretty funny so I don't mind them. Of course, those who dislike Ryan Reynolds anyway will find nothing here to win them over.Then there are the bad guys. Dracula is a bit of a wet blanket considering the infamous reputation he has and the fear he instils in his followers. Purcell is okay in the role but eminently forgettable. Much more memorable is the wonderful Parker Posey, vamped up and acting up and looking worryingly sexy with huge fangs. There's also Paul Levesque (known to wrestling fans as Triple H) who provides a great, menacing presence and the likes of the returning Kris Kristofferson, John Michael Higgins playing a slimy doc, there's Eric Bogosian, Natasha Lyonne and the ever watchable James Remar.The main flaw here is not so much the shift of focus towards the next generation of vampire slayers or even the slow pacing in between some decent action sequences. Having given it due consideration, I don't even think that David S. Goyer does that bad a job as a director although he could certainly have done more to maintain a good relationship with his leading man, in my opinion. Nope, the biggest problem this film has is it's main baddie. Dracula should be the biggest and nastiest threat that Blade ever has to face but is instead, as the movie shows, a moping, angry man who has to endure seeing cartoon versions of his stereotyped image over a variety of shoddy merchandise. Not really the towering mass of ultimate evil everyone was expecting, really.Never mind, there is still a lot here to enjoy. vampires are killed in inventive and entertaining ways, Reynolds cracks wise, Parker Posey is great, Jessica Biel . . . . . . wears tight jeans and Blade is still the baddest slayer on the block.See this if you like: Blade, Vamp, "Buffy The Vampire Slayer".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blade with Some Real Dimension!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This version of the Blade series is my favorite. In my personal opinion, it has a dimension of humor and character development that I felt was lacking in the others; which I did enjoy by the way. Parker Posey and Ryan Renolds are absolutely hilarious, and imparted a lightness to the otherwise brutal and predictable action. Renold's character, for all his adventurous intentions, is basically comic relief; and most entertaining. While Blade and Abigail are out fighting dozens of vampires, he ends up confronting the vampire Pomeranian and its friends. That is inspired humor, and worth the entire film for me. Renolds is a pleasant and unexpected character in this third Blade outing. And Parker Posy is flawless. It is not often of late that I am entertained so much in a film. Jessica Biel brought a level of earthy sensuality to the story that, in my opinion, no one else can. They did not give her much to say; but she can do a lot with a few words. Her intense beauty is another dimension that I love. And for me, she has an ability in physical acting that is second to none. Her fight scenes are thrilling. Her facial expressions and acting skills overall, are for me compelling. She is an actress who will get me to a film just because she is in it.I thought Dominic Purcell did an excellent job. He also had little to say, but he gave a powerful performance. I also enjoyed the brief performance by Erica Cerra, Blake's victim in the vampire store. I hope to see more of her. It is true that Wesley Snipes did not have quite enough to do in the film, in relation to the other two. But it is possible that without the added dimensions, this film probably would not have been made. He carried his role with his usual skills, and anchored the film as only he could. I am a long-time fan of his films. I have seen Blade Trinity several times, and I do not tire of its characters, action and dialog. If you like action and "monster" films, I recommend it.As always however, I must protest the incredible amount of foul language in the film. It is the one great flaws in it for me. When will directors learn that real words can carry much more meaning and impact than constantly repeated obscenities? There is certainly room in a film for some ribald expression without soaking the script in a constant flow of four letter words. Blade Trinity could have well stood on its own without them!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weakest of the trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some people claim that the first Blade film is responsible for the re-birth of the superhero genre (I personally think Bryan Singer X-Men really started it). But Blade I and II show a more adult, very violence action series can be critically and commercial successful. But Blade Trinity was a sad disappointed.The Vampire race are on their suffering with Blade's one man campaign against them. The Vampires take one despite message, they find the first vampire, the perfect vampire, Dracula, aka Drake (Dominic Purcell). As well as getting their savour, the Vampires also launch a PR campaign, making Blade (Wesley Snipes) kill a human, and use familiars in the FBI to capture him. But has a new set of allies, the Nightwalkers, including Abigail Whistler (Jessica Biel) and Hannibal King (Ryan Reynolds). They go on the hunt, to stop Drake and the vampires from taking over the world.The failure lays on David S. Goyer. He is a very talented writer, writing Blade and Blade II, and Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, but with Blade Trinity he was weighted down by his own ambition. With Blade and Blade II Goyer had to raise the streaks each time. This time he had to create the perfect vampire. The story line was weaker then the previous films. Goyer also took over in the director's chair. His inexperience shows, with too many stylist tricks, slows-motion, wooden performances and weak pacing. He sadly doesn't have the skill of Guillermo del Toro who directed Blade II. They were some silly set pieces, like in the beginning, with Blade driving a muscle car to stop vampires. The casting of the film was poor. Dominic Purcell had a good build, but that was all that was going for him. He lacked any menage that previous villains had. Jessica Biel looked good, she needs to work on her acting. The only two that were half-way good were Ryan Reynolds and Parker Posey but leads to another problem: there was too much comedy in the film. The previous films were treated the material pretty seriously, with only a few moments of comedy: Blade Trinity doesn't have the serious feel to it.There are still some fine action sequences so the film isn't a dead-lost, but it could have been a lot better.</fullReview>

I think a lot of people will enjoy this movie it does explain things even if you haven't seen the other two movies but i suggest that you do. Wesley snipes, Jessica Biel and Ryan Reynolds fit their characters perfect and so does the rest of the cast like Parker Posey she is pretty amazing in this movie. I'm a huge Blade fan and of all three movies id have to say this is the best one yet and I would hope they would consider to make another blade I know if they did it would be even better. Each time Wesley Snipes seems to amaze me more and more each time with these movies, hes a great actor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Blade: Trinity" marks Wesley Snipes' third appearance as the hippest, baddest and most well-dressed vampire killer this side of Roman Polanski. In the latest edition, Blade is forced to do battle with none other than the original Dracula himself, an ancient Sumerian bloodsucker who has just been freed from his tomb in the Iraqi desert. Has Blade finally met his match? "Blade: Trinity" starts off rather badly, threatening to become mired in those same repetitive shootouts and car chases that eventually ended up driving a stake through the heart of the unfortunate "Blade II." But after a rocky first half, the story finally kicks into gear, the characters become more fully defined, and the movie belatedly engages our interest. There's still too much time spent on action movie clichés and hardware, but what shows up in between makes the film worth watching. And that final showdown between Dracula and Blade is a lulu.</fullReview>

Not cheesy or overblown but, what's the right word?.....believeableandsocool! The only drawback was the feeling they needed to include the FBI in on the hunt for Blade. Where were they during those very public exchanges of gunshots and collateral destruction. I can't roll through a stop sign without attracting the heat, but the local PD and the FEDS can't seem to make it to the party on time. Nevertheless, this is real movie entertainment. Destined to be a classic in the Saturday Matinée genre. Don't miss it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What went wrong?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where the first two movies were great Blade Trinity is just sad. Was Wesley so expensive that all the other actors had to be some sitcom rejects? Now why did the movie suck so bad? If you examine David S. Goyers achievements as a director it all comes crystal clear. He's an amateur when it comes to directing movies. Of course being a novice isn't a valid excuse but being an amateur and a retard at the same time... This is what happens when you feed the pigs with caviar. If they ever make a Blade number four here's a thought: There are few of those with talent and lots of guys like Goyer and I'm sure hiring a talent isn't that expensive. What was with the casting? Jessica Biel, Ryan Reynolds... Is there a file somewhere that says: Cheap and Desperate..and untalented too.. So much pure badness in every aspect of the movie that it would take me a whole day just to find words for them in English. "Dracula looked like an Croatian bouncer" As it read in a review somewhere. Total waste of money and your precious time. A bad movie shortens your life more than few packs of cigarettes. ;)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jessica Biel is hot.... And thats about all there is to this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lets see how should I began... Besides the fact that this film introduces a new clan of vampire hunters that Blade who has been around the block a few times doesn't notice, the new enemies that decide to finally come out of hiding, or that Dracula, one of the most feared evils of all time, goes by the name Drake; Blade Trinity is a disappointment. With a better writer, director, and a much needed recasting this film could have been up to par with the previous films. Now don't get me wrong the story isn't THAT bad, with just a few tweaks it could've actually been good. Finally Blades enemies wise up and use a human as bait to catch Blade in the act of murder. Using the FBI to do the vampires' own dirty work, now doesn't that sound a little bit easier than spending years tinkering with the human/vampire genome to create a perfect race of vampires? The enemies also become more efficient with their feeding sources, instead of grabbing people off of the street the enemies use "blood farms" which harvest 100's of humans blood keeping the humans alive but brain dead. Now the entire film could have revolved around these two smarter deeds done by the vampires, perhaps Blade could find all of the "blood farms" and destroy them whilst he must avoid authorities from his capture and find a way to bring down the vampire nation, instead they bring in the lord of darkness himself, Dracula. Now when you see this film you will think otherwise, other than the fact Dracula is badly cast (Dominic Purcell), he really isn't needed, just as long as his other enemies were recast as well they could prove themselves far more formidable than Dracula, or "Drake" as they call him, was in this film. He first comes off as a bad-ass and just when you think its going somewhere he turns around and starts following orders for some new age vampire bitch. The final battle which was a complete and utter let down, lasted about five minutes when Blade and "Drake" both lose their weapons and start body slamming each for awhile. Than Drake turns into his original form which looks maybe a little frightening he than starts to dominate Blade, which was like "why didn't you just do that in the first place, I mean what was the deal with the swordplay?" The leader of the new age vampire enemies was a sassy chick played by Parker Posey who had an utterly ridiculous lisp throughout the film (maybe her fake vampire fangs were a bit too large). Posey played perhaps the most diabolical villain in the story (which isn't saying much for her or the rest of em') she was more or less the ring leader, collaborating with authorities to capture Blade (which was foiled by his new vampire hunter friends), resurrecting Dracula himself and making him hunt down Blade, and falling to the inevitable emblematic state most badly created villains do, trying to create THE PERFECT VAMPIRE, which is their main goal, as in the last film. Posey's main posse is her brother (Callum Rennie) and a bulky minion played by none other than professional wrestler Triple H, the other villains were insignificant serving no purpose but to look stylish and hip as the new age vampires. Blade's new friends or the "Nightstalkers" as they call themselves is mainly Abigail Whistler, played by the very beautiful Jessica Biel, and Hannibal King, played by Ryan Reynolds. The rest of the "Nighstalkers" meaning the people you saw maybe once or twice in the film, were of course the overweight virgin gadget man, the black driver that seemed to always find a nice and expensive ride for the clan, and last but not least the blind electronics/chemical/physics/whatever the hell else the writers think is at all plausible for a blind person to be an expert at. I mean don't get me wrong the blind are capable of lots of things, but come on a blind scientist, I mean really what the hell were you writers thinking??? Anyways, Jessica Biel plays Whistlers daughter, and is the quiet but deadly type. She wields this really cool looking light bow that can cut through vampires like butter but as cool as it looks its used like twice throughout the entire movie and for only two vampires which is a let down. Well she has another bow with some pretty cool upgraded arrows as well. She can kick some serious ass but when it comes to the scenes where she's not fighting she doesn't have much to say, in fact I think she has about 10 lines throughout the entire film and most of them are a few words at a time if not less. The person who really steals the show is the somewhat out of place Ryan Reynolds. With the constant one liner's and fart jokes, it makes you wonder whether this movie is actually supposed to be a comedy. The jokes get old and Reynolds becomes this obnoxious sidekick of Blades that you wish would just go back to National Lampoon films. All in all this film could have been better, if there were maybe a little more evenly distributed lines, a little less fart jokes, a complete recasting of the villains, better writing, more extended fight scenes, better editing, better characters (mainly just the blind scientist you've gotta be on crack to think of that or maybe it was a dying blind kids last wish, ya never know), the main reason - excuse me the only reason I gave this movie the ten out of ten was because of Jessica Biel, I really do think she's the hottest thing on the planet, I mean come on, that could be your selling point right there, a little less vampires, a lot more Jessica Biel. Hell, if movies keep coming out like this, maybe just Jessica Biel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing, but not bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Upon my first viewing of BLADE: TRINITY, I was disappointed to say the least. However, after watching it a second time, I found myself liking it a lot more. The problem was that I was expecting BLADE: TRINITY to be the best vampire movie of all time since David S. Goyer was both writing and directing it. Unfortunately, it didn't end up being the best vampire movie of all time. That's not saying that it's a bad movie. It's a fun, entertaining, and stylish picture that's a vast improvement over BLADE II, but the film suffers from action scenes that are over edited and a poor performance by Dominic Purcell as an underwritten Drake (Dracula). Still, I'd recommend it to fans of comic book movies as long as they don't expect too much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The BEST, of the worst</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Honestly, this movie is the worst movie that I have ever seen. Save yourself the $9 and don't go see it. If you still really feel the need to spend $9, go down to the hardware store, buy a hammer and hit yourself in the head repeatedly until the urge subsides. The movie is filled with horrible plot holes, UN-developed characters and one cliché after another. WWE Wrestler Triple-H seemed to be on the screen almost as much as Snipes, and didn't make things any more enjoyable with the canned delivery of "dialogue". The printed script and screenplay would have been much better suited for distribution to small children for use as drawing paper. I understand the strategy of product placement popular media. However this movie was horrible. The movie features countless plugs for Apple Computers.All of the computers used during the movie appeared to be Macs, and the Apple IPOD/ITUNES Software were also shown. I happen to be a recent convert to the digital music media world and Apple has a fair amount of market share. I can't see this terrible choice of a vehicle--showcasing their products helping them to increase sales/brand recognition. Then again, I did notice their products, and take the time to mention it. The best part of the movie was the ending, because well, it was the end...and not a moment too soon. In closing I can only hope that, in time, any memory of this movie will be erased from my mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sickening and unforgivable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing this film (after I was fairly hyped about it) I feel compelled to not only warn people about how disappointed they will be, but how sick they will feel. Never before have I seen such distasteful, amateur, pointless nonsense reach the screen (with perhaps the exception of Son of the Mask). How on earth David Goyer can write the original Blade (a fairly good film), and then write this is beyond me. Perhaps the film would have had a saving grace if a Director with some talent had taken the helm, but I fail to find one decent reason why this film was ever released - surely there must have been people to see what a disaster this was before they gave away the money for it to be made.In terms of Story, it's un-inventive at best and awfully clichéd at worst, character's fates are of no emotional involvement, Blade himself is off-screen most of the time (which perhaps is a good thing), the dialogue is cringe-worthy, and the Plot in general is unbelievably dire. Signs of Goyer's utter laziness lie all over this mess: the stereotypical Antagonists, the stagnant exposition, the pointless voice over, the clichéd twists, and to add insult to injury there is an unashamed product placement (which now I feel even the manufacturers are regretting).Things get worse with the Direction of the film - the brief but painful slow-motion sequences, introduction of characters, the overall design, the chief Antagonist. The consequences of these errors not only produces a film which is unforgivable (literally: I see no reason to expect any better from the people involved), but also make me doubtful of Goyer's other script: Batman Begins.David Goyer has destroyed what was a fresh take on a decent character, it has been reduced to a commercial machine, adding to the poisoning of today's cliché-ridden catalogue of films. He has shown blatant contempt for the franchise with his laziness and disrespect - my only hope is that Christopher Nolan can save Batman Begins from the same grotesque fate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, maybe I'm over-exaggerating but if there has ever been genius shown in a no-brainer action flick then surely this is the one!!! I wasn't really a massive fan of the Blade films and all that, but the first 2 were entertaining enough. But all that has changed now, I am now a proud, rabid Blade-head! Went to see Blade Trinity last night. It's succeeds in being almost as good as AvP, another one of the films of the year.It's amazing - like Blade meets Dawsons Creek meets Baywatch meets WWF. Think I am going to go back and see it again.It's really great to see that they decided to go with young, inexperienced actors for this one and that the main bad guy decides to act really badly - this helps to make the other actors stand out. He has to be one of the top screen bad-guys of all time - an unforgettable, understated performance by the magnificent Dominic Purcell as Dracula... did I hear someone say Oscar nomination....?Some not-that funny one liners by the young male vampire hunter detract from the plot and the action and the explosions and the cool CGI and stuff but some beautifully shameless plugs for ipod are worth the admission price alone;"What's she doing?" "Making up a playlist. She likes to listen to mp3s whilst she kicks a55."I also liked that bit where Blade said coochie coo to a baby, it was soooo funny - i nearly fell out my seat.Since they had all the cool explosions and fights and stuff they must've reckoned they didn't need to worry about a script much - it's a bold move and it pays off. And anyway it is really hard to concentrate on people speaking for long without explosions and stuff. The beauty of it was, cos of all the action and fire and explosions and stuff you don't really need to think about the storyline or pay attention much - the sign of a great director (and script writer).I really liked the bit where the blind woman died, it was really scary and moving. She was a really great character and it is a shame when she dies. I wish that she appeared in the film more - one of the great performances of recent cinematic history.... did I hear someone say Oscar nomination....? Some people in the cinema thought it was funny when she died but they are just sick. It is good how she has a daughter that gets kidnapped and then Blade and the team have to go and get her back, it brings the human element into the film and I couldn't believe it that they rescued her OK - totally unexpected! Somebody sitting next to me in the cinema wanted her to get killed off but i think they may have psychological problems.The only bad thing about this film is when it ends. With half an hour to go I was sitting in the cinema thinking "I hope this goes on forever"! What a film... did I hear someone say Oscar nomination....?I won't say too much about the little twist at the end but there is a little twist at the end.In conclusion run out to see this film as soon as you can!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awful, disgusting, repellent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That's exactly how I would sum up both this film and this whole year, in terms of what Hollywood has delivered. I am getting sick and tired of spending my valuable time and money on going to the cinema, only to be continually disappointed by poorly written, low budget garbage.I had hoped that following a long year of terrible, terrible films, Blade Trinity would save the day in December, how wrong I was.Hannibal was played by Chandler from friends, Blade seems to be more Eddie Murphy/Chris Rock (not the best of either, think Vampire in Brooklyn and Down to Earth) Abigail Whistler looked very uncomfortable in the role (think Anthony Hopkins in Bad Company) The blind woman has a monitor for her PC, as well as a braille Keypad... why?? Blade really does say "couchie coo" to a baby. Drake... no comment.Not to mention the disgusting Apple product placement.... "Whistler likes to hunt vampires listening to her I-Pod"... How cheap is that. She is seen downloading from i-tunes, not once but twice!! Cheap and nasty Hollywood.I could not believe that they also tried to introduce Matrix themes and comedy into this film. It is so so bad. Blade one was dark, sexy and eerie. Blade two had fantastic characters, a great story and good effects. Blade Trinity has no redeeming features... at all. If anyone has bothered to see it, this film is on a par with Resident Evil Apocalypse. It really is that bad.Steer well well clear. If you go and see it and get that feeling in the pit of your stomach about ten mins in... when you are still waiting for the mind blowing entrance scene and martial arts... and it hasn't happened. Go home... just leave.. go and spend you time watching films that deserve to be supported and encouraged by our money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As far as action films go this is brilliant, the special effects were out of this world, the action sequences were adrenaline packed.It was great to see Wesley Snipes back in action as Blade and to see that he still has the ability to pull of some well-crafted fight choreography.I was very pleased by the introduction of the Nightstalkers, and Ryan Reynolds played the Hannibal King charter brilliantly - the funny, eccentric ex-vampire vampire hunter, I liked it.What did surprise me is Jessica Biel's character and even after Whistler dies, the story keeps him alive in Abigail.The plot wasn't the best I have seen, but hey, it's an action movie, a typical one at that; one where you get to unplug your brain box and be dazzled by what you see.After seeing the film, much like I felt after the second, I felt Empowered, lol and attempted to karate chop my best friend.I can say I really enjoyed this third instalment in the vampire tale, and I hope they make a fourth.Blade: Trinity is by far one of the best action films of the year and is up there with Kill Bill Volume II, Spider Man II, Troy, Van Helsing, The Chronicles of Riddick, I, Robot and The Bourne Supremacy.7/10 action movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A totally awesome action packed movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit to being a little apprehensive about seeing the third instalment of Blade as i was very disappointed by the second movie, but boy was i surprised. Although, the Dracula plot has been a excessively used over the years, it didn't take anything away from the brilliance of film as it put a totally new spin on the age old tale of Dracula. What the movie lacked in dialogue was certainly made up for with action and King's (Ryan Reynolds) one liners and humour were well worth the entrance money alone. The addition of Whistler's daughter, who was following in her father footsteps was well worked into the storyline. All in all, i thoroughly enjoyed the latest Blade outing and will definitely be going to see it again</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing fighting scenes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've watched all three Blade movies as part of my personal challenge to watch every Marvel movie made. I went in with no opinion or knowledge about the story.I liked the story, but I've definitely seen better story lines. What I personally liked most is the fighting scenes. Recent movies make a lot of heroes look like almost invincible gods. It doesn't look like throwing punches takes any effort or power. In Blade in saw the opposite, the fighting looked extremely real. Sometimes I could've sworn he actually hit the actors. Comparing Blade: Trinity to the earlier Blade movies, the special effects became so much better too. Huge plus to me. I rated this 6 because of good fighting and special effects. It's only 6 because some of Blade's humor was switched to other characters and the story isn't very deep. It's not bad, but not deep and sometimes obvious.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blade: Trinity is actually a good action comic book film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the very first Marvel Movie I saw in theaters back in 2004 and it still one of the best times I had at the theaters. It's one of those films in a series that I look at the good and ignore the bad. Also Blade Trinity was how I discover IMDb in 2005 and while I have been on the site ever since so as part of my ten year anniversary I'm reviewing Blade:Trinity Yes I know this movie got a bad rap but I still love it since I saw it in theaters. The plot this time features Blade (Wesley Snipes) must team up with Hannibal King (Ryan Reynolds) and Abigail Whistler (Jessica Biel) as they do battle against Drake (Dominic Purcell), Danica Talos (Parker Posey), Asher Talos (Callum Keith Rennie) and Jarko Grimwood (Triple H)I feel Blade Trinity is actually a good action comic book movie because it features a lot more than people give it credit for.The action scenes in the film are top notch as you see many fights throughout this movie and the stunts are pretty intense and some of the most out of control scenes that make you go I can't believe that. Also the film does feature some emotional scenes that I remember everyone in the theater was silence throughout that really is not something you see all the time any more. Plus there are some good performances in the film Plus there is a good soundtrack for the film along with the score that helps tell the story of the movie. Now the film does have it share of comedy some weak some that make you laugh so hard along with one scene I remember everyone in the theater clap Back to the film the movie is just driven by action and tense movements that you won't see coming even while watching Blade:Trinity also it still a better vampire film Seriously give Blade:Trinity a try you might be surprised with how much it's better then you thought it would be plus the film feature cool one liners With tense moments, superb action scenes and actually one of Marvel's most interesting films you will actually come to enjoy it I give Blade:Trinity an 9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Third Blade Movie?The Third Different Style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This the Final Blade Movie in the Series is the Third Different Style Rendered for the Vampire Vampire Slayer. Wesley Snipes Returns as Does Kris Kristofferson, but This One Adds the Marvel Team, "The Nightstalkers" with Jessica Biel and Ryan Reynolds in Key Roles.Trinity is Riddled with as Many Snarky and Glib One Liners, as Explosions, Ashings, and Modified Bullets. Most of it Works and the Decidedly Lighter Tone of the Movie Gives it a Definitive Comic-Book Feel. The First Movie was a Solidly Straight Origin Story, the Sequel was a Gore-Fest Horrorthon, and Now There's This.Fans were Mixed and Critics Lambasted the Final as an Over Indulgent Mess Mostly Sighting First Time Director Goyer (who wrote all three). It's Not that Bad and is a Fun Frolic with Enough Action and "Super-Heroics" and Forced Hipness, to Make it an Entertaining, if Shallow Treat.There was Much Reported On-Set Angst Between Snipes and the Director and the Rest of the Crew were Caught Up in the Turmoil. It Doesn't Really Show Up in the Movie. But a Failed Follow-Up with the Nightstalkers Never Materialized.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gets more hate than it deserves</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So Blade Trinity is a much loathed entry into the Marvel Studios live action film library but does it deserve so much of the hatred it's garnered? No. It's a B-movie popcorn flick. It was a fun ride for about two-thirds of the movie. It's better than Blade 2, which is actually a very awful movie. People will deride Parker Posey's corporate vampire villain from this film as a weak character but Nomak, the genetically engineered super vampire from Blade 2 was far worse. Did Blade need a bunch of disposable nobodies generically dubbed The Nightstalkers following him around? Of course not. It's not any worse than the vampire commando squad from Blade 2, who are just as disposable and faceless (shame on you Guillermo del Toro for wasting the talents of Donnie Yen). Ryan Reynolds' performance may be the worst thing about this movie aside from having to see the non-acting performance of Triple H the vampire. They both just suck some of the life out of nearly every scene they're in. It's a shame since Ryan Reynolds is usually funny and at least a competent supporting actor but comes across as extremely obnoxious in this. Dominic Purcell, before his breakthrough role on Prison Break, is a decent Dracula or Drake as the movie calls him. Nomak looked like a malnourished methamphetamine user by comparison. Most of the story is based around some plot to stop the vampires from using blood farms to finally eradicate and or enslave humanity, while the good guys are trying to use a bioweapon against the vampires capable of destroying them. The rest is not much not different from the first two films through initial confrontation to the concluding final battle with a few slight variations. It's a 2.5 out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So so movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked the first and the second Blade better ( although they could also be improved). The third one does not make as much sense to me. Dracula was born in the 15th century ( Vlad Dracul ) according to the legend , he's not thousands of years old . His character should not be in this movie . Further more how is it possible for humans to go toe to toe with vampires and win ? In other words , How could the characters of Ryan and Jessica survive even one fight with any vampires ? Ryan gets kicked and punched by superstrong and superfast creatures and he can still walk and talk and boy does he talk !. Jessica is fighting kung fu with a vampire who could technically move much faster than her . Does that make sense at all? Duh ! Humans are no match for superheroes or supervillains alike unless they have a super secret weapon that equalizes the plane field (eg UV flashes in blade 2)I think Goyer is overrated as a director ( and perhaps as a writer). People in the movie industry still do not get that a good story with character dimensions is always better than pure action or pure special effects. (look at pulp fiction )Heres's a tip from a fan with common sense Mr Goyer:Fundamentals of movies or movie 101: the "good" storytelling ,the "good" dialogues , the "good" acting the " good" directing , and some "good "necessary action to keep people excited .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad, but lacks the visceral excitement of the previous films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching "Trinity" was somewhat frustrating at times. It's as if the director somehow forgot that this was supposed to be a big time theatrical release and made a "made for TV" movie by accident. The supporting actors, the main bad guy, the plot, the fight scenes...none of them were bad at all. This was obviously the work of high level professionals with a big budget, and things look pretty good - but none of it had the weight and heft of the first two films.Part of the problem might be that Guillermo del Toro made Blade II such a ferocious blood-and-thunder epic that director Goyer may have felt he couldn't make anything that compared directly to it -even if he'd written the screenplay for both. So he went with a less intense direction, hoping to make up the difference with more diverse storytelling elements. I don't blame Goyer for this, since anything louder and nastier than "Blade II" might have sat on the audience's heads and gnawed out their livers, but the choices he made didn't quite gel. Some blame has to fall on the supporting cast,too. Reynolds is in fantastic physical condition for the movie, and he works really hard to get his character over, but he comes across as a hopeless lightweight compared to previous supporting actors like Ron Purlman ."Trinity" just goes "KLUNK!!" whenever Reynolds is handed the ball in a scene and has to try to carry it with dry, ironic humor. He's certainly likable - modest, self effacing, etc - he just isn't impressive. I don't know how much of this is his fault, and how much is the director's - it's possible that another director might have gotten a more effective performance out of him.Same thing with Biel. Like Reynolds, she looks great, and like Reynolds she's very likable. But she doesn't have the heft or the "gravitas" to make her anything more than eye candy. Watching her in action is kind of like watching the cheer-leading squad's top star do fight choreography from "The Matrix"....yes it's nice, but what's the point?There is some good stuff in here, enough to rescue "Trinity" from being unwatchable or boring. The idea of having to face the original primal vampire, Dracula himself, is something that had to be done; the opening of the film is clever and intense, with a nice "oh sh*t!" feeling;the scene with the "blood bank" was a nasty, chilling touch; the concept of a reformed (!!) vampire fighting against his former masters carries a lot of potential; and a few of the new gimmicks and weapons are nice. And did I mention the vampire Pomeranian? I liked the vampire puppy dog a lot. So I don't feel that Goyer owes me his life's blood for "ruining the franchise for me" or any of that over-heated fan-boy rhetoric. It's not a bad movie - it's just not a great movie. Reynold's career will survive this, and so will Biel's, and they will both probably go on to better things. If you just go in looking for a couple of hours of diversion from your movie, "Trinity" will provide it for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like a lot of you I found this film a disappointment after Blade II which I just loved. For me it seemed to be dulled down as if people where just going through the motions, like get this over with and give me my cash. Although a lot hated Ryans role I found him beguiling and I feel that his uncomfortable jokes added and not detracted from his role, whether it be through type-casting or not. I liked the younger crew and I am sorry that their characters where not given enough time to develop. Constructed more as Vampire fodder than back-up crew. Jennifer Biels role I did enjoy, in particular her 'mother waiting for a train role' mind you I would not go onto that lonely platform to await a train. Loved her bow and arrow action and that slicey thing. Very innovative. I thought the dogs where both great and sad (going with the animal experimentation is bad angle). But my surprise when that Pomeranian first showed his teeth, and his Rottie posse did make me smile. I thought Parker was as quirky as ever in her choice of role and character. Agree with Hannibal when he said her hairdo was a hair don't. Didn't like the main vampire he had no charisma, as in Dracula of Hammer days, or no creep out scary as in Nosferatu or Blade II. I wasn't keen on his giant scary vampire self because big is not necessarily better. Personally I don't feel that the real Dracula (I know he isn't real) would look like that. He was devoid of all things vampire and although he could have played a minion, or a bouncer, Dracula incarnate he was not. I tended to watch this because otherwise it would have seemed unfinished as if I had left a book when I still had a couple of hundred pages to go. I would like to see a forth but only if a director like del Torro (or he himself) would deem to do it.Oh and how would it be if Dracula incarnated into a woman instead? Just a thought.

		<shortDescription>Bad Rap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know, it's funny. The whole point of the Blade franchise was for it to be fun, bloody, ass-kicking fun. The first Blade was fresh and had a black hero, and Snipes, as such, was awesome. The action genera had been pretty tired, as had the horror genera. So Blade, the first movie, was a breath of fresh air, as far as I'm concerned... stylish, fairly simple, but brutal, adult fun. Maybe made for us guys, but either way a damn fun movie. Blade 2 kicked in and actually impressed... way better, way smarter, and using the same formula but directed with more skill and brains.Now, on to the third installment, actually directed by the creator of the Blade franchise in movie form. So we've brought in more characters... a bit more humor, some sex-appeal, and some ridiculousness, but the same formula has been followed. Maybe someone wanted some freshness to an already fresh series, I don't know. The directing style is different to be sure. But if I want to have some brainless entertainment that's got stylish violence, some sharp one-liners, and a bit of gore, then I watch Blade movies- including this one. Trinity is, as a Blade film, the worst of the three. But dammit, even the worst pizza is pretty good, right? I enjoyed it. I didn't feel like critiquing a vampire movie based on a comic book. What's the freakin point? This is not Oscar material, people. It's fun, fantasy crap. And the Blade movies are really good fun fantasy crap. You can bicker all you want about which one is better, and why, but I'm just glad they came up with them in the first place.I grant you that the villains in this movie suck, and much of the script sucks, and plenty of the direction kinda sucked. The plot kinda sucked, and vampires suck... whatever. If I want cinematic perfection, I'll watch Munich, or something... (and sometimes I do.) So anyway, stop trying to be such a fake brainiac and tear this movie apart. Have fun, put your brain on hold, and watch a good freakin entertaining bunch of slosh. Ryan Reynolds is likable, and I liked seeing him fight and swear and act tough. Beal is just plain hot. Again, very watchable and likable, even if it is only for a couple of curvy reasons. Snipes, as Blade, is bad ass, and there hasn't been a better side-kick foundation than Whistler in years. The reasons we liked Blade in the first place are still all hear-- so don't even try to make these movies something they've never been. Just have fun and watch some killin'.For what it is, Blade: Trinity, is still way better than other films in the same genera--- or other generas, for that matter. And I AM picky...just not about the silly unimportant stuff in silly, unimportant movies- like the Blade movies. They aren't important or even great (Blade 2 was close to great), but they are fun as hell.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Again Blade(Wesley Snipes),the half vampire,part human two-fisted hero with his cutting blade and his black garment and of course with the company of the veteran Abraham Whistler(Kris Kristofferson).This time he teams up with the ¨Vigilantes from the night¨ named Annibal and Abigail(a muscular Ryan Reynolds and Jessica Biel)constituting an invincible trio.They have to take on a gang of crazies bloodsuckers in the dangerous underworld.The Vigilantes have a hidden place as headquarter where are a blind(Natasha Lyonne) scientific and a child.They are pursued by law agents(James Remar) and combat vampiric enemies(led by Parker Posey)and against the greatest vampire(Dominick Purcell) of all the time named Drake.The picture provides frenetic action,visceral violence,spectacular combats and loads of blood and gore. The movie is full of energy when the struggles happen with impressive bounds and leaps,besides a sensational blades-Katana type- duels.It's just another vampires story wrapped up with unstopped action and breathtaking scenes.The fights are well staged with sensational choreography and are made by the same actors who hold a hard training on martial arts and by stunts but also by ordering.The makeshift from human to vampire is equally realized as makeup as especial effects.It's the following of Blade I(Stephen Norrington 1998) and Blade II(Guillermo del Toro 2002)making a perfect trilogy.The plot rips off everything in sight including a confrontation between one bloodsucker(Dominick Purcell,Prison Break) such megalomaniac as the evil man from the Blade I(Stephen Dorff).Besides the vampires countenance and vampires dogs faces are similar than Blade II.However the film is darkest even than anterior parts,is more spectacular,more thriller,more focused than previous movies.The motion picture is based on the character created by Marvel Comic Group by Rolfman and Gene Colan and is well adapted by David S. Goyer(film producer along with Snipes).It's a generally enjoyable tribute to vampires cinema and the action genre.If you're a former Blade fan,you'll like it.The picture results to be one of the most successful terror-action movie of the last years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was never really into the Blade movies or stories from the comic books, but my mom is a huge fan. We have a Pomeranian, and I remember her calling me and screaming about how Blade: Trinity had a vampire Pomeranian in it, I just started laughing and couldn't believe it. But she kept on asking me to watch it with her, because no one else would, so finally I sat down and watched it, and I couldn't believe my eyes, a vampire Pomeranian! Blade has been set up by humans who were pretending to be vampires, so now everyone thinks he is a murderer and has become the most wanted man in America. When the Feds get ahold of him, a group of humans help Blade escape and together they must find Dracula to stop him from creating the ultimate vampire. Of course, you know, that's not going to be easy since Dracula reminds you instead of a smooth talking Romanian as a Predator wanna be!While Blade: Trinity has some great action like always, it just seems like the whole special effects just revolved around video games of today. But I would recommend Blade: Trinity for vampire lovers, action lovers, or well, you get the idea. I just at least wanted to watch it, because, there is a vampire Pomeranian! Crazy, I know! But it was so cool to see and I will never doubt my mom again.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the trailer it look so damn cool and plus it got new additional character Hannibal and Abigail. But watch it for real, Blade: Trinity nothing but disappointment. I expect a lot more for the movie that will wrap up the trilogy.Brief: Blade is now facing more problem as he learn he is a wanted man by the authority and the nemesis enemy - Dracula is finally awaken. This time he must joint Nightstalkers to fight against evil.Almost everything about this movie is a disappointment. Stated off with the story, which is really lame and predictable, and the movie has lost all characteristic of Blade. It is now just typical B grade vampire movie. I feel like watching a PG-13 movie. The story is just too lame to describe.The casting consists of good and bad, I think Dominic is horrible as Dracula but the used of Ryan and Jessica is pretty neat and Ms. Parker is hot! Anyway none of them really save the movie with such a horrible screenplay and character development. Costume of the other actors were all right but for Blade it is really horrendous looking.I don't like the idea of stuffing in action scene every 15 minutes like this; it doesn't look natural. Every fighting is set in particular places and time and particular moves. What I'm trying to say is the movie is too calculated.And I must add the directing is quite bad even for the first time director, but he has been in the business in a long while and I think could do better than this. He shouldn't be allowed to give such a big responsibility of directing this movie.Final Say: Despite movie got loads number of action scenes it was an unsatisfying one. Everything blew here and there and nothing really to hold on to. The movie couldn't hold my interest. The movie is lacking in everything.Reason To Watch: Jessica Biel and Ryan Reynolds.Reason Not To: It Got Really Lame Story and It Lost All The Coolness of Blade.Rating: 5/10 (Grade: D-).Please Rate Y/N After Read.

		<fullReview>"Blade Trinity" was kind of a disappointing end to the trilogy. I think they waited to long to start filming this one after the second film came out. After the perfect second movie, this one was no where close to as good. That is not to say that this is a bad movie however. You still have a lot of action, and a lot of new characters. Newcomers Ryan Reynolds and Jessica Biel join blade in his quest to kill the legendary Dracula (called Drake in this movie) as young vampire hunters. Biel and Reynolds are OK, but I'd rather see Blade go it alone to go after the remainder of the vampire community. It was also weird seeing Reynolds not in a teen comedy role. It is hard not to compare Trinity to the rest of the series, but the bad guys aren't as bad, and the good guys aren't as cool and stylish as its predecessors. I just wish that they did more with this one. Fans of the Blade series should definitely still see this, and for the casual action fan this will be a decent movie for you as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One thing that lifts this film up is Ryan Reynolds turn as Hannibal King. Some of his lines are just hilarious! Jessica Biel as Abigail Whistler, she was OK, I certainly wouldn't kick her out of bed, but her part was rather overwhelmed by Reynolds, and in part, his relationship with Danica.Wesley Snipes plays the emotionless part of Blade as well as he has done in the first two films.Quite a lot of 'fanboys' aren't happy with this being the final film and think Reynolds and the rest ruined the franchise, fact is, it helped lift the film. Just how much more emotionless Blade killing can we stomach? From my point of view, the parts of Abigail and Hannibal are clearly setup for separate films like Elektra was to Daredevil, but I can't see it happening somehow. The Box Office for Blade Trinity wasn't great, so I guess this is where Blade stops.If you don't like Vampire movies, then this movie isn't for you.I always like the idea of a more mature Marvel comic to movie transition, and Blade does it better than Punisher did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really tried to like this movie. There was a lot of hype towards it but sadly, it doesn't live up to the expectations. Not even the always beautiful Jessical Biel saves the day. Wesley Snipes looks uncomfortable all the time, and the rest of the cast looks over acted. Except for the always wonderful, beautiful Parker Posey. Ryan Reynolds seems like an actor that has a bright future but this kind of roles won't help him that much.The movie is filled with comic book action type scenes but unlike the first two "Blade" movies, this one isn't impressive or even spectacular. The Horror elements are gone and "Trinity" focuses mainly on the CGI effects. Sadly, the visuals aren't that impressive. Oh, and the score is painful. Enough with cheap techno tracks!This is probably the last movie of the "Blade" franchise and I can understand why. The plot is terrible and never gets interesting. The action sequences aren't impressive as I stated before.There isn't anything good about "Blade Trinity" except for Parker Posey.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unfortunate attempt by a first-time director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you watch this film carefully you can see that they chopped some stuff out and rearranged it A LOT.For example, the scene where Dracula goes rampaging through the Vampire/Sex/goth shop...there's no real need for the scene - it's pretty obvious it was sliced and diced to fit there. Same can be said for quite a few scenes The Nightstalkers never work together as a unified team except for the Blade rescue...instead they all die in one fell swoop.The elements of the script are cobbled together from six or seven other movies, like "The Usual Suspects," several James bond films, "Commando," and re-imaginings of the first two "Blades." It's clearly a first-time director's work.When the second film came out I loved it. It gave Blade some much-needed humanity. I assumed the third film would find some way to give us a peek beneath that facade again...and it didn't Instead we have Blade completely stone-faced throughout the film, unresponsive to Whistler's death and surrounded by well-meaning but ultimately incapable sidekicks, most of whom die within the first half of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When will they let Wesley direct? Surely he's higher up the film chain than a writer?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1. Were the cinematographers paid by the footage of film they shot? 2. Were the editors paid by the footage they left in the film? 3. Did the director, who seems to have been a writer at some point in his life, ever watch a movie before he directed this one?Wesley spends most of the movie looking like a beaver with thyroid problems. The sidekicks would have been better off in their own movie, perhaps an animated one. Jessica deserves her own movie, perhaps even with this character. The franchise was in jeopardy when the final credits rolled on the first movie. The second movie seemed to have been made by people who hadn't seen the first. This thing, "Trinity" (funny triple entendre, guys... NOT!), should be erased from the memory of the human race. I've seen videos collections of old commercials from the fifties that were more entertaining... and suspenseful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>...bad way to end a trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I came into the theaters expecting a great finale to the Blade franchise seeing as how Goyer who had written the first two had directed it. But i was sadly disappointed. It seems Goyer had a VERY different view of how the Blade universe works. The great horror/action mood the first two had were gone completely and replaced by a on again off again wannabe hip comedic one that did not fit in properly with the theme of the movie. It seemed like they tried to mix Blade with a buddy cop movie feel, having the rookie Hannibal King crack a joke at every possible opportunity, and of course Blade taking the role of the older more mature cop would give him scolding looks. Aside from that the Abigail character was a completely useless role in this movie as all she was there for was to use an ridiculously unrealistic weapon and cry for when her dad died.As for the Dracula role they completely went against the grain with how this guy is. Gone are the gentlemanly/seductive character traits that made Dracula famous and are instead replaced with a biker/rock star looking character who was more like an X-Man than a vampire. Honestly if your going to have an icon such as Dracula in the movie, you don't go and change him just to fit with what the new generation might consider a cool vamp. Aside from that just the thought that a half vampire could beat the King of Vampires was in my view the worst mistake of this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Waste of time, and a disgrace for Wesley Snipes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Waste of time. Thats my opinion about this one. The storyline of this movie is very cheap and thoughtless. The acting is very poor even though Paul Levesque actually made me laugh several times with his dump out-of-situation jokes. Wesley Snipes tried to be the same cool blade as in the first movie, but he does not accomplish it, and even if he did it would be the same person over again. The special effects are pretty poor and the new weapons absolutely ridicules. Except from several cheap laughs from Pauls dump and annoying comments there is nothing in this movie that is worth seeing. Taking in notice that it lasts almost 2 full hours it is simply not worth spending your time on. Sit down and do a jigsaw puzzle if you don't know what to do with your time, anything but watching this movie. You might think that I am being a little rough on this movie but it disappointed the hell out of me, since me friend said that it was cool and entertaining. Since then I have not taking his advice concerning movies. For those who like mindless action, dump weapons and plane acting and falls for smart-ass comments this might just be the movie to throw away your time on! Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know what's going on with 3rd-part Marvel movies.I have the advantage of writing this review AFTER I watched X-Men 3 and they both have the same problem, only X-Men 3 got away with it better than Blade 3.The problem was pacing and development. This (as well as X-Men 3) could have been better than its two predecessors, instead they were both merely "acceptable." X-Men got away with it because (if we watched the first two), we were already familiar with the main cast. However, the peripheral cast (the new people introduced) didn't get a fair chance to get acquainted with us, they were introduced, given a quick background, then "did their thing." But none of their true "driving" emotions were brought out, especially in Biel's character. Reynold's character had more chances to express his personality, but still not as many as I would have liked.The same is true with Dracula, played very well by Dominic Purcell. But once again, unlike Frost (in part one) or the lead Reaper (in part two), you really can't get a feel for his character's true personality.Now for the good part...the lack of character development was made up for by some rock solid action and a good plot to develop the ultimate weapon against the vampires. However, I don't think it works for me as a "finale." It's more of a lead into Blade: The Series which comes out the end of June 2006 on Spike TV.Quick summary: The Highs -- good plot; same great fight scenes we all love from Blade movies; new cool weapons; great new enemies The Lows -- rushed plot; poor character development; Snipe's acting is inferior compared to the first two, but his fights were good (maybe he was sick of being Blade :) ) 6/10 overall, and hopefully they won't mess up the Series...we'll soon see</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie sucked</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching the first Blade movie with my ex, I knew this movie franchise was something I wanted to follow. After seeing the second Blade movie, although not as good as the first, I was anxious to see how much awesome the third and final Blade would be. I was throughly disappointed with the crappy directing and production of the final movie. The actors seemed to have less talent than 3rd grade students acting out a complicated Shakespeare play. If it weren't for Snipes and Kristopherson being in the movie, I would not be convinced that it was even in the same series of movies. I would really love to see this movie done correctly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A really good ending to a great trilogy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Blade was a small comic, but the movie was far from small. The movie shot the character of Blade into pop culture and spawned two entirely different but equally good sequels. Blade: Trinity shows Blade's struggle with keeping his war with vampires under wraps getting out of control. When he inadvertently kills a human, he finds himself hunted by both vampires and the law. Meanwhile, a group of vampires raise the original vampire, Dracula, from the dead. Now Blade and another team of hunters called the Nightstalkers have to find a way to wipe vampires out for good.The movie is just as well made as the first two films. David S. Goyer, who wrote all three films does a good job taking over as director this time around. Wesley Snipes is as good as ever as Blade, and Ryan Reynolds is both hilarious and hardcore as the vampire hunter Hannibal King. The action/fight scenes are awesome and entertaining to watch. The humour in the film really makes you laugh.What brings this movie down a little is the fact that the style has changed a bit. It doesn't feel like the first two Blade films. The first two were dark action/horror films whereas this movie is an action/comedy popcorn film. Even though I loved the humour in the movie, it just changed it into too much of a comedy. There were also too many advertisements within the film, like for iPod and Buell motorbikes. Also, I didn't much like the performances of Parker Posey and Dominic Purcell as Dracula.Overall, the movie was a good entry into the Blade series, but it just wasn't the same style as the first two.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Give Blade back to the fans!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw Blade Trinity on DVD! It was an OK movie, which I must add is not worthy the Blade series. The previous two kicked my behind so hard, it toke me weeks to sit again. Blade movies should ROCK! Seriously, the Blade character looked old and his two side kicks were to comical. Even the evil Dracula did not impress me. In the first movie Steven Dorff, Donal Logue and Arly Jover came over as vampire friends who would show the old order how to survive. The Reapers in the second movie were dark and scary. With such adversaries Blade comes out ten times stronger. In this movie the vampires start out good, but they lose power in the movie. They are brought down to easy. If ever a fourth Blade should arise, please let Guillermo del Toro direct it. With all due respect too everyone involved in this movie, give Blade back to the fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best movie of the three, easily.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked Blade, I thought Blade II was decent, not as good as the first, but more visually compelling at points, but wow, Trinity is just excellent, the characters are there for once, Drake(Dracula, as it were.) is a great final villain for this series, especially after the utterly disappointing villain scene of the second, which was a notch down from the first.The idea of wiping out the vampires using a virus was also a good idea, though it wasn't great, the jokes were hilarious, King really stole the show, and countless quotes come to mind, it seems whenever he speaks it's quotable.His female Nemesis is also strange and funny, her twitching lipped hollow eyed delivery was exactly as many of the vampires featured should be, numbed by utter decadence in their American Vampire rule, which as opposed to the European stature, and rule, was far less so, and more pure, I think that's a great little social commentary and it gets more fleshed out in this film.Paul Levesque(Triple H from the WWE) played a great secondary villain, almost as good as Donal Logue in the first movie, or even equal, I was afraid of excessive wrestling moves, but thankfully they were kept in a short, and powerful fight scene between him and Ryan's character Hannibal King.Disappointments? Thankfully not dialogue, the fact that Drake didn't get more fleshing out, and the fact that none of the characters in their group got fleshed out, instead they were killed off, even a few tidbits would've been great.I hate saying it but, not enough King! I've seen Ryan in quite a few films, and he's funny in some, and just barely passable in others, but I have to say, this is, in my opinion, his best role, and in of all places a Sci-Fi/Thriller/Action movie, who would've guessed? Overall, fantastic action flick, vampires were better this time around, their society was left untouched, that touching is what really saved the second one for me, we got a better feeling of how it works, but with this one we really went back to how the original worked, and improved on that, so the score is 8/10 for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad, the first 2 are better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you decide to watch Blade Trinity, try to keep the first 2 out of your mind. Despite some of the opinions that have been expressed, I would argue that BLADE TRINITY IS NOT A BAD FILM. It fails to I've up to the hype of the originals but in itself it is not a bad film.That said, it does have its flaws. Like Blade 2, giving Blade allies draws attention away from him and working with others is not in Blades character. In the original Blade is a loner, taking on hordes of Vampires single handed, now he has allies with him who frankly dilute the action. Despite this, the Nightstalkers are generally good characters, and a movie of their own could be entertaining, they just don't fit in with Blade.Also, there is not enough contact between Blade and the enemy. In the first 2 films Blade encounters his enemy repeatedly during the film in a buildup to the final battle, generating atmosphere. In Trinity this does not happen.Despite my emphasis on the bad points of the movie, I did enjoy this enough to buy the DVD and it is a good film. It could be improved by splitting it in 2, a Blade movie and a Nightstalkers movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst Blade movie but not a bad action movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed Blade: Trinity. It's the worst Blade movie but it's definitely not a bad action movie. The fight scenes were good and the new vampire hunter characters enjoyable. Especially Ryan Reynolds was a very good comedy sidekick as the other vampire hunter. However the Dracula bad guy wasn't a very good or menacing Dracula. The plot wasn't very good and it was stupid that the vampire hunting humans could beat up vampires like they were nothing. The other Blades had good soundtracks but this one had maybe the best one. The ending seems to send a message that there won't be a fourth Blade movie. Maybe that's a good thing. Anyway I can say I enjoyed the movie very much although it has it's flaws.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Will Abigail appear in, maybe the next Blade movie? I thought she was great in Blade Trinity . After all she has to go through a lot of serious training . Lots of weight training, lots of cardio, lots of running. She had to lean down, gain more muscle, lose body fat. Then she would go to an hour of martial arts, and then an hour of archery. That would be her everyday thing. None of them such as King the character have ever worked with swords or knives, or you know, martial arts -- any of that stuff. So that's how it's becoming really easy for Abigail. She looks really good. I think she's definitely in the best shape of her whole life. She looks like she should be part of like these fitness competitions. Where they dance and back handsprings things. I also like one of her weapons -- knife that comes out of the tip of her boot and a special compound bow, which is really cool. Abigail interested in doing a Nightstalkers spin-off? Back to the fact that she is Whistler's daughter -- sounds really cool.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Blade: Trinity The third and supposedly last Blade movie catches us up with the day walker Blade and his long time battle against vampires. However the vampires have two new enemies for Blade to fight negative media coverage and Dracula now known as drake. Blade is forced into helping a lonely band of vampire hunters calling themselves the night stalkers. Lead by Hannibal King ( Ryan Reynolds ) and Abigale Whistler (Jessica Biel ) both in good supporting roles especially the comic relief of Ryan Reynolds. These new vampire fighters must take on some new evil vamps played by Parker pose and WWE fighter HHH. Dominic Purcell plays the evil Drake and Wesley Snipes is a mean as ever as Blade. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie although most critics would not agree with me. I didn't think it was the strongest of the three however still well done. I actually hope this is in fact not the last Blade movie and that the series can have breath blown back into it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What the ?????</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lots of Spoilers...... OK all, this movie had great potential (if you are a Blade fan), but the writer and director missed the boat. The Action was good and Snipes was his usually Blade character, but the rest of this film falls apart. First off, we have our Night stalkers who apparently (mainly Biel and Reynolds) who apparently can match strength and Speed with vampires. Come off it, mortals had no chance in the first 2 films or in the comics for that matter. Vampires in Marvel comics are typically as strong and fast as spider-man if not stronger. I can see a weapons battle between mortal and the vamps, but hand to hand combat? I don't care if your Royce Gracie, Steven Seagal and Mike Tyson rolled into one, a vampire from the Blade series is gonna hand you your A$$! Even Reynolds starts narrating the movie stating that only Blade has really been effective against the vampires, no English guys with holy water. Thats the first beef, issue 2 is make up your mind on who and what Dracula is. OK he's not the blood god, for that guys was in the first film, so he is probably an avatar of the blood god, but we are not going to tell you. Next as Dracula I'm going to sit here , hiding behind a baby from a man I don't fear and talk to him about true honor? What kind of stupidity is that, is he a noble warrior or not. And he's resurrected for what purpose? To create other day walkers and kill Blade? he never could make day walkers in the past, why do they think he can do it now? Haven't they got Blade on the ropes before they wake Dracula, why take the risk? When asked about being a day-walker Dracula states read the book, well if he did read the book he would know that all vampires can walk in daylight, but it drains their powers more quickly and makes them tired and weak. Make up your minds. Issue 3, why did we bother putting silver oxide in the ventilation shafts, it doesn't seem to kill any vampires, just pisses them off. Kind of an expensive tool of uselessness. Probably as effective as if Reynolds really did have Garlic farts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This comment refers to the unrated DVD version of Blade: TrinityFirst of all let me say that if you liked the first two Blade movies, you should go and see this one. You'll probably like it too. Second, the third movie of the Blade saga is without a doubt the worst of the bunch. It's OK but not great. And here's why: FX - the special effects are a bit worse than in Blade 2 (except for the dogs, they were cool)ACTING - Wesley Snipes is in his element as Blade, Ryan Reynolds is drop dead funny (and also has some cool action scenes), Jessica Biel delivers, Parker Posey annoyed me sometimes with her overacting and Natasha Lyonne was Natasha Lyonne, nuff said. The rest of the cast was overall OK.STORY - Uuuuhhhh ... the Vamps are bringing Dracula back to life to kill Blade. I'm soooooo scared. No really, the story was weak in comparison to the first two movies, but good enough for a sequel. The ending bummed me out though. They should have used the ending of the theatrical version for the unrated film too. It just would have made more sense.Rating: Ryan Reynolds bumps the movie up to 7 outta 10.My personal list of favorite Blade movies: 1. Blade 2 (9 outta 10) 2. Blade (8 outta 10) 3. Blade: Trinity (7 outta 10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I usually don't like sequels, and I most often hate when they do a third movie. Well for some odd reason I really enjoy watching the blade movies. The first Blade is of course the best by far, but I still enjoy the two sequels. There were some things that annoyed me about Blade: Trinity, and that was how the action sequences was shot. Very up and close, with fast cutting so you really can't see what is being done. Old Hollywood trick when the actor or actress doesn't know martial arts but we are meant to think that he/she does. But if you take away that fact, you still have about two hours with action, one liners and people too cool for their own good. This is Blade ladies and gentlemen, and you know he will get the job done while saying cheesy lines and killing bad guys off one by one. If you go to see this movie, keep an open mind because if you want a good movie you will be disappointed. If you on the other hand want to be easily entertained without having to think about plot holes and bad lines, you will be glad you went. I rate this movie 6/10</fullReview>

Trinity is an absolute mess. It says enough when parker posey and Triple H are tow of your main villains(even though HHH does pretty good in his first role). The Dracula character was a disgrace. They could have done so much more with this character. This movie also tries far too hard to be funny. I admit Reynolds character did make me laugh at times, it did not belong in a blade movie. The whole thing where Dracula walks into a Gothic porn shop is stupid. This movie should have never been made, it truly drags down what was a series of two very good movies. Its so bad that i don't even consider it apart of the series and find myself almost forgetting it even existed.</fullReview>

Does anyone wonder why there have been 3 different directors in the series....cause no one likes Snipes...directors hate him...co-stars hate him...thats why besides Blade he has been doing straight to video like Van Damme and Seagal...all 3 of these guys destroyed their careers by being a-holes to producers, directors, and actors...no one will work with them...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Unkindest or Kindest Cut of All?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Goyer directs the third and perhaps final installment to the Blade series with an astonishing amount of energy amidst a background of a rather cliché-ridden, anemic plot. This time Blade is going to battle ... dare I say...Dracula, who has been in hiding somewhere in the Middle East when he hibernated when he became bored with society. The story is nothing grand in anyone's dictionary, but the film breathes life into it with an entertaining, never-take-yourself-too-seriously attitude. Wesley Snipes is Wesley Snipes as Blade. We get lots of one-liners with real little meaning and Snipe's cracking his neck muscles a lot. The other actors are adequate for this kind of film. Whistler is back yet again(Boy, you sure can't keep a good man down!). He departs early in the film, but have no fear...Whistler's daughter is here! Jessica Biel plays the role with verve if nothing else. Parker Posey and the fellow playing Hannibal King(Ryan Reynolds) quip one-liners back and forth. Surprisingly some of them work well, and that for me is the best part of this film - the humour that is generously fused throughout. Sure, one could get bogged down with the endless action scenes and vampires turning into crisps, but the action sequences, which are impressive, are transitioned nicely with something else. There are some moments where drama is approached but not let in. As far as action movies go with a faint taint of science fiction, I recommend Blade: Trinity. You get exactly what is advertised. Nothing more or nothing less.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great with a few exceptions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, first off, when you decide to see a movie like this there are a few things you want. Great special effects, a storyline that just makes sense, some good fight scenes, and believable enough acting that you can still enjoy it and stay into it. I'm not giving anything away, no spoilers, but when Blade meets up with the "main bad guy" this time around, they keep having these little standoffs where nobody starts anything and the guy takes off for no reason. Supposedly he's so much tougher and stronger and whatever than Blade, but every time they have a little "chat", he runs away like a little girl like he's afraid to fight. As much of a bad-ass as the other characters make him out to be, this just makes the whole movie silly. Then we have the acting. Parker Posey and Triple H (both vampires) are the worst...and that's surprising. Parker Posey is a pretty decent actress, and her first couple of scenes come off pretty well, but after that she seems pretty campy. Triple H must have been hired when they found out Tyler Mane wasn't available. This may sound sad, but the wrestler who also starred as Sabretooth in X-Men 1 &amp; 2 and an oil rig hand in Joe Dirt - and was actually pretty convincing in his roles - was, when compared to Triple H was like comparing Tom Hanks to Pauly Shore. He was awful. If I made sock puppets, they would be more convincing as big scary mean vampires than Triple H was. Really. The friend I watched it with won't watch anything but action, horror, etc., no drama or "good cinema" for him (even hates Hotel Rwanda, even with all the blood and violence), and he even thought Triple H was terrible. The rest of the storyline was a bit stock, i.e. going after all the supporting characters to create some scary scenes...it wasn't bad, but mostly reminded me of most other action/horror/suspense movies I've seen. So we're left with the fight scenes and special effects. Awesome. Tons of cool moves that make you sit up and stare, all kinds of wildness. Definitely worth watching, if for no other reason than to finish out the series. The movie as a whole wasn't as good as the other two - by far - but the addition of the Nightstalkers (for comic fans, a good thing!) and Ryan Reynolds' character (very funny and a nice surprise since I was never impressed by his supposedly "serious" roles) make this a fun little ride. Not great cinema, with a few "what the heck were they thinking?" moments, but still really cool for at least one or two viewings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure popcorn flick...(contains spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first Blade blew away all my expectations and was one of those movies that I loved right from the first viewing. Blade 2 was cool because Blade had to team up with the group of vampires known as the bloodpack. Blade Trinity has the weakest of the stories, but it does contain some great visuals and action. This movie is all balls to the wall action. The act's all play their parts well, even Mr. Van Helsing...I mean Van Wilder. This film is all eye candy with little substance. Very fun nonetheless.It would have been interesting to see what the end of the world "planet of the apes" style Blade movie would have turned out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awkward</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I felt pretty uncomfortable watching Blade Trinity; when I saw it in the theater. It has since begun to grow on me. Though, first the 'awkwardness'. I felt uneasy watching these vastly different actors (and characters) clash in a big way. I know they were supposed to be on the opposition from the get-go, but instead of being a storyline clash, it just felt nervous and tense (to me).Blade: Of course, he's always tense and serious and all business. Always has been. However, with the addition of the younger, and rag-tag bunch, known as the 'Nightstalkers', he seems even more tense and edgy than he normally would. Lashing out at them for almost no reason, at times and even when they've helped him / saved him. I got the feeling the actor didn't like the 'newbies', stealing some of his thunder on his title movie series. Almost can't blame him.King: The antithesis to Blade in almost every way. Ryan Reynolds actually saved this movie on a few levels. It's like he through fuel on the fire of tension with his jokes that never seemed to get laughs, other than from the audience who laughed quite openly. Reynolds is perfect for the tense moments with his dry humor and sometimes childish quips. I liked him in this, and wouldn't mind if he reprized his role in future movies of either Blade or a spin-off of the Nightstalkers.Abigail Whistler: Pretty cool. Again, serious. And naturally seemed to hit it off better with Blade than the others. The more I watch Trinity, the more I like her. She's not over-the-top and seems to have her own persona that sets her apart from the rest. Of course, she enters her own world whenever she puts on her earphones.Still, the first few times I watched this, I was very uncomfortable watching these actors / characters interact. This could have been better, but I really enjoyed much of the humor and some of the fight sequences. Especially, Abigail's first one in the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blade Trinity was an o.k all around action and comedy movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of people are putting down Blade Trinity more than they should. Compared action wise to Blade II, it was lacking. Comedy wise, i think Ryan Reynolds was quite humorous. I know it is not a comedy movie it was nice to bust out in a couple of laughs here and there. If you just want to see a down packed action kung fu movie then watch the I or II one (the final fight in Blade II was better then the final fight in Blade Trinity). If you want to so an action movie with laughs here and there, which I guarantee you a laugh, then Blade Trinity is in fact your movie. I gave this movie a 7 out of 10. I thought it was a good movie but acting wise and a final battle, it could have been much better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the average review score here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a practiced film critic, but 5.7/10 is harsh. I'm a big fan of the whole Blade series and contrary to a lot of opinions I think Goyer did an excellent job. The cinematography is varied and engaging. I like his use of split screens for example (certainly far better than the Hulk - sorry that I even compare the two). The fight scenes are fun. The special effects are great. My only complaint there is I find that the explosive demise of the vampires a bit cheesy. I'd rather see them terminate in a different way (explosions are a bit b-movie-ish but I know thats how they perish throughout the whole series). The humor is a bit cheesy at times but also really funny as well, it's a mixed bag. I'm on the fence about whether the film made fun of itself. It's interesting that in some sequels this phenomena happens. Did Snipes need to go at it alone as one reviewer said? No, I think the supporting heroes did a fine job and were interesting characters. This film is solidly entertaining. There are far worse choices that are deserving of a 5.7.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The funniest blade yet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched Trinity and thought this was the funniest of the three. This is my first (written) review of a movie. I love movies. I love vampire movies. The Blade series is the most modern that I have seen and next to Queen of the Dammed its the best. The original Blade set the stage for what the writers wanted us to know about vampires. Steve Norrington did a fantastic job building characters and developing a "love" for Blade. In my opinion it was the best of the three. Blade II was great for all the special effects. The introduction of a "reaper strain" was highly inventive. 8 out of 10 stars for Ron Pearlman's Reinheart, but hey actors are only as good as the person directing them, right. OK not all actors.Trinity was the funniest one yet. I mean lines like-Cop to Whistler "Dont move a finger" his response to a man with a gun pointed at him is "How about just this one". I know its a movie. Most people don't understand, but some of you will. Your my audience!! Ryan Reynolds is so quick witted, and Paul Michael Levesque(TripleH) struggled with the lines that he had. The dog was funny. Dominic Purcell character needed more development and for an unstoppable immortal, they nailed him pretty quick. This story line could of used more development and don't forget Blade himself. Wesley gave his usual platinum performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Disappointing Conclusion to the Blade Fanchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Blade Trinity has plenty of action to offer but not much else. Blade is back fighting a new vampire menace, this time with the help of the Nightstalkers, a group of vampire-hunting humans that includes Hannibal King (Ryan Reynolds) and Abigail Whistler (Jessica Biel), the illegitimate daughter of his long-time mentor. The plot sounds interesting but the execution isn't. Blade 1 and 2 were both good films. They weren't Oscar quality films but still a lot of fun to watch. Blade Trinity isn't as good as those as its more tedious. The acting was alright, though several actors brought the film down. Wesley Snipes does an okay job of playing Blade. He did a better job in the other films, as he seems really bored with the material. Ryan Reynolds does a good job and he also brings a lot of humor into the film. His sarcasm and jokes start getting annoying after awhile. Jessica Biel does an okay job but this isn't her best role. Parker Posey does a terrible job, which is surprising given how she usually does a good job. Triple H even did a better job then Parker. This doesn't mean he was good but he did an okay job. I seriously hope though he doesn't try to star in more movies. Dominic Purcell plays Dracula and gives a poor performance as well. Natasha Lyonne also does a terrible job, even if she isn't in the film for very long. The last person worth mentioning is Kris Kristofferson and he is killed off in the beginning. David S. Goyer writes again and for the first time directs. He does a poor job doing both as he seems to get lazy. The action was nicely done, with some really entertaining fight scenes. The special effects are also done well, so the film got some stuff right. The dialog was either hit or miss, with most of the humor coming from Ryan Reynolds. There were some lame lines though, like when Blade says coochie cu to a baby. So the Blade series has become a bit more sillier now and I think that upset Wesley Snipes. Also he didn't get to revise the screenplay and that probably would have helped. Its only 113 minutes long but it drags. Therefore, the film seems a lot longer then it is. The producers were also hoping to have a spin-off series with Reynolds. This probably wouldn't be a good idea. What made the other Blade films fun is gone and what your left with a generic action film with a silly plot. The film is still watch able, its just easily forgettable. To enjoy it more you can't really compare this one to the other Blades. Rating 6/10, worth checking out on video, although it's a disappointment for Blade fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the second, not as good as the first...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here now, is the 'objective' list of the good, bad and in the middle stuff, which comprised of Blade Trinity. Let's start with the good.Good: 1) Ryan Reynolds- Yes he had some pretty damn cheesy lines, but all the same, he was one of the few things you looked forward to in the film. The interrogation scene was the best part.2) Dr. Vance- Absolutely hysterical, watch the scene in the police station...solid gold! 3) Vampire pomeranians- This actually might be *the* best part of the film. See for yourself.4) Triple H- In his acting debut. Out of every actor in the film, he made the most of his screen time. Balanced seriousness with humor well.5) Musical score- It worked. Maybe a little overkill with the techno popularized by Blade I, but it still gets the thumbs up from me.Bad: 1) Wesley Snipes- A wooden, boring, going-through-the-motions effort. He was outshined by the rest of the cast. Obviously unfortunate as he played the title character.2) Jessica Biel- Like Wesley, a boring, pointless character. Grimwood and Reynolds were pointless too, but at least they entertained.3) Product placement- I think I literally puked in the movie theatre. I say we all torch Apple, anyone with me? 4) Camera work- good god Ihated the shaky cam...Why the freaking shaky cam? 5) The Writing- an abomination...clichéd, too many plot holes, confusing, under-developed characters. In the middle stuff 1) Fight scenes- I'm sure they could have been better, but I blame it on the amateur camera work of David Goyer.2) Parker Posey- Lame in the beginning, but picks up some steam by the movie's end.Overall, the movie was fun. It dragged in the middle, but some parts make it redeemable. So who would I recommend this movie to? If you're a fan of Reynolds, puppies, and Triple H, this movie is for you, as all three shine (especially the puppies). But if you were expecting Wesley Snipes to impress, you'll be sorely disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Producers Should Take Que from Dracula and put the Vampire idea to bed for a few years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vampire films need to take a break. Everything has been done, just put it on a shelf for a while and come back in about 10 years. That sounds good to me. ANYWAY, Blade Trinity isn't the worst film ever made. With that said, it's not up to the brilliance of the first Blade film either. In the long honored tradition of Triologies, this film is decent. Just as Crusade was hundreds of times better than Temple of Doom, but nowhere near as good as Raiders of the Lost ark and Matrix Revolutions made up for the crap that Reloaded tried to feed us, but still failed to impress us like the original did; Blade Trinity puts up a good fight but in the end just isn't as great as the first. First boo boo, they brought in the kid idea. What is it with producers in Hollywood... you get a actor who is too old to hold his own in the film, i know... we'll give them a child! They can take up the action slack. Enter Jessica Biel. Whistler's compound bow toting daughter. (yeah i know in the first film he said the vampires had killed his family, don't worry they clear this up) Anyway she can fight with the best of them.... a little too good. Honestly she was too good at taking on the vampires, um excuse me but with people like her, why do we need blade? Van Helsing would give his right...um well you know what appendage... to be as good as her. Then there is Ryan Reynolds. A funny, funny (and HOT...whew eee!! Ladies, if your boyfriend forces you to watch this, you'll still have something to look at) man. But he's a little too funny. Meaning he seems to try too hard for the gag. I hope he's not acting like this in Amityville horror, that would be sad. In Blade they seem to have him around only to make stupid jokes. At least his fighting wasn't up to par with Biels, this making him a bit more believable when fighting with the vampires. His connection to Parker Posey and how he became a vampire is amusing if nothing else. Would have liked to seen a more romantic element between him and biel, but eh... it's guy film, not Jane Austen. Anyway, Dracula was probably the weakest character in the film, he had no connection to the vampires and really i didn't see him as much of a threat. Stephen Dorf was way cooler and far more in charge (and surprisingly much SMALLER size wise) than this guy and he was just a half-breed. (not much mention of the hatred between the pure breds and half breeds in this film, which is sad. I thought that was one of the most inventive and interesting things about the first film.The second worst character was Parker Posey. Bad hair, bad clothes and teeth so big she couldn't even talk right. She sounded like they had jabbed a wad of cotton in her mouth. Stupid, stupid, it's a film you HAVE to understand what the actress is saying, not try to guess and be forced to turn on the subtitles only to find out she's not saying anything really interesting anyway. Her one liner, "HANNIBAL KING!" when Reynolds (Reynold's character is named Hannibal King) crashes into a room is ridiculous. Um... great thanks for letting us know honey. We really needed to know RIGHT NOW what his name is, thanks for that. Why don't you go stand in the corner and watch the men fight... *rolling eyes*Finally there is Triple H....what the.... just like Edge in Highlander Endgame, he's only there for star appeal. So many young adults ages 16-35 know who he is and thus they'll come just to see him. His character was very 2 dimensional, heck, i'm not even sure if they gave him a name... i missed it that's for sure. His dog was cool, but that was about it. And his climatic fight was like watching Monday Night Raw, other than that... ugh. So what am i saying here? Did i hate it? No, not really. I know it sounds that way, but like i said there was something about it, something that made it okay-ish. The compound bow was awesome (but then again I'm and archer myself, so that's that) and a few of the gadgets were cool. But i just couldn't get behind any of the characters. The first blade made me feel bad for him, made me really like Whistler, made me LOVE Stephan Dorf and even take a liking to his nearly non-speaking girlfriend played by Traci Lords. Trinity kept making me wish for more and finding myself increasingly unsurprised when it wasn't given to me. scale 1-10 action: 9 plot - 4 dialogue - 3 OVERALL : a weak 6. Sorry the action just barely saved it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The end of the Trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"As an apocalyptic event takes place that could shift the control of the planet Earth from the hands of humanity to the claws of vampires, the Daywalker, Blade (Snipes) is the only person who can turn the tide of the crisis against the undead blood suckers and prevent the world from becoming a "Planet of the Vampires". To make things a lot harder for Blade, the vampire leadership launches a public relations "smear campaign" against Blade, letting the world of humans know that he exists, so that the police start hunting him down, thinking he is some sort of horrible monster...""Blade:Trinity" is the end (or so we've been led to believe) of Wesley Snipes as Blade and while an acceptable action film, isn't really the cap-off we deserved and wanted. Blade has been relegated to it being a sort of "Blade &amp; The Nightstalkers" movie and while Ryan Reynolds is great at bringing humour into the movie and Jessica Biel is just hot, but it wasn't what should have been done.The death of Whistler is slightly touched upon and that's it, which was definitely wrong, the villain Drake (modern for Dracula) doesn't really work and isn't really seen as a threat and the leader of the villains is Parker Posey, who while good in other movies just doesn't suit the movie.The best baddie is (and it pains me to say this as I think he's a complete and utter prick) is Triple-H, who walks the fine line between humour and bad-ass. All in all, this movie is good for an Action-Adventure movie but is shade inferior to the rest of the Blade Movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Blade:Trinity is a noble effort. Wesley Snipes again plays the day walker known as Blade. For those who don't know his history, he's 1/2 human, 1/2 vampire. With his sidekick, Whistler (Kris Kristofferson), they have been battling the forces of the undead. In this film, they hit a stumbling block. A group of vampires, lead by Danica Talos (Parker Posey, in a sexy turn), resurrects the original vampire, Dracula (Or Drake, played by Dominic Purcell), who has the ability to shape shift. They want Blade and they use the humans to get him to surface. Into the picture comes Whistler's daughter, Abigail (Jessica Biel)and Hannibal King (Ryan Reynolds), who use to be close enough to Danica. They belong to a group called The Nightstalkers, who use they're resources to help fight the vampires.The funny thing about the film is that you don't see that much of Blade. Compared to the previous films, Blade is pretty much pushed a bit to the background. It's loaded with a lot of action, but there are a couple of plot holes (Why would Drake pose as Whistler when everyone supposedly know that he's dead?).Good film, but the lamest in the series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sad way to end the trilogy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was rather surprised that they actually thought of producing a third movie considering that the second one was a rather poor film. Unfortunately this film was even poorer. The whole plot line was just so disjointed and unoriginal. It all started with the rather dull premise which frankly set the tone for the rest of the film.Also I also found the action scenes, which could have saved this movie despite it's faulty story, to be rather ordinary. Even the supposed big battle with the main enemy at the climax of the film didn't live up to expectations. All the time they were hyping on how " perfect" and "unbeatable" his opponent was. I was rather surprised that little was done in terms of defeating him. Can't help but say "what that's it".I was also quite surprised and amused that they cast Ryan Reynolds as one of the leads in a big action movie like this. The last time I saw him was in comedies: " Harold and Kumar" and "Van WIlder". I just couldn't help but chuckle when I saw him all buffed up and killing vampires.I think Wesley can breath a sigh of relief because he can finally move on to other project which perhaps can help his sagging career.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Blade II, but good in it's own right</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This latest installment (presumably the last) is an interesting film. It lacks the altogether cohesiveness "Blade II" had, but the kind of genre to which the Blade movies belong doesn't necessarily require a brilliant plot or script. Still, I felt they could have done a little better than Dracula. Just because he's the most famous vampire to date doesn't mean he has to be in every vampire movie or TV show (he made an appearance on the Buffy TV show a while back).Another thing that bugged me about this movie was Ryan Reynolds, aka Hannibal King. He was added to the movie to bring some comic relief, but the thing with these movies is they operate fine without such relief. King was less funny, and more fun to laugh at. Still, there were a few moments when he brought a genuine smile to my face.Finally, the vampires that were featured in this movie that set Dracula free are just kinda tossed in there. Again, these movies don't really need a strong explanation on everything, but "Blade II" actually did a really good job, and I felt that "Trinity" could have at least tried harder. I mean, in "Blade II" you knew why Damaskinos was doing what he was doing, and you were sympathetic towards characters like Nyssa and Nomak. But in this movie, you don't get the same kind of connection with the villains, which again I think would have been much appreciated.But enough bad stuff about the movie. For what it is - a vampire movie starring Wesley Snipes - it's pretty fun. The final fight scene between Dracula (I refuse to call him Drake) and Blade was just as ass-kicking as Blade and Nomak. I also liked the superfluous character that Triple H played - GOD knows wrestlers are terrible actors, but this is the one movie where wrestlers could have shone, and H did a great job as just being large, scary, imposing muscle. And while Whistler is missed, the expansion of the cast good guys does make the movie a little more dynamic. And - this might seem pointless, but bear with me - while I didn't like the fact that they used Dracula, I did like the plot behind Dracula and his character. The idea of the First Vampire, never had to evolve, and able to do everything any vampire has been able to do in any capacity is fun... just felt like they sold out by choosing Dracula, could have been a little more original. But still, nicely done.All in all, I would put this movie between "Blade" and "Blade II", with the latter being the best of the three. If you liked "Blade II", give this a whirl. If you liked "Blade", chances are you'll like this movie. And if you don't like the Blade movies but see this anyway, well, don't call it a bad movie if you knew you weren't gonna like it anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Action movie ... if it wouldn't be called "Blade"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all: This movie wasn't all that bad, if you think of it being an vampire action movie. If you keep in mind it is a blade sequel while watching it, it was just an average action movie... The plot of the movie...i won't describe once again..., because this has been done few times before, is not special but average and OK, so lets quickly go to the critic:Seeing this movie should make me, from the first second on to the last names in the credits, think "I'm seeing a thrilling and cool BLADE movie" But many times i had to take a closer look and recognize once again that this is supposed to be a sequel to the Blade franchises. That happened because King seemed to be more than just a supporting character, even the things you don't hear in the movie make you think that king has an exciting past, like how he became a vampire and so on.Just like in the "Alien" series every movie had a different director and so a very special look and style, which i found OK after watching blade: trinity.Goyer made the 3rd movie look more like an overview of the vampire actions and not focusing to much on blade, which i didn't liked although, Blade 2 also showed a side of the vampire-world including many new characters but still having blade as the coolest and best of them all.If i get directly to the movie i can pick up some good and some bad parts, first the good ones:This movie had some awesome music tracks in it, that made the movie really more fun to watch, because a continuous music underneath in a movie like this makes it really cool and some kind of epic. Beside of that the known street and city shots played faster than they are actually filmed (don't know the word for this technique sorry ;) )are in it, which are really beautiful this time.Yeah and now the bad things in it:The action sequences aren't that good you can actually see (esspecially at biel) that the action mostly comes from the camera and not from the actors, means that the actor hits a guys once and the camera is bouncing and afterwards effects are included... so that doesn't make a good action-scene. It's often that someone just hits 2 guys at the same time and then the action-scene is over... to fast !The actions in the movie happen to fast to care about them, the thing that happens with whistler ( i won't write it down because that would be to much of a Spoiler ) happens so fast, i didn't recognize what happened at first, because i didn't get the point why, i mean it was useless... and so many other scenes are, if Blade: Trinity would have been a 130 min. movie it maybe would have been OK, but yeah, as i already said it's happening to fast, to many new ideas involved which just won't touch you and can not develop. That drag down this movie a lot.Finally you can say, it is a movie you watch, maybe even enjoy it, and then forget about it. Let's see what Blade 4 will offer us, if there will be any, which i personally don't think.6 out of 10 From Germany -- Lou</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must admit i enjoyed the two previous Blade-movies quite a bit. They lifted the whole boring Vampire-genre a few notches in my opinion. So of course expectations for the third installment were pretty high.The Vampires have grown tired of hunting humans one on one, and most of all they have tired of the troubles with Blade. Therefore they start their "final solution" that includes waking up the original vampire: Dracula. At the same time the Vampires see to that Blade has the police on his tale while trying to fight the new Vampire threat.The style of the Blade-movies has stayed more or less intact throughout the franchise. Even though it's three movies with three different directors this is immediately recognizable as a Blade-movie. David S. Goyer, who has also written the two previous Blade-movies, is both writing and directing this movie. Something that he does competently enough, even if he doesn't reach the heights of Guillermo Del Toro's directing for Blade II.The action scenes are mostly well done. There is nice martial arts work as well as swordplay and Wesley Snipes looks as strong and agile as before. What i think becomes annoying after a while though is Ryan Reynolds constant comments. I know he's there for comic relief, but there is just too much of it. The acting is not much to comment really, it is what it is. And i don't think anyone watches Blade for the acting anyway. It's acceptable at least.So this is not a disappointment. It doesn't quite reach up to the quality and entertainment of the first two Blade-installments. But it's entertaining enough and it doesn't shame the two previous films. Recommended for fans of the previous movies.</fullReview>

One good thing was Drac loved his look a good change from long dark hair norm look and his monster change was ace but again would of liked to of seen more of him beating Blade after all he is the big daddy of vamps.So its 7 out of 10 maybe a 8 at a push.

There were also two great characters introduced (a gorgeous woman vampire slayer who is deadly with a high tech bow and arrow) and a guy (an ex-vampire, turned wise-cracking vampire slayer) as helpers to Blade in his war on the vampire nation.In this one the vampires sensing they are losing, search out the original vampire of their species (he was Dracula among his many other identities). They hope that through him they will achieve the ability to be out in the light, making them truly immortal! The slayers on the other hand, are seeking this Dracula to use his blood to destroy all the world's vampires.The fight scenes get a little corny (a la Kill Bill) at times but they are well choreographed to strong rock guitar music. The movie is not as good as the prior two but it is better than a lot of the action films, especially the zombie films that Hollywood seems to be spitting out today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So tacky</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all i'd like to excuse my English, i'm Swedish and my English might be a bit off.Anyways to my 2 cents.The script was so god damn awful. I enjoyed Blade 1 extremely much and Blade 2 wasn't all bad either. But Blade Trinity is just plain crap. It's been discussed earlier but listening to music while doing melee-combat against multiple opponents in an uncontrolled environment is suicide and especially since the opponents are vampires, which are supposed to be far superior to humans in every way. I guess there are worthless vampires that humans should be able to handle but these are supposed to be the cream and butter seeing as they resurrected Dracula and everything. And what is up with the predator-mouths on Dracula and the dogs? Ripoff..That leads my to Dracula, he is supposed to be the GREATEST vampire ever which would actually make him the mightiest creature on earth, assuming there are nothing more evolved than vampires. Still Blade, the crossbreed that had problems ,including being captured, with normal vampires in the previous movies, had no particular hardships beating this opponent in a sword fight which relies greatly on agility and strength. If he would have defeated Dracula with ranged weaponry i would not have been as ticked about this but in a sword fight i would assume a supernatural, super evolved creature with centuries of close combat experience would be the clear winner.I really like Ryan Reynolds in the comedies and sitcoms he has acted in but he was not at all action-material. The funny sidekick did just not work in this movie. He had a few funny lines but they didn't add anything to the movie.Also in the end he says, as narrator, that the hunt continues or something like that. Wasn't this virus supposed to be the final solution that would wipe vampires off the planet? Weak.On a side note i am getting really sick and tired of the henchmen in movies such as these. It seems gas masks and urban warfare armor is the hot ticket at the moment (remove gas masks and replace with motorcycle-helmets in some movies). Seeing as they are wearing this equipment, including kevlar-vests, why the hell do they go for close combat instead of ranged? I have some military experience and engaging in close combat is an absolute last solution (unless you are on a mission that requires stealth and silence i guess, but this was clearly not such a situation), it is extremely dangerous and very hard in medium /heavy kevlar vests.3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT and tons of spoilers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The second Blade film was the exception to the rule that sequels are always worse than the original. The second film is so good it makes watching the first film difficult. Now we have Blade Trinity and the rule about sequels is proved true, sequels are rarely as good as the the film that precedes it.The plot has Blade wanted for murder after the vampires set him up by killing a human. The plot line is merely a "deus ex machina" used to get everything going and its importance to the plot comes and goes on a whim.This film takes everything that has gone before and thrown it to the wind. Nothing here follows what has gone before. From the way the vampires operate to the way they all have seem to have plastic teeth in their mouths, there is nothing about these vampires that fits with what has gone before. The history of the vampires is rewritten yet again and the split monster mouths that the reapers in the last film had are suddenly the norm, to the point that dogs have them (which is way cool).Blade is a cypher that we know less about than before. He is a tight lipped bad ass that looks bored by the proceedings. His Night Stalker friends, while intriguing, seem to have come out of another movie.Its awful. Even the fights plunge head long into cartoonish violence thats completely not in keeping with the the earlier films.(I won't even mention the acting because its just too dumb)If you liked the earlier films re-watch them, this movie is not worth bothering with.4 out of 10 for a few cool moments but mostly this is a lost cause.</fullReview>

Let me get this straight, are the writers running out of bad guys or they are not just creative enough to invent one? a little piece of advice for the next installment, make a bad guy that is just like blade only stronger, so it will be worth anticipating. I also feel Guilleromo del Torro should be brought back to direct the next installment, i was over impressed with his work in Blade two.

		<fullReview>Main reason this didn't work? Direction. If you step back, the over all story as well as 'most' of the dialogue with the addition of the other characters is well intentioned and could have worked.How the storyline was made to look and play out was interesting yet failed in execution. Overall feel, sight and vibe of the film were absent making this a possibility with all the right parts yet someone not apt enough to put them all together. One word... David S. Goyer. (too bad too...this could have been 3 good ones in a row)If David would have stuck solely to writing this third installment yet having the touch of say, the last director Guiellermo del torro (hope I got it right) then I believe this film would have come out looking a whole lot better. More to the true vibe of the two previous films giving this series more bite than bark.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, let me begin by saying that Blade III didn't need to be this bad. A good collection of actors can't make up for a horrible script and ridiculously poor directing. Blade 1 &amp; 2 have always been good B-movie action extravaganzas. Nice on the big screen, great on DVD. Unfortunately , Blade Trinity wouldn't even work as a Sci-Fi channel feature. Trinity is nothing more than a bad collection of CGI action sequences, staggered visuals and flat one-liners, that attempt to extend some story about Blade saving man-kind once again from the clutches of vampires. There are unbelievable weapons, very little gore, and no horror to speak of... which makes the movie somewhat pointless (unless you were hoping for a two hour music video). There are more gadgets than you can shake a stick at, but nobody seems to have a day job to pay for all that gear. Jessica Biel and Ryan Renyolds have no chemistry, and no purpose, other than to steal screen time away from Snipes. Dracula, stomps around, shirtless, like Scott Stapp from Creed and is neither creepy nor menacing. Laughably bad is a short part/cameo played by Natasha Lyonne who plays the token handicapped computer nerd. Her post mortem video message had me laughing out loud in the aisle.This stinker will surely will guarantee that Blade IV will go direct to video. 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as the first two but entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a big blade fan, in fact a fan of most comic to movie franchiser's (except Daredevil) and really had high hopes for Blade Trinity. In that I was disappointed. I was expected tons of action, strong plot, and good acting. I got part of it The Action The action scenes were good, when they occurred. As always the final action scene had me smiling, sitting in the theater commenting "yeah!" but the rest of the film lacked the action or the suspense. The Plot The general plot of bringing Dracula from the dead to kill Blade and create a more perfect species of vampires was good. (I mean after all thats basically the plot of all the blades. Blade I - Resurrect the blood god...more perfect day walking vampire. Blade II - cross strains of DNA...more perfect day walking vampire, even though the plan failed ala reapers. But you get the point same basic plot). I liked the introduction of the nightstalkers and Hannibal King. I read a few of the comics, so I was really looking forward to seeing him. ONe thing that really bothered me, and another user posted this in his comment, is why did Dracula who was there to kill Blade and very confident in his ability to do so, run. I mean he didn't just run. The fool booked out Olympic style. I didn't understand the purpose in him running. Either don't have them meet face to face until the end or get a little battle going on. Also did anyone notice how Dracula and the dogs resembled Reapers! I was surprisingly happy with Jessica Biel's character. She kicked butt (almost more than Blade). You can definitely tell their going for a Nightstalkers spin off. If they did I would go see it. The acting/cast It sucked! I know this is an action film and no one is going for an Oscar, but come on now. Parkey Posey did not belong in that film in any way shape or form. Her words were void of emotion, she didn't pull off evil at all. She just shouldn't been there. I never questioned the casting of Dominic Purcell until I read all these reviews and boards, before seeing the movie, that said he looked like a German bouncer. So all while I was watching it I kept thinking "He DOES look like a German bouncer...and acts like one too!" So I kind of ruined that for myself by checking out what people thought first. Ryan Reynolds got very buff for the film. He had a lot of one liners, but looking at those abs and the divot/V I didn't mind. He got his ass whooped a lot though. For someone who use to be a vampire and has been in the fight for so long, it would seem he could managed not get strangled at every opportunity. The Blade Shout Out! I am so surprised no one noticed this. There was a scene in the film when the Nightstalkers were talking to Blade about the possible resurrection of Dracula. They showed him a Marvel Comic "The Tomb of Dracula" as a way of explaining. The Tomb of Dracula is where Blade made his first appearance, and after a few cameos in there he spun off to his own comic. I thought that scene was really classic. An homage to the beginning. (This may be another reason I didn't have a problem with the Dracula plot, after all thats how Blade got his start.)In conclusion Its entertaining, but a bit of a disappointment to the Blade Franchise. If you liked the comic, then see the movie. If you didn't like Blade I and/or II don't bother with this one. If you go with no expectations, then will enjoy the movie a lot more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went in to see Blade Trinity having enjoyed the first two movies and came out having found the film entertaining but finding myself rather disappointed with a number of things.1. The plot was textbook, you knew everything that was coming well ahead of it. No neat twists, no surprises, nothing.2. Blade had Stephen Dorff who made an impressive Deacon Frost, Blade II had Luke Goss also impressive as Nomak, however Blade Trinity's choice of bad guys were poor, weak dialogue and wooden acting at best, you know somethings wrong when the best of the vampires was Triple H!!!I would recommend seeing it if you enjoyed the other two - but its definitely the weakest of the three Blade films.</fullReview>

Wesley Snipes obviously stopped hitting the gym for this one. He was still a beast though. Jessica Biel was extremely ridiculously hot and knew how to beat some ass down. As for Ryan Reynolds. Hes the man, simply put. Everything he says is funny as hell. Adding Triple H to the cast was huge. Hes a monster and they needed a huge vampire who is just bad ass. But Dracula...come on baby...Nomac would have whooped that ass. They made him seem that he was like the greatest since sliced bread but he lasted a matter of moments in a dead even fight with Blade. An extra hot thing for this flick is the skeleton mask that one of the "Lost Boys" wore when he attacked Jessica Biel in the beginning. I want one. Go see it, enjoy it and stare at Biel....shes out of control.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie Blade Trinity was an entertaining movie to say the least. It filled my thirst for action, violence, and funny one-liners, for now. The movie though was a lacking in some important aspects, namely depth, plot, and a better cast of secondary villains.The second Blade movie had the same team aspect that seen in all of the Blade movies, but the one thing that it had that I feel Blade Trinity lacked was a strong assortment of secondary villains. Trinity has its usual foray the strong vamp, the Asian vamp, the dominatrix vamp, and the crazy vamp that annoys everyone. The sad truth is that these characters were lacking in everything. Parker Posey, the actress who played Danica Talos, the dominatrix and pseudo leader vamp was lacking in the essentials of a strong female villain. The actress tried but did not capture the truly evil aspects that her character should have personified. In a scene were she is torturing one of are hero's she is supposed to be menacing but instead is just plain annoying.Now the band of hero's in the film are a nice batch of auctioneers. Snipes does his usual Blade routine and Whistler adds what little spice and depth the movie had. I actually thought that Whistler was the most in-depth character in the movie. Second to Whistler in the character department would have to be Hannible King played by Ryan Reynolds. King dispatches most of the one-liners in the film and actually does a good job of making the film humorous at spots without dragging the film down. Next of course is the enchanting Jessica Biel who was not so much enchanting in the film as just there. She plays Abigail but does not add the flavor needed for the film.I should also note that Dominic Purcell, who played the infamous Dracula in the film did an excellent job. He brought the true evil of Dracula out, I only wish that he had more spotlight time in the film. If he had I feel he would have given a more in-depth peak of the true character of Dracula.The plot of the film is pretty standard, Dracula's brought back and Blade and his trio must stop him. Plot elements are put in the film to add to a way to end the franchise, but so are certain holes. The origin of Dracula is never explained and though the reasons for Dracula's slumber are pseudo given they are never fully explained.The weapons in the movie are cool but are not given as much spotlight as they were in the last two movies. As you will see a weapon used in the beginning of the film that is not used any more time after.The stunts in the movie were also enjoyable but I wish the fight scene between Drake (Dracula) and Blade had been longer and in a wider area of space. The other two movies feature a final fight in a large area with plenty of light and camera angle glory. The final fight in the end of the movie is dark and cramped. I would have liked to see the lighted form of Dracula for once in the movie but I was left disappointed.All in all the movie was a good action movie that managed to keep my interest through the whole movie, and in some cases laugh. I give the movie a 7 because event though it lacks it does hold a pinnacle of vampire goodness that is missed at times. Plus some of the action sequences and shots were really artistic and original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went in to this movie with higher expectations. While it was good, it could have been better. In my opinion I like Blade better as a one man show, with Wislter to slide back on. While Van Wilder does provide a lot of comic relief and acts well, and JB looks great, Blade just kick more butt alone. Plus where have this underground clan been the whole time??? ***SPOILERS ABOUT COMBAT AHEAD*** Also Blades combat 'toys' were less cool and he rarely used them. His sword handle blades did not make an appearance, the cool whip blade thing did not make an appearance after blade even told Whistler they were nice (and they were). All in all the movie was good, and the fist action and the sword play in the final battle was nice, I like the bow and arrow thing JB was rocking. The plot was weaker IMHO but my buddie like it better than the second, I disagree there, see for yourself. If you liked the first to you'll respect this one!</fullReview>

I haven't seen the second of this trilogy, so I can't comment on that, but this movie seemed consistent with the first movie in production value (as far as I can recall). The effects were MUCH better (remember that CG blood in the first), but the overall movie was about the same in quality. If you enjoyed the first movie then I would guess you'd also like this one. Nothing too deep here, a good action flick, just sit there and enjoy the ultra ultra violence. Snipes was great as Blade and this movie is worth a look for action movie fans.</fullReview>

Though there were a few moments that made me cringe from stupidity, the overall movie was very well done, flowed quickly enough, and made sense. I would have to give this movie at least a 7/10 biases aside (I was expecting another Blade/Blade II).

		<fullReview>Wesley Snipes and Kris Kristofferson reprise their roles and the hybrid vampire hunter and his partner / armorer. While this film lacks some of the more visceral elements of the first two, it makes up in action what it lacks in darkness. Dominic Purcell is perfect in the role of Drake, the true immortal who is risen from his sleep by the desperate Danica Talos, played by Parker Posey. Parker does a nice job if you take into account a vampire like that might be a bit on the emo side, and the sarcasm between her and her former lover, played nicely by Ryan Reynolds, plays a major part of the script. Reynolds role is non-stop smart ass, and it suits him well. Triple H does an adequate job as the strong arm vampire, but my advice to Paul is not to give up his day job. Jessica Biel shines as Whistler's daughter, and her acting is one of the saving graces of the film. All in all, we do have to remember this is a comic book based in an alternate universe (Canada qualifies, I do believe) and the characters are two dimensional, which is expected. The cinematography and photography are great, the action scenes are exceptional, and we get the impression Blade may not come back to the screen. But who knows, there may be another threat coming up soon. Rated R for violence, language, and brief nudity (Jessica Biel in the shower....oh yeah), this is a collectible is you are a fan of Blade or just a fan of the comic (graphic novel) genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blade Trinity Not As Good As The Second One But Not Bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Blade Trinity is not as good as the second but it's not ad from writer/director David Goyer whose admirable in this third film in the trilogy but the lack of character development, suspense, and a rushed finale is what weighed the film down the most. Don't get me wrong the movie isn't bad action wise it just could've been better. Wesley Snipes returns once again as Blade and he still proves to be effective in the role especially during the action/fight sequences. Kris Kristofferson reprises his part as Blades mentor Whistler and he's okay but his role unfortunately is cut really short because he's written out very early on in the movie. Jessica Biel is good as Whistler's tough daughter Abigail who can certainly kick butt when she wants to. The one to stand out in the cast is Ryan Reynolds as Hannibal King a member of the Nightstalkers who hunt vampires. Reynolds brings much comic relief to the movie and proves to be a very talented actor. The rest of the cast including Parker Posey, John Michael Higgins, and James Remar are impressive in their limited screen time but aren't given much to do. Wrestler Triple HHH and Natasha Lyonne are okay in their small parts in the movie but aren't really developed that much. Dominic Purcell is convincing as Dracula the first real vampire but his showdown at the end with Blade felt rushed like in the second one and the character wasn't as great as Goss was in the sequel as Nomack. Purcell still makes the best of his villain role in the movie none the less who proves to be a challenge but is easily defeated. The action/fight sequences are well executed but they get a little old after a while. The special effects are still cool and the film did move at a steady pace. Blade Trinity isn't the worst movie I've ever seen it just could've been better. Overall the film based on a comic book is a flawed but decent with enough martial arts action, impressive special effects, humor, and good performances by the cast (especially Reynolds) who make this third entry into the Blade series worth watching once.</fullReview>

I only hope that the movie makers realise this and call it a day before they decide to milk some more from this once excellent incarnation of a dark comic character.Jessica Biel and Ryan Reynolds, along with Snipes of course; all do a good job in their respective roles, the action is still plentiful and the story is pretty good, its a simple case of enough is enough i'm afraid.Still fun to watch, but don't expect to be as entertained as you were by the first two outings.7/10</fullReview>

That's 0 for acting, 0 for plot, +2 for special effects and a +1 for directing.The whole iPod advert was the icing on the cake, what a joke. They might as well have stopped the action mid-fight while Snipes took a sip of Pepsi and ate a couple of Doritos while staring into the camera Wayne's World style. "Woa!! iPods are offishul ninja wepuns, I best gets me wahn then!". cocks.If we all wish hard enough, maybe we can harness the power of positive thinking- and give all the people who had anything to do with making this complete piece of horse manure a terminal illness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They finally Schumachered the Blade series.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Blade Trinity. A hip, trendy action-comedy obviously aimed at MTV-brainwashed youth with a 2 minute attention span. This, in itself, could've been done well as it's own movie. But to ruin the good name of a respectable franchise like this is unforgivable, especially when it's David S. Goyer (the writer for the first two Blades) at the helm. Let's start with the fact that Whistler, played excellently as always by Kristofferson, is killed... again. Except rather than a moving moment between Blade and his mentor like in the first movie, we get one second and a bunch of small references throughout the rest of the film. Worst possible way to get rid of a star character. In Whistler's place, we get the Nightstalkers, which consist of the annoying comic relief Hannibal King (Ryan Reynolds) and the hot femme fatale Abigail Whistler (Jessica Biel). Yup, Whistler has a daughter, which completely cheapens his character and renders his motive for hunting vampires in the first place null and void. Biel wasn't terrible, aside from the shameless iPod plug, but should've been a whole different character. How Hannibal actually made it to the end of the film I'll never figure out, because I was expecting Blade to kick his ass any minute. The rest are forgettable to say the least. The main baddie in Trinity is none other than the King of Vampires, or at least a big muscle head who thinks he's the King of Vampires. I was psyched when I heard Dracula was going to be the final Blade bad guy, but now I understand why he was almost never shown in previews. This guy is completely wrong for his role, wrong for a Blade villain, and looks more like the bouncer at a blood club than the successor to Frost and Nomak. This can of course be attributed to bad casting, but not helping matters were the movie's near non-existent character development and the fact that most of his scenes were just recycled from Frost in the first Blade. This guy is easily the worst Dracula ever. HHH plays a wannabe Quinn, except instead of cool and funny he's just whiny and stupid. The rest of the vamps are throwaway and only there to get staked, which isn't that great since the action scenes are just the same-old same-old we've seen in Blade and Blade 2. We get one cool new weapon, a UV laser bow, but it's only used once against some generic vampire thugs. One thing I was happy to see was that the blood farm idea from the first Blade finally got used, but in the end, it just shows you just how much of a missed opportunity this film was. If you haven't seen this, don't waste your time. Just stick to the first two, and get Guillermo Del Toro's Hellboy, the movie this should've been.OH yeah, notice how I didn't mention Snipes once in this review? That's because he plays Blade with no emotion, no charisma, and seems bored beyond belief with the role. It's like he's embarrassed to even be involved with this project, not that I can blame him, and he almost feels like a supporting character in his own movie. Truly sad way to end the franchise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wesley Snipes returns as Blade who this time takes on Dracula, while also hiding from the cops. Seems that Blade has accidentally killed a human so now the police are looking to hunt our favorite day-walker. Also this time Blade is aided by a pack of soldiers who hunt vampires. Blade:Trinity emerges as quite a disappointing feature, I think the problem is due to the rushed script which Goyer has filmed. For instance we learn little about Dracula, therefore his villain is the most lightweight of the series and Snipes this time seems extremely annoyed to be here. The only real life of the movie comes from Ryan Reynolds and Parker Posey who at least play the parts with enthusiasm. The action sequences are okay but pale in comparison to the other two.

		<shortDescription>a disappointing finale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Blade was one of the better comic book movies ever made. Blade II was fun to see gruesome images and some OK fights. Blade III just flat out failed miserably. It wasn't even entertaining. There was nothing scary about the movie. The main bad guy couldn't act. Van Wilder was magically placed in this movie with some muscles to give a joke every time he opened his mouth. I got a sense that kristopherson and Snipes really wanted to be rid of this mess of a franchise. I would think there would be this big finale, but i was wrong. I guess a big finale wasn't on their minds. The fights were lame and the story was a mess. It seems like Blade is in a different movie that went straight to video. Jessica Biel's character was pointless and poorly done (producers trying to get the males since there is a lack of good action scenes). And a bow and arrow? give me a break. Let's hope that this is the last installment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Blade has to join with a group of "Nightstalkers" to defeat Dracula himself, after he's set-up by killing a human disguised as a vampire.I enjoyed the first two Blade movies. But this one left me cold. The introduction of the unneeded and unfunny "comedy" side-kicks, combined with David Goyer's poor directing makes this outing a chore to sit through. Triple H is highly underused and has maybe one good line throughout. The fight scenes are far from as great as they were in the first two films. Needless to say I was very disappointed and the movie took me back to those early movies based on Marvel comic properties before they got good.My Grade: D+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know what happened on the sets but Trinity is amateurish in all aspects and doesn't come anywhere near close to the first two Blades. Scenes jump into each other without much care for pace and flow, the music is constant and instead of adding to the mood just gets in the way, and the whole thing just seems like someone's first attempt at film-making. Which is probably rather close to the truth looking at director Goyer's IMDb resume. I've read a few rumours of Wesley Snipes' behaviour on set and after seeing the film I can only guess that it stems from his disappointment in the way the film was developing. Hopefully if there were to be a Blade 4 a more competent crew will be hired.Verdict: Very disappointing. 3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's not supposed to be "realistic".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What happened to the days of yore when people could sit back and enjoy a movie for what it was, a way to get away from reality for an hour or two? Now, people have to point out that the movies are not realistic and how these types of things would not happen in real life. If they happened in real life, then why would we need the movies? No this Blade was not as gritty as the first and not as **itty as the second. Shhhhh.. This one was actually quite entertaining though. The addition of Ryan Reynolds as the ever sarcastic, tart tongued Hannibal King was a breath of fresh air. Jessica Biel held her own as Abigail. I have seen written on here that Domenic Purcell was miscast. I do not see that as the case. Dracula, or Drake, as he was christened for the current era, was played as a gorgeous, cunning, soft spoken man who secretly housed one of the most evil hearts ever to walk the Earth. As far as his wardrobe, well, it was too Queer Eye for the Straight guy for me, but I am not GQ.The fight scenes, I do agree with others who have posted here, were poorly done. They went too fast, the focus was off in many of them, and whoever had the idea to split screen fights, should be slapped repeatedly with a rather large lead pipe. Wesley Snipes did not do as much fighting, or as intense fighting as his fans are used to seeing. Could it be that his age is starting to catch him? I would recommend this movie to those who can enjoy it for what it is..a good way to kill a few hours laughing and oohing and aahing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this film after hearing very bad things about it but thought I would give it the benefit of the doubt as the other 2 films in the blade series were fairly entertaining, not special but not bad either.So about half an hour into this movie I realised that all the bad things i had heard were right, but I decided to stick with it anyway.Certain things about this movie were just wrong. The plot was virtually non existent, don't get me wrong there was a plot a very dodgy one, which has been done in different ways before. However the film seemed to focus more on mindless slow motion up close action/battle scenes than on the story.Before I watched this film I was expecting the usual cheesy lines and actions that you normally get during one of these films but when Abi Whistler decides to use an iPod while going into battle, I was left speechless. I mean what was that all about? MASSIVE Idiot! Also when "bad ass" Blade says Koochy Koochy Koo to a baby well I dunno what all that was about either but it just didn't fit in at all.Well i almost got through this movie but during the last 10 minutes I fell asleep and missed the end, being tired probably did me a favour really as those last 10 minutes of my life went on something useful like sleep and not the bag of dirt known as Blade Trinity.1 last thing I will say is if you haven't yet seen this movie and are planning on watching it in the near future.... unlucky! I wouldn't say don't watch it (altho this would be wise,)but don't expect much either when you do, its terrible.My mark for this would be Dog Dirt/10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Uninspired and forgettable sequel centers around vampire hunter Blade as he faces his greatest threat in the form of Dracula, the original vampire who's been resurrected in an effort to bring about the evolution of his race. In addition, Blade's identity is disclosed to the human population who fear he's a vicious sociopath, and he must join a team of hunters known as the Nightstalkers in order to survive. Effects are good but the action scenes are disappointingly mild, the acting extremely one-note, and the dialogue beyond laughable. Posey has an especially irritating role as a seductive vampire, and star Snipes just seems to be going through the motions. Could have worked, but the film's focal point seems to be corny humor and dumb wisecracks. **</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unnecessary &amp; unfortunate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>... which is upsetting since I really enjoy the Blade series. I'll be brief though: I watched the first Blade and honestly believed it to be something revolutionary in comic-book movies. It was made for adults. It didn't have unnecessary sex or generic characteristics like most studio productions. It was something that was true to the world it was defining.As for Trinity, well, it was an attempted cash-haul from what I can tell. Allow me to break this down into 3 basic parts.(1) Ads in the film Yes, there are blatant ads for GMC trucks and even more so for the Apple iPod. I don't need to know how easily songs can be organized on an MP3 player. And since my ticket price wasn't subsidized by these ads, I felt no reason to have them thrown at me. Plus, I'd like to know why hip-hop was chosen as the background music? I mean, there was little to no hip-hop culture present in the movie. It just seemed to cheapen the music because it felt out of place and undefined, and another cash-in.(2) Dracula references Stoker Uh, yeah ... rather than adding anything original or unique to this mammoth set-up of a character, they simply explained him with: "Read Dracula by Bram Stoker". That really sucked. I understood the assumed humour there, but way to bite off that handle of originality.(3) Pick a character, flush them out It seems that they started to define a character, and then would jump suddenly to another one. And then they would drop certain aspects of characters when it wasn't useful. At one point Reynolds and Triple H duke it out, and Reynolds is able to hold up in a one-on-one fist fight. I mean, I would have a hard time buying that if Triple H wasn't a vampire that couldn't be hurt by any of Reynold's mortal knuckle thrusts.Anyhow, it's time for class, so I'm gonna finish. I know a lot of people who found the movie entertaining enough and enjoyed it. I found no value to it myself though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blade vs. Dracula - the winner? - Just see "Blade: Trinity"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I scroll through my vote history - centering on 1998's "Blade" and its sequel, 2002's "Blade II" - I've found that I rated both of those films with a solid "10." I rated "Blade: Trinity" with a "7." So what went wrong?First of all, "Blade" is one of Marvel Comics' most versatile and overlooked characters, since on more than a few occasions, he has teamed up with Peter Parker a.k.a. Spider-Man to hunt down Morbius ("the living vampire") and other bloodsucking nasties.Wesley Snipes returns in the third (and possibly final) "Blade" film, and as it opens in the Syria desert, four vampires, led by Danica Talos (Parker Posey), stumble onto the tomb of Dracula (Dominic Purcell). It would be a bit of an understatement to say that he isn't exactly happy to be awake, since right off the bat he tears off one of their heads.Meanwhile, Blade and Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) are continuing their lonely quest of eradicating vampires on the streets of some nameless city. They have managed to land at the top of the F.B.I.'s most wanted list (topping Bin Laden?), since Blade is regarded as a murderous psychopath and his claims of vampires are simply laughed off as paranoia.Blade is eventually captured, and then rescued by Hannibal King (Ryan Reynolds) and Whistler's only surviving daughter Abigail (Jessica Biel). They're both the leaders of the "Nightstalkers," a youthful group of vampire hunters that could be considered the human equivalent of the late Deacon Frost's (Stephen Dorff from the first "Blade" film) youthful generation of upstarts.From the get-go, there's a flaw in the story, beginning with the mention that Dracula is Blade's nemesis for this third entry. Dorff's Deacon Frost (from "Blade") and Luke Goss's Nomak (from "Blade II") were pretty scary guys, and formidable opponents to our hero who was played densely by Snipes.Now we have Purcell's Dracula, who is quite scary and sadistic on his own, but you have to wonder if they were running out of bad guys for Blade to face, that they have to go back and get the one that started it all? First time director David S. Goyer, who penned both of the first two "Blade" films, shows competency but somehow or another the project just never seems to come together like "Blade" and "Blade II" did.Both of the first two movies utilized strong visual aesthetics, outlandish gore, Hong Kong-inspired action sequences (particularly evident in the first movie), and a cynical-brand sense of humor that undercut much of the action. "Blade: Trinity" has all of that, but for some reason it just doesn't connect.On the plus side, while this movie is certainly a step down from the first two, it is nonetheless a fitting conclusion to the trilogy, if that's what it indeed is.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good film not the best of the trilogy tho</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have enjoyed the previous 2 Blade films and was looking forward to Blade Trinty quite a lot. The plot seemed quite good, the introduction of Dracula was promising to. But to the film, it started off similar to the previous 2 with Blade kicking some ass, after a brief introduction by Ryan Reynolds. The involvement of Blade does not seem as much as in the previous 2 films, maybe due to the great roles played by Jessica Biel and Ryan Reynolds. It has to be said in my opinion Ryan Reynolds was the best part of the film he gave comical relief and had good fighting exchanges with Triple H, who didn't do to bad for his first role.I wont go into much detail about the rest of the film for those that have not seen it but if you want to lose your mind for s while, Blade Trinity will do the job very well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as the original, but better than the second.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ryan Reynolds stole the show, playing ex-vampire, Hannibal King. It seemed like in every line Reynolds had something catchy to say. In Blade Trinity, as well as being up against vampires, now Blade (Wesley Snipes) has to face the human race. However, we forget all about that after the first half hour or so. In Blade Trinity, Blade goes toe to toe against Dracula himself or Drake as he's called in the film, played by Dominic Purcell. However, Parker Posey plays the devious Danica Talos, who I thought did a poor job acting wise. Another person who I believe won't get any more acting jobs in Hollywood anytime soon is Paul Michael Levesque, or he's better known in the wrestling ring as Triple H, unlike his friend Dwayne " The Rock" Johnson, Triple H doesn't bring that same charisma onto the set and most of his lines sound forced. However, I loved Jessica Biel as Abigail Whistler. I would suggest see the seeing the other two Blade films first and then going to see this one, because they hint on some of the things that were introduced in the other two movies, such as the idea of "familiars" and the other two movies might give you a further and more in depth explanation about Blade and Kris Kristofferson's character, although Kristofferson isn't in this one that much. Overall, I gave Blade Trinity 7.5 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A big disappointment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I give this 2 stars out of 10.I have not been to the movie theater for awhile because I was busy with work. I recently had some time and was eager to see a movie. I do not really care for Christmas theme movies so I chose Blade Trinity.....big mistake.While this movie is called Blade Trinity, it should really be called Blade 3. It is about Blade, half human and half vampire, who is on a mission to eradicate all vampires. What they really should have done is eradicate this movie instead.In this movie, his main sidekick is killed and Blade teams ups with the sidekicks daughter played by Biel. The head vampires, desperate to defeat Blade, finds and wakes up the first vampire, Dracula, to kill Blade.The premise sounds interesting but unfortunately the story just does not measure up to it. In Blade 1, you had the one liners from Blade to give it the comic effect but it was not overly done and was appropriately placed. Here, inane one liners abound, and not just from Blade but from every single person. It was really annoying.You had too many characters but not enough development to make you connect with any of the characters. For instance, after Blade's sidekick dies, he teams up with his daughter. Well, what is she like, how did she come to be a vampire slayer, why haven't Blade's sidekick ever mention about her to him and so forth. I mean, all she does is support blade in killing vampires but there is all these issues not are not covered in this movie. Admittedly, this is suppose to be a horror/action movie and not some drama but it never hurts to have some good dialogues interspersed throughout the movie. As is, all you have in this movie is a whole load of stupid banter between characters with no substance. This combination makes for a bad movie.This is how I would characterize Blade 1: a good overall movie although I found some of the story and character development to be flawed but worth watching.Blade 2: This is a more serious movie with less stupid one liners but a good story development. This movie is worth watching.Blade 3: This movie sucks. Wait for it to come out in your neighborhood video store.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blade Trinity blows goat (I have proof)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe Wesley Snipes is getting tired of playing the lugubrious vampire slayer. Or maybe, after three movies, screenwriter David S. Goyer is getting bored writing the humorless lead character. This would explain why, in "Blade Trinity," vampire turned good guy Hannibal King gets all the good lines. Hannibal's potty-mouthed sense of humor seems imported from a Kevin Smith movie and Blade is reduced to his straight man. Trinity feels like an attempt by Goyer to set-up a new franchise starring the Nightstalkers, a group of anti-vampire young guns lead by Hannibal (Ryan Reynolds) and Abigail Whistler (Jessica Biel), the daughter of Blade's mentor.In the first two films of the series, Blade was a seamless combination of the 70's blaxploitation movie cool of John Shaft and the violent edge of Japanese anime's Vampire Hunter D. Now, with the Nightstalkers in tow, Blade comes off like a grumpy old vampire slayer telling the kids to keep the racket down and get off his lawn. In one scene, he chastises the Nightstalkers, saying "What do think this is? A game? Look at how you're dressed!" Indeed, Hannibal and Abigail run around half naked, showing off chiseled abs and sinewy biceps. Meanwhile, Blade, bundled up for the winter in a leather trench coat, black vest and long-sleeved, red crew neck, looks like his mother dressed him. Of course, his mother was a vampire.The plot of "Trinity," such that there is one, has the Vampire Nation led by Danica Talons (the hilarious Parker Posey, in a film that probably cost more than the rest of her filmography combined) awakening the original Count Dracula to aid in their war against Blade. According to the movie, Dracula was born in ancient Samaria and has spent the past few generations slumbering in Iraq. Can someone please tell me then, why he comes out of his tomb looking like Nick Lachey from MTV's "Newlyweds?" And while I can accept that Dracula speaks perfect English, when he starts using phrases like "parting gift" I have to ask myself, has Dracula been watching The Game Show Network? I have a great deal of affection for "Blade II," which was directed by Guillermo Del Toro. Writer/director Goyer brings no visual style to the table and the cinematography makes the film look like a documentary shot on 16mm film in the mid seventies. The colors in the daylight exteriors are so washed out, they make Joe Carnahan's steely blue "Narc" look positively lush by comparison. And while we're on the subject of daylight exteriors, didn't Goyer get the memo that this is a vampire movie? I know that Blade is a "day walker," but who wants to see the world's greatest vampire slayer chase the world's oldest vampire through an apartment building in the middle of the afternoon like Agent Smith and Neo in the first "Matrix?" Ultimately, the mark of a good comic book movie is that it's entertaining enough to distract you from the obvious questions that would render most comic book movies completely implausible. For example: Abigail's habit of listening to her i-Pod while hunting vampires. At best, this is a riff on Gary Oldman's Beethoven loving sociopath in "The Professional" and at worst, it's blatant product placement. However, it begs the question: when hunting hoards of vampires, wouldn't you want your hearing unobstructed? Also, for all the cash the Nightstalkers must spend on high-tech equipment, they spend an awful lot of time engaging the vampires in hand to hand combat. Since vampire disintegrate when pierced with silver, wouldn't a pair of silver, spiked boxing gloves save these guys a lot of energy? Maybe Blade should ditch the Nightstalkers and do a Marvel Team-Up with Wolverine?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blade trinity bites</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed the 1st and 2nd movies well enough. And I had high hopes for this 3rd installment, having read a bit of the source comics. I realize things are going to be changed in adaptation, but the Hannibal King character was completely ruined. In the books, he was a full vampire trying to redeem his soul, and for that reason Blade was willing to work with him. Goyer really should have kept that intact - would have made for some character dynamics and plot elements that could have been MUCH more interesting than King just having been a former familiar and over-the-top comic relief wannabe.The worst problem with the movie was the directing, which was shoddy throughout. Long-winded dialogue when there should have been more action, action when we should have gotten more story. There are some good actors in there, but their performances had all the nuance of high-school theatre. Wesley Snipes is perfect in the role, and he's always great to watch doing combat, but in the few scenes where he was giving us something to watch, all we got was jerky camera movements and way-too-close close-ups.In short, if you were a fan of the comics this movie claims to be based on, you may find yourself disappointed by this movie. If you enjoyed the first 2 and are hoping for a good follow-up, again, you may be less than impressed. I'm sure ready for the franchise to be retired.</fullReview>

At one point I wanted to scream because Van Wilder was annoying the hell out of me. It just seems like if you are going to waste the money on a film at least choose a film that is going to sell. This movie will sell but only because of people like me who kind of enjoyed the first two movies and now were destroyed by a horrible movie that should have never been made for any reason what so ever. I can't even really suggest this movie just for the action sequences alone because they aren't even that great. They use the same fighting techniques that were in all the other movies.

Poor choice of actors and a very pathetic story made this very expected movie a disaster. Wesley Snipes was the only one who tried to hold this movie together but he couldn't do it alone. The others, and by this I mean Jessica Biel and Ryan Reynolds, just didn't have what it took to continue the Blade trilogy as well as possible. The best thing in this movie, if we can say that there was a good thing,were the special effects which continued to be OK after the first two movies. The worst ting was Drake. I couldn't believe that he was found in Iraq of all places and he was defeated after a fight which lasted only 3-4 minutes. I think this movie should be forgotten as soon as possible also by Snipes and also by everyone who tried to direct such a catastrophe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Trinity - as in there are THREE things in this film (more or less) worth looking at</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First and foremost there's Ryan "van Wilder" Reynolds, who actually seems to be the only decent acting person in this film. Although I must admit that his character does not have much diversity or any real depth, he seems to be the only one in this film to do what he is supposed to: his job. Ryan is believable as the sarcastic vampire hunter Hannibal King and has much better lines than the rest of the cast (I just can't stand hearing Snipes say motherf...er again after this film).Secondly there are the fight scenes, which are mostly well choreographed but whose translation to the screen seems to suffer from directorial amateurism. While I felt there were some good fighting scenes and the action was good overall, I felt also felt that the cinematography fell short at times and that the music was horrible. Fighting scenes are supposed to be exciting and I guess Goyer aimed to amplify the tension with the music, but personally I couldn't integrate the two into a whole. This made the film much less exciting and entertaining to me, even when the action looked good.Third of all there's Whistler's bottom and NO i do not mean Abe's ;) I mean Abi's. Wait a second, seriously. I think Jessica Biel is very pretty and I guess that was the main reason she was picked to do this film, as the whole thing tries to be very hip and modern and to appeal to a young audience. In a way that makes her the second best 'actor' in the film, for she also accomplished what she was hired for. She doesn't bring depth, emotion or anything other than shallowness (her looks) into the film and let's face it, that's what she gets her paycheck for.As far as the rest of the film is concerned I've really got nothing much to add to the criticism that has already spread across the internet (and hopefully all of you out there). YES: the story is weak; YES: the acting is mediocre at best; YES: Dracula is neither very scary nor convincing. What made it even worse for me was that the ending was very disappointing and that Abraham Whistler's and Blade's character seemed to be nothing but caricatures of their former selves. These two things to me, were the worst things, about a mainly average film.4,5 out of 10 (with a merciful 5 given upon voting)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We're fans of the last 2 and I'd really been looking forward to this film. Cheaply made. Did they run out of money on this one or did the main actor(s) command most of the budget? Mainly shot in offices, on rooftops. A couple of exploding cars. Maybe glaziers charge a lot for glass, plenty of that shattered. Few vampire extras to speak of. One or two makeup/cgi effects and an interesting weapon or two.Action As usual with a series, the first one has a decent story, the remainder start with lots of explosions, action and the hero appears amongst the havoc within the first few minutes. Fast action continues through to the end. OK if you don't have any brain cells.storyline Dracula raised. Vampire killers need his blood to energise a virus. Virus to be let loose on world to kill all vampires. Vampire killers go and do that. OK.Character interaction Was there any? Even the fights were small discrete pieces of action. No character development and little interaction. You just don't get to care about any of them (except whatsisname who has a lovely 6 pack, cor!)Baddies Dracula of course. Skinny vampire woman with bad teeth, attitude but not much personality. Nothing going for her aside from that.Children/animals It's a series so a cute spunky kid is brought in somewhere in episode 2 or 3. Indy did it, chainsaw massacre 3, the mummy, Aliens etc The little pooch was cute too.Dallas Similarities between Bobby Ewing and whatsisface's illegitimate daughter arriving on the scene.You got to be kidding Police station surrounded by angry screeching police cars. As the heros leave the building they get shot at, then quietness while an escape vehicle pulls up next to the heros (in front of police). Guy gets out and tells them to get in the car. They jump in and drive away and get shot at again. No one seems bothered during the escape itself and none of the police cars follow the getaway vehicle. Heros walking down street in weird leather gear with swords, archery equipment etc and no-one bats an eye. er, well it is the USA I suppose.Dracula Did they have to choose him? Surely the development of vampire lore in recent years (in pc gaming especially) could have given a better antihero. I could have forgiven that if they hadn't picked a chunky non charismatic bouncer with a no. 2 shaven head? Would have preferred a more James Bond type for this roleHumour Personally, I didn't notice any except for Blade with the baby (and the dog) Usually the bad guys main bruiser (you know, there's always a thicky chunk that gets several unlucky amputations and recovers) gets some funny scenes but these were few and far between hereMusic The first 2 had very catchy funky hypnotic club music. I can't even recall the music style from this one but not impressed when I watched it.In all a very shallow, disjointed, cheap, unsexy action follow on. Maybe needed an extra hour to introduce some depth.</fullReview>

I can usually make an excuse to watch a bad movie. but this one has no excuse. well maybe the fact that Ryan Reynolds is in it (yes I am a girl, but you probably gathered that from the ms.) but um buddy what' with the beard?? and do we all remember the part when Dracula and blade are about to fight? and Dracula is like, are you ready to die. then blade goes, I was born ready mother___. WHAT THE HELL was that???!! could it be any cornier. what's with the old man dying. I liked him, he was cool. oh and isn't Dracula suppose to be invincible??? don't' you think it was little easy to kill him!!!!? I mean if it's really that easy just send me to do it!!! GOD, and by the way killing off a blind person is really not cool! okay so call me fussy but seriously, what a movie!!! apologies to all who loved it which can't be more than 5 people!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a huge fan of the first two Blade movies and I couldn't wait to see this movie! And after seeing it last night, what a colossal disappointment!!!I don't want to get into a long review but the movie felt shallow and very rushed... Note: This movie does NOT open like the first two Blade films with a great @ss kicking scene, it has a little taste of a good opening but is not on par with the first two films.Basically the story is that the Vampires unleash Dracula to take on Blade since he has become more then they can handle alone. The Vamps use familiars to set Blade up and get him arrested by the police. This was probably the best scene in the movie and could have been so much more. It had very little trademark Blade @ss kicking... Whistler on the other hand was shooting cops left and right with a shotgun. Blade should have been slicing them up but ends up giving himself up and ends up being interrogated in a police station. The Nightstalkers come to his rescue and the plice weren't tactial at all in the arresting and rescue scenes the action just seems wrong and doesn't flow when I am sure Goyer could have had plenty of resources available to him to get things right. The worst example of this is when Blade and the Nightstalkers are outside of the police station and they are surrounded by officers with guns drawn taking cover and here comes another Nightstalker who pulls up in a truck between the cops and the Blade gang bumping music to pick them up?NOW TELL ME HOW DOES THAT SCENE WORK?! Terrible!Then we meet the rest of the Nightstalkers which none other then Hannibal King have any character what so ever... Abigail Whistler seems to have no emotional driving force 'considering' what happen during the raid on Blade and Whistlers hide out.There is a terrible plug for an Apple IPOD, how terrible is it? TERRIBLE!The Triple H Vampire has silver caps on his fangs?!?! Why?The, I made a serum to do this and to do that is getting old.The cinematography of the fight scenes is terrible, shot way too tight even though it was anamorphic ? it's like watching a Hong Kong film cut up for a US release Pan &amp; Scan style where you can't really see how great the action is.There was probably only about 70% of the action that the other Blade films have and only 50% of that was worth putting on film.I knew they shot a couple of different endings to the film and during one of them Blade supposedly died so I found myself during the last 15 minutes only caring if Blade died or not and not caring about what was going on.My final thought is that I seriously doubt a 4th Blade will see daylight or moonlight after this disappointment, they'll be lucky if it makes it's money back on DVD.I wish there could or would be a darker more kick @ss 4th film but my magic 8-Ball says 'Highly Unlikely!'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this Movie. Dominick played drake really well and made it look like vampires can be totally hot. This movie was actioned packed and kept me watching. The other movies were good to but I think this one is better just a little bit. I hope there is another movie after this. I've watched this movie a thousand of times and it keeps getting better. It also kept me wondering what happens at the end. It also got me interested in other movies about vampires. I got this for my boyfriend and he loved it! It was great seeing that emotion on his face. If you have not seen the movie you should. If you have then you know how great it was. I'm ready to start a huge fan club because this movie is so great.

		<shortDescription>wow! this movie sukt ass!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would have given this a 1 if not for the extremely competent craftsmanship shown by the technical people working on the film ( I gave it a 2 out of 10). The script is unbelievably stupid (yes, even for a comic book movie), the casting was apparently done by someone thru the internet, and the directing.... well, Goyer should go back to writing or something, cause doing both is just too much for him.***SPOILERS*** The plot is complete malarkey. Dracula has seemingly been waiting for hundreds or thousands of years beneath a pyramid in the Syrian desert, wearing his full armor and ready to kill anyone who comes a-knockin'. Even when the Avon lady is really a vampiress who wants him to a) kill that Blade guy and b) give over some DNA so they can make a new day walker vampire. Blade is eventually joined by Whistler's daughter (never have fully understood just how she escaped both the vampire who killed his family and any divulges whenever Whistler talked about his family being all dead) and some guy (Biel and Reynolds). They all team up to fight and track down Dracula to kill him and everyone else.The lead bad guy vacillates between his euro-accent and American English, and is just not sufficiently EVIL to make us really care much about him and how he needs to be dead. Parker Posey was a terrible casting call as a tough evil vamp vampire... she simply isn't tough enough, evil enough, or focused enough to make us hate her (or laugh at her either). Blade's new accomplices are both nobodies... Ryan Reynolds doesn't have any screen charisma, and while Jessica Biel is delightful to look at (in her vampire fighting clothes with the bare tummy! so sexy but not very smart) she has the same lack of screen charisma that Mr. Reynolds exhibits.Wesley Snipes is passable. His fighting scenes are great and his continued martial arts prowess is evident throughout much of the film. His acting isn't as tough, as focused as "Blade" as in the first 2 flicks, however. Still, in comparison to the rest of the cast, he looks like Peter O'Toole doing a community theatre workshop.But the real flaw is in the directing. A barely watch-able opening sequence features Blade chasing down a a bunch of vampires on foot and then in vehicles. The whole thing, for some reason, was shot to look like The Fast &amp; The Furious (one of the most abysmal films of the new millennium), a production value that is inconsistent not just with the first 2 films, but with THE ENTIRE REST OF THIS ONE.Many of the fight scenes are marred by moving camera work that detracts from the choreography of the actors/stunt people. Frames zoom in and out, the pov rushes up to something, etc. Empty-vision style editing does not help fight scenes or car chases (Bourne Supremacy, anyone?).In addition, much of the new material in the "unrated version" is exactly what you would expect: it made it to the cutting room floor because it was poorly done and did not significantly advance the storyline (what scant one there is).Some of the movies that Mr. Goyer has written are excellent films. I hope that he goes back to writing, and lets someone else handle the director's chair duties.The good stuff: excellent cinematography (except for the aforementioned Fast &amp; Furious sequence), decent fight choreography (but where was Donnie Yen for this one?) and execution by all involved, and decent (read: not completely lame or overblown) CGI work. The soundtrack was OK, but the product placement got to be a bit much. I mean wtf, does Goyer have a ton of stock in Apple or what?In the end, this film isn't as bad as, say, XxX, but is nowhere near as good as either of the 2 X-Men films we've seen thus far. What sucks most about this film is the possibility that after 2 excellent movies, this may serve as the close of the series. I hope not, I just hope they don't let Goyer direct another one. And not that guy who did Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, either.I also wanted to say that the mastering on the DVD is terrible. My player, my laptop, and my friends' player (different manufacturer than mine) all paused at the end of every scene for about 1 second. It was really unnerving, and totally destroyed any chance of involvement for me.If I hadn't bought this on sale at Wal-Mart for $15, I'd prolly be mad about how much it cost me to complete my Blade set. As it is, $15 to watch it and let it collect dust is the going rate, I guess. At least I can take comfort in knowing that I wont pay Goyer any more money. I wont be seeing Batman Begins, having hated the first one and never went back. (btw, whichever reviewer for B:T wrote that he was surprised he dint see Blade's costume sporting nipples... you had me waste a good bit of soda, mate; cheers!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At the beginning of "Blade: Trinity" (technically "Blade Trinity" - no on-screen colon - but why carp?), Ryan Reynolds says "Everybody knows the movies are s***." Which is certainly true in this case.In fairness, I was at a disadvantage with this movie not having seen the previous two; but in more fairness, writer-director David S. Goyer still has to take the majority of the blame for making a sloppy and dreary movie which is, after all, supposed to be about a vampire battle entering endgame - "Yu-Gi-Oh!" is more exciting. And he brings in Dracula as well, although the approach is closer to "Van Helsing" than, say, any decent effort (though it's not quite as stupid). I remember him telling 'Premiere' that "Predator 2" was "a piece of s***" which, though true, is pretty rich coming from the man who wrote one of Jean-Claude Van Damme's worst movies ("Death Warrant"), and the pot-kettle status remains. Not only is the story slack, but the rampantly po-faced proceedings force in the (admittedly amusing) comic relief via the guy from "Two Guys And A Girl" - it's like the joke in "Futurama" about a Hawkeye Pierce-type robot who goes to funny to maudlin literally at the flick of a switch.Wesley Snipes isn't a help either as the human/vampire hybrid; we're supposed to be thinking "Wow, he's so cool" but instead he spends the whole movie wrapped up in how fantastic he thinks he is, and never seems to connect with anybody (and this doesn't help the fight scenes; when he takes out several vampires at once in the climax it should not be a cause for "Whatever," but it is); when we learn from Natasha Lyonne's blind scientist that the Daystar virus which is fatal to vampires may wipe him out as well I came close to cheering. Still, at least he isn't quite as annoying as Parker Posey, whose vampire makes you want to kill her (long before she does indeed die) for reasons not connected to her being a baddie. And try and spot the gratuitous wrestling match thrown in for Triple H fans, part of the movie's inability to strike a line between being Serious and being a tad tongue-in-cheek. (And as for that Dracula, he must be the most well-fed of his kind in screen history...)Eric Bogosian's brief turn is a plus, along with the welcome early demise of the ever-tedious Kris Kristofferson's Whistler; but the second-best thing about "Blade: Trinity" for me was the Leslie Stevens references - in addition to a clip from Mr. Outer Limits' infamous "Incubus" (the only fantasy movie starring William Shatner filmed in Esperanto ever made!) on TV, the virus shares the name Daystar with his 1960s production company (too bad the movie is closer in quality to another TV series the late Mr. Stevens was involved with - "Buck Rogers in the 25th Century").The best thing? Jessica Biel. Not her performance as such, but her arrows - her character Abigail is to arrows what Ricochet Rabbit was to bullets - and her full-on hotness; even the fight-scenes-set-to-soundtrack-plugs she inspires (Abigail likes to download music to listen to before she fights) are forgivable. Your scribe plays in a Fantasy Film League and had her in one of the movies, which turned out to be my biggest hit, so I went to see this basically to return the favour. While "Blade: Trinity" plays like an episode of "Angel" (even with the time-lapse transitions"), which I never liked, when Jessica's awesome looks are on screen, coupled with the way she walks, it becomes bearable. And explains the 2 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First up. I beg of all users, please stop writing lengthy plot summaries. It serves no useful purpose - anyone checking user comments is either interested in seeing the film for themselves or has already seen it: either way I doubt anyone wants to read tedious regurgitation's of the plot so, just comments please. I thought this would be obvious, alas it seems otherwise.So now, Blade: Trinity. My pet hate at the moment is watching film that looks like a music video. To call ramped footage and washed out colors visually exciting is to have a standard so low that you perhaps should join a database that comments on MTV programming. Trinity is abundant with this sugar, and that's all it is - "cool fight scenes".Forget plot. This really feels like an early draft. Some interesting ideas but it seems there was no choice made about the overall direction of the story, so instead we get a bit of everything. Q.1) Where do the cops go for the second hour? I mean they were right onto it in the set-up, so much so, I figured Blade was going to have to seriously deal with integration into the human world while that very same world believes him to be a dangerous criminal. But this concept is abandoned, even after Blade kills the Cop at the blood farm - I certainly thought there'd be immediate repercussions to cop-killing. Which brings me to Q.2) Why set-up this human blood-farming thing? It doesn't go anywhere. We go to one farm, learn that these exist in every major city, then we shut it down, kill a cop and move on to the next adventure. And don't get me started about the flagging of this concept to begin with - Goyer! Dude, after Matrix, you can't just have Ryan Reynolds saying "It doesn't make sense that the Vampires would want to destroy their food source," and expect the farm thing to be a surprise. I'm sure I'm not the only one who picked it - it's plain lazy, man. Let's move on, Q.3) If Dracula came back, I doubt he'd be running around doing Parker Posey's bidding. I don't understand why he gives a toss about Blade or the Posey's little plan. In fact, he doesn't care to begin with, then suddenly he decides it's time to join the game. Why? Fun? Coz he's a baddie? I just don't know because it's not dealt with. What is dealt with however, is the idea of honor. Why they tackle this I don't know. How can you have Dracula talking seriously about honor while he's threatening to drop a baby over a ledge. If this is an attempt at adding depth, it's a failure. I know if I had lived for centuries and fed off humans I wouldn't care about honor at all.That's about it for my rant. I only care about the failure of this film because Blade 2 was an excellent action film: it was the first time I'd seen the use of an L-Cam and it managed to deal with ideas of loyalty and abandonment through both the heroes and villains without pushing away from the requirements of an action film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sharp Blade-Trinity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Writer and Director David Goyer's third installment of The Blade saga, "Blade: Trinity" is better than the last, and almost as good as the first. This is only a personal preference. I've heard other valid points of view on "Trinity". What "Blade: Trinty" has going for it along with Wesley Snipes as The Day Walker Blade, are charismatic young blood in Ryan Reynolds as Hannibal King and Jessica Biel as Abigail Whistler (Whistler's daughter), and a novel mythology surrounding Dracula, or in this modern setting, Drake. "Trinty" opens with an elite group led by Danica Talos (Parker Posey, really), who is the powerful leader of the Vampire Nation, searching for the tomb of the legendary, Dracula or Drake (Dominic Purcell). At the same time, Danica is orchestrating the media smear campaign against Blade making him a target of the FBI and Police.Reviving Drake is all part of the Nation's conspiracy to dominate humanity, ascending to the top of the food chain, literally. The Vampire have become weak over the generations-- the bloodline diluted. Drake is the source of the bloodline; thus, the key to their power and salvation.Aided by vampire hunters called The Nightstalkers which include Hannibal (Reynolds) and Abigail (Biel), Blade grudgingly joins their cause. Their leader is a blind scientist (yes, really) Sommerfield (Natasha Lyonne) who has developed a virus that can kill the vampire. However, if they obtain the DNA from Drake's blood and synthesize the virus, the resultant virus could eradicate the entire Vampire Nation.Yes, this is all far fetched even for a comic book storyline. However, the mythology is fascinating. Apparently, Dracula was the perfect predator-- the analogy to the Great White Shark in the sea world. So Dracula or rather Drake was the perfect being: he was evolution's pinnacle. Drake is powerful, cunning, and like Blade... a Day Walker. So is Blade the next stage in the evolution? Ultimately, the two must battle. Inherent in their conflict is a sense of honor and respect which is surprising, and welcome. "Blade: Trinity" for the most part is kluged and linear story telling with some captivating hooks. The action and martial arts sequences are great. I liked that the action was not CGI dependent fight sequences like in Blade 2.Wesley Snipes is solid as Blade, although he takes the hero of few words to the extreme. Snipes is strong as the Day Walker. He is also a great martial artist. His martial arts choreography is simple, clean, and brutal. The young blood Night Stalkers are also very impressive. Ryan Reynolds really got ripped for his role as Hannibal King. Along with the killer abs, he also demonstrates quick wit, and charm. Honestly, Jessica Biel, as Abigail Whistler, is the best thing about the movie. Her character is the most developed, accessible, and empathetic. Biel is both strong and vulnerable. She has great intensity. She is gorgeous and has a perfect body. Her intense physical and martial arts training shows in her convincing fight sequences, and when she uses the bow. She is awesome."Blade: Trinty" is formulaic with interesting story twists which also benefits from its charismatic stars, Snipes, Reynolds, and Biel. It's a fun movie, where the heroes really get to kick some butt. This all makes for an entertaining time at the movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A terrible mess.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dear oh dear...I liked the first 2 Blade movies very much and thought they were perfect horror/action entertainment, so I kind of expected the same thing from "Blade: Trinity". The movie however turned out to be a terrible mess with an incredibly awfully told story and sidekicks that became more interesting and better than Blade himself. You know something is terribly wrong when you're care way more and are more interested in the sidekicks than in the main title character.Man to blame is director David S. Goyer. This guy is no director, let him stick to produce and writing movies. He tells the movie its story in such an incredibly messy and uninteresting way that I kept losing track, not because the story was that complicated but because it was told in such a completely messy way. The movie felt terribly incoherent like none of the scene's were really connected with each other. Also the fight scene's that were perhaps the best elements of the previous two Blade movies were disappointing in this third Blade entry. They were filmed with little flair and the terrible editing made it impossible to tell at times what was exactly happening on the screen. Yes, this movie features the worst editing I have seen in a while but that is what happens when you have three editors on the job.The new characters Hannibal King and Abigail Whistler (really, did she had to be Whistler's daughter? That served absolutely no purpose and was nothing more than just a lame, pointless story addition.) are cool and interesting. At least more interesting than Blade! They add a lot of humor and style to the movie and they are about the two only successful things about this movie. OK The cinematography by Gabriel Beristain might be a third successful thing about the movie but it ends right after there really.The villains are also a disappointing element of the movie. I mean über-vampire Dracula is in this, you would expect something more from a character like that but he has got very little to do and its unclear what exactly his motivations are and what he is trying to achieve.I feel that "Blade: Trinity" still could had been a good movie, with a different, better and more experienced director at the helm. Couldn't they just had waited until director Guillermo Del Toro became available again? This movie makes a terrible messy impression and feels like a lame excuse to quickly cash in some more money after the more successful and better previous two Blade movies. I didn't expected this to be so but this was the worst movie I have seen, in the last couple of months.3/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wesley Snipes had the odd OK action scene, Ryan Reynolds forced a smile, and Jessica Beil looked good. That's it tho, that is as far as I am inclined to praise this film, and to be frank, beyond these boundaries it was no more than a painful experience. I would even go as far to say that in the cinema I found myself having a more enjoyable time watching the fluorescent exit lights..... The story line was something of a surreal comedy, i mean the fact that Blade's base got broken into was surely no surprise... considering their SECURITY GUARD WAS BLIND!? It was just countless small but idiotic ideas like these throughout the movie that cause you to start trailing off into more interesting thoughts...like the trip home for example. The only redeeming features as i said before were the odd alright action scenes,(which failed to satisfy me fully considering throughout most of them it was quite clear that they were computer generated,) the quirks of Ryan Reynolds,(which altho funny, began to run thin,) and Jessica Beil...(no more said.) OK so i am probably being a tad harsh on the film, but i suppose before hand i thought that surely they would have enough decent actors and funding from Blade 1 and 2 to keep the interest of a gore seeking teenager such as myself. Which alas they didn't.On the whole, if you've got nothing better to do with your money, go watch it. Just keep in mind that it will not be as good as you expect , and that replenishing your stamp collection may prove more fulfilling and entertaining.....and erotic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst Blade Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those movies that missed the mark so bad you would almost think it was a joke. I really half expected Goyer to lean out of the projection box after the end and yell " Gotcha! "...and then put in a movie that was not a disaster akin to a Soviet Crafted Economy. Now I did not go to this movie expecting a brilliant human drama, one that touched my soul and in some small way made me a better person...but I did expect to see a fun action movie. First off, in defense of all of the actors, the writing was absolutely terrible. I can only assume that Goyer needs the creative energy associated with working with others, because when put in charge of a project on his own he absolutely blew it. This movie has some of the lamest dialogue I have seen in a long time. Not only that, but there are whole chunks of the movie that must have been written by someone's middle school child as they are just back and forth curse-a-thons that plain do not work.Secondly, the characters in this were also just cringingly bad. My favorite has got to be the blind computer guru that somehow reads her monitor. Next up has got to be Patton Oswald as a scientist, nice casting choice there, I like him as a comedian but come on. Finally there are the vampires...which consist of a crew of suck heads that are about as threatening as your local Brownie Troop, as well as Dracula himself. Dracula was played by the same guy as in John Doe, and was quite possible the lamest Dracula I have ever seen portrayed in film. You would think that a person who lived for 1000's of years would be either crafty or powerful, but you would be wrong. No, Dracula has apparently been getting by on his looks, oh and his generic mince, my guess would be that in the next one Paris Hilton will play Moses.Finally there is Blade himself, who throughout the whole movie never quite gets around to being Blade. He not only looks rather weak (Snipes is quite covered up in this one and clearly not in as good of shape) but also acts pretty weak. he constantly finds himself on equal ground with humans and sadly puts them to no shame.As a final note let me just put a word in about HHH. As his debut this was not a terrible vehicle, but following movie logic I guess the bigger a guy is in a film the less he bothers to learn about fighting. His character is never fully identified, and his big nemesis is a guy about 1/3 of his size, who is a human. I guess I missed the part in the first couple of Blade movies where vampires were as weak as humans.Rating (and this is pretty generous) 1 out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First things first, "Blade: Trinity" isn't a truly bad film. It just isn't in the same league as the first two. Directed by "Blade" writer David S. Goyer, the film is a little too lightweight. There are plenty of action sequences but the film's lacking excitement. The film suffers from the curse of "the third installment". As with so many film series before it, the third part is a notoriously difficult one.On its plus side, the visuals are as sumptuous as always and the film has a "big screen" feel. Wesley Snipes is very comfortable with his character but there's little development to Blade in this movie. Instead, the film spends time on his two new sidekicks, Ryan Reynolds and Jessica Biel. Without wanting to state the obvious, Biel is breathtaking as Whistler's daughter, Abigail. Without a doubt, Biel is one of the best looking actresses working in Hollywood today.Dominic Purcell is a half-reasonable baddie as "Drake" but lacks the charisma of "Blade"'s Stephen Dorff.Worthy of a rental but don't expect anything other than a reasonable viewing experience. Goyer should have left this movie in the hands of a more capable director.7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Blade and Blade II are reasonable films, but Blade III shows once again how difficult it is to keep sequels interesting and how easy it is to blow it.The characters Blade and Whistler are not that interesting anymore, so director Goyers throws in a group of other vampire hunters: The Nightstalkers. But nothing is done with these characters. They have no character development whatsoever and do the same as Blade does: They kick and shoot their way to the end. With no trouble at all. I don't know what the vampires do in their free time, but developing weapons or taking lessons at a good karate club isn't one of those things. It is all too easy and it gets boring after a while. There is just too much action and for no reason. When Blade follows the Vampire king Drake through walls, windows en buildings you expect something interesting when he finally catches up with Drake. But a lame scene with a baby follows and Drake magically disappears.Drake is played by Dominic Purcell, introduced in a worse version of the opening scenes in Blade II, but he doesn't have the charisma to portray the father of all vampires. Come on, the FATHER OF ALL VAMPIRES must be special, important, charismatic. Nothing special about him now. Ryan Reynolds (with beard he looks like Jason Lee) does the best he can with the jokes that he has, but humor alone can't save this film. I wasn't even curious to see how it would end. This film fails to be interesting and doesn't stand out in any way. Half way the movie gets boring. a 5.</fullReview>

I also don't understand why Dracula turned into the devil at the end that just makes no sense. I thought Dracula was a vampire but I guess he's not.

		<shortDescription>Worst movie EVUR</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are far more plot holes and question marks in this movie than there are scenes. Even if I did check my brain at the door the action was terrible and extremely repetitive. I lost count of the number of times Blade does a back kick to take someone out. Seriously if I were to fight Blade I'd just stand right in front of him! What, is he a mule?If we even discount the fact that there are very small amounts of originality in the choreography then you're still left with an abysmal ending. I mean he takes out Dracula and the worst he gets is a nick on the cheek? Come ON! I was also confounded as to why everyone in the movie found it necessary to swear in every other line of dialogue. The first and only decent Blade movie had hardly any swearing. I'm all about the swearing if it's in context or at least sounds cool but this was a joke! And fart jokes? AHH!Hope to never see something as terrible as this again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the movie sucks big time..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>the worst movie. plot sucks. worst acting by the duo who join Blade in the fight against vampires. I think the director tried to compensate the worst plot by "jokes" and "funny lines". It had worst actors. Worst "karate" moves. (it was like two little girls were fighting). I hated it. I didn't get the purpose The Dracula (Drake) in the movie. There was only one fight between Dracula and Blade at the end of the movie, and it sucked. I think those rookie vampire killers ruined the movie. they were abundant. So i don't advise to waste your money (if it is hard earned) to watch this movie. Better go and watch Salem's Lot, which is truly frightening vampire movie - based on a Stephen King novel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why are people discussing this movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Blade 1 - Great. An accomplishment to meld action and horror into a successful formula/franchise.Blade 2 - Amazing. Topped the first. Characters were charming and Blade didn't cross the cheese line too many times. This is the best Blade there is.Blade 3 - Are you serious? This is a movie or an ad for IPOD? Or a music video gone wrong? Or a series of scenes glued together just so someone at NewLine could finish their contractual obligation and go start working for Paramount? Whatever it was, its virtually unwatchable and I'm offended that people would be foolish enough to even buy this on DVD.I'm a huge fan of what Snipes and Deltoro did in the first two. What was done with the last one was criminal. They ruined a perfectly good opportunity to attract the public back to this type of action-genera. Sad. Very. No redeemable scenes at all other than the opener which was a compete rip from the opener from the 2nd one, but not nearly as good.Add to that, Snipes looked like he didn't even wanna be there. And don't even get me started on the cast.. Ryan ???? Wtf? They shoulda just put Woody Allen in his role and called it a day.Horrible movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Awful ! Now I know why Snipes doesn't want to make the promotion of this film... Many many awful &amp; stupid ideas. Goyer is usually a good screenwriter, but not a good one for his own movie. This episode is, for me, the worst of the trilogy, and one of the worst film I saw in 2004. NewLine has just buried a nice character.Most of the film looks like a comedy with unfunny jokes, with slow fights (old kicks, old moves, nothing special in the moves), boring stunts (woua ! a guy fly on a car, it's very original, I never saw this before). This film smells old, and takes all the fans for dumbs !!! It's a shame...Please Stephen Norrington, comeback !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as bad as critics and fans said it was..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Blade, now a wanted man by the FBI, must join forces with the Nightstalkers to face his most challenging enemy yet: Dracula. Blade Trinity is the final installment of the Trilogy and the weakest for many fans and critics but the problem is that critics didn't like the first film or even the superior sequel Blade 2 which remains the best of the 3 in my opinion with the hand to hand combat. Now Blade 3 i didn't mind the corny humor or the bad language that comes once in a while because it worked pretty well most of the humor came from Ryan Reynolds which pretty much plays Deadpool in here and Jessica Biel was one hell of a badass chick as for Wesley Snipes he is Blade simple as that there's no TV Series or anything that they made after this he still wants to make Blade 4 and studios should let him do it. Is this better than Blade II? No but i think it comes somewhere close at 2nd but i really don't remember the first one so i can't really say the only thing that i didn't like from this film is some of the cgi was kinda out of place and that scene when Dracula went inside the shop and killed the owners that was kinda lame but i found the acting from the 3 leading actors to be pretty cool, the villain looked pretty scary as for the rest of the cast i found Triple H to be the most interesting character in my opinion and the blind lady alongside Kris Kristofferson were easily 2 of the most saddest deaths in the whole movie the worst character by far was John Michael Higgins not a perfect movie but i was entertained a lot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It seems to forget its origins in film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some people may not recognize it as the actual successful start of film studio Marvel comics but Blade (1998) was the original renaissance to where the company entered into profitable film making. It may have not had the intro credits like every property that came after it until its sequels or glowing reviews but the character was one of the few to have a much grittier and darker tone. This attribute would only go to Blade for the first five years until Daredevil (2003) and The Punisher (2004) were released. It was a special franchise that molded vampires from romantic / fantasy creatures into action / horror icons. Blade II (2002) reaffirmed this understanding although it was not as compelling as its predecessor. A couple years later, fans of the series would get their final entry in the series and very few left the theater happy. With a troubled production involving Wesley Snipes and Kris Kristofferson being unsatisfied with the script, the end product feels like not the entire crew was on board.David S. Goyer, the now divisive comic book film adapter of multiple properties wrote and directed this feature. After accidentally killing a human, Blade (Wesley Snipes) is on the run from the F.B.I. and teams up with a group called the Nightstalkers played by Hannibal King (Ryan Reynolds) and Abigail Whistler (Jessica Biel). Together they must join forces to stop Drake AKA Dracula (Dominic Purcell) from bringing the world to an end. Sounds okay on paper (or screen) but the execution is different. Seeing Goyer's experience in other properties and being involved with this franchise from the very beginning, its confusing as to how Goyer messed up this much. Of the premise, the first subplot that does not belong is the killing of a human. It's not that it's a bad idea, but it never gets resolved so why even bother shoehorning it in? The cast is also a mismatch of actors. The only two actors who fit the best are obviously Snipes and Kristofferson; a close third could be Jessica Biel due to her character's relation to Blade.But of this, Snipes and Kristofferson feel and sound the least invested and that only further cements the troubled production history. One of the biggest things that fans of the series will notice is how much Whistler and Blade take a back seat. Casting Ryan Reynolds would not have been a mistake if the character of King did not eat up all the dialog on the script. Blade barely says anything in this feature. Here and there yeah he does say a couple of good lines, but it's not that often. Most of the time, he just stares into space or grimaces. There's more to Blade than just that. The same could be said for Biel's role. Her character enjoys listening to music when fighting vampires; that dates the film a lot. Dominic Purcell as Drake (is that supposed to modernize his name?) isn't terrible but he also looks awkward in the role. His face looks as though he doesn't quite know what he's playing so he'll just be himself to some degree. His minions played by Paul Levesque (Triple H) and Parker Posey are actually more convincing vampires than he is.There's also a distinct lack of action and horror throughout this picture. The special visual effects are actually better than a lot of the CGI stuffed scenes that were in Blade II (2002) but the count is much lower here. There are a couple of decent action scenes but the rest are rather underwhelming. Even the battle between Drake and Blade looks less exciting than what has been put to screen before. There are vampire stabbings, bitings and some blood but it's not as heavy as the violence depicted in this franchise's earlier years. Again going back to tone, Blade (1998) and Blade II (2002) roughly had equal tone with each other. The atmosphere of the universe Blade lived in felt dark and unsafe. The locations used in this entry are just uninteresting and boring. The Nightstalkers' headquarters has nothing special about it and the city itself feels more clean and shiny than in past representations. What was the purpose of this? Was it to just add to the fad at the time of other superhero films? It takes away what the series had going for it.Handling the camera-work was Mexican cameraman Gabriel Beristain. Beristain had also filmed for Blade II (2002) and S.W.A.T. (2003). Thankfully for much of the film, Beristain's experience kept the shoot steady. Beristain delightfully changed the aspect ratio from the previous entry to a wide lens and that always gives the movie a much bigger scope in visuals. The music was also enjoyable though this series has never had a solidified composer attached. Producing the music to this entry was German composer Ramin Djawadi and for some reason his official score has gone unreleased. There are a few areas where bootlegs can be found but there's no real way of obtaining the music. Only a few actual tracks exist, which mainly highlight some of the action sequences. One called "Shooting Around Corners" uses mainly synths but with an energetic fashion that actually is fun listening to. There are some cues that are organic like "Drake's Parting Gift" using real orchestra but it's not as memorable as the scores released it before.Unfortunately, the last series to the original Blade (1998) franchise is just middling. The music and visuals are acceptable but the casting feels misguided. The main leads don't sound invested, the action is infrequent and Blade doesn't do all that much wisecracking or say much at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A blunter Blade with not much bite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Blade is back for a third film in Blade Trinity and this time he's not alone as he's joined by the Nightstalkers. Alone and surrounded it seems everyone wants a piece of the day walker, the Vampires want to kill him and the living want to capture and imprison him for his apparent crimes against humanity. At the start of the film Blade is set up, he slays what he believes is a vampire only to find out it's a human in disguise, he's caught on camera and learns it's a set up when the video is played all over the media and a manhunt ensues. While getting a good old telling off from Whistler (Kristofferson) a trap is sprung and his HQ is stormed by human authorities. Whistler is killed (for real this time) but manages to detonate a self destruct command wiping out the command centre and taking all the computers and evidence down with him. Grief stricken Blade is surrounded and submits. Now in police custody it all looks bleak for the day walker. He's interrogated by the law and vampires pretending to be the law. The vampires plan to take him away and to his demise but before they even get out of the room a rescue mission is sprung by Hannibal Kane (Ryan Reynolds) and Abigail Whistler (Whistlers daughter, played by Jessica Biel). They escape and take Blade to their own HQ where he learns about other Vampire resistance groups/ cells. They advise Blade that the Vampire current plan is to resurrect the very first vampire, Dracula (Dominic Purcell) himself. The chase is on, kill Dracula or be killed and watch as the world dies. While all looks bleak there is also a glimmer of hope as the team have finally made a compound that can cure vampirism but it has to be injected into the alphas vampire, I guess it's lucky that Dracula is knocking around then. This was a fun film all in all, more tongue in cheek humour than the last two but still crammed with action and adventure. The pace of the film is a little up and down but that's because it's almost like it has two films worth of content all rolled into one. It was refreshing to see how the Blade's actions are seen by the living and how they reported on it, in previous films he was just allowed to dice and slice with no consequences ever being discussed. The casting was not what I expected for a Blade film, I was happy watching Wesley Snipes rampage but I can't remember signing up to watch Ryan Reynolds and Jessica Biel kick undead butt. Why does Blade need sidekicks though? He didn't really need them in the other films or the comics, it's almost in insult that he's been given them for this film. By having sidekicks and by sharing screen time with them it belittles Blade and makes him look like he's not actually that essential? but isn't he the day walk, the scourge of the vampire world? Evidently not and humans can get in on the act too. Not just do they get in on the act but they also have no fear of Vampires or death and they seem to physically cope with the demands of hunting super strength blood suckers. Average human's didn't fair to well in the first two Blade films so what makes them suddenly able to stand up to the fight? Allowing the 'kids' to have as much screen time diminishes the need for Blade who has made himself into the Vampire hunter the world needs. As well as belittling Blade's involvement it also gives the film a pretty and poppy feel, almost like they are trying to removed the darkness of the Blade franchise to attract a younger audience - shame. Although not a side kick what was the point in putting Triple-H (Jarko Grimwood) (WWE wrestler) in the film? He wasn't imposing, he wasn't a threat, he didn't have great dialogue, he was just there for being there's sake. Dominic Purcell as Dracula didn't do it for me either, he didn't seem convincing as the alpha vampire with unmeasurable strength and power, he was more like the bad guy in an episode of "Hercules" or "Zena: Warrior Princess". When I've sat back and thought about It after the film he didn't actually serve any kind of threat to the world, at most he killed a few of the Nightstalkers and attempts to throw a baby of a building (despite talking about 'honour' in his finale with Blade) but other than that nothing too menacing. He could probably have been left to roam the city for ages before any major incidents occurred which would need a vampire fighting hit squad to try and kill him off. Out of the bad guys it was Parker Posey as Danica Talos who was the most credibility, well, least embarrassing anyway, she played the role as if she was copying Fairuza Balk in "The Craft".For fear of a massive rant I'm going to stop myself here and try to summarise the rest of the review. Not as good as the first two films. Not as dark as the first two films. Random pace and random casting. More amusement and humour than action and story. Family friendly Blade rather than cult classic for fans. Terrible way to end the franchise. Predictable in places. Good soundtrack. 6 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An average film that is the worst of the franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now I really like the original Blade and even though the second one was a step down it was still okay but this film is lower again and just an average attempt. This film sees Blade in trouble with the FBI which forces him to team up with a group of humans called the night stalkers who have to go after the very first vampire Drake better known as Dracula. Wesley Snipes is once again back as Blade but even though he provides some good moments this is easily his worst performance as Blade with some of his moments in the film seeming lazy and like he just doesn't really care anymore. The supporting cast is a bit of a hit and miss with Kris Kristofferson returning as Whistler but just like I thought in the last film he was completely unnecessary in this film and just shoehorned in because he was in the last two films. Also the guy they got to play Drake was quite wooden and not a very good adversary for Blade. But I thought Jessica Biel was decent in the film for her action role that she was required for that didn't really take a lot of acting prowess. Ryan Reynolds was good in his role and at the beginning his humour was really well done, however, throughout he seemed like an overly jokey character but overall I liked him in this film. The story is bad, with it never really fully explained and just an excuse to have Blade vs Dracula that Goyer felt was necessary. The script is okay with some good dialogue especially from Reynolds and snipes but once again there is just some bad dialogue that really hurts the film. The style is cool with the action scenes being well done and the weapons being awesome but it just isn't enough to improve this film. Overall this is the worst Blade film that is distinctly average.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Or a lot, depending on what kind of a mood you have, or how much you (dis)like the new additions, in this case the new "team" members, Ryan Reynolds and(or) Jessica Biel. And here you have the crux (of the matter) ... although a very good idea itself (to put new elements in the story), it is obvious that it just dilutes the end result ... even if the actors do look good (another addition being a WWE Wrestler better known by his wrestling name Triple H, does what he does best and kicks butt)! Unfortunately this movie has nothing much going for it then. With the new additions taking the (lime)light from Blade himself and making/degrading Wesley to a "supporting actor" (not really, it just feels like that). It doesn't have the surprise element (discovering/exploring) from the first movie and neither does it have the tongue-in-cheek humor from the second. You've also seen better villains then the one on display here ... Still it has some nicely done fight scenes, which doesn't save the day entirely, but does help you enjoy it at least a little bit!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One word. "Why?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I tell you about Blade: Trinity let me first tell you about the first one. Blade is popularly believed to be the catalyst for the Marvel movie franchise. Avi Arad is the man responsible for giving us our favorite comic book movies, Spider-Man, X-Men, etc. Blade set the first standard for comic book movies until Spider-Man increased it. Blade II came with rather remarkable success, it gave us more of what we wanted: a closer look at the vampire culture and the inner turmoil between vampires, an engaging storyline, and incredible action/ fight sequences. With that said let's move onto Blade: Trinity.First let's start with the title, Blade:Trinity? Why couldn't they call it Blade III? Instead it's called Trinity because we now have three vampire hunters (Snipes, Beil, Reynolds) however, Beil and Reynolds are more like sidekicks of Snipe's and are their characters are more animated than realistic. To suggest that these two other characters are Blade's equals is laughable at best.Next is the casting, most noticeably are the "Nightstacker's" buddies, technicians, or people you just don't care about. First if Patton Oswalt is in a movie, don't waste time thinking about going to see it. Plus some of the characters jobs are completely illogical, for example why would you have a blind woman watch the surveillance monitors?! And how do these "20 somethings" have access to technology that far exceeds that of anything available to the world? Fortunately the movie doesn't take any time for the audiences to get to know these one dimensional characters and only focuses on Snipes, Beil, Reynolds. Next the script, the writing is so bad I wondered if the actors had actual lines or just said whatever came first in their heads. There are more curse words than coherent dialogue in this film, and it seems that if an actor couldn't remember a line that they simply yelled out curse words. Reynolds is the biggest offender of this.Next is the story, Vampires using the FBI to help capture Blade? Well I guess it makes sense, after-all if immortal vampires can't capture Blade I'm sure a bunch of frail humans could. And summoning Dracula to fight Blade, was the most ridiculous part of all. I wonder what that vampire meeting was like. "We need to kill Blade, any suggestions?" "Dracula! He'll kill him for sure!" "Brilliant! Here's a cookie!" "YAY"Huh...well...that was odd, anyway. Now for the biggest problem of all, the directing. The sorest part are the fight scenes, I bet the fighting would look awesome if I could see it. Except the camera is always zoomed in and switching around so frantically that you can't even tell what is going on half the time. Now I bet you're asking, but Brad! (Because my name is Brad) This is Blade we are talking about, there must be something good here. Well, there are a few silver linings in this movie. Snipes is excellent as always, Jessica Beil has never looked hotter, Dominic Purcell does an okay job as Dracula, some of King's (Reynolds) jokes can be humorous, the vampire Pomeranian was funny, Dracula (in his true form) looked awesome, and the sword fight between Blade and Drake was cool. But it's all weighed down by bad writing, bad acting, illogical turns, and bad directing. I can only recommend this as a rent at best. But please don't expect to be blown away, the first two are suited for that. I give Blade: Trinity, TWO lowly sidekicks of Blade's out of FIVE.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a huge fan of the Blade Trilogy. The heroes are kick ass, the monsters are gruesome, and there's death and destruction to spare. After seeing all three films in succession, I say that Trinity is the best, Here's why...1) Finally, Blade gets some much deserved back-up. (The Bloodpack just didn't do it right. They seemed more like cannon fodder than help). 2) Hannibal King. Ryan Reynold's character was the best in the series. Blade Trinity was a dark film and needed some comedy. King did just that, 3)We meet Dracula. A question in my mind all throughout the series is what did Dracula look like? Well now we know. and last but not least 4) We get some human involvement. How did Blade kill thousands of people and Vamps without the outside world noticing? HE DIDN'T! Human's, at last, are not just cattle.Trinity is by far the best film in the series. But see Blade AND Blade 2 before renting this bad boy.</fullReview>

I think they should leave comedians out of movies like this, it doesn't really click good enough. I was hoping there would be a much better story then Dracula fighting blade. thats was another thing they should of had them fight a lot more then once. i mean look at blade two he fought that weird vampire dude twice, Dracula once which sucks.I thought they should of had the director from the second one come in and help them because it would have been a lot better then this.Alright Jessica biel was good in the movie she was a strong character and she was believable to be whistlers daughter. she acted great i mean she usually acts good in her films but she did pretty well. Wesley Snipes was still pretty good as blade well he always is good. i like the things he says and the way he fights. Now Ryan Reynolds I'm a big fan of his and when i heard he was playing in blade 3 i was pretty happy, i thought this was gonna be his first actual serious role but it wasn't. he was terrible in this movie he just joked the whole movie and i hate that in movies like that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has a few good points but is ultimately disappointing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I suppose the first word I should use in when describing Blade Trinity is: uneven. That is how I perceived the film. Some scenes were decent and some scenes were just downright pieces of trash. I didn't see the film in the cinema as the trailer looked disappointing and instead I decided to wait for the DVD so I could see if the film was as bad as the rating. It was. If you love Blade Trinity you should probably stop reading now because the following review is not an all together positive one.Guillermo del Toro didn't return as director for this film because he wanted to do Hellboy (another not all together satisfying film) which he described as his dream project and so the writer David S. Goyer, who wrote the previous two films, was given the job. Now I pose a question, what happens when you get a mediocre writer to direct a film he wrote himself? You of course get mediocre entertainment. Wesley Snipes does his best to keep the title character of Blade alive but he has the same problem as in Blade II. He doesn't bring anything new to the character. His performance is basically a rerun of his performances in the previous films and the character is just not interesting enough to keep the film afloat. That and Snipes isn't as thin as in the previous films (notice there are no scenes with him showing off his bare chest in this film). Maybe Snipes haven't been doing his sit-ups in between this film and Blade II because Blade is getting just a little fat. Kris Kristofferson returns briefly in his character as well but he doesn't exactly bring anything much to the film either. Dominic Purcell plays the villain, Drake (a modernized Dracula), and he is woolly at best. His performance isn't downright bad but it leans toward it. His sense of timing and overall line delivery is quite bad. Jessica Biel was brought on the project obviously as eye candy and she serves her purpose beautifully because she is just gorgeous. Other than that, however, she, like all other leading ladies in the Blade series, doesn't contribute much acting wise. Ryan Reynolds is the only saving grace acting wise. His comic timing is impeccable and I must admit I did laugh out loud because of him quite a few times. He is nothing more than a sidekick, however, and he doesn't get too much screen time.The effects aren't spectacular but at least there are no unbelievable CG sequences like in Blade II and the vampire dustings are still pretty to look at. Other than that, however, I felt that the pace had been taken down quite a bit from the action packed Blade II. There was much more sitting around doing close to nothing. This is a problem as the overall plot is about as lacking as in Blade II. This makes the film seem longer than it is and that is a pretty serious problem as the paper thin story cannot sustain itself. Suffice to say the pacing is bad. The sound/music is the worst of the series and unlike in the previous films (especially the first) the music doesn't leave a lasting impression. You've basically forgotten it as soon as you stop watching the movie.The film's most major problem is the fact that Drake is seriously un-menacing. He never seems to pose a threat to Blade making their confrontation (which is quite poorly choreographed) seem dull and anticlimactic. The action sequences leading up to their confrontation are much better. Another thing that puzzled me was the fact that in their first confrontation Drake felt that for Blade to "show him what he's made off" meant running through the street completely without purpose. I mean, what the heck is that. Not all the action sucks though and Blade has a few new gadgets that are pretty cool.Overall Blade Trinity is about as polished as Viggo Mortensen's chin in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. The production seems rushed and the poor villain does that Blade Trinity stands as a shining example of how third films can be hugely disappointing.4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wesley Snipes returns as vampire hunter Blade in the third and final film in the Blade franchise, Blade: Trinity. When the Vampire Nation hatches a plan to frame Blade in a series of killings, he must join forces with the Nightstalkers, human vampire hunters. Not all is what it seems, when the legendary vampire Dracula makes an appearance.First of all, I loved the first two films and was eagerly anticipating this third explosive installment. It had some promising elements to it, such as the writer also being the director, with that you'd figure that Goyer would know what direction to take Blade and how to get there, but what we get on the screen is a mix of jumbled characters and no direction what so ever. Writers who are unexperienced should let the directing go to trained professionals, it seems Goyer just left the camera on and let the actors do their thing.Ryan Renolds, I believe stole the show, even though some of his jokes missed. I can see another movie spinning off from his character alone, but the rest of the Nightstalkers lack any kind of attachment what-so-ever, even Abagail. Dracula (Purcell) is so out of place, his lines are delivered like a board and nail. Posey makes an appearance as the female vampire lead, do I really have to go there? Blade II had some wrestling moves incorporated into it, so how does Goyer up on that, well introduce a wrestler into this flick, who has no acting talent what so ever, he's basically just a stunt double with a role, HHH should stick to wrestling. This is one of the main mistakes while making this movie, some pretty poor casting choices.The film feels more like a Nightstalkers movie then a Blade movie, Snipes takes a backseat to Renolds and Biel, which is a mistake. You do not take out your lead character to introduce some weak characters with no development.This third installment takes a different stroll from the first two, when both of the first films open, it opens with a bang/shock, here we get a mediocre opener. With both of the first films, they end with a bang, here we get a soft wrap up, not the best way to end a great trilogy...well after this film, a mediocre trilogy.It's hard to watch a film where the product placement is so utterly terrible, it takes you out of the experience. Once is good enough, but when they repeatedly beat it into you, you think to yourself STOP IT ALREADY and you can't focus on the story, well, what little story there is.The fight scenes are terrible, thanks to bad choreography and editing. The final showdown between the legendary Dracula and Blade is a let down because you can't follow the action and if you can, it looks phony. Just one question, if Dracula turned around and stopped the first arrow from hitting him, why couldn't he do the same thing with the second....oh, she won't shoot again right? It's sad to see a promising series take a turn for the worse, and the blade series follows the matrix as the third installment cannot hold a candle to the first two films, which brings down the whole camp. I would rather see BLADE end on a high note then a low one, but you got to stop while there is some dignity left. You know you're watching a bad film when the bad ass lead hero says 'coochie-coo'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***Attention, spoilers*** So, Blade 2 was about the dangers of tampering with a species' genome. In Blade 3, we find that the arch-vampire is actually a smart guy from the Middle-East. A real devil. Who'd have thought. Other than that, there is a lot of fine action and effects, as was to be expected. I didn't quite grasp the significance of 'immortality comes to such as are fit for it'. Well, no... and the point ? What about Drake? Is he in any sense 'more immortal' than usual vampires? What becomes of his victims ? They seem to die. Further, I have no problem with Blade having a team on his side. However, the relation between Nyssa and Blade in 'Blade 2' was more complex and, well, interesting than Abigail Whistler's just being another fighting machine. OK, you need to have a tough woman in there too, I know. That bit of family feeling however didn't really hurt. You can't infinitely play on the 'lonesome rider' theme, I think. All in all a rather shallow movie though which, however, doesn't fail to echo current world affairs. That last sentence says it all, doesn't it ? "And of course, the war never ends..."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun, but a let down</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Blade was never outwitted or out-fought. He has yet to meet anything resembling a real challenge. I would have liked to see a larger sacrifice on the hero's part - somewhere from which he can crawl back, (cuz you know he's gonna win eventually). Even an ultra-cool cat like Blade needs a challenge, and if the Lord of Vampires isn't going to provide that for him, then the director needs a good slap upside the head.The best heroes in history attained greatness, then lost it, then regained it - it's part of the mythos.Surveying randomly across the ages for a couple examples: Bruce Willis in Die Hard fought most of the movie without his shoes on, stepping through broken glass. Schwartzenegger dealt with Predator after all his companions were slain - only through ingenuity and admitted luck did he persevere. Achilles lost his best friend then went on a drinking binge before emerging from his tent and kicking some ass. Jesus people, give Snipes a little CHALLENGE!! He obviously can handle it - unlimited funds (from where?), meditating and fighting all day - he's a weapon, yes, but he's also part man. In the next Blade (a dubious hope) - I think it's time for Blade's human side to be explored a little more. Dude needs to get laid anyway.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was my biggest disappointment of last year, I am an avid fan of both Blade I &amp; II but this one really let it down, the violence has been dumbed down and the script is laughable. There were some passable action moments, but I cannot see this film delighting anyone not even the casual viewer. The plot is also disgraceful with the least scary nemesis I think a film has ever witnessed, to top it all the end battle is also shockingly bad, Dracula DOES not have a conscience!!!!1 Overall I would really say don't bother with this movie, it'll be forgotten as soon as the credits roll. If they want to make another Blade for god sake bring Del Toro back before the franchise is destroyed completely. My sympathies lie with Wesley snipes whose career has surely been tarnished by this lackluster movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Blade went from sarcastic to snappish and just all-out weird. Perhaps as a side effect to Whistler's death, but I personally liked him better when he was more at ease. Another change. First movie, huge gun. Second, the gun is smaller. But why is he now using pistols? The weapon downgrades were certainly unimpressive. And Drake. How did they get Drake from Dracula? Sure, maybe a more modern name, but come on, they could have just done Drac and I would have been happier. A majorly bad aspect WAS Drake. First off, he seemed almost lost to himself. Weak and fragile. He threw the baby; right to Blade. And if he could disappear from the top of a building that fast, and dodge a bullet, why couldn't he have beat the daylights out of Blade in a one-on-one sword fight? He took a hit that sent him through a window, but then when he transformed he couldn't even be hurt. He caught the first arrow yet not the second. AND, to top it all off, he got killed by a disease he would have outlived, IF he was really Dracula. He would have built an instant resistance against it, since he is "perfect". Also, he mentions a book that says he was the first. No, the book does not say he is the first, it says he is the mightiest.The plot was good, the acting was good, and I loved the smart, sarcastic comments. The overall appeal was fairly decent, but it fell far short of Blade II.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blade gets therapy!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***Mild SpoilersBlade gets therapy! All right, not really. After having seen Blade 2: One Blade Too Many, I was filled with a bit of trepidation over the prospect of seeing the latest installment in the Blade saga. Despite that trepidation, I decided to take a chance. Director David Goyer is a very mixed bag when it comes to the movies he has helmed. At this point he can go either way. He may improve (we will see when Batman Begins comes out) or he could start to slide toward Paul W. S. Anderson territory (shudder). Let us see what Goyer's career has been like so far. Hmmm, in 1993 there was Dollman vs. Demonic Toys. Nuff said there. In 1996 there was the insult to Brandon Lee's memory, The Crow: City of Angels. But wait! In 1998 there was Blade! Blade rocked....oh wait a minute, he did not direct that one. He did the screenplay. Big difference. Then came the annoyingly bad Blade 2: One Blade Too Many. That brings us up to Blade: Trinity. Well it was not as bad as Blade 2 and one might even say it was not bad at all, though just barely so. The most that really can be said is that it is mediocre or perhaps a little above that. Let us examine why. The biggest problem is with the bad guy, who in this film is Dracula himself, or Drake as he is now called. When we first see Dracula he actually looks pretty cool. Well, way cool to be honest. That bad-ass kind of do not want to mess with him cool. But unfortunately for us (and one has to wonder as a result of a low special effects budget) he quickly morphs into leather pants wearing, Euro-trash Dracula. The scenes we do get with him are just to show how....ohhhhh, he is so eeeeeeevilllll. Boring. It takes a damn good director to make a completely evil character interesting. Unfortunately for us, Goyer is not one of those directors. What really saves the film from going way down hill into Paul W. S. Anderson territory is Hannibal King (Ryan Reynolds). He is a wise-cracking night-stalker. Night-stalkers are a covert group of humans who stalk and kill vampires. The scenes that are most interesting generally include him. His partner Abigail Whistler (yep you guessed it.....related to THAT Whistler) also does well and actually looks and acts like she might be able to kick some vampire ass when the occasion presents itself. Though the little character trait of having her listen to her ipod when she is out staking vampires just seems a little too much like a marketing ploy. How much situational awareness can someone have if they have music blasting in their ears while doing commando style raids? Parker Posey's Danica Talos (the second vampire in command) is played a little too much over the top to be enjoyable. She did a must better job in Best in Show.Snipes does his usual serviceable job as the brooding Blade. Thankfully, Goyer resisted the temptation to turn him into wise-cracking Blade. The other scoobies in the night-stalker team are entertaining for the short time we see them, but they seem to only be in the film for a few moments of comic relief before being dispatched by Euro-trash Dracula. OHHHH, he done went and kill-ded my buddies! GRRRRR! I will not go into the plot other than say it was a fairly good idea. The action and effects are well done also. So why did I not like this movie as much as I should have? Well, as I mentioned before, there was Euro-Trash, leather pants-wearing Dracula whose main purpose seemed to be to snarl and act bad before having the big showdown with Blade. But more than that, the cool idea was just not handled as well as it could have been. For these kinds of movies to work there has to be a certain amount of chemistry between the main baddie and the hero. None here. When Drake is finally dispatched he starts talking about honor, legacies and all that, blah, blah, blah. I say blah, blah, blah, not because I think honor is an outdated concept but because it is coming from the mouth of a character who earlier in the film grabs an infant and tosses it off the top of a multi-story building, giving Blade the choice of continuing the chase or saving the infant. Yeh that is honor all right. Goyer has shown himself to be capable of good ideas, but so far, he has shown that he cannot follow through on them particularly well. In the case of Blade 3 that tradition continues. If you want to go out for some mindless fun, Blade 3 will fit the bill, but if you are looking for something a little more filling, you might want to go elsewhere.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alas ... an almost forced reprise for Wesley, such a good fit for the Blade franchise that one can hardly consider someone else in it.Erratic editing, miscasting and toppish dialogue ... You know how your dog tilts his head quizzically every time he hears something odd? That was me quite often throughout the film.The comic-to-film leap is more delicate than most know - just ask the fans. The director either gets it or he does it. Why is Keaton (ostensibly one of the last guys in the world anyone would pick for a macho superhero role) still regarded by most as the only decent Batman? Because he gets it.Stick with the directors that get it, bring del Toro back. On a brighter note, Posey did reasonably well in her Vampire Goddess/Fairuza Balk tole. Dominic Purcell too young for such a 'legendary' role as Dracula; should have been filled by a Bill Nighy as Victor in Underworld. Purcell, too, seemed a bit awkward with his dialogue, although a powerful screen look.Then again, easy for us to sit back and judge the finished product harshly. We still should take our hats off and respect the talent, time and hard work that these actors, producers and staff put into a film.</fullReview>

The only really entertaining actor was Ryan Reynolds who plays Hannibal King. He was extremely funny. At the end of the movie you find yourself asking, "uuhhh is that it?". The soundtrack was neither good nor bad. Dracula was weak and not even scary, this is supposed to be the King of Vampires?? I don't think so. Can you say rip-off of Predator? Decent special effects but nothing really new since Blade 2. Jessica Biel is extremely annoying. Stunts were too fantastical almost like current kung-fu titles.

		<fullReview>BLADE: TRINITY is the third and supposedly last film in the BLADE trilogy. I doubt it. Is it as bad as everyone has been saying it is? Not even close. Since the first two were so well done; it would be hard to top them. Yes, some of the humor is juvenile and insipid BUT the film keeps the pace and the energy going just like the first two films. Also, with another strong performance by Wesley Snipes as the title character and a great supporting performance by Jessica Biel BLADE: TRINITY worked well for me. Ryan Reynolds as Hannibal King, however, was miscast and he seems out of place in this film. Dominic Purcell as Dracula is menacing and perhaps the best bit of casting was Parker Posey as Dracula's main hench woman. She chews up every scene she is in. I hope there are more BLADE films and I'm sure they can be better than this one, but, this one by my standards, was a good time. *** out of 4.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What the devil have they done to Dracula!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've just seen Blade Trinity on DVD and like some of the vampires in the film it shouldn't have seen the light of day. I've read about the difficulties on and off set between writer/director David S Goyer (who should have stayed just writer) and Wesley Snipes which could have had some effect on its outcome. But it's a mess on just about every level for me. Blade, looking bored at times, is relegated to the back burner for the best part of the film, making way for a set of new, instantly forgettable vampires and sidekicks. The fight scenes are so bland my eyes kept drifting towards a particularly unhealthy pair of socks on my bedroom floor, which really need a wash. Unlike the first two films, Trinity has a serious lack of style and imagination in terms of the way it's shot, the locations and lighting. It looks like half the film hasn't been colour graded! The biggest problem for me though was Dracula. I'm a big fan of vampire films, especially where Dracula is concerned, but never have I seen him defined this badly. As a man he HAS to ooze charm and control but most importantly be feared, not look like he just stumbled out of a bikers bar after hours with a serious thirst on. In Trinity, Dracula transforms into a rubbery devil not dissimilar to the one in 'Legend', which isn't a bad look, but it isn't Dracula! In a scene where Blade chases Dracula up and down some high-rise flats I couldn't help asking myself, why is Dracula actually running away? He can appear as mist, vapour or fog can't he, and disappear at will. I'm all for modernising but surely they could have kept SOME of his classic characteristics in the film. I mean come on...He's DraculaOverall there seems to be a lack of anything engaging. Blade 2 in particular gave a real sense of where the vampires came from and their purpose. It had an imaginative, believable world and the characters, especially the evil ones, were really likable. Trinity bypasses these elements and consequently means you don't care. It's basically had its heart ripped out. You do get a feeling during the film that Snipes is being edged out of the franchise, although how that can happen and still have future films called Blade, I don't know. I wouldn't be surprised to see a TV or straight to DVD spin-off take shape. Anyway there's so much more to say but in classical Hollywood style I'll end on a happy note. Whistler's daughter is hot!</fullReview>

Though I just don't understand why this movie doesn't try to take itself seriously?What I mean is if you replaced all this cliché' lines and obvious over-acting with a solid story line about vampires, there is no reason (in my opinion) that this wouldn't work.Take the X-Men movie for example. I loved this movie because even though most of us realise that super-humans are not real, it still showed us the reality of what would be if they were. I really wish blade trinity (not so much the previous blade movies) tried to do this, especially since many people believe or want to believe in vampires.I personally enjoy a movie a lot more when I can get lost in the illusion of it, rather than being prompted every 10 minutes that it is just another Hollywood action movie.</fullReview>

The vampires were all hollow and had nothing scary or evil about them. Anyone who loves the first two movies: refrain from watching this steaming pile of crap because it will totally ruin everything. My vote is 4 out of ten and the 4 points were solely because of the character Hannibal King. The story itself was very lame and the entire movie feels like it has been made just to collect some cash.

		<fullReview>Being quite a fan of the first two installments I was looking forward to the final? chapter of the trilogy (although one can be sure that another one will follow as long as this one makes enough money). Well, what to say about the flick?! I think that Blade Trinity is not as good as the previous ones but still it entertained me throughout its running time. One of the major problems is the villain: Dracula is so anemic which makes him such a colorless character. Either one makes the villain so evil that he/she is really detestable or one must provide the villain with character traits that make him interesting. Neither of it is the case here. Dracula is not really that evil and frightening as he could be. Another problem are the action sequences. Yes, they are okay and sometimes quite good but overall anybody who has watched action movies in the last years will not really be impressed by what he has seen (Blade I was even pretty revolutionary in the pre-Matrix era). I also felt that this installment lacked the pretty dark and dense atmosphere of its predecessors. Astonishingly I liked Ryan Reynolds' performance.The character Hannibal King is really a flat character but nonetheless he was really funny sometimes. To put it in a nutshell: If one liked the first two flicks he/she will probably like the this one as well although this franchise shows signs of wear and tear under David S. Goyer.</fullReview>

Good thing he gets some assistance from Abigail Whistler (Jessica Biel) and Hannibal King (really, who makes up these names?) (Ryan Reynolds) who offer a contribution in the babe-and-fun factor.There's still a lot lacking of Blade: Trinity, as the end fight is rather boring and overlong, and it has a really bad 'bad guy' to fight, but the extra's make it an OK ride.5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I feel this film was rushed. The first Blade came out in 1998. The second one wasn't released until 2002. I think that the appearance of the third and supposedly final film so soon indicates that they only had one thing on there mind. Money. This apple has fallen far from the tree that was Blade. In comparison to the first two films this one feels like a low-budget, home-made, fan film. It offers almost nothing but cheap quick-cut action, endlessly and excessive smart-ass remarks from the "Hannibal King" character, and lame, rushed, cgi effects. This is David Goyer's first film and at this rate it will likely be his last. Blade: Trinity does not have the dark, fear-approaching effect that the first, and arguably the second one had. Instead it has a murky, what's-Hannibal King-gonna-say- next feel to it. The film is called "Trinity" but it is far from anything holy. The WORST part of the film was the ABSOLUTELY horribly choreographed and shot "final fight" sequence between Blade and "Drake" or "Dracula". Blade 3 could have been a lot better in many ways, if the script had just gone through another draft, and Goyer could have just found a better more experienced director. I left the theater feeling let down. Will I buy the DVD? Yes. Why?? Because hopefully the deleted scenes and supposed alternate ending will make up for this vastly inferior third outing.</fullReview>

Then there was Blade II which also had a great bad guy, good action and funny quips from the new characters led by Ron Pearlman, in a role infinitely superior to Hellboy. Then we come to Blade Trinity.The story is ridiculous, the new characters are like the brat-pack, and Ryan Reynolds Character is abhorrent. The weapons are ridiculous,and look like toys not guns, and the Lazer Bow style weapon is just ludicrous. The dialogue is terrible, and the only thing that saves the film from complete disaster is Grimwood, played brilliantly by Triple H. In wrestling terms I have never liked "The Game", but if it hadn't have been for him, this film would have been utter garbage.My advice would be to avoid like the plague, my only fear being that they will inevitably market the series as "The Blade Trilogy", which means like "The Godfather Trilogy" "The Scary Movie Trilogy" and "The Rambo Trilogy" we will have to endure a terrible 3rd installment even if we don't want it.Truly, Truly awful film.</fullReview>

Some say the blind scientist was Whistler's second daughter, I don't think so...And yeah, how did Drake manage to shape shift AFTER dying? He DID die in front of the viewers, and later, 'Blade's' body at the morgue transforms back to Drake...so does that mean there'll be a Blade 4?

		<fullReview>Just got back from Blade Trinity. I had heard terrible things about it, which is why I waited until a two dollar matinée to see it.This is a decent sequel that relies on a young, charismatic supporting cast to overshadow the fact that Snipes doesn't put as much effort into it as the previous sequels. IMHO Snipes lackluster presence on the screen is only motivated by his multi-million dollar paycheck. Not to say that he doesn't have his moments, there are several moments where he reminds us of the old Blade, just not consistent.Ryan Reynolds carries this movie. Jessica Biel isn't bad, and great to look at. HHH is an entertaining villain. Parker Posey is an wicked force of villianess charm. Natasha Lyonne is completely wasted as the blind scientist, but having her on screen is comforting, unfortunately because she is blind she always wears glasses, her eyes are her personality.Finally, the beast version of Drake at the end, is really badass.This film suffers from the fact that the vampires seem too weak in this film, you never see them kill anyone. A popcorn film can never be perfect. Overall this is a fun movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Easily the worst of the Blade movies, Blade Trinity sees the return of Dracula, the original vampire. Whom Blade must obviously kill. After Blade's hideout is being assaulted by SWAT teams, and after Whistler humps around, killing cops with his shotgun left and right, Blade teams up with Whistler's daughter and a plethora of boring, annoying characters you just wish dead right from the start.Well that's not quite right. To be accurate, Jessica Biel's character was annoying too. I think the title of most annoying would be a tie between Ryan Reynolds' character and the blind woman. Well, at least Ryan Reynolds says some funny words to the vampires, but the blind woman has the upside of ending up dead.The only good thing in the movie is Wesley Snipes' solid performance as Blade. Sadly, Blade is somewhat sidelined by his new human allies, who are stronger, faster and tougher than most vampires. Including the martial arts trained ones. And the fabulous mr. Drake? He seemed cool in his real form, but was far from convincing when in human form. The least interesting Blade villain yet.And well, the music isn't that bad. The music vid.. i mean film just makes it seem it is.4/10 - don't waste your time watching this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Blade Trinity is the latest in the Blade series. Let's hope it stays that way. It's a highly entertaining movie, but it clearly shows that David S. Goyers interpretation of the Blade universe, has turned into a pretty unoriginal parade of action and faceless one-sided characters. The story is alright albeit not as good as in Blade or Blade II. This time Dracula - or Drake as he's called - is awakened by the vampires to help them defeat Blade and achieve world supremacy. Along the way Blade gets assistance from Whistlers daughter Abby (Jessica Biel) and a former vampire Hannibal King (Ryan Reynolds). The main plot is Blade versus Drake, and the two sidekicks also have their own demons to fight, which makes out the side plots. Everything is well told and straightforward, ending with a final showdown between Blade and Drake. The ending also makes sense, and leaves a small opening for a fourth movie.The acting is adequate but the quality of the characters are mixed. The Hannibal King character (Ryan Reynolds) is annoying. He's a good actor but his character is stupid. He's supposed to be the fun sidekick, but instead his comments end up being completely misplaced, and that makes his character pointless. Fun sidekicks are fine if they are properly implemented. In the first movie Quinn was the fun guy who's silly behavior and tendency to get hurt, worked really well. That's not the case with Ryan Reynolds, fortunately we don't get to see him that much. Jessica Biel works very well as Abby. She's a silent angry girl full of hatred towards the vampires, and it's a joy to see her beat them up. She works well with the Blade character which is delivered convincingly once again by Wesley Snipes. The conflict within Blade between the vampire and the human is told as reminder of what he is, but the script doesn't take advantage of his split personality.The vampires are a pretty boring experience. In Blade and Blade II the vampire society was full of internal tension, intrigues and some interesting/entertaining characters. This time the vampires are a boring faceless bunch. There is a leader (who wakes up Drake), and then there are hordes a vampire henchmen for the heroes to beat up. Boring! In the first Blade you had the story of a rebellious Frost versus the more conservative pure blooded vampires. In the second Blade the main villains' daughter fell in love with Blade. But in Blade Trinity vampires are just there to die. Drake is alright and played well by Dominic Purcell. He's supposed to be a higher vampire-being - not degenerated as the rest of the species - but the story only implies it and doesn't elaborate on it. It's a shame since a more nuanced Drake could have added some spice to the movie. The greatest shame is the end-battle. Most of it is great and you get to see Blade and Drake fight it out with swords and martial arts while they destroy the building. GREAT!!! Then Drake turns into a huge rubber monster and acts like an invulnerable truck who can only walk around a little and say "grarrrrgg" (or something like that). A shame.The action sequences are tremendous. The weapons are awesome, the choreography is awesome and the effects are awesome. Accompanied by a really cool soundtrack, it adds up to a higher experience. I think the great music and the sound in general has always been a trademark of Blade, and Trinity lives up to the standard.I think you should see this movie because the story is solid, because Snipes and Biel are awesome together, and because the action is excellent. All in all a very entertaining movie and a fitting end to the Blade movies (I hope). When you see it, ignore Ryan Reynolds and don't expect anything original at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, I thankfully saw the movie Blade Trinity before I read the reviews. I have to concede that the film was very different from the first two movies but that doesn't make it bad. Personally I disliked the second one and was relived to find more humour in this movie.I really enjoyed Blade Trinity it was a great action movie with acerbic humour added into it. The special effects were brilliant as well!It was also interesting to see that Blade got back-up this time. Even if he didn't want it. Though perhaps we could have had a little more interaction between Blade and these new characters. As for review that mention Dominic Purcell's lack at being Dracula all I can say it that who knew Dracula could be so sexy and horrifying at the same time.</fullReview>

How then can the writer/director possibly justify equipping Abigail Whistler with an Ipod for when she fights the undead?I was recently in a bar brawl and I remember thinking, thank goodness I'm not wearing my Ipod today. I'd get my a$$ handed to me. Are the bucks really worth the shame of a product placement blowing a hole in your already thin plot credibility?Shame on you Goyer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>we just saw blade trinity tonight...we loved blade 1 and 2 and had our doubts about this latest due to different director. sadly this film is the turkey of the three. maybe as a stand alone film we'd like it more, but compared to the first two it is sadly lacking. was there a tight budget for blades clothes? he just didn't look as good, and as for his boots (as seen in close up when stepping from car) any average joe is seen wearing them... gone are the mega tuff biker type boots. wesley snipes is always good though, its such a shame that the company didn't insist on waiting for del toro to complete the trilogy. this film also seems to have been influenced by the matrix, had the same slickness to it that we didn't feel belonged to the blade films. seems as though the costume dept might have shared matrix designs too. there is maybe a bit too much attempt at humour.. the one guy is a regular comedian as he's getting his head pounded for the umpteenth time. good effects, mostly good acting...just not a satisfying tribute to the 1st and 2nd. anyway this is our view on this film my partner says i'm generous giving it 4 he gives it 0...hes very upset over it, a big blade fan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit I wasn't a fan of the first film, but I didn't think it was embarrassingly bad. The second film was a big step in the right direction. Interesting plot (with the three conflicting sides and actually interesting bad guys) and decent action and not excessive amounts of blatant posing and clichés. Now this film *was* embarrassingly bad and had all those things I just mentioned that the second film managed to avoid.So lets get down to it. Virtually no plot. Pretty much just ripped out of "Vampire Movies for Dummys". I could sum it up in one short sentence, but then that'd constitute a spoiler. Really there is that little going on. The characters themselves are about the most 2 dimensional and wooden characters I've ever seen. The acting isn't too bad, aside from Snipes himself who seems to have given up on acting completely but decided to keep making films regardless. He's never come across as a poor actor to me before in any of his films but he did in this one. The other actors seem okay, indeed Triple H was surprisingly competent (not that he had a hard role, I think the guy had all of 3 lines), but none of them really had enough screen time (or character dev) to make you give a hoot who they are or what happens to them.Of course it doesn't help that the film actually looses tempo *during* it's action sequences and the excessive supposed "stylish" moments drag on so long and are so clichéd that you loose interest before the action even starts. The action sequences themselves are all pretty standard, lack any kind of surprise, or there are very few "woah that's cool" moments (I can only think of one in the entire film). The rest of it is just digging up the same ole same ole from any number of action films. The only thing this film was lacking in the cliché department was a bullet time "Matrix" style sequence and thank the god of flogged dead donkeys for that one! Still that is only a small redeeming feature. Some of the posing and "style" stuff is so cheesy it's like a parody of itself and were the film supposed to be tongue in cheek they may have gotten away with it, but sadly the film seems to take itself seriously.This is a film that if it had come out in the 80's it would possibly have been acceptable. Not good, but acceptable. In the modern day I really think an action film either needs to try and give a bit more depth to characters and/or plot or at least try and pioneer some new things on the action front.I guess though, if you liked all the posing and clichés from the first film you may find this worth a watch, but I wouldn't really recommend paying the price of a cinema ticket for it. Wait for it to be on TV or something, you won't be missing out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not enough depth, too little, too early.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the midst of yet another winter we get the next installment of the Blade franchise. Trinity, the third and quite possibly the last in the series stumbles and staggers like Whistler trying to win a potato sack race. Oh yes, that last line was corny, forgive me. At least I didn't cast a franchise of great potential into the fiery pits of mediocrity.I guess I'll start with my "qualms" about the film. The foremost biggest problem this film had was bad casting, namely the Dracula character. I don't know, maybe it's just me but when a movie has a Dracula character it sets a higher standard for big bad villain. Dracula should have a lot of depth, which I thought this Drac lacked. They didn't do enough with his history in this movie, maybe it was due to time issues. Or maybe it was just lack of diligence and imagination. Drake's "beast" form was great though. By far one of the film's shining moments, but it's light eclipsed by Drake's boring brooding Calvin Klein model human form. If they would have had the beast throughout the entire film it would have been much better.The vampire cronies worked decent enough, I suppose. There wasn't enough room for them to screw up. They just had to flash their fangs in a close-up, snarl and growl then escape. Triple H did an alright job considering he is a wrestler, even though his character was basically the same one he plays in the WWE, he just had fangs. The Nightstalkers weren't focused on enough but that's okay. We pretty much know they won't last the entire movie, no harm no foul. Biel was brilliant, appearance wise, as she always is. She continues to make a career on carrying badly written movies by her looks and nothing more. She isn't one of the greatest actresses of our time but certainly one of best looking. The director believed this and thus we get Abigail Whistler in leather pants the entire movie, one of it's strong points. The "King" character should have had a "Hello, My Name Is Comic Relief" patch on instead, but he helps a bland movie inch it's way to finish so he gets a passing grade. And I hate to say this, but even Snipes seemed like he'd rather be someplace else.I don't know if any of the films followed the comic story line but in terms of the three movies, I think this would have been better suited as Blade 2 only because of it's lack of innovation, creativity and wide-open ending. I felt more fulfilled after the real Blade 2 in which he loses a girl he started to care about, fought a formidable(and well designed) foe and actually changed his "universe" significantly. That is what we call story advancement.I've rambled on long enough here. If the above paragraphs meandered and have led you nowhere then you have a good idea of what this movie did for me. Save this one for a rental.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>TheProblem with Blade:Trinity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's really sad that such a great series has gone out with, instead of a bang, a commercialized teeny-bop fizzle. Wrtiters =/= directors and Blade Trinity proves just this. The writer/director took away what made the first two movies so great. The movie has NO real character development, not enough "Blade", no real plot, and no real Super Villain ("Drake" aka Dracula was NO Deacon Frost).What's worse is that they turned Blade into a corny one-line spitting one-dimensional character. You could tell that Wesley really didn't want to do this movie. He was rumored to be VERY upset with the direction and advertising of the movie and now I can see why. It seems like this was more of an introduction for a spin-off movie series for those lame-ass NightStalkers instead of a BLADE film. I paid 9 bucks to see Blade, Not some Gen X iPOD listening hip young techy vamp killers. What happened to trying to appeal to the ORIGINAL audience that loved the first two movies so much? Now, we get a movie geared towards 14 -18 yr olds who only care about mindless action, hot women and corny jokes. Out with the old and in with the new huh? I feel you Mr. Snipes. I'll end this with a few points that I really felt brought the movie down 1)Whistler is needlessly and randomly killed off like a character from a bad soap opera 2) Drake is in no way intimidating and looks out of place as Dracula (looked more like a Gladiator reject) 3) The vampire shop scene was more like a deleted scene from the eventual DD release 4) Triple-H does not, I repeat, DOES NOT belong in ANY Blade movies, and runs like an idiot.5) Why are vampires so easy to kill now? and why do some of them look like high school drop out sk8rs? 6) Too many non developed points; Harvest station....why? Whistlers daughter...wha?? Blind lady can read computer models and complex DNA synthesis...how??? 7) Dracula, the King of all vampires, should NOT be running AWAY from Blade and stealing babies and then talking about honor. *note* In the chase scene he (or his stunt double) hilariously trips on one of the doors he breaks through 8) Blade spits out one too many stupid and corny one-liners, and curses way too much.9) Product placement is horrible. Do these people think that we won't notice the shameless plugs of their products? or just don't care? Damn, I think I need to get an iPOD now....and 10) Blade is NOT a comedy. Comedy is OK, but when it starts taking front seat to the action and horror/suspense in a BLADE movie then something has gone horribly wrong.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is not for everyone, but if you liked the last 2 Blade movies Wesley Snipes has kept the tradition alive. Good villains, good supporting cast, and well paced action. The story, which revolves around resurrecting Dracula to battle Blade, holds together OK and the fight scenes are very cool. Parker Posey was surprisingly good as the evil mastermind. After seeing this, I don't think there is any role she can't pull off. While the movie rehashes the basic plot lines from the previous Blade outings (gotta find a way to subjugate the humans and defeat Blade), there are some original twists, subtle political jabs, and more humor than the last time around. 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie was very different...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was hearing everyone and their vampire dog bark about how bad this movie was. Like Beil stopping in the middle of a fight to put on an Ipod, how Parker was absolutely terrible. Well, when I walk in to see Blade, I'm not expecting anything beyond an action movie. This movie was good in my opinion, but they should have definitely changed a few things. The 'Drake' Legend thing was cool, that cutscene where they explain how he comes about was awesome. I got tingles. But the actor that played him should have either been less fired up when delivering lines or just get a new actor. Why did they take him?? They should have gotten someone who is just plain lethal as an actor, ala Gary Oldman. I think Sean Bean would have been terrific. He has that germanic look and he's a top notch actor. He wouldn't have hammed it up like the dood we got. Plus Drake was too all over the board. He kills the psychiatrist dood then stabs Reynolds, then goes on a merry chase. He should have just (by pure strength alone) torn Reynold's arm outta socket when he grabbed him and huffed him. That and Drake goes on about honour? He steals a baby! They shoulda built him up on the honour thing more then it would have been earned instead of going on just him saying it.Parker Posie was the best villain I have seen since Deacon. Some were saying she was like a spoiled rich girl. I found her to be just an evil businesswoman. What is more evil than that? She was lethal and just scary.That part where she comes downstairs to get Blade when he was arrested was one of the best intros I have ever seen. I didn't mind Triple H being in there but they should have had him do NOTHING with wressling. I mean come on now! The rock should never do a rock bottom to anyone in a movie. That is gay. If he were just a straight thug then he would have been much cooler.I understand that Whisler had to die, I didn't mind that. I also was glad they didn't do the "I'm dying but I have enough breathe to tell Blade to keep going on man" type of deal. He just died in a misshap. Cool.Hannibal King was awesome. In any kind of action movie, I have always liked someone who was as wise ass. With him, he was kind of like Ghandi, they had him, were beating the snot out of him, and he couldn't stop behind himself. He didn't like what Parker was suggesting they do to him, and he was left without a smart remark there, but basically he never broke. I like how most of the time Blade could just stand and start at him, because he knew it wasn't worth his time to respond to most of the smart mouthing.It wasn't as bad with screen time as everyone was saying. Some people were saying that blade had like 4 lines. He has enough lines to keep him Blade, but hey this movie isn't about him and his past, it's about his future, hunting with the nightstalkers. They got an equal portion of the screen time. That didn't bother me. We all know blade well enough.I didn't care about the nightstalkers helpers. I mean they are just there to fill roles, I didn't care if they died early, or how it happened or whathaveyou. I hate hearing some people whine that they weren't full characters, why was she blind, yadda yadda. I mean we get intro'd to Chewie in star wars, did anyone wanna know his background? No, we know nothing about him but everyone loves chewie :)The final battle wasn't anything to write home about. It wasn't like the first one or even the second one. They should have had it slower and more dramatic. There was 0 chemistry between Drake and Blade. I mean there was tons with Blade and Frost. Or even a bit with NOvak. He had a reason to battle Frost. Frost was like a zealot, he had his religion and if Blade didn't stop him, well that was it. Drake was just a bad guy, big deal. If he didn't stop him then Drake would just snack on humanity. No big deal.I didn't buy Biel as an action star. I didn't know if it was the editing or what, but a beautiful girl always gets bounced out as a toughie. Because you know that if you can find a girl who fights that well, she likely isn't going to be amazing, likely she will be average. They shoulda covered her in scars or bruises or something. Overall I enjoyed it but hey they coulda fixed a few things, no?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ending on a 'meh'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was a big fan of the original 'Blade' movie-I was impressed at how a fairly obscure Marvel character could be given such a great adaptation.Like so many, I looked forward to Blade II. I was disappointed by it-too many plot illogics, bad scripting and dodgy effects. But I can watch it with friends and enjoy for what it is. According to many sources 'Blade: Trinity' will be the last film in the series, and that is a shame. Not because it's a return to form and a great film, but because it ends not on a bang, or a whimper but a figurative shrug. The movie almost completely sidelines Blade in favour of the 'Nightstalkers', as it is hoped they will get a spin off series. While the story is strong, many of the villains are unmemorbale and the actor who plays Drake/Dracula is possibly the worst actor I have ever seen. The fight scenes, while visually impressive, look rehearsed and are badly edited. However, there are highlights which make up for the films deficiencies. The most obvious one is the performance of Ryan Reynolds. His continual wisecracks and smart comments never grate and make the prospect of a spin off somewhat desirable. But with very little Blade, bad acting and very little sense of finality for the character, 'Trinity' is oddly unsatisfying. Final Score-5.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Third Time Ain't the Charm.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this disaster today and was totally disappointed. Once I heard that writer David S. Goyer would be taking over the directing chores, knew we were in trouble. It's like putting in a rookie quarterback, at the height of a teams winning season. Granted, "Blade 2" was to "Blade" as "Matrix Reloaded" was to "The Matrix", but both franchises were still in full swing. And now we have, Blade's version of "The Matrix Revolutions" (at least "Revolutions" had a cool battle scene). Hey, Goyer! Stick to script-writing or practice directing straight-to-video releases. You ain't ready for the big leagues yet. How could you screw this up? This movie should have written itself. There were so many better plots.It's starts off with a group of vampires searching in the Middle East for the Supreme Being that they all sprang from. They figure he can help them destroy Blade and give them all the ability to be "daywalkers". Meanwhile, Blade is set-up in an ambush where he's taped killing a human who he thinks is a vampire, making him Public Enemy No. 1. The plot stinks and more so, when you consider the original plot was to have the world already taken over by vampires. Who cast this thing? Who called Triple H??? We all know wrestlers cant' act. The Rock is the best they have and look at him. What about the rest of them? Hulk Hogan? Roddy Piper? Jesse Ventura? nuff said!! Parker Posey is sexy and looks the part but but she's terribly miscast. And what about the primo himself? Dominic Purcell? I remember him from FOX's "John Doe" but who in Sam Hill figured he'd be a decent Dracula? Bad enuff, he's not even scary but then he doesn't even reflect as an authority figure. And Ryan Reynolds...he was funny but he just didn't seem to fit. He was just comedy relief. But he wasn't that funny. His stuff ran thin pretty quick to the point of being annoying. Meanwhile, talent like Natasha Lyonne were wasted.Then the plot zigs and zags from one subplot before it's even halfway resolved to the next. Why wasn't there a big tender scene where Blade tells Abigail that her father had been killed? Why didn't they play off of the "murder set-up" angle? Get the unsuspecting humans involved in the witch hunt more. It just seemed everyone was in on it because it was simply vampires and familiars. Gee, it was nice that they cared enuff to squeeze in some quick bio info on Abigail and Hannibal. I guess they wanted to set us up for the Nightstalkers spin-off, if it ever happens. (Aren't we tired of vampires and hit men movies yet?)The action scenes barely made sense. Blade (Wesley Snipes) barely cuts loose until the end. He basically stands and poses through the whole movie.How is it a human like King is able to fight a vampire (and a buff one like Triple H) and almost match him strength-wise. And shouldn't Blade have had more trouble with the Supreme One? He got a better ass-kicking from Nomak. All-in-all, this inferior flick ruins the franchise. (I think Kristofferson was happy to bow out early and I'm sure Wesley's finished with it, too). As usual in sequels, the third time ain't the charm. (Alien, The Matrix, Die Hard). I hope they don't screw up the next X-Men, Shrek or Spiderman movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blade Trinity - The final nail in the coffin of Sequels (spoilers ahead)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fellow movie fanaticsI don't know where to begin. I have genuinely never been this disappointed in a highly anticipated sequel in a large movie franchise (and yes, that does include The Matrix). I thought that 2004, a year that will be surely remembered in many movie calendars as the worst year in movie sequel history, could not get any worse. I was so, SO wrong. In my desperate hope that Blade Trinity would rescue this awful period I found myself giving the film every chance I could, ignoring terrible, terrible moments like Blade saying "coohie coo" to a baby, or Ryan Reynold's opening all of his Christmas crackers early to read the jokes on set instead of his lines. Ignoring terrible errors like giving a blind character a braille keyboard but also a monitor. Ignoring all of the stupid names that the Night Stalkers gave their bits of kit instead of just calling them "bullet" or "knife with silver edge" etc. And please, don't get me started on Whistler's daughter's disgustingly unsubtle product placement moments with her iPod and MP3 downloads.It was like, "OK, it's the final Blade film, I guess he has to fight Dracula", except they accidentally cast Dracula as a camp GAP model who stupidly only decides to turn into his 8 foot tall, demon-like form in the last 5 seconds of the movie instead of throughout, which might have spared him from his eventual demise as he seems to swat Blade away from him like you would an annoying fly when in large and scary form. Still, I'm sure you can guess the ending.Blade Trinity truly was the final nail in the coffin of recent sequels. After The Matrix Reloaded, Revolutions, Resident Evil 2, Spiderman 2, etc. etc., I'm terrified of seeing Ocean's 12 as I fear will be outdone by the likes of Scooby Doo. I just don't get how a franchise that has kept the same Director for all 3 outings could go so wrong at the end.You have to know that there is something wrong with a film when a WWE wrestler's vampire dog is on of the best things in it. Please, please, please, I implore you, spend your hard earned money on The Incredibles, or Dawn of the Dead, unless your short of a turkey for Christmas in which case Blade Trinity will do nicely.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While critics have absolutely slaughtered this movie, the general word of mouth has been positive. My only hope was that this third installment of the Blade saga was going to be better than the second. And it was!There is no cheesy love story this time bogging down the action like in Blade 2, and you basically see Wesley Snipes and his gang battle evil vampires the entire movie. Reynolds actually provides some goofy comic relief, and if you're not too sophisticated you'll appreciate it. Biel does a great job as well as Whistler's daughter, and provides strong female support not previously seen in the Blade movies. The story has holes in it, and the main bad guy isn't the greatest villain I've ever seen, but it's still worth seeing on the big screen for matinée price if you enjoy action/comic book movies. The first movie remains my favorite, but if you're a fan of the whole franchise, than see this one!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Expected better. (Minor Spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw the first Blade film back in 1998, my first thought was that Snipes had found a role that I felt he was "born to play". Blade is a role that only Snipes could play, and thankfully, he did portray Blade for three films. The success of Blade made us want more, and it would be four years until we got Blade 2 (2002). I think the time it took to make the second paid off because that film gave us something different. I actually like the second film, mostly because Snipes seems to be enjoying playing Blade, and because I liked the acting in it (like Pearlman and Kristofferson). So, you can imagine my expectations for the third film. Before I talk about the bad things about Blade:Trinity, allow me to talk about the good things. The action in Trinity is good, but it isn't anything that will knock your socks off. The chase scene in the beginning is solid, and this is really the only time Snipes seems to be enjoying himself in this movie (more on that in a bit). Still, the action is good, so that is not a letdown. Parker Posey and Dominic Purcell could have done more and should have done more. Posey works with what she has, but I just felt that she should have been given more screen time. Same goes for Purcell, who plays Dracula (Drake). This guy does his job well, but he is not used enough (the first time he and Blade meet is good). Drake and Danica needed to be developed more to make them better heels in this film. A good action film needs a very convincing bad guy. Drake is the ultimate bad guy vampire, and he needed more time to show that. Danika is conniving and she wants to destroy Blade, so for the most part, her character does try to fill the bad guy role. Had Drake been better established, then I have a feeling the film would've been a whole lot better.Now, the bad. It seems that Reynolds is being blasted for his role in this film. I don't think his character needed to be left out of it, but it did seem a little too much with his potty mouth humor and his sarcasm. Yes, he added a new twist with being the funny sidekick, but his character does not mesh well with Blade at all. Reynolds should have been funny, but I think Goyer gave him too many one-liners to use in the film. Some are good and funny, but there are just as many worthless cracks in here that drag the script down. I did like Reynolds in this film. He pulled it off, and I can see him doing action films in his future. The guy showed he can act and he can do an action film, which I admit I was tentative about. I just think Goyer wrote his character wrong. As for Biel, I will say this. Yes, she is hot and yes she does look good kicking ass. But this role did not suit her at all, and I found her character to be the weakest in the whole movie. She is Whistler's daughter, born out of wedlock. Okay.........so she finds daddy and decides she wants to fight the good fight. Okay..........and? Basically, all you can gather from her is that she has a lot of aggression and decides to join up with daddy to kick some ass. Nice.....but shouldn't there have been more to her? I've yet to see what makes Biel such a hot commodity in Hollywood. I have yet to be impressed by her so far. Hot? Hell yes she is! But that is about it. Now to Snipes. It seemed to me that Wesley did not enjoy doing this film. Honestly, his delivery of his lines is not convincing at all, and it seems that he just wanted to get this third film done so he could do other projects that were more important to him. I don't think that Reynolds or Biel brought him down. Snipes just is not into being Blade in this one. Look at Blade's 1 and 2, and you'll see that Snipes is enjoying playing Blade. And Goyer? Well, if this guy wants to continue to direct movies, then he will need to improve. The fact he wrote and directed this film means that he has to take much of the blame for its' faults. Someone mentioned that Trinity seems like one, long music video, and I happen to agree with that. The main thing about Trinity that makes it boring is the lack of the story and the flow of what is there. I honestly think the action and all the slo-mo scenes are trying to make up for the lack of story, but it doesn't work. I feel that a film that you know will be the final piece of a trilogy needs to be special. Revolutions did not do a good job of wrapping up the The Matrix trilogy, and now Blade: Trinity has failed the Blade franchise. I really did expect better, and felt that the franchise went out with a whimper.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just seen this third film, and have to say it is good on the whole, probably on par with the first, but not as good as the second.Soundtrack on the second film was awesome, but i found it poor and bit over zealous on this one. Photography wasn't as good either, lots of good action scenes are ruined a bit by the constant camera-flicking angle trick, so your eyes don't really have time to adjust to see the excellent martial arts moves. Shame really.Characters are good, the two fighting partners (abigail and hannibal) are good as well, eye candy for the men and ladies i think.Strange how all the mutations and Dracula himself is have jaws that look the same as the 'reapers' did in the second one though. Co-incidence that. Could have come up with something else for him, something unique.Overall great film, worth seeing, just let down slightly by the sound and photography. Will still be sitting on my DVD shelf though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Blade Trinity could've been the best of the three, but it became a disjointed execution. Not because of bad acting or to much humor, but because of poor direction and a choppy storyline. In movies, editing is everything. I have heard actors interviewed who having seen the first cut of their work and then were surprised to see the final result; a lot can be left on the chopping room floor. Why do I bring this up? Well when I first saw this movie at another theater, I only got to see it half way because I was called out on an emergency. When I finally got to see all of it at another theater, parts of at least one scene had been deleted.Who knows , maybe when it come out on video as a director's cut, we might see a better version. Blade Trinity, a fair movie that might have been great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Two-Act Story Ruined by a Third</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been eagerly awaiting the third installment of the Blade "franchise" since its announcement. So eager in fact that I bought and watched the first two film again in anticipation.You see, the first "Blade" was an amazing film as much for the movie itself as the fact that it single-handedly reversed the damage done by Joel Schumacher through "Batman and Robin" to the film aspirations of comic book movies. "Blade" made super-hero movies viable vehicles again. It was a relatively low-budget, acclaimed hit that brought in good revenue and opened the doors for Spider-Man, X-Men, Batman Begins and others.The second "Blade", Blade II, was just a great film. Unhindered with backstory and with great acting and action (and only minor tweaking needing for continuity with respect to Whistler), it did very well both in terms of presence and revenue. Among a field of poorly conceived pretenders, Blade II makes my top five list of super hero movies.Then along comes Blade: Trinity. Throw another log on the fire - here's another film to burn.Blade: Trinity is written by the same guy (David S. Goyer) who wrote the first two films, but also directed by him. It tries to add humour to the mix and overdoes it. It introduces too many new characters and dilutes the screen presence of the star. It is poorly edited at the front end and wastes time on side stories that could have been spent on character development. Too many poorly conceived camera shots that made part of the movie look like it was filmed on a handy-cam. And Parker Posey, despite the efforts of so many critics to assure me to the contrary, cannot act in this film and provided us with the lamest characterization since Arnold's Mr. Freeze.And I can't even begin to get into all the plot holes...The action is good. The screen time with Blade and Abigail is reasonable. Some of the ideas (body banks for instance) are clever. And the line about "blinking once in awhile" made me laugh out loud. But after Deacon Frost and the Bloodpack, you're left with the idea, if these villains are the best baddies the Vampire nation can produce this time around, then Blade doesn't have much of a fight anymore.If you are a fan, skip this film and re-rent the first two. You don't want to scar the previous efforts by waiting for the blood to clot on the open wound that this movie inflicts on an otherwise high-caliber super-hero film series.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Blade Trinity was not the best when compared to Blade two. It's overall exploration of character would have been better suited for a sequel, not a third movie. By the time a part three arrives from any trilogy, we all should know the characters motivations and whatnot. The group dynamic was better executed in Blade two, and to fall back now on a smaller team of amateurs, doesn't make me feel as though this third movie has made any progress. Blade started in an urban environment, and in the sequel took us overseas, and now we're back in the urban cityscape. A complete rehash. Samething goes with the innercity elitist-whiney-Bourgeousie vampires. Nothing new here again. But my biggest beef concerns the police. In the beginning Blade is spotted overhead by a police helicopter, and his response is to hop into his car and drive away. Minutes later he's back at his hideout, apparently having lost the helicopter. I don't think so. How many helicopter police chases have we seen on the news and the cars NEVER get away. Blade couldn't have gotten away unless he had some underground opening that re-opened a block outside his hideout (ala Batman). The second mistake is the police station breakout. Blade and his two "rescuers" are standing outside the police station surrounded by six cruisers, cops with guns pulled, and up comes an SUV, they jump in and DRIVE AWAY? Again, no police chase! Talk about insulting! Perhaps these are details that will arise in the Director's Cut/Extended Edition (everyone's doing it these days - thank you Peter Jackson), but the manner in which this movie was presented, it should be renamed "Blade 2", and then the REAL masterpiece Guillermo del Toro's Blade 2 should be raised to it's proper place as BlADE TRINITY. Lets face facts here, Guillermo del Toro OWNS blade and nobody is going to create a superior product. Guillermo del Toro is to Blade as James Cameron was to Aliens and Terminator 2.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh Dear</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film rates as one of the biggest disappointments of the year beaten only by alien vs predator. The original Blade was a cult classic that had many memorable scenes such as the opening scene in the club with the blood sprinklers. Wesley Snipes was born to play blade and Stephen Dorff put in a great performance and is still the best bad guy in all three movies. The original had a great script and was so gritty and in your face it just flowed from beginning to end. It had a great sense of less is more and when something good or funny happened it didn't need a stupid witty comment to prove it. The original was so great that without it films like Spiderman, the Hulk and the Xmen would never have made it to the big screen.Blade deserved a sequel and as the original was near perfection for its genre the second would have a tough time beating it. The second was a good action film, the fight scenes were generally better, there was more action and most of the acting was just as good as the original but the plot and script wasn't as good.So here we have Blade 3. Now I wasn't expecting it to be better than the last two but I would have hoped it wasn't far off them??how wrong could I have been! Without giving too much away the plot was extremely ropey and that's putting it nicely. The script was absolute cr*p and the acting was very average even for an action film. Despite all those problems the thing that annoyed me the most was it trying to be funny and it just plain wasn't. They tried to fill it with witty one-liners but they didn't even come off as cheesy, it was just plain bad. Ryan Reynolds who played Hannibal King was the friggin Jar Jar Binks of the film; his lines were so bad and didn't belong. Again without giving the plot away the main bad guy and in fact all of the bad guys were terrible in this film and the main bad guy had the potential to be one of the best if not the very best. The curse of the third film in a series being bad strikes again so I hope if they make a new film it will be to the standards of the first two.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Blade Trinity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I admit I haven't watched the first sequel to Blade, but I watched the first, at a time when comic book movies weren't all that popular after Batman and Robin bombed.However, this film somehow lacks the chic sophisticated feel of the first movie. It does has its moments - good action, cool toys, fabulous chicks, but falls flat somehow, that you've seen it all before, and there's nothing new on offer.3 things stand out though, not necessarily good: 1. There are a lot of shots of buildings, streets, landscape, in a fast forwarded motion, from day to night. 2. It's great product placement for Apple's Powerbook and iPod. Wonder how much millions it cost for those incredible closeups 3. Lots of creative expletives, in my opinion. Even a reply to the line featured in the trailer ("are you ready to die?") is given the expletive treatment, and the middle finger is one of the first things you'll see too.The main weakness in the movie is the lack of strong baddies. Drake (the original vampire) has no unique value proposition, except for looking mean, thirst for virgin blood and looks great in his original form with venus fly trap like fangs.Stay until the end of the credits if you wanna catch a 5 second clip of Blade looking mean and driving his GTO.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly sad way to end a great series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where to start? This has truly been one of the most disappointing ways to end a successful movie franchise in recent memory. The first two "Blade" movies were both highly enjoyable and I hotly anticipated this flick. Unfortunately, the film is weighed down by bad writing, bad acting and terrible directing. David Goyer has utterly destroyed the series with his inept script with enough plot holes to drive a truck through and a cop out ending that will leave even the most ardent "Blade" fans disappointed. The movie lacks any kind of depth and we are asked as an audience to care about characters that aren't even developed. Jessica Biel was great eye candy but we don't learn much about her character so she might as well have not appeared in the film. To be fair, costar Ryan Reynolds does have some funny one-liners but they seemed out of place in a "Blade" movie. Finally, another unexpected problem comes in the form of star Wesley Snipes. The man was born to play this character but he just wasn't likable in this movie. And Dracula? What a joke. Perhaps the least threatening one I've ever seen. Overall, a huge disappointment. Skip it unless you're dying to see how the trilogy ends.</fullReview>

It is supposed to be blade (Wesley Snipes) who has fought almost every kind of vampire. But for it to end he has to fight Dracula. And along the way he gets side kicks. It had some cheesy parts but it did make up for the humor Ryan Reynolds also blade needs to talk more he is just not much of a talker. If there were movies you would want to go and see I would definitely recommend this not for drama but for action. I give this movie a 7 usually I'm a tough critic but this was a good movie I really would have given it a 8 but those few cheesy parts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has the blade finally gone blunt?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this last night and in my opinion i don't think it was worthy of being called a Blade film. Don't get me wrong but it wasn't a patch on the others. Blade was and is a cult classic that will never be copied because it was so unique, even though it was a film about vampires. Unfortunalty Blade 2 ( originally subtitled Bloodline btw ) didn't really carry on the theme of Blade. It had the action and the veichles but i don't think it was a worthy follow up and the ending seemed a bit rushed to me. Blade Trinity seemed to be trying to milk the Blade franchise for all it was worth and didn't seem like a convincing sequel to me. Even the thought of having Dracula in the film lowered the tone. On the plus side the action was there, boy was it there! and it was good to see the Dodge Charger back in action! What let the film down though was the introduction of the Nightstalkers, which for me made it more of a collective effort like the X Men which isn't what Blade is about. There was some comedy moments form Ryan Renolds though which were genuinely funny but seemed out of place in the film. As with the second film the ending seemed rushed and probably could've being a lot better. Apparently there's going to be a spin off series with the Nightstalkers which is going to cheapen what Blade was/is even more</fullReview>

		<fullReview>BLADE i thought was OK (it had a nice hard-edge) BLADE 2 was a masterpiece (great effects, fights, music, cast, set design and alround feeling of grandness) but BLADE TRINITY comes across like JIM CARREY sh*t-fest, with badly filmed fight sequences, bleached out photography, unfunny humour and generally, lazy writing. SNIPES looks bored (and should be, it seems the makers are trying to sell 'vampire-hunting' to the JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE generation) and his fight scenes are over shot with either too much CGI of quick cuts (this detracts from his genuine martial-arts abilities) and the two would-be assistants are annoying, unfunny and redundant. RYAN REYNOLDS is quite possibly the most unfunniest guy in the world, and his lame (so called) humour, left me looking away(or should that be 'cringing'?) with embarrassment. The chick wasn't much better either (when she wasn't trying to sell I-POD's to the AVRIL LAVIGNE fanbase, that actually likes this garbage!) The less said about 'count Dracula' (i.e, meathead FCUK model) the better!The special FX were terrible (certainly a notch down from BLADE 2) and the makers also shyed away from the violence (which i thought was BLADE's selling point over kiddy comic adaptions?) only the profanity level was raised, but it was done so unfunny (please check out IMDb's memorable quotes section, the dialogue stinks)All in all, this movie should not have been made (it's all the worse for the fact, that i was hoping it would be great) and if SNIPES wants to call it a day, bring on MICHAEL JAI WHITE and ditch the 'FRIENDS' wanna-be comic relief.Let's face facts, BLADE TRINITY ranks up there with KILL BILL as a overblown celebration of 'false-hip' and should be avoided at all costs2 out of 10 (for KRIS KRISTOFFERSON, and also the 'count-chockula' breakfast cereal gag, at least)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like the 1st and 2nd movies, Blade tells a story of a vampire-hybrid that hunts vampires, but only the vampires are sick of being the prey when they are used to be the hunter. So a vampire named Danika Talos feels its her duty to help her kind by awaking the 1st vampire ever, Dracula or Drake; to kill Blade.In this last installment of the Trilogy, Blade gets help from a group called the NightStalkers and 2 of the main fighters are Abigail Whistler and the Hannibal King. Let me just say, this is one of the better Vampire movies I've seen and Dracula is a powerful enemy that is unrelenting and is played very well. His power seems limitless and is even more apparent is his vampire form; his speed, his strength, and his intelligence.2 things about this movie really bothered me. 1st one being the humour of Hannibal King. If you've seen Van Wilder you'll see the same dry unfunny wit of Ryan Reynolds. His humour is stupid and is unnecessary and made the movie feel...kinda pathetic. Every time he made I joke, I wished he'd be killed off in the next scene.(LOL I'm so nice!) Secondly, Abigail Whistler, she is just a human with martial arts and weapon training. Not once did I see her actually sustain any physical damage, she has no superhuman strength and she is taking down men with armored suits like she had steel for arms. Even the Hannibal King (SPOILER) who was a former vampire turned back human, sustains heavy physical damage.Other than that, I feel this is a good movie to end the Trilody of Blade.</fullReview>

Dominic Purcell does well in the tired role of Dracula (to be fair Blade originated in the comic book Tomb of Dracula) But its Parker Posey's Danica Talos is the far more engaging villain. Plot? We don't need no stinking plot. There are some references to a vampire final solution, but really this isn't about some intricate web of whatever, it's about turning vampires into ash.

		<fullReview>What a mess.... A real director was sadly needly for this entrant in the Blade franchise. I was one minute away from leaving due to the excessive expositional dialogue, wooden acting, tasteless product placement, ill-conceived (and worst of all, BORING) action sequences, and the lamest of one liners (although I must admit the bit where Reynolds refers to Posey as a 'c$%k juggling thunder c**nt' was so ridiculous, it was almost humorous).This film is proof positive that a decent writer does not automatically make for a decent director. There was absolutely no sense of tone, pace, and charisma to this film. It was just one empty moment after another. Gone is the sense of wonder and just plain fun that would typify the Blade films -where was the meat packing rave or the house of pain styled set piece? And what is with the "Matrix' styled green cinematography? I wanted those deep shadows and rich blacks in the colour schemes ala the first two films.Others have spent considerable effort into detailing just why you shouldn't see this entrant but I realize that, like myself, you'll still have to experience it for yourself.

		<fullReview>The problem with flouting logic in a movie isn't so much that the film becomes unrealistic (after all we're talking about a vampire movie here) but rather you break the tension line and then essentially you just have a bunch of pretty scenes that scatter about. The problem with "Blade Trinity" is that very early in the film we see how the conflict could be resolved, but we are given absolutely no reason why it isn't. And so the next hour and a half go by as an indulgence on our intelligence, rather than as a flight of fantasy.That said, there is still a lot of great stuff to look at and enjoy- much of what you would expect after seeing the first two films. The only other real problem is that there are periodic dead spots in the film. These usually occur during exposition scenes where characters will look at each other meaningfully but unfortunately without soundtrack cues. Or a character will say something funny and hesitate a few seconds for the audience laugh. It becomes a bit distracting at some points, and you wonder if a closer edit would not have been more effective to presentation and pace.The standouts of this film are the new cast members Jessica Biel and Ryan Reynolds, who offer a nice complement to Wesley Snipe's stoic invincibility.Reynold's humour in particular is a nice counterpoint to the otherwise oppressive tone, yet it never crosses the line into farce. Parker Posey is of course excellent, but really did anyone expect less of he? She's a great actress without the aid of elaborate makeup and appliances- with them it's just far too easy.All and all I would say that if you liked the first 'Blade' film (or vampire/monster films in general) then this is probably right up your alley.However, if you were looking for a continuation of 'Blade II' then you will be disappointed. In fact, the films are even contradictory at some levels.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blade: Trinity, not what it could have been...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Blade: Trinity sounds great in theory. Blade takes on Dracula with a new team of vampire hunters and they hatch a virus to kill the blood suckers for good. Unfortunately for people like me, who are huge fans of the first two films, Goyer does not deliver the goods with "Trinity". The film just feels disjointed from poor direction and lack of characterization.Wesley goes through the motions as Blade with his usual grunt and comment routine, which is fine since we'll get to see Blade in action all kinds right? Wrong. The film lacks the frantic tension of horror and action found in the previous two movies. Half the fun in Blade is watching Snipes throw down, which is seriously lacking here. Jessica Biel is not very convincing in her hard ass routine, despite being very nice to look at. Her role as Whistlers daughter is totally ineffective in adding any levity to the story, and Whistler's role is dwindled down with no real effects on the character of Blade or his daughter.Ryan Reynolds brings the comic relief as Hannibal King. Reynolds is a great comic actor who is naturally charming. The problem is that he brings nothing else to the table here. His one liners are funny, but become tiring by the films end. It's a shame that the Blade series has to end on such a low note. If only Del Toro (Director of Blade 2) would have had time for this and Hellboy 2 on his schedule. Blade: Trinity has it's moments, but lacks the solid direction of is predecessors that gave the Blade films credibility. Blade: Trinity feels contrived and not so special.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie soooo bad you gotta laugh</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So here I am looking forward to seeing the final movie of an all around good series. So what do I get for my months of waiting? Utter contempt &amp; disappointment. Let's go over the things that made this movie so crappy, shall we?1. If Hannibal King was cured, and he was a full blown vampire, why didn't they just use that cure to destroy the other vampires?2. Since when did humans bulk up enough to go hand to hand with vampires?3. The I-Pod... enough said. I personally feel the need to not pay attention to my surroundings when fighting the undead, but rather rock out to trip-hop.4. Vampire dogs. Scratch that, vampire Pomeranians. Why?5. Dracula couldn't be more bland. And what's with the shirt? I wasn't aware that I was watching a Chippendale's video. And let's not even get into the fact that his alter form was something out of Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers.6. No vampire storyline. The vampires in the 1st two films had some depth and inner conflict. The vampires in this film couldn't be more two dimensional.7. When Triple H has more lines than Wesley Snipes, there's a problem.I could write about this for hours, and not get out all the frustration and disappointment from this film. On that note, save your money and buy a camera to make your own final Blade movie. I'm sure it would be better than the piece of garbage I saw last night</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Blade: Trinity' is by no means a great movie, but it's fun for an hour and change. I think the main problem comes from Goyer's weaker than usual script. I like the first two 'Blade' movies, both of which were written by Goyer but this one seemed to lack the character and plot development found earlier in the series. I liked Hannibal King and Abigail fine but Blade really didn't go through any kind of change. For the final chapter in a series, there wasn't much resolved. Also, the lines not uttered by Hannibal King fell flat for me, which is a disappointment because I usually like what Goyer has to say. The film rushed on to the action scenes with really no pause other than for basic plot information and advancement. The film explained itself too simply. What I mean by this is that there was nothing left up to the audience to discover. Lines like, "We used the humans to flush you out." were just... blah. On the positive, the action scenes were well done. I liked the pacing and there was a lot of energy that went into their creation. I wish the same amount of energy went into what was really important in the movie: the development of the story/ characters. It's worth the matinée price but I wouldn't plunk down eight bucks for it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A nasty gang of Vamps have found Dracula and want him to kill Blade who is on the run from the cops. Meanwhile Blade hooks up with the Nightstalkers, a gang of hip, vampire killers. In short, it's not bad. It's not the worst movie ever but with the likes of Jessica Biel and Ryan Reynolds involved, there's something for everyone. The plot of this techno-heaven film revolves around introducing Hannibal King (Reynolds) and Abigail Whistler (Biel) to the Blade audience. Blade himself has been outed to the cops by mischievous vamps and is on the run. Cue a rescue by the Nightstalkers and the unfolding of a plan by the vamps to unleash Drake (Dracula), who they found in Iraq on an unsuspecting populace. Blade et al plan on stopping him.Honestly went into this expecting it to be at least watchable and have a few good one-liners to get the odd chuckle and that's pretty much what I got. Biel and Reynolds are more than watchable but Reynolds gets a fair few duff lines. More than his share, as when he's good, he's very good. Blade camps it up a bit along the way, coochy-cooing a baby and throwing in some gangsta stuff too which mostly works.The vamps include Parker Posey as the ring-leader (looks awful) and Triple H as the comedy vamp there's been in all Blade movies. As a main Baddie, Drake comes somewhere around dead last for overall nastiness, coming nowhere near Stephen Dorff's Frost for cruelty or Luke Goss' remember Bros) Nomak for scariness. He does however have pretty good dialogue and isn't overdone. The problem is he doesn't seem to have a plan of his own.Other than that the techno soundtrack is excellent again (Jurassic 5 feature prominently) the look and feel of the movie is glossy and fun. Jessica Biel will keep all the fan boys happy. Main lacking points include occasional weak writing, and a loose plot. The fight scenes are as strong as any in the series but not enough to save this from being the weakest of the three. Never boring and well paced but never likely to get you jumping out of your seat. 2/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just to get it out of the way nice and up front, this is not a great flick. It's probably not even a great action flick, but I certainly found it to be very entertaining. You obviously don't look for masterful dialogue or intricate plots, but I think the makers did a few very key things to make this movie much less of a groaner than the second Blade movie.First, they added a few characters to join in the battle. Although some seem to believe this detracts from the focus on Snipes, the simple fact as I see it is this - the Blade character really isn't that interesting to begin with. At least, not any more than was established in the first in the series. He doesn't have much personality, but at least did break with that a couple of times in Trinity. The extra characters at least lightened things up a bit, which I found to mix in nicely with the cartoonishly entertaining fight violence. Second - and this dovetails with the first point - there are actually a few funnies in this one. It doesn't take itself too seriously, and even the violence is a funny sort of absurd. Throw in "the original vampire" seeing what sort of merchandising he's come to have spawned, and the genetic experiments the vampires were conducting ...In short, if you're looking for suspense, high drama or snappy dialogue, you aren't going to find it here. But if you are able to enjoy fight sequences and would like to see Blade in a more buddy-picture type of context, I highly recommend this one. Take care.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WHY??(Some Spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly I'd like to point out I'm a huge fan of the first 2 films. As such I'm greatly disappointed that this film ever saw the light of day (pardon the pun). Here are a few questions that I asked after watching Trinity. 1, Where was the Intro fight? What we got looked like the opening of a t.v. movie. 2, Where was the nightclub scene, there must be a night club scene I'm sure it's a law. 3, Where was the finale fight, that was pathetic. 4, In Blade 2 the reaper vampire was a new strain of vampire. So why did Dracula the first vampire look like the reaper? 5, If Dracula is the "Uber" Vampire why was Blade able to beat him without feeding? Pick any fight in Blade or Blade 2 and they wipe the floor with the end fight with Dracula. 6, Ryan Reyonlds was quite amusing but he kept getting his a*se kicked, when did they intend in actually letting him have more than a 2 punch fight. 7, More importantly we never got a dedicated "COOL" shot of Blade catching his shades, a subtle shot in the police station just doesn't cut it. 8, Finally, what was that sound track about, POOR. My opinion is that I wouldn't be surprised if very soon there's a T.V. series about Blade because this to me was no more than a bad pilot to a poor t.v. series. I hope they make Blade 4 and put all the right people back in charge, give it a proper certificate, soundtrack and plenty of top notch action and violence. If the rumors that Wesley Snipes doesn't like this edition to the series are true, I can see why and totally agree.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warnings From An Avid Blade Fan- SLIGHT spoilers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's get this out from the start: I love the first two movies, but this one is a failure. This movie does a few things right...but the rest is rather dreadful. In fact, the movie rarely feels anything like the other two. The direction and writing make this one an unfortunate mistake.First, the good: The soundtrack is very noticeable in this movie and adds a pulse to many of the scenes that would otherwise feel empty. A very decent composer was also hired for the score, and it shows Also, the cinematography is well-done and crisp. It is almost always easy to tell what is going on in a fight- unlike some other action movies.Also, the opening and ending credits are just SWEET...but don't let the opening ones fool you.Triply H plays a convincing and interesting bad guy- too bad he didn't get more development and screen time.Finally, thanks to a certain character, the movie is quite often laugh out loud funny.That's all the good- here comes all the bad: First- remember I said the movie was funny- it's TOO funny. The focus in this movie is not on Blade, himself, but on 2 other characters who are very shallow. This is to prepare for a movie that they get on their own. One of the characters is there simply to wear tight clothes. In the other Blade movies, the characters all served some purpose.Second, with the focus away from Blade, Blade no longer seems as cool himself- he never seems particularly triumphant and is given very few good lines (although there are a couple). Snipes also looks very old in his role and definitely isn't as trim as he used to be.Third, the writing/plot is horrible. One and two really explored the complexity of Blade through the enemies he faced. This one seems like a vehicle for some actions scenes and scantily clad women. Most of the characters are simply boring.Fourth, the action is lacking. The choreography here felt very tired. There were maybe 2 "that was kinda cool" moments, but that was it. Both of the other movies had some really inspired choreography and special effects. You've already seen the best of this one in the trailers.Fifth, it may be a small issue, but it becomes huge here- the product placement is SHAMEFUL. If I saw one more IPOD, I was going to go ballistic.If you are an avid Blade fan and still want to see this movie (as an avid Blade fan should), then at least know that this isn't the same Blade you knew. Both of the first two movies (though they were done by different directors) had a thematic cohesion and fit together well in most all respects. This one is a mess- go in with low expectations and you should have a good time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just got back from seeing this film. It was definitely worth the wait. I'd been hearing lots of rumors about different endings and a Nightstalkers spin-off. Well the Nightstalkers spin-off is definitely possible but the true answer about different ending will be answered in the DVD.Without taking anything away from Wesley Snipes (who is always the big bad mo-fo if the franchise), I gotta say that Ryan Reynolds made this film! His smart-ass sense of humor sweetened up this dark bloodbath. The humor doesn't spoil the mood. The action was so fast paced that I missed a couple things. So I guess the pacing of some action sequences would be my only complaint. The ending was a shock but Blade Trinity does not and will not disappoint you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So, another Blade film. Number three in a series, and it's rare for a series to get to number 3 and still be any good. I hadn't read any reviews, and had only seen a rather flaccid trailer. My hopes were not high.To my HUGE surprise, Blade: Trinity was absolutely fantastic. Yeah, it had some cheesy bits, but it was nothing like the huge wedge of cheddar that Blade II turned out to be. Blade: Trinity had a plot. It had snappy dialogue, was genuinely funny in parts, had well-choreographed fight scenes, good music, really excellent cinematography (and I can't believe I'm saying that about a throwaway popcorn flick like a Blade film) and was, overall, a big chunk of entertainment. Far, far better than Blade II, and probably even better than the original film.Perhaps the secret is to expect it to be pants. I mean, how many rubbishy sequels have we been put through in recent years? It's a lot. In fact, it's almost all of them.. but not this time. This is just good, brainless fun, well-executed and slickly produced.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ryan Reynolds is the only good thing in the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, it seems the writer-turned-director David Goyer realized he had a crappy script, lame plot, and badly cast villains this go-round and turned to two young hotties - Jessica Biel and Ryan Reynolds -- to keep us distracted from how awful the film really is. And for me, it almost worked. Well, Jessica does nothing for me, but Reynolds, who got super buff and shows if off nicely in several scenes, was like Han Solo riding in to save the day with his (mostly) funny one-liners. Every time he was on screen, the movie was watchable. When he wasn't, I was waiting for him to come back on. He totally steals the film.And what happened to Parker Posey &amp; Natasha Lyonne? They are both looking haggard and awful these days. The Dracula, Dominic Purcell, is just wrong, wrong, wrong. His beefy, Army grunt look is all wrong, his clothes ridiculous and the fights are disappointing. If he's so invincible, why does he run away from Blade when they first meet? Very poor villain behavior!Oh, and I haven't mentioned Wesley Snipes yet. He makes it through with a few shreds of dignity left, but given his feud with the director, that's it for him and Blade. Which is probably a good thing, after this film. But I'd totally see a Nightstalker spin-off. Or hell, anything else with Reynolds.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Action Flick, but hopefully the last Blade movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie shows that a series can be different then the original and its sequel and still have a good time. It kind of reminds me of how the Harry Potter series took a different turn in its third movie. I really liked the fact that Van Wilder makes an appearance, giving the movie some humor. While to most people who loved the comics, which are much darker, this may seem like a huge problem, but to me I welcome a change. Other then that the action sequences were well done and Jessica Biel does a great job in her role, playing Whistlers daughter our of wed lock. The only thing I hope is that it does not continue past this one. There really is no one left to kill after this movie, and they create a way to kill the vampires, so why keep this going. I am going to warn those of you who do not like the popcorn comic book movie, then this is not for you, there is no deep message in this movie, so if that is your bag, then do not go see this. If you like vampires blowing up, car chases, and kick ass new weaponry then this is for you. And to end this I will say one thing watch out for the dogs!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not going into a lot of detail here but what it largely amounts to is it seemed like the concept and writing went well and, believe it or not, Ryan Reynolds and Parker Posey were not so bad. What seemed lacking was the smooth way Blade was played by Wesley Snipes in the first two movies. It seemed as though Snipes is getting tired of Blade and was not all that interested in making his performance in this the best it could be.Dominic Purcell was a rather interesting choice as Dracula, he seems FAR more suited to a more heroic lead role than as a villain (if you were one of the few fans of John Doe on FOX then you know what I mean). It still could have been far worse, but I felt like I would rather have seen this on video.</fullReview>

Jessica looks hot and all, but damn girl, take an acting lesson or thousand. Ryan DOES rock... if it weren't for his humorous asides and one liners this film wouldn't even rate as watchable.

This film few other redeeming qualities.The character of Blade didn't even match up to his calm and calculating self. I don't recall him in the first two movies ever raising his voice to anyone. I know this is a weak point to mention, but the other two films were of a relatively high caliber, as marvel films go, so I expected more.The product placement of the new mp3 players was blatant; Abigail (Jessica Biel) unable to slay vampires without the sound of music blaring through her ears. In fact, some of the fight scenes reminded me a little of Baywatch.Maybe I'm being harsh though, because I liked the other films so much??</fullReview>

		<fullReview>to many sexual jokes, making fun of each other was stupid, in the other two movies of the series they were serious. but the effects and sound track were great. triple H was just a joke. Even Blade had a personality in this movie, is worth a matinée fee eat first so you don't have to pay the high cost of food. I will buy it when it comes out on video, There was a sick line about a child I do think they went to far with that, But that was to much. Lots of fight scenes to go around and there are some sick dogs in this movie I do hope they make a 4th but have the director from the 1st 2 movies direct it. I am not saying it stunk but it is not like the other 2 movies. Have fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warning- several people in my theater talked or took cell phone calls while I saw this film so maybe that's influencing my opinions a little. Though, this is typical of every film I see, in every theater, in every state in the U.S. I'm a little bitter about the state of affairs in movie theaters, but I digress...I agree with most of the early comments by "the unemployed critic" here on IMDb. Particularly, the direction of David Goyer has left this movie wanting. The basic storyline was decent, however, it is the execution of that story with which I have a problem. I am a big fan of the previous Blade films but Trinity was shallow in most areas:1. We are bombarded with new characters for which there is no character development. 2. Jessica Biel is attractive, which is enough for most of us, but we have virtually no other reason to like or dislike her. Her link to Whistler is weak to say the least. They faintly hint at a more complicated relationship, but there are no plot points to support it. 3. The always likable Ryan Reynolds made a good career choice here but the director let him down a little. Everything he says is an attempt at humor with no serious side to the character. With a few exceptions, the jokes were ill timed and not funny. But he did get ripped for the film so maybe he could jump from this into some other action hero roles.After about 7 or 8 years of using IMDb religiously, this is my first posted comment on a film and I want to keep it as short as I can. I'll reiterate that "the unemployed critic" has, with some exceptions, described my own feelings on this film. I recommend finding his/her post and reading it.Basically, if you're the type of person who can get past simple-minded eye candy with no story depth to speak of, you're going to enjoy this film. You will also enjoy this film if you're the type who likes giving the rest of the theater patrons a narrative of such brilliantly clichéd inner-dialog as "Oh, snap!" and "No he didn't!" Trinity, like the first 2 films, was good in both the visuals and the soundtrack. Despite my negative critiques I think that, overall, it wasn't that bad a flick. It just wasn't all that special, either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Action Flick, but hopefully the last Blade movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie shows that a series can be different then the original and its sequel and still have a good time. It kind of reminds me of how the Harry Potter series took a different turn in its third movie. I really liked the fact that Van Wilder makes an appearance, giving the movie some humor. While to most people who loved the comics, which are much darker, this may seem like a huge problem, but to me I welcome a change. Other then that the action sequences were well done and Jessica Biel does a great job in her role, playing Whistlers daughter our of wed lock. The only thing I hope is that it does not continue past this one. There really is no one left to kill after this movie, and they create a way to kill the vampires, so why keep this going. I am going to warn those of you who do not like the popcorn comic book movie, then this is not for you, there is no deep message in this movie, so if that is your bag, then do not go see this. If you like vampires blowing up, car chases, and kick ass new weaponry then this is for you. And to end this I will say one thing watch out for the dogs!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie definitely wasn't on par with Blade 2, and barely stands up with the first movie. My biggest gripe is the number of gaping plot holes and way too convenient stories; I know we're dealing with a vampire movie here, but Blades 1 &amp; 2 were solid movies. There was not enough cool action (there's action, just not enough), too many iPod ads, and apparently Ryan Reynolds can't play anything other than Van Wilder. As far as the bad guys, leave the pro wrestlers to the Punisher cast, and aim higher for your lead baddie; Stephen Dorf and Luke Goss make Drake look like a familiar... The movie is worth seeing (matinee if you can help it) and my gripes are so general since I don't want to ruin the actual movie for anyone, but I will say that I am thoroughly mad at Guillermo Del Toro for not directing this one.</fullReview>

I found the action was as good as ever, the dialogue was much funnier in this one and the new characters were refreshing.I've learnt not to get my hopes up too high for sequels (the matrix sequels and terminator 3 were massive let downs for me) although there have been some superb ones (spiderman 2 and x men 2), so I went in with not unduly high expectations and I was satisfied with the end result.Overall I'd say it's watchable, definitely one of the better comic book films this year.

		<shortDescription>A few opportunities missed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***Spoilers ahead***Let me start this off by saying that I am a fan of Blade. I watched the first two last night and I have just come home from seeing it. Now I know that this sounds like a, "I'm going straight home to blast this movie on the net," type of opening, but it's not. I did thoroughly like it, as much or more than the first ones. Saying that, there were a few missed opportunities. There is a scene where the master vampire (who can change shapes) enters the home base of the hunters and wipes most of them out. There are a few missed opportunities in this scene. There was a semi-crucified blind lady, a hunter-computer hacker who Jessica Biel (yum) cries a lot over her death. It would have been much more tear jerking in this scene if Biel was forced to kill her friend because she was turned into a vampire. This scene also would have been insanely awesome if there were a fight between Blade and a pseudo-Blade (the Vampire who has changed shape). It would have been thoroughly interesting to see the two fight with Biel not knowing who to help. Ryan Reynolds also makes an appearance in this movie. now anyone who has seen National Lampoon's Van Wilder will immediately think that Van has graduated from college, found a purpose in life and has started hunting vampires. His voice inflexion and delivery in Blade was EXACTLY the same as it was in Van Wilder. If you are not a fan of that movie, you won't like him in this one, but since I really did like it, I thought his lines tried to steal the movie from Blade's opening of a serious keg of whoop-ass. Triple H, the WWE's favorite Monday night bad-boy makes an appearance in Blade Trinity as well. Sadly he should stayed on television. He's more entertaining as a wrestler. His acting was pathetic (as if we expected anything else) and had me rooting for his dog more then him. Now lets get back to Jessica Biel. Yum. A very sexy young lady, but sadly not a very believable vampire hunter. I mean she's good and actually acts fairly well, but c'mon, a man vs. vampire (who is supposed to have super-human strength) is hard enough to believe, but a woman, even a fairly athletic woman (she definitely got into good shape for this role) vs. vampire, I'm not buying it. Still, if this is all that I can complain about, it's a good movie. I will buy it the day it comes out on DVD and probably go see it at least one more time in theaters. All Movies 2.5 - 5 Action Movies 3.5 - 5 Comic Books 4 - 5Go see it for yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More like Blade WWF in a worrying turn into Robocop 3 country</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Always, always worry when the rating of a franchise sequel slips down a notch. In the UK parts 1 and 2 were rated 18, which in simple terms means admit 18 years or over, and part three is rated 15, which opens the gates to the high school crowd. It's a reflection of content, since the first pair were gore heavy horror movies and this is a Spiderman Matrix Happy Days hybrid. With lots of swearing. Anyone who knows the painful descent of the Robocop movies, and the sanitised TV pilot third movie, will understand my pain as I walked in unaware at the top of the movie and saw the red "15" pre-title certificate.That said, Blade Trinity isn't an all-out car crash. The opening sequence follows the pattern of trying to top the last one. It brings back THE CAR! There is a lot of hyperkinetic martial arts action. In fact, the action sequences as a whole were obviously choreographed, shot and cut by people with attention-deficit syndrome after an all-night Sunny D party. The soundtrack ditches the worst of the Blade 2 guitar-bashing metalhead AOR for the bassy electronica of the original. The final fight sequence reminds you that this is basically a superhero story and the crew do an stand-up job of throwing two indestructible bodies at the destructible architecture. I know what I like, and what I like goes "WHO-O-O-OOM!", surrounded by fracture lines in concrete and falling brick dust.Sadly, there are a few too many sad and shabby corners. Too much technology, for a start, which only emphasises the weediness of the new supporting cast of post-teen vampire hunters. We love Blade, and Blade uses a big gun and a big stick with a point on the end. If you need a laser-tazer cheese-slice you belong in another movie! There's also straight rip of the Alias tech guy, the post-Buffy teenager who steps in for Whistler, and the wise-cracking ex-vampire who looks like Anthony Edwards with a frickin GOATEE. I mean, really, as if Mark Green from ER is going to kick anybody's butt?The worst spoiler-free flaw in the film, though, are the two horribly miscast lead vampires. I don't know Parker Posey's other work, but here her queen bitch vampire comes across as a slightly skankier version of MTV casualty Pink, and less like the leader of a high tech master race bent on world domination than a working girl with a monkey on her back. Her only real saving grace is that they guy who plays her boss is worse. Former boy-band singer Matt Goss was a spectacular opponent in Blade 2, but here when we meet the Blade movie universe version of Dracula, King of the Undead, he actually turns out to be a too-old-for-a-boy-band doughboy who is about as threatening as a mild cough.It's not a patch on the last one, but definitely worth the ticket price, and its saving grace is that it doesn't slow down to draw breath. Also, right at the end, just when I thought Hannibal King couldn't be any more irritating or unfunny he manages a fantastic death-cell tirade against his vampire nemesis which climaxes in a three-syllable insult that starts with the word "thunder" and ended with me falling out of my chair.The film also features criminally under-rated actor James Remar in a cruelly cut-down role, and I like to see Ajax from the Warriors still getting work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK, not great.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw Blade Trinity tonight. This was really not as good as either the first or the second I thought. First of all was it's reliance on comedy. Reynold's Hannibal King was way too much like Van Wilder: Vampire Liason. Always with a wisecrack but never with the characterisation (even though the line 'You c*ck juggling thunder-c*nt!!' was a classic). Biel's Abagail was just there to fluff the screen with some hotness. I felt she needed more backstory regarding her and her dad. Not enough dimension to the characters. Snipes, as usual, is cool and kicking some. I feel he's gone as far as he's going to with this character though. The bad guy? Not as cool or suave as Deacon Frost (Blade) or as tortured and emotive as Novak (Blade 2). He lacks any real definition and as such is just there for Blade to punch and banter with. The fight scenes (especially the opening ones) have been done before and done better in the previous films. The soundtrack again, done better in Blade. Overall, I liked this film and recommend it for fans of the series. It could've been done better, but it could've been done a whole lot worse.3 out of 5This of course is just my opinion, but vampire dogs??? Whats that all about???</fullReview>

And I love that woman.Jessica Biel is beautiful and kind of a pointless character. Pretty much eye candy.Every vampire looked like they were wearing toy novelty teeth. Watch them when their mouths are closed, they look as if they could fall out at any time. Not sure what that was about. I don't remember that from the other two movies. Even Blade's were bad.The movie had a late seventies, early eighties feel to it. The credits, the high speed cut scenes.

		<shortDescription>Blade Trinity makes it three for three</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wesley Snipes dons the sunglasses again as the half human/half vampire avenger for the third installment of Marvel Comics Blade series in Blade Trinity. While not as well made as the original cult classic, it holds its own as a kinetic action film for fans of the genre.The film opens with eye catching visuals in which a team of vampires helicopters to a ruin in Iraq to unearth the Prince of Darkness, Dracula. Who better than the granddaddy of all vampires to do battle with Blade? It certainly ups the ante in the 'us against vampires' concept.Blade is still hunting and destroying vampires en masse with the help of his mentor, Whistler (Kris Kristofferson). But when some devious vampires purposely set up Blade in a very awkward moment, the FBI and police begin tracking down the warrior. A subsequent raid goes awry at Blade's compound with disastrous results, and he is captured for interrogation at police headquarters. Fortunately, he is rescued by a man (Ryan Reynolds) and woman (Jessica Biel) who show a flair for weaponry and hand-to-hand combat. It turns out the woman, Abigail, is the daughter of Kristofferson's character and is leading one of many cells against the vampire hoards. Her team has a possible biological solution to destroying the vampires. Unfortunately, Dracula infiltrates the cell on a kidnapping mission and wreaks havoc. The final action sequence has Blade and company attempting a rescue and doing battle with the vampires and ultimately Dracula. You have to admire the ways the filmmakers try to instill new wrinkles in the vampire mythology and the mystique of Blade. Humans, it turns out, aren't the only animals affected with vampirism, and Blade and gang are always equipped with some state of the art weaponry that would make any Starship Trooper's head spin. The final battle is a solid set piece and proficient at delivering the goods with its franticly paced fights and shootouts. One wishes at times that we could see more sustained long shots of Snipes doing his martial arts thing without resorting to rapid close-ups and cutting; it's almost a cheat. David S Goyer who wrote all three Blade films gets his directing nod here, and he does a decent job. Just a bit more storyline and stronger, defined characters would have made this a better film. The soundtrack revs up with fast paced songs, and the cinematography is appropriately murky and imaginative. The special effects are effective particularly when vampires morph into monsters, but they look a bit too much like the Predator films. Wesley Snipes is always worth watching, and just to hear him bellow a rare profane challenge or unexpected witticism is always amusing. Kristofferson is in fine form as the weary human who treats Blade as his own son. Biel and Reynolds make a good, heroic pair with a nice dash of humor. In general, the dialogue especially between humans and vampires is at times clever and quite humorous. There are a moments toward the end that are a bit inconsistent but the whole thing pretty much delivers a well paced page turner. There isn't much more to the plot, and the characters are mere bare bones sketches. What do you want from a comic book anyway?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blade meets Van Wilder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw an advanced screening of this movie at AMC. Before I type anything, let me say that this movie was more comedy-based rather than the typical expected action flick, so if you're into comedy movies, then this one would grasp your attention, but if you're expecting straight-up action with little-to-no humor additives, then view this movie with caution and the expectation of disappointment. This is the most funniest vampire movie I've seen since...It's just the funnies. Ryan Reynolds does what he does what he does best with almost the same personality he's had playing Van Wilder. Of course Ryan's more hardcore in this R-rated film so cursing has no limit to him. Jessica Biel wasn't too convincing as a vampire slayer. The fight choreography was rather slow and plane for both her and Ryan and her acting was stale. Wesley Snipes himself looks as though her age is getting to him, as he appears smaller in frame. but one might miss such detail with his new suit and very mundane boots (that look like they have no business getting the close-up they got) on. Parker Pose wasn't was believable vampire either. She seemed more comedy oriented as Ryan, doing nothing more than fueling Ryan's humor. Paul Michael Levesque (AKA Triple H) had a somewhat memorable role. I'd say his character fit better in this movie than the Rock's character in ANY of his movies. However, being a wrestling fan myself, I can't help but feel disappointed at his choreography, sure he wrestled, but I expected more from him-then again, I expected a lesser role also. The comedy is great, everything else is questionable. I feel that this movie had too big of a storyline to end the way it did, which makes it feel as though it was short. I rate this movie 6 out of 10 stars, from a comic perspective. * * * * * * _ _ _ _ 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad Ending To An Otherwise Successful Series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alright first off gotta say the first two Blade films were well done no question about that. I honestly can say however that I had no high hopes for the last installment. When I learned that the main villain would be Dracula my head almost flew off my shoulders in rage.To start off the character portrayal. Wesley Snipes is always a good Blade but didn't get to do what he did best in the last two films. Whistler what to say about Whistler? Well lets face it after his return in the second film I felt it kind of dumb to kill him off in this one by means much weaker than the last time. Plus Whistler is supposed to be hardened by years of fighting the undead yet he's taken out quickly by human police officers. Hannibal King, for those unfamiliar with the character, is supposed to be a loner and not a comedian. I like Ryan Reynolds don't get me wrong but he was out of place here. Hannibal in the comics was almost as mysterious as Blade himself. Abigail should never have been in this movie at all since she causes continuity problems no matter what reason you give for her existence. This was the wrong movie to introduce the Nightstalkers since Blade, who in the comics was the Nightstalker's youngest member, is older than the lot of them and has been at it for years. Dracula as the villain well how do I put this? it's cliché. Dracula is like the number one villain you go to when you can't come up with a better one. Dominic Purcell as Dracula not the best choice. He's good in all his other stuff but not here. As for all the other subordinate vampires well yeah didn't really give a crap about them plus why the heck was Triple H here!?Next the Storyline. So Blade, after apparently being watched by the human element that supposedly doesn't know he exists, is caught after killing a human in a set up. The Night stalkers save him from whatever...blah blah blah plot to resurrect the first vampire blah blah blah virus blah blah freaking blah. Yeah needless to say the storyline bites(no play on words intended). It sounds like it was thrown together to get this turkey out of the oven.The action scenes. By this stage of the game such action scenes are pretty cookie cutter regular. You could see these moves in almost any action film prior to it. Why Abigail wears a stupid ipod while fighting is well..stupid. I mean you are hunting the most dangerous thing on the streets at night and you are listening to music instead of your surroundings. Either this girl is very stupid or she really is the best vamp hunter around. Hannibal gets his butt beat every time he enters battle this definitely shouldn't happen since Hannibal is supposed to be one of the very best there is. But no this movie has reduced him to a wise cracking idiot. The fight between Blade and Dracula was anti climactic. It didn't leave me feeling that a great evil has just been vanquished. Wesley your movies are top notch but not even you could have made this rotten egg any less of a stinker. What happened man what happened?The Dialogue. Yeah it was terrible too. Blade is the strong silent type. He isn't supposed to be the I've been doing this longer than you so I'm better than you type. He would be above such things since his only goal is to destroy all vampire existence that's his number one motive in life. Instead of telling the Nightstalkers they are in over their head he would have just suddenly left since he has no reason to associate with them. If they want to go get killed then let them do it just as long as they stay out of his way and don't draw too much attention they are just rookies he doesn't need. Dracula his dialogue would have best been put to roars and screeches since it didn't really add much plot wise. The supposed baddie vamps were lame. Dracula said that they were mere shadows of their former selves. He was right. They are nothing but a group of stereotypical pretty boy and girl vamps incapable of taking over a city much less subjugate an entire race supposedly weaker than it but hey that's what vamp movies these days are about. Yep that's right the eye candy. Their dialogue reflected this. There was no menacing tone in their voices. It sounded like they did it just for the sake of it. Think Paris Hilton if she was a vamp and there you go. Ryan Reynolds' comments were genuinely funny but once again out of place in this film. Biel's character actually delivered them pretty well considering the fact that the character was of no real importance in any of the story. Basically she was just there so the creators could say that there was a Whistler all throughout this movie too. Though she didn't have as much grit as her dear old daddy.All in all this movie is your average example of a once shining example of good cinema for its genre going down the tubes and what's worse is it's the final movie. Then again that's kind of a good thing. When you think about it. I don't recommend this film and there are better films to waste your time with. Might I suggest Van Wilder for those of you who are Ryan Reynolds's fans he's definitely in his element there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are vampire movies of all shapes and sorts in the cinema world. But where some suffer from age and others from poor effects, "Blade Trinity" has no such excuses for being a lacklustre, badly acted and bluntly delivered piece of schlock. The storyline is predictable to the point of being tedious, the dialogue (even the supposed "banter" between Snipes and Reynolds) is plodding and the acting is painfully poor. Parker Posey in particular hams it up so much she'd make even Vincent Price shudder with embarrassment. What is more the treatment of Dracula (or "Drake" as the scriptwriters decided to call him - was this some attempt to modernise the evil Count?) is shameful, and would have had Bram Stoker physically retching if he were to have seen it for himself. Where Blade (and to some extent Blade II) gave us something new and exciting, Blade Trinity treads the same old ground with heavy, clodhopping feet to produce what is quite frankly a miserable result. If you've only seen Blade and/or Blade II, avoid this film unless you want to have nightmares about how low a once reasonably decent movie franchise can sink.</fullReview>

Fine, wake up Dracula, let him be totally miscast, have unnecessary sub characters steal the show, but at least give us an entertaining thrill ride with underground vampire clubs and some cool ***kicking.

		<fullReview>What is it about nearly every 3rd sequel flushing an established and successful movie series down the toilet?Too many Kooks in the kitchen?Bad casting?Poor script?Bad director?I think that all boils down to what happened to Blade 3.Uh I mean trinity.This time around Whisler is out.And Blade is joined by a group of Slayers called the Nightstalkers.Led By Whistler's Daughter(Jessica Beil)and Hannibal King(Ryan Reynolds)In the meantime,the Vampire nation led by Parker Posey have brought back Dracula.YES,that Dracula to combat Blade.The movie starts out on a good foot.Good opening action sequence.Blade is bad-ass as ever.But then it just gets bogged down into way too many subplots.little character development.None of the hyper-reality in the other movies that made them real.No atmosphere.A lame bunch of villains.Poor action scenes.It all starts to resemble a parody of the week one would see on Mad TV.Wesley Snipes is great as Blade.His character is the reason I have paid 9 bucks to see the movies.Not The MTV wannabees that now infest the storyline.Instead of Blade making the next logical step in character development as from the much-superior Blade 2,he backtracks to the first one.Do we get to see Blade get laid?Its almost like Blade is a supporting actor in his own movie.Not very wise at all.No instead this is the Nightstalkers guest-starring Blade.Jessica Beil is okay here.But her action scenes are just way too cheesy and totally unreal.Blade 3 wastes her time.The ever-Annoying Ryan Reynolds is the weak spot here.His little one-liners are supposed to be hip,cool,and appeal to the MTV crowd.But they just fall flat or sound stupid.Parker Posey is badly miscast here.None of that Party girl sass.Triple H is wasted.As is James Remar,Natasha Lyonne,and Patton Oswald.The Guy they picked to play Dracula is just stale,lacks dimension,and totally non-threatening.David Goyer may have sounded like the best choice to direct this at the time.How New Line had the guts to green-light this and send it reeking out to the masses is puzzling? Goyer sabotages Blade 3 at nearly every chance he gets to redeem himself.Is it any wonder Snipes and Kristopherson voiced their concerns?Major disappointment and lame ending to a once promising series.3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So many people just don't understand the drivel that comes down the pipeline...OK. Blade Trinity isn't a 'great' movie in the Orsen Wells Citizen Kane kinda way or in the Marlon Brandon Apocalypse Now kinda way...BUT when you have movies such as Fast and the Furious 2 (seriously people!) that promotes itself as "action packed" or Troy which was promoted as "epic" that are just full of...well, words I cant write here (!), its nice to see someone make a movie in the spirit of the first Men in Black or The Matrix movies: its fun, its not trying too hard (Ryan Reynolds is just funny, not TRYING to be funny), not pretending to be deep or insightful or meaningful, but still maintains "action packed" in form and "epic" in feel. The directing is great, the script - although with a few bumps in the road - is well rounded for a movie whose purpose is to be entertainment. The fight sequences more believable than most I've seen lately, and for once we have a movie about vampires that isn't about gore; did you know that you can tell a story without gratuitous blood? Even a vampire story? Its great film-making when you don't miss blood in a vampire flick, and even better when you are thoroughly entertained from beginning to end. Could it use something else? Perhaps. But at least I wasn't begging them to cut something out of it. Its about time we had a movie that was about being a movie, knew it was about being a movie, and just was really, really good at it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is purely a marketing ploy. Jessica Biel regularly showing off her apple i-pod and Oakley sunglasses. Not to forget the obvious support from Nokia phones.Purely disgusting in terms of a film desperately trying to help push corporate products!I am sure that Wesley Snipes has had botox in his upper lip or is chewing on some gum the whole way through the film, as he appears to be gurning. Probably because he knows that the film is a load of rubbish. I am a Blade fan, but this film was a waste of time. I cant wait for a good marvel comic book conversion. Maybe something along the lines of Sin City which is a great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Failed to focus on what made the first two successful.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After holding out on watching this film due to the horrendous user ratings and comments, I finally picked this one up and watched with all the comments I read in the back of my mind. "Blade Trinity" isn't as terrible as I thought (basically I had "Daredevil in mind here), but its still an average action flick that had tons of potential and loses its focus in the franchise and doesn't even feel like the finale of trilogy."Trinity" takes place a few years later after the second one (I guess) with Blade and Whistler now at battle with media and local/federal police forces while handling their business with the vampires as well. The vampires meanwhile resurrect Dracula in hopes of him changing the tide of the on-going war with Blade and preserve their race. Later on Blade inherits a couple of new sidekicks in Ryan Reynolds (Van Wilder) who plays Hannibal King and Jessica Biel who plays Abigail Whistler, Whistler's long lost daughter.I had way too many personal dislikes in this movie that may be left open for interpretation, but they still hindered the movie and the opinions held by most of it's audience. Let me start with Dracula. One of the baddest characters in movie history was totally miscasted and misplayed by Dominic Purcell. He takes two forms really, one is his true creature form which can be seen in "Jeepers Creepers 1 &amp; 2" and the second is his human form, in which he chooses to resemble a British soccer player that looks like he was Russell Crowe's stunt double in "Gladiator". Instead of Dracula looking elderly and powerful (like "Underworld" and most vampire films), Dracula instead trounces throughout the movie looking like an an extra from the movie "Snatch".The director also decided to add a hint of comedy into the film by adding Ryan Reynolds to the film, with his character adding anecdotes every 30 seconds which are annoying, not funny and practically turned "Trinity" into an 80's action flick. Even though Blade himself was supposed to be annoyed by Reynold's comments it still didn't fit. And since I only have a 1,000 word limit here, I'll just wrap up the rest of the things that irked me: the Triple H's vampire Pomeranian, Parker Posey erratic acting, the two-time product placement of iPods and the out of control weapons to include Obi-Won Kenobi's light saber.More importantly, the film never felt like a finale, which was supposed to end the whole trilogy. The film focused more on Dracula and Blade's pointless sidekicks than Blade himself. The ending is terrible because it displayed nothing and used Reynold's narration to explain what happened. The only reason why I even gave it a 5 was the occasional action sequences, musical score and a few added chase scenes. Although this movie isn't as bad as people said, it's still disappointing and could've been an excellent movie with better directing and a better cast.</fullReview>

I liked the ancient horror and power that lurked in those other movies. This "ancient horror" is like the McDonald's mascot clown compared to the previous movies. An example of how bad this movie is. For one instance, the bad intervention in the movie. Suddenly a heroess appears from nowhere, without any context to previous scenes, and wacks a gang of vampires. And she is only human (lol). Then suddenly more heroic humans appear. Soon they are a whole army. Then they rescue blade, and afterward they kiss his ass like there is no tomorrow, its embarrassing to watch this movie. Blade has gone from cool to nerd imo in this movie. 6 for the special effects and -4 for the extreme crappy content.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***A critic is nothing more than a person voicing their beliefs; a review is nothing more than one person's opinion, and you're NEVER going to agree with someone 100% of the time. -Me ***Set aside all your preconceived notions and what you think you know about vampires and what you didn't like about the preceding two films, and look at this movie in and of itself.Now keep in mind I am normally more critical of sequels because they come a dime a dozen these days, *and* that I was greatly disappointed with Blade II. Now, let me say that I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I just finished watching it for the third time--the first two times were in the theater and now the extended version on the DVD--and I am as pleased with it as I was the first time I saw it, which believe it or not is a rare feature for a movie to have. A lot of times, you will be very pleased with a movie the first time you see it and not like it half as much with each repeated viewing. When you watch a movie for the 2nd or 3rd or 4th time, and you come away with the same opinion of it as you had the first time, there has to be some depth and consistency that is not easily achieved. These are the best movies...not to imply that I'm throwing this in the pot with 'the best', but the fact that this film achieves this certainly puts it a few notches higher than others.Consider what the movie excels at: 1) Several different types of action--car chases, foot chases, gun fights, sword fights, archery, etc. 2) Talented actors that portray three-dimensional characters and that underwent three months of training. 3) Believable characters, each with an aspect many can relate to. 4) It actually has an intelligence to it, with the development of the weapons, the evolution of the vampires, and their plans for the future. 5) Awesome martial arts choreography which the actors trained to perform. 6) Well researched and creative weapons that don't just look good, but have a simple functionality. 7) And we certainly can't forget the special effects--I thought the movie was visually astounding.8) Something else I feel is notable is that Blade is not a typical hero, being more or less bad himself, however comparably good when you factor in the vampires. 9) The movie was not predictable and did not feel forced like most sequels. 10) Short punch-lines that are actually funny--I only found 3 statements over-the-top. I thoroughly enjoyed the light humor. 11) Heart--yes, heart. The father-son relationship between Whistler and Blade, the brother- sister relationship between Hannibal and Abbey, and the family that they all become. I actually felt moved when Blade cried out after Whistler was killed in the fire, and I'm *not* your typical girl--it takes a lot to scare me; it takes a lot to move me--to the point of tears anyway.Ultimately, with all of these factors combined, the movie takes on a life of its own and manages to produce its own unique feel. I love movies that excel in many areas--not settling to be simply a bad ass action movie, or a heartfelt romantic comedy. This movie has it all, and still manages to not include the usual throw-in-some-romantic-interest cop-out that might've been done with Abbey &amp; Hannibal, instead playing the trio as a sort of makeshift family. Granted, yes, there are flaws, but they do not overshadow the tangible and solid nature the film. I for one was pleasantly surprised, and hope that anyone who reads this will put aside their preconceived notions and give this movie (and others they 'heard' were bad) a chance.***And please remember, a critic is nothing more than a person voicing their beliefs, and a review is nothing more than one person's opinion, and you're NEVER going to agree with someone 100% of the time. So go see the movie and decide for yourself.8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch the extended play DVD!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't able to watch this movie when it first came out in theaters. However, I was able to rent the DVD when it was released to video and I highly recommend it. In fact, I will probably purchase the DVD later on some time. The DVD offered an extended play, so there are many scenes that were not in the original theatrical release. There is also a second disk of various "the making of", "out takes", etc.I've read the comments from others here and I'm sure that you can get an idea of what the plot of the movie is. Also if you are a big fan of the Blade series, I think that you will not be disappointed by "Trinity". Maybe it's just me viewing the extended play version, but I didn't know why these other people didn't enjoy this movie. I thought it was great. In fact, I think that Trinity was much better than Blade II."Blade Trinity" is a steady, fast paced action movie with lots of chase scenes (both cars and simply running), lots of explosions, and some of the best fight choreography of any karate movie. I love the ashing effects and there is a lot of those here too. All of the actors did a fine job.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who on earth made Blade a comedy? Is that enough for you? If not, please continue.Blade Trinity is the sort of movie that can wreck a series. This certainly did. The only thing that gives this a three is (ironically enough) some moments of comedy. Other than that, this is dreadful; terrible acting, dreadful script, and most of all, they can't even salvage a decent action film in the entire film. It seems as everything is done in slow-motion; people taking at least three minutes to react to the first gunshot and figure out exactly what the hell they're doing.Ignore any positive reviews. This is sure to disappoint and waste your money.3 out of 10</fullReview>

Ryan Reynolds was at his best, delivering very funny parts, he also knows how to kick some HHH ass.Lots of great action, especially the end where they're saving Hannibal. One of the best action scenes ever! The ending was a little strange and me and my friend didn't really get it at first, but then we eventually got it. Some people might not like this ending.Overall, a very good action movie.9/10 P.S. Blade wears a gay looking Christmas sweater and the end of the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst Dracula films ever created.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dracula films have continued to evolve from Bram stokers original novel and the first Dracula film Nosferatu, improvements in sound and special EFX have improved the visual elements, but the narrative has remained intact. However, the most recent Dracula film to combine both contemporary visual elements (Dracula changes into a wolf etc) and new narrative elements successfully was the flamboyant 1992 version. Subsquently, when it is compared to this most recent version of the the 1992 version is on a different scale. I feel the only factor Balde Trinity succeeds in is the action sequences. As the narrative is tedious, repetitive and tries too hard to be funny via one character in particular. One element which really made me laugh was the fact that Dracula (the source of all evil was found in IRAQ) this concerned me, and posed the question would the American public respond to this concept by agreeing as the Hollywood hoped, because to me it highlights the huge influence that politics can have even on film audiences. Addtionally I fear that just as the Universal and Hammer horror cycles came to an end with big budget 'Flops', with every horror character on the screen at one time, the Hollywood horror cycle is copying, illustrated by the poor quality Gothic horror based films like Blade Trinity and especially Van Helsing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I welcome</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>May contain spoilers Perhaps it has something right shooting another Blade with not that much action. Really, this one is very different. Nice story!It turns out Dracula (or at least somebody like him) exists. He's dug in a desert and a couple of survived vampires bring him back to life. He's day-walker like Blade. They want his DNA to create a new race with no fear of the sun. This time Whistler really gets killed, but instead of him Blade will get new company: another command hunting for vampires with Whistler's pretty daughter (princess Jessica Biel) inside. (I'm her fan since the last "Texas chainsaw massacre"). Hunters get Blade out of FBI building after he's arrested. The members of the group are really nicely "arranged". The rest of the movie is well-known (no way boring, I'm going to watch it for the third time) but unlike Blade 2 this part contains more drama. I love touching scenes in any genre. Basically Blade 3 doesn't contain much action but I think that is Goyer's plan of changing some game rules. I think he managed, he did it right. You see, the point is there are even not many vampires left and more: Blade himself will probably die in the end. Everybody's getting ready to face the fate. In one word, let's watch Blade one more time, perhaps it's the last time. That's why I'll say again: Goyer really wanted to say something with this movie. At least this is rare case when 3rd part turns out really watch-worthy. Right now I can't find a single gripe. Lot of things are really cool and unexpected in here, but the ending (contains a bit sad elements, plus very impressing narration) was really something. Great final! Some might feel discomfort. That's what I felt watching first time because of the huge contrast between previous 2 parts and this one, but the second time I thought it's nice. I like it. I'd really own DVD (and let me say, I don't own first 2 "Blades"). Don't be afraid of changes. This one is right and good. Mr. Goyer and the rest of the crew! I frankly welcome what you did. Highly recommended! 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best of all Three So Far... Who says there won't be another?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This an interesting premise, how is it that the Media have never caught on to such a titanic battle before? A quasi-vamp chasing down full-blooded blood-suckers? Better yet, why was the First Fang not informed of it? Borrowing a little from Anne Rice indirectly - they implied the first vampire was a dude conveniently called Drake (never heard of Dominic Purcell, but he was good as Blade's ultimate nemesis) and he was found in the Middle East (thus the Rice ref, as in Queen of The Damned which implied somewhere in Egypt or Israel the first blood-suckers were made from a rogue demon) and to be revived again at a severe thirst (like Lestat after his going Underground after "Interview With The Vampire").But the current vamps who in Drake's eyes are little different from the wanna-be Goths (who really tick off Drake as you'll see when he enters a "vampire" shop), the new vamps decide to up the ante by putting Blade in a situation where he accidentally kills a human - who's really a slave, that sacrifices themselves to mess up Blade - and the whole thing is on tape!At the cost of Whistler, who appears to really die this time, Blade manages to escape and regroup with a bunch of kids who are good in their own right but seem wet behind the ears by Blade's own demanding standards.Wesley Snipes' character is darker and less remorseful, something that Kristofferson/Whistler spotted, and Blade almost loses sight of his humanity until his initial contact with Drake where he threatens an infant at the top of a building.Ryan Reynolds' debut as an ex-slave and former vamp (that needs expounding, if no Blade 4, then a Hannibal King?) and his foray into action flick from teen comedies is a great transition with his smart-arsery still intact - listen to how he delivered that line, "...thunder-c*** with fangs!" LOL Blade and Drake's final battle was enormous and cataclysmic as any true comic book/graphic-novel contretemps should be - going through floors windows and damn near doing a Samson from the Bible! Magnificent, almost like a ballet...Well thought-out, brilliantly executed and still leaving the way open for more from this genre by creating an opening for the budding young Reynolds... I say here's to a 21-fang nibble for the Marvel team who are finally getting their act together in making movies! They used to say Make Mine Marvel, maybe now it can be altered to Make My Movies Marvel-ous? ;op http://tinyurl.com/3464k/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have been a fan of the Blade Movies ever since the first was made and I think Ryan Reynolds and Jessica Biel were good additions. I think the humor brought into this film was much enjoyed and well added. The humor wasn't over the top and was well chosen. The whole idea of Dracula being the ultimate enemy and there being a company of Vampires is a little over the top, but all in all the third movie didn't crash like most trilogy's do these days. The only thing I believe should be different is the ending, I don't think it finalizes at all and unless they plan on having a fourth what were they thinking. I will still be buying this movie, but with the hope that there is more to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>News Flash - This movie is not challenging or thought provoking. Nor does it's plot work on any level other than as the thinnest of threads upon which to hang a succession of action sequences. Which is exactly what you'll be looking for if, like me, you loved the previous two movies. This is the perfect hangover movie as many parts of your brain are not required at all in order for you to enjoy every black-leather-clad, gun-totting, comic-book-violence, vampire-slaying minute of it. Some movies are designed to stimulate the viewer intellectually, some to stimulate the senses. The best movies do both. Blade Trinity doesn't even try to tickle your intellect, let alone awaken it. What it does brilliantly though, is assault your senses with cool visuals and sound. Wesley Snipes as Blade has more vampire-exterminating guns and gadgets than you could shake a crucifix at. Jessica Beal (Abigail Whistler) looks awesome in slow-motion and Ryan Reynolds is great as the wise-cracking Hannibal King. This trio spends almost the entire movie dispatching a seemingly endless supply of vampires and familiars in ever more spectacular and amusing ways. If you liked the previous 2 movies you won't be disappointed by Blade Trinity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great special effects, excellent action sequences, kick-ass soundtrack, but a very lousy storyline! I was disappointed that they brought "Dracula" and left out the seductive and wicked parts that make Dracula such as him seducing female victims or seeking a female soulmate or at least giving him more screen time. The villains served no purpose and the ending was left hanging to the point that I may not even want to see another Blade movie. Jessica Biel was hot and she has potential to become an action heroine. I would like to see a spin-off of her character. Ryan Reynolds was hysterical! He stole every scene he was in and he was better here than in National Lampoon's Van Wilder. This could've been a better movie if written by someone else. Didn't care for the story but it was worth it just to see Wesley Snipes, Jessica Biel, and Ryan Reynolds.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw blade Friday night. Well Blade was always "bad" now through he has transcended that, he has moved right into???.. AWFUL.If you don't want to know what happens delete this now, well nothing actually happens, but telling you will not make it any better.The movie starts well, the first 10 minutes are cool, a fight scene, but it is downhill from there. Actually the first line of the movie is about how movies about vampires are all stupid, boy did they get that right. The story makes no sense, WS during many parts of the movie just looks like he does not want to be there at all. Did I say the story was stupid, actually it is worse. The Vampire girls are UGLY and the vampires are all stupid and can not fight at all. They have some wrestler playing a vampire, in real life he could beat up anybody, but as a super strong vampire, he can beat on a weak human with all his might for 5 minutes and not do any damage and then get beat up by the skinny human. Except in the movie I think he was supposed to be beating on the human for hours. Stupid. The Dracula plot makes no sense and does not add anything, and goes no where. The dig him up to kill Blade, except he doesn't do anything, except show up every now and again. They have Dracula be able to change into anyone he wants (why, how who knows) and it is never used to any purpose at all. Every time he does it people see right through it. Oh they kill Dracula by inventing some virus that will kill all vampires, except guess what at the end of the movie (2 minutes later) they say Blade is still out there on the hunt cause the hunt never ends, blah blah blah. OK but the purpose of the virus was to kill all vampires, we see it doing that, so????? They have a girl shooting arrows instead of guns cause she looks cool, OK well I can go with that.They have a new weapon (only used twice) that makes a beam "half as hot as the sun" OK but the sun is pretty hot, right, even half as hot as the sun would not the beam melt everything, especially the person who was holding it.Somehow we go from Blade being the big bad vampire killer on his own to lots and lots for small vampire hunter groups out there that Blade has never heard of?? And Whistlers daughter is a member of them, and Whistler visited her, but he never told Blade about these other groups. Oh, they kill Whistler in the first 12 minutes, just so (I think) Dracula can show up as Whistler later (for about 30 seconds), except the guy who sees him says "hey you are dead" and knows it is Dracula.I was so sad</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Disappointing!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just got back from seeing this movie and I was very disappointed...with everything! Now don't get me wrong, the first two were awesome! The first one was cool, sleek, dark, and serious! The second one was still dark, serious, and took the storyline and plot into a new cool direction with a neat twist but still retained a sense of horror to it. But, the third one...UGH! Everything about it was horrible...the script, the plot, the acting, the bad jokes, the villains, all bad! The dialogue sounds like it was written by a seventeen year old high school student and the computer generated Dracula looked terrible. Oh, and I can't forget about the vampire pooches running around...how stupid is that? The guy they got to play Dracula couldn't be more misplaced! He was undoubtedly the worst Dracula I have ever seen...and I have seen a whole hell of a lot of "Dracula" movies! What genius decided to put Parker Posey in this movie as the lead female vampire. She's so bad it's funny! And the guy from "King of Queens"?? What the hell is he doing in this movie?!? And one of the female Nightstalkers IS BLIND!! Yeah, that's what I'd be doing too if I couldn't see what I was doing...chasing and killing vampires!!! Not to mention she has a young daughter running around she doesn't seem to be too worried about, considering what she does for a living...and what would any vampire movie be without a wrestler...? Triple H did not belong in this movie...period! The only thing I can't complain about is that Jessica Biel, as always, was HOT! She kind of takes your mind off the movie and just how bad it is. Being a big fan of the "Tomb of Dracula" comic from the seventies(which Blade first debuted) and the more recent comic series called "Nightstalkers" (which also stars Blade), it was just too out of whack with both comic series for me. It was too comical, the plot was ridiculous, the acting and dialogue was awful, and the ending sucked too. I just hope this was the last one in this series before they take the "Batman" route and get soooo bad they're laughed off the screen!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Without having seen the first 2 Blade installments, I fully expected not to let that interrupt my unadulterated enjoyment of this flick. The action was nonstop and the special effects were as usual kick ass. I really didn't see anything to complain about in this movie. Hannibal's snappy lines throughout the film left me chuckling, especially with Danica Talos. Abraham Whistler was a cross between Rip Van Winkle and Rubber Duck from Convoy. Abigail Whistler was hot eye candy and to a lesser extent so was Danica. The funniest part of the movie was the vamp-pom. I found the ending to be predictable and expect another Blade in a couple years but I can see this movie becoming tired &amp; tedious like the Highlander movies and every other movie that has ever been done to death by Hollywood. Nonetheless, I give it two thumbs up. Can't go wrong.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Start with: Formula that made the first two Blade movies successful and/or entertaining.Add: Poor acting from Parker Posey, Jessica Biel, and pretty much everyone else in the movie. Add: Van Wilder + 30 lbs + 30 one-liners Add: Bit players on the "Nightstalkers" that mean nothing to the movie (Natasha Lyonne? C'mon!) Add: Weak Dracula that wasn't even as menacing as Deacon Frost LOL Add: Ridiculous camera angles and stupid action scenes Add: Multiple shameless plugs for the IPOD Subtract: Wesley Snipes' humor that made the other movies funny. Subtract: The successful formula that we started with.What do you get? 2 hours of one-liners from Ryan Reynolds and none of the satisfaction of the first two movies. Go see something else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To begin, Blade= Awesome. Blade 2= Pretty damn good. Blade 3= What the @#%$!!!!!!!!!!!!!I saw this flick and not to sound like a total film geek but damn there was so much wrong with this one.Things to think about: 1. Blade kills a human, a familiar, but a human none the less. He thought it was a vamp. In the first movie he said he could smell vampires and knew how they moved. How did he screw that one up. Whistler yells at him for killing humans. The F.B.I bust in and Whistler starts to blow the cops away with a shot gun. WHAT THE @#$%!!!!2. The vampires use lamps and lights in the tomb of Dracula, in the second movie they could see in the dark tunnels of the sewer. Whistler even yells at them for breaking his night vision goggles in Blade 2. Again, WHAT THE @#$%!!!!3. Abigail Whistler kills the power to the building at the end of the movie, thus killing the lights. Good thing the vampires in this one cannot see in the dark like the ones in the second movie. Oh wait, she doesn't have goggles so why fight these guys blind in the first place. WHAT THE... well you know.4. Noe of the NIghtstalkers are at all useful. they are throwaway characters that had no purpose. And whoever did the fags for Parker Posey. It helps them the actor doesn't have to lisp through the prosthetics. They made an amazing actress sound like Cindy Brady.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, Ryan Reynold's character ruined the movie. I'll repeat that...Ryan Reynold's character ruined the movie. His jokes were corny,offensive, and childish. He reminded me of a child seeking attention by using four letter words as much as possible. Ridiculous and inappropriate to the overall feel of the movie. This is a serious movie...well it was supposed to be....and any amount of BRIEF comic-relief must be crafted very tactfully. Also, Dominic Purcell was inappropriate cast. If the writers of Balde wished to include him in the movie...then he could have been some biker-cum-vampire type...NOT the first vampire. His features are too modern (which he can't help)...but it was made worse by his stylish leather pants, cowboy books, armani shirt, and GQ jewelry accessories. There were elements of Blade Trinity that reminded me of the last two movies....Blade I was ingenious, Blade II was good, and Blade Trinity had wonderful opening graphics, brilliant acting by Snipes as times...but ever since the opening monologue's ending phrase "crock of S **t was the beginning of a very bad movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed Blade 2 and was looking forward to Blade Trinity. The fight scenes were good, and the guy playing the super vampire was good. What wasn't so good was how much time they gave the wise cracking helper. It was like they took Chandler Bing from "Friends", had him drink a gallon of coffee then stuck him in there. A little of the wise-ass type of humor goes a long way but the director seemed to have fallen in love with the guy and gave him more lines than any one else in the movie. Wesley Snipes had no good lines. The woman helper described as a "hottie" and she was , very much so but again there was no particular reason that character was a woman as she was given no real dialoge. Perhaps there will be a "director's cut" or "special edition" that gives Wesley more screen presence and or cuts down on the Chandler Bing guy and it could boost the movie several points.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rounding out the Trinity...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original Blade film will always stand out above the sequels whether they make more or not, they would struggle to come close to the nail they hit with Blade. Former writer David Goyer takes the reigns of direction in the third installment. Unfortunately he proves that the imminent knowledge of writer's character doesn't necessarily mean he can envision the actual world. Trinity is much less about Blade then it is about the world that revolves around Blade and if necessary without Blade.Trinity begins in a whole new era it seems. Blade's actions have been caught up with by the FBI and they seek to take him down. He no longer stalks from the shadows and they are closing in on him. Also a pack of vampires led by two strong vampires, Danica Talos, and Jarko Grimwood, have resurrected the oldest, original, unstoppable vampire...Dracula as he is known to some. In a trap set up by the vampires, Blade is captured by the FBI, and his beloved Whistler is killed...again, and then he is rescued by a group of vampire slayers called Nightstalkers led by Abigail Whistler, Whistler's daughter. Nightstalkers believe they have found a way to launch a virus into the world that will eliminate ALL Vampires. Unfortunately in order to launch the virus they need direct contact with the Patriarch of all vampires. Together with the new Whistler, and former Vampire Hannibal King, Blade must stop a new threat and find a way to launch the virus.The plus side is since Blade 2, they toned down to enormous amount of CGI that plagued the second installment. They took a remarkable original film and killed it with big budget effects that looked cheesy. Unfortunately the story line also went shallow with the second one but Blade still remained tough as nails and great to watch. Blade Trinity drains everything from the series that is left. The story is the shallowest yet despite introducing what could have been some amazing characters in Jessica Biel and Ryan Reynolds. As I warned almost 3 years ago about Blade going soft, his character doesn't seem as strong as he used to be. In Trinity it feels as though he is replaced by these new generation vamp hunters. Biel is terrific but under utilized as Whistler's illegitimate daughter and Ryan Reynolds is used as you might expect for comic relief as he is the master of one liners. Fortunately they also make him into a great action star which he can also pull off. Both of them look in the shape of their lives!! They counter Blade's dark side well. Sadly the worse part of the film is the ending which feels more than tacked on. It feels like they ran out of money and had to end it there and then. It's a freakishly fast, pointless ending. The positive side is that Snipes is still great as Blade and some of the action sequences are kick butt!! Unfortunately the film series MUST end here because they are getting worse with time. Still I suggest checking this one out as it does round off a great action trilogy even if it closes it poorly. 6.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A) This is the lamest one of the trilogy.B) Wesley Snipes rule, sidekicks are lame and no I don't want a Nightstalker spin-off (the lame itself is so awfully lame).C) Not enough action, Wesley Snipes should have been involved in post-production like the earlier two movies (which both ruled).D) I can't stress this enough, the Nightstalkers destroyed the movie and took the focus of mr badass Blade. Wesley is the only one of the three who actually know martial arts and can pull it off. No matter how hot Biel looks all buffed up (which is, so hot, to quote a 15 year old) it's still not credible having her kick 250 pound guys around.E) If you read about Snipes and this movie, you'll find he is not exactly over the top happy about it, for obvious reasons. Oh and Dracula.. my god, super lame, the worst foe yet - and this because of the horrible actor and lame costume.F) Ryan's character is funny, but that's it. If you ever do a fourth it should be all Snipes or I'm out. And if I ever see the eventual Nightstalker spin-off I'm sorry to say I'll see it only to see Biel buff again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recently went to see this movie and let me tell you, they were not aiming for the Oscars.It was just meant to be some pointless fun. I know there was no script,some of the acting was kind of poor, it probably didn't benefit from the best director, and yes, it was a little loud. But hey, it had a few things going for it:1)_ WesleySnipes is Blade 2)_ Jessica Biel is one good looking babe.3)_ Ryan Reynolds (who is probably going to be the next action hero in a few years)And i'm not going to make a list of the cons because i was entertained by this movie ,it was 2 hours of distraction and 30 minutes later i had forgot all about it. So guys, don't try to find a meaning to all this,it's just a movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having seen the movie, I really don't understand the scorn heaped on it by some published reviewers. Maybe it is all a matter of what you go in expecting. If you're looking for "Sophie's Choice," or even "Crouching Tiger," you'll be disappointed.But if you expect a light narrative that straps you in and takes you on a fast-paced, entertaining ride -- you're in the right place. That is, if you allow for a lot of violence and gratuitously rancid language.Not much more to say than that, except for two SPOILER complaints. SPOILERs in three... two... one....Okay, so they're so smart that they have this tight organization all set up, and can even spring Blade from the middle of a police station. But as to their HQ, "security" consists of... a blind woman sitting in front of a monitor? Hmmm.....And this is even more bothersome. After beating King to no effect, Parker Posey's character makes this really gripping threat to him. It clearly "gets" to him, hits home. And so, in the next sequence... they've gone back to beating him, so he can make more cute remarks? What's up with that?It would have been MUCH more dramatic, effective, and logical if that threat had been the climax, and if he'd clearly been shaken to the point where he was wavering, considering giving them their information -- and THEN they start coughing and choking, and he (relievedly!) makes his little speech.But hey -- it wasn't a documentary! It was EN TER TAIN Meant. And my son and I were entertained!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First things first...If you loved the original Blade, DON'T SEE THIS! You will be sorely disappointed. This movie has nothing that Blade 1 had. You want an example? Take Blade's sword...count how many vampires he kills in this movie with it...ZERO. Or how about fights...Something Blade is known for...well how about 1 small fight at the end...that's split up between camera time of Ryan Reynolds and Jessica Beil fighting.This is the worst part of the film. The movie is called BLADE, not Blade and friends. Why do directors/writers think that people care about these other actors? Why do they think they are just important as the main character? They're not...BLADE IS THE STAR and the REASON WHY WE ARE SEEING THE MOVIE. Stop trying to "change" the formula by adding all these MTV generation losers for the pop kids to identify with.This movie is all about the new people...Including Reynolds who is nothing but joke afer joke after joke. Oh and get this...Jessica Beil, what does she do when she's fighting? She listens to her Ipod, with the latest MP3s. Can you say GARBAGE! Could this movie get any more corny?If you're wondering why I haven't talked about Blade himself much...well its because there's nothing to say. He's barely the star of the movie. He has one fight that's split up by the other 2 idiots. Even the end fight is split up with screen time for the others. This movie lacks the style and awesomeness the 1st presented.Lastly...Jessica Beil is a normal person...but yet can kick the crap of tons of vampires. I'm sorry, but wasn't the draw of actually becoming a vampire, that you have super-human strength? Well appearntly thats not the case in Blade Trinity...It seems that Jessica Beil is just as strong as Blade, if not stronger...And she's just a normal human. At least Reynolds get his ass kicked enough to make him look human.To sum this movie up...The end Villain is really awesome...But the end fight really sucks. Blade is really awesome...But he's barely doing what Blade does, KICKING BUTT. This movie is lost potential and made for the MTV generation. Buy BLADE 1, and forget this movie ever happened.</fullReview>

Although I love Van Wilder, I thought they could have been a little more original.

		<shortDescription>Blade meets his worst enemy: over-zealous comic relief</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved the initial Blade movie, it's in my top 20. Blade 2 offered an acceptable array of action and ingenuity that left me yearning for more. I've often said that action movies should be allowed some slack when it comes to story and character. However, there comes a point where the sacred contract between an action filmmaker and a tolerant action audience is tested and abused to the point where it's not fun anymore.Blade Trinity, has rejected the slickness of the first two for what can only be described as cheap sentimentality, painful exposition, an overly-convoluted weak plot, COMPOUNDED by an over-zealous effort to make the otherwise dull second act interesting through comic relief.The movie begins surprisingly poorly, a big shock from an action franchise famous for the introduction of its kick-butt stylization in the prologue (before any story is expected). Basically, vampire brats walk down a stone staircase and are attacked by an armoured hand that's sleeping under the sand. Sound action-packed? Wrong. Howabout if it was followed a COMPLETE AND TOTAL rehashing of the opening sequence of Blade 2, even copying the use of motorcycles by the vampires AND Blade flipping over a speeding vehicle? Sound cool? NO, IT'S NOT COOL, IT'S THE SAME EXACT THING.Parker Posie plays the female vampire mastermind that's filled the vampire's leadership void created in the second film. I love Parker Posie, she's a wonderful actress, but she staggers in this role, seemingly more from the director's lack of vision than her own abilities. I assume this because, in fact, none of the characters seem to know exactly what they're doing. It isn't until the last twenty minutes or so that a goal for the protagonists is clearly laid out, and even then, it's a bit of a deus ex machina (coming in the form of "Hey, I have the ultimate weapon, sorry I didn't tell you or emphasize the importance of it earlier.")Meanwhile, in an attempt to give the second act some semblance of drama, the secondary protagonists are killed off, including a BLIND MOTHER. You read it right, the producers actually played the handicap parent card to tug on the audience's feelings. This is called bad writing. BAD, even for a BLADE movie.But I haven't even gotten to the worst part. The Ryan Reynolds comic relief character, instead of punctuating the drama like you're supposed to do with comic relief, instead becomes uncomfortably pronounced in the expositional scenes. Non-sequitors also seem to be the flavor of the day, an example being a poke at the "techie" character with the line "Hey, have you ever gotten laid?" This would normally be funny if we shared in the joker's confusion over the technical jargon being expressed by the "techie" character, but in fact, the information being provided is not only easy to understand, but also, get this, ESSENTIAL to the plot. Wrap your mind around that contradiction.As usual, in the vein of recent large action titles (aka Van Helsing), the visuals are amazingly vibrant and dynamic. Gabriel Beristain's cinematography borders on stupendous, leveraging every possibility of dramatic lighting, camera movement, depth of focus, and dynamism available. I'd even go so far as to say the craft of motion photography has reached a new golden era in great part to Blade Trinity and other movies of its kind.But as any Neanderthal can tell you, "great visuals no make great movie." The ultimate blow comes simply from the concept of the film itself. The movie starts off with the suggestion that Blade must fight a two-front war (against both humans and vampires) without Whistler. At the end of act one we're ready for an epic and dramatic triangle of combat between Blade, humans, and vampires. But too quickly, the plot COMPLETELY changes. In fact, the humans don't even make an appearance until the last FIVE MINUTES of the movie. What happened to the two-front war?!?!?! VERY DISAPPOINTING.I give Blade Trinity 3 out of 10 stars, 3 stars coming from the excellent cinematography and the superfluous use of the phrase "mother f***er."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>At least Jessica Biel's hotness ensues...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well. That was disappointing. Let me start off by saying that I'm not a Blade fanboy. I've only seen bits and pieces of the first one, and while Blade II doesn't rest comfortably on my DVD shelf, I still thought it was pretty good. I'd probably give it 3.5 marks. So I was expecting to thoroughly enjoy Blade: Trinity as a fast-paced, action-packed movie with a little Jessica Biel thrown in to spice up the proceedings. In other words, I thought for sure I'd come away thinking this was the best of the series.Unfortunately, that's not the case. Instead of being a dark, intense, and gritty tale about a Dracula-led legion of vampires taking on the baddest vampire hunters on the planet, what we've got is a silly circus with some goofy vampires as the sideshow. They're not the least bit intimidating, and um, shouldn't vampires be at least somewhat scary? I thought HHH (the wrestler) would make a pretty cool bad guy vampire, but he seemed more interested in exchanging lame jokes with Ryan Reynolds than anything else.Speaking of Ryan Reynolds, what's the deal, could they not afford Jason Lee? The guy looks and sounds just like a Jason Lee clone. He actually has some funny lines, but he has some pretty bad ones as well. I'll give the guy a break and chalk it up to the bad dialogue rather than his delivery. For example, when Wesley Snipes finds out that Reynolds and Biel call themselves the Nightstalkers, he asks if that's supposed to be some sort of Saturday morning cartoon. Reynolds claims that "the Care Bears" was taken. Sorry, but that just isn't funny.Did someone mention Jessica Biel? Oh yeah, I did in the paragraph above. Yeah, well, you see, she's hot, and as such I'm glad she was in the movie because I pretty much just stared at her whenever she was on screen. It sure beat trying to sit through some of the dialogue. If not for her presence, then I would've ranked the movie even lower, so bravo for that casting choice.As for Dracula? Hmm, he was all right. However, I don't know why he was made up to look like a model for International Male. Leather pants, a white shirt whose neck comes halfway down his chest, and loads of chains? Come on, what's that all about? Is Dracula headed to a rave? Do those even exist anymore? Other than that bit of silliness, he was at least somewhat menacing.Even though I was disappointed in the campy B-movie feel, I'd have to say my biggest complaint is the lackluster plot and the uneven flow of the story. The action is very cool whenever it finally kicks in. I especially enjoyed watching Jessica Biel kick vampire posterior. But there are a few parts that drag, and for some reason, almost half the movie is in slow motion. At least it feels that way. Seriously, the formula is: play really loud techno music, show some main characters walking in slow motion towards the camera and looking very pensive, have a fight scene. Repeat until end of movie.The formula is so overdone that I can honestly say this is one movie where I actually agree with the critics who say it looks like one big music video. There's one scene where the pimped out Dracula is walking on a deserted street (in slow motion, of course) with the music blaring, and I just kept wondering when the girls in bikinis were going to show up and start dancing behind him. I'm just not sure what the point was. This works for some movies, but that's not what I wanted to see here.I know I've spent a lot of time on its shortcomings, but Blade: Trinity isn't a bad movie. I was never really bored, and I really enjoyed the action sequences and fight scenes. But this is the third movie in the series, and therefore, it has a lot to live up to. Unfortunately, it doesn't live up to the hype. So yeah, I was somewhat entertained, but more than that I was disappointed.It *could* have been very memorable if it had made one little drastic change. Allow me to explain. Early in the movie we see Jessica Biel's character on a laptop, and Reynolds informs Blade that she likes to listen to music while she's fighting. Of course, her taste in music exclusively involves techno and loud hip hop beats. How funny would it have been if instead she had been a huge Kris Kristofferson fan? After all, she's Whistler's daughter. Then the gang could've gone to battle against Dracula with To Beat the Devil blaring. Or am I the only person who thinks that idea is gold? THE GIST:If you're a fan of the Blade movies, then lower your expectations and you should at least find some entertainment value. If you've watched the previous Blade movies and hated them, then there's no way this will win you over. If you haven't seen either of the first two Blade movies, then I suggest watching them before you even consider Blade: Trinity. And if all you want is to see Jessica Biel looking hot, then this will fill that need.Rating: 3 (out of 5)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a fan of the Blade franchise. Wesley Snipes is great as Blade. The third movie fell completely flat. The introduction of two new characters Biel and Reynolds was a mistake and didn't fit the movie. Ryan Reynolds character was completely awful, the humour he tried to put in this role does not fit this franchise. Reynolds is only good in comedy films, he sucks in action films. He was terrible in Green Lantern. The Blade series is a dark and action packed franchise, it is not a comedy film. Biel was OK but did not compliment Blade. I feel that Blade is a one man show and it should have stayed that way in this film. The story had some potential, but introducing too many characters muddied the waters.</fullReview>

Guillermo del Toro made a good piece of cinema directing Blade 2 but unfortunately Blade's 3 director wasn't capable to follow such a high level. Acting, story, dialogues, music, special effects - everything was like a horror and I'm not talking about movie genre here. What I didn't like most of all was Ryan Reynolds acting. It was weak, fake, without life (even tough he wasn't a vampire;)). Besides the person he was playing was an idiot indeed, asking pointless questions and spoiling movie's impression. For everybody who saw second part of Blade's adventure and are about to see it's third part - DON'T DO IT. It will spoil your good impression about Blade's movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No.The first "Blade" is immortal, due largely in part to what many consider the greatest opening credits of the 1990's. On top of that, it's a pretty decent movie, with great martial arts, production values and soundtrack. Everything came together surprisingly well, under the watchful eye of some kid we'd never heard of named Stephen Norrington.It was a fortunate match, because Norrington's much-anticipated follow-up, "The League of Extraordinary Gentleman," tanked and with good reason-- it was poorly written and no fun at all. Screenwriter David S. Goyer stuck with the Blade franchise, though, and penned a decent (if more self-serious) sequel, directed that time by Guillermo del Toro, who's had some experience with that sort of thing, and though the change in style from the original was jarring, it was still a solid entry.The problem with "Blade: Trinity" could be a textbook example of why an experienced director is so freakin' important. The writing isn't BAD, it just needs crafting and shaping, something which Goyer-as-director is incapable of doing, at least at this point. The martial arts are poorly choreographed, the characterization is non-existent, and the studio walks all over the guy like he's yesterday's news. Which he might just be.There's a whole running joke (if you can call it that) where Abigail Whistler listens to mp3's when she's beating up folks. This isn't so much a plot point as it is a paid commercial advertisement for the fine people at Apple computers. It's a good idea-- props to Goyer for writing it in, if it was even his idea-- but he doesn't know how to make it funny, save for showing the character putting in her earphones, in slow motion, as the next Crystal Method track fades in.The budget seems low for a second sequel, the action and fighting is all shot perilously close-up, and Goyer routinely makes the rookie mistake of trying to make the action more exciting via music, when he should be using the camera-- though somehow the costumes, make-up, lighting, sound and soundtrack are all A+ work, surely done by A+ people. Also, there's a change in CGI-style from the way vampires die, from the first to second movies, but into "B:T" there is no change... this is either a lapse in budget, or creative vision. Either way, these A+ people don't have a sensible director to direct them, so it's just aimless talent that sort of creates a mess that's pretty decent, but not really worth a second viewing, or thought. At least Norrington and del Toro knew how to weave the soundtrack into both the score and already-exciting action... Goyer just pushes play at random.Avoid-- Alba thinks it's an action movie, Snipes thinks it's a paycheck, Reynolds apparently thinks it's a comedy and he's the star... and Goyer thinks it's his ticket to big-time stardom. Worth for the curiosity factor but little else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst Blade Movie!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very disappointed on this one, when I heard that Blade was facing Dracula I said "Cool!" but this was a very pathetic imitation of Dracula, not to mention that it was played by a bad bad actor, he looked more like a WWF wrestlers. I gave them 2 just because it could have been worst.Blade II was great, well written and very dynamic and Blade vs Nomack was the mos exiting fight I have seen on years. But blade III was awful, with a ridiculous plot, stupid characters, ridiculous dialogs, and BAD DIRECTING, and Blade vs Drake was a pathetic B-movie joke of a fight.Mistakes on this movie:1) The plot, it sucks from start to end 2) Those trinity guys, we wanted to see Blade, not the Trinity Club 3) An amateur director, how in hell you let a high budget movie on the hands of an amateur director 4) The bad guys are a joke (played by B class bad-actors) 5) Drake, Blade's counterpart, cant fit the shoes of Frost (Blade I), or Nomak (Blade II); and this Drake was the worst Dracula ever played 6) Not getting one of the directors of the originals Blade or Blade II</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>dreadful garbage. the franchise has been sucked bone-dry.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Blade franchise runs out of steam- spectacularly so- with this deadening all-on assault of video-game movie-making. There's nothing vaguely new or interesting here, from the sub-par special effects to the confusing action sequences, and the shameless product placement- 'She listens to her iPod when she goes into battle'- is bound to leave you disgusted. To add insult to injury, Dominic Purcell appears as the screen's most embarrassing Dracula- or 'Drake', as he's known now. Three syllables too long to remember? Strutting around like he's just walked out of a Calvin Klein photo-shoot, he's even worse than Ryan Reynolds' 'comic' relief character, who spews out wisecracking one-liners at such a rate one could quite happily throttle him. At least there won't be any Blade: Quadrilogy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this is the worst blade film and i hope it stays there. the first one was a GREAT movie, with a new kind of hero, kicking new kind of ass (vampires)! the sword fight at the end was fantastic. i don't remember too much of it now, but i remember me rewinding it and watching it again!! Then the second one wasn't as good, like the Omar guy said, the story line was crap but the action was good. waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too much computer generated (CG) stuff.Then there were three... unlucky three. the movies just wasn't as good as the others. not enough blade fights and too much sidekicks. There's an weapon in there which is a UV arch.. i think it's in the adverts. anyhow, it's little things like that, that make the movie crap! the same thing happened in terminator 3, there was TOO much hi-tech gadgets that don't exist! if they just kept it a lot more simple, like, swords, dagger, and those killing star thingys, that u throw... But lasers, they just go over the top. They're great for futuristic film that are completely non-realistic, like star wars.That Ryan Reynolds should've stayed in "2 guys and a girl" he was funny in that, cos u were expecting to laugh. but BLade is a dark thriller, where you're expecting thing die, maybe get scared, and possibly cheer on the good guys for having some style with what they do. Ryan just spoils EVERYTHING!! it's like seeing Matt le blanc (joey from friends) play a masked murderer, and just when he's gonna kill some guy, and beautiful lady walks by, and Matt coming out with "How u DOIN?"It's just not right.David S. Goyer NEEDS directing lessons!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Blade: Trinity: 1/10: Press reports at the time of Blade: Trinity's release claimed that star Wesley Snipes went off the deep end and tried to kill the director David S. Goyer. Lord knows he could have gotten away with it. Show the jury this movie and let the acquittals fly.After two better than we deserved films the third Blade is a mess. For one thing the casting director is insane. The good guys consist of Snipes, Gabby Hayes (Kris Kristofferson), Elektra (Jessica Biel), Van Wilder (Ryan Reynolds), a retarded guy, a blind woman and Newt from Aliens. The good guys have a "club" called the Nightstalkers. (What no Darren McGavin). Biel fights with an overtly plugged iPod playing horrible techno. (I would think being able to hear would be important in hand-to-hand combat) Reynolds's character spouts off endless one liners (most of them remarkably lame) and is saddled with the name Hannibal King. (Also needless to say remarkably lame) and fights with a light saber bow. (Please see above). Speaking of lame we have the bad guys. We have wrestler triple H (who cannot act), Parker Posey (who cannot speak with the fangs in her mouth) and best of all Dracula (Who calls himself Drake. Thinks he is in a Highlander movie. He is also a pacifist piece of Euro trash that looks like he fell of a Harlequin romance book cover. And is easily the least convincing screen Dracula I have ever scene (I'm including both George Hamilton and Mel Brooks in this equation)). The script is awful (even if you remove Reynolds's one-liners), the film was edited in a Cuisinart, the continuity was done by the blind girl, and the plot consists of bad guys finding good guys headquarters, then good guys finding bad guys headquarters. If your still not convinced a contribution to Mr. Snipes potential legal defense fund is in order let me remind you. Parker Posey is the head vampire and has a climatic battle with Van Wilder. You can make the check out to cash.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gasoline would improve this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Too bad zero was not an option to pick as the value of the rating. Better yet a rating of minus 100 would fit quite nicely. The only thing that would improve this movie is a can of gasoline and a match tossed on all originals and copies of the original used to make this production. Wesley Snipes is underused. The script is dismal. No plot. No story. No situations that evoke inner feelings (except disgust). For any media not burned via gasoline per my above suggestion, I suggest that a good use might be an attempt to attract the attention of a room full of mental retards. They may get a kick out of the pretty flashing colors. I feel bad that the tremendous and great special effects were put to such a useless and wasted use.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Barely worth renting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, the addition of Ryan Reynolds to the cast practically brought down the quality of this movie all by itself. Don't get me wrong, i loved him as Van Wilder, but now he is Van Wilder fighting vampires. Besides being more buff than Van, he is exactly the same character in this movie as in Van Wilder. His jokes are always during serious parts and seem out of place and they are exactly like Van's jokes. That was the biggest thing this movie did to make me angry. Then, the crummy acting by Triple X (the professional wrestler) in this movie was very hokey. He even pulled some wrestling moves while fighting. The addition of Jessica Beil wearing headphones and using music software made by apple to load up her songs is obvious product placement and is really lame that she listens to her mp3 player to get pumped up while fighting. The rest of the movie is alright i guess except for Dracula himself. They act like he is so hardcore and the vampires expect him to save them from Blade. But when he actually fights blade, he fights like a girl. He isn't very central to the movie yet they make him out to be such a big deal. Also, the fact that Dracula is some teen heart throb model look alike is pretty lame too. And when Dracula shows his true self or whatever that is when he doesn't look like a human, his alien looks are really stupid, he looks kind of like Predator. I guess if you don't mind it being kind of hokey, its acceptable to rent but don't buy it for you will regret the purchase.</fullReview>

You can't compare each film to each other ... 1st movie was action based and second movie had a scifi flare to it and third had a hint of the other to with some comedy added to this one...

		<shortDescription>Not as good as it could or should be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Basically, what my one line summary says.This film is a bit of a let-down. There are some good points, and I did enjoy it, but it fails on so many levels.Firstly, I enjoy Ryan Reynolds' work, especially in the second season of 'Two Guys and a Girl', and I liked his performance in this, as he was the one character who provided some laughs, but he is not Hannibal King. Yes, Hannibal King is a wise-cracker, but he is much tougher than he is portrayed in this movie. He reminded me more of Xander off 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' than he should of. Also, he un-necessarily said the f-word a lot, which I think was done for the purposes of achieving at least a '15' rating alone.Secondly, pro wrestling has no reason for being in this film. Triple H is a good actor and he did well in the role of Jarko Grimwood, but never, in all of the vampire films I've watched over the years, have I ever seen a vampire body-slam someone!Thirdly, the fights were far too choreographed, which detracted from the atmosphere of the film, as did the blantant advertising of I-Pods. Also, unlike the previous films, the action sequences weren't violent enough, due to the fact that they were so complex and methodical because of the choreography.Finally, as I mentioned earlier, Hannibal King was the one character who provides laughs in this film. which shouldn't be. Previously, Blade has always had a great line in dry humour and wittiness, as had Whistler, and this isn't present.I was really looking forward to this film, as a fan of the series, but I'm really disappointed. If a Night Stalkers spin-off is made, which I would like, as I liked the characters, and there are a lot of different ways in which the characters could be developed, I hope it is better than this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blade 3 Returns to the right formula</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While i was quite disappointed with the 2nd film, although i still enjoyed it because it was a decent action fest for 2 hours, this film returns to the formula the first one used extremely well. It has a more character/human driven element to it and it doesn't rely on cheesy CGI or hong kong fighting to carry the flick. These are nice elements i like to see when used properly, but not overused. The humor of reynolds in this movie is a big plus as well as the great throwdown lines they thought up. This film has some flaws, i.e. they don't develop Drake enough, but it definitely was a good multi watch movie. I walked out of the theater this time thinking i wanted to come back and watch it again. Definitely a must see for any original Blade movie fan!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The mighty have fallen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even after over 10 years of development of special effects and progress in shooting action sequences "Blade" and "Blade II" are still a great watch. Much more than many other movies which back in the days were the hallmark of comic book movies (i.e. "Spiderman" or "X-Men").The third instalment of Blade with Wesley Snipes as the titular character is a big drop from those experiences. Gone is the witty dialogue, slightly corny but terrific one-liners, great acting for an action movie, impressive villains and a satisfying finale. All you basically have left is cool and collected Blade - Wesley Snipes really excels in this role and does an unwaning perfect job as the Daywalker.And the movie initially starts where it left off. However it goes quickly downhill with the killing off of Whistler (Kris Kristoferson - one of the few actors that does a good job in character). Soon afterwards everything unfolds with the introduction of the Nightstalkers - a very bland and forcefully cool Abigail Whistler (Jessica Biel) as well as fan-favourite Hannibal King (Ryan Reynolds) - and Blade's villains - the unmemorable Talos family (with Parker Posey doing an exceptionally bad acting job) and Dracula (Dominic Purcell).The less said about Abigail Whistler and the Talos family the better. Very poor acting and apart from some eye candy they are quite pointless characters. As far as Ryan Reynolds is concerned I can accept moving away from source material and making him into more of a wisecrack. Problem is that Reynolds delivery doesn't work (especially if he has to sells the lines to the ultraterrible Biel) and there is no chemistry between him and Wesley Snipes. Every scene where they are together is so fake it hurts. The only scenes that seem to more or less click for the King is those where he neither Blade nor Abigail are in sight (the best was the sequence where the ex-vampire goes head to head with Jarko Grimwood). After seeing this movie and a couple other roles I have come to put into doubt Reynolds comedic talent and feel that Seann William Scott would have done miles better in the same comic-book roles. Enough said that the previous movies were much funnier with Snipes doing a stand-out job in delivering some ridiculously fun lines.Than comes the issue of Dracula. Dominic Purcell did an OK job given the lines and the script, but the main issue was the underusing of the character. The final battle was nowhere as epic as in the previous Blade movies, but essentially Dracula is the ultimate foe and as such this should be the most epic of Blade movies. The end battle is unmemorable, whilst Dracula himself seems a much weaker enemy than either Nomak or Deacon Frost. A definitely missed opportunity, but you got the feeling that with a better script and better director Purcell could really work the part.And thats the main issue with the movie. The script is very lazy and forced, as is the character interaction, which makes you emotionally unattached with anything that happens in the movie. Additionally the editing is totally out of whack, which kills off some of the line deliverance by King.Hopefully this isn't the end of the franchise, because you can't find anyone better than Snipes for Blade and you can still bring in some enemies such as Steppin' Razor or - best of all - Morbius.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch out for that plot hole, Blade!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I actually wrote a longer review on this film before for another website, but I have refined my opinion and have decided to write a review for the film "Blade: Trinity". Since there's already a plot summary listed here, I don't need to describe the film in detail. Needless to say, I didn't like the film, and I will go over the reason why I hated this monstrosity of modern cinema:ACTING: Let's be honest here, folks. The only characters in the film who get any significant screen time are Ryan Reynolds, Jessica Biel, and Wesley Snipes. By and large, the acting talent in this film is completely wasted. Kris Kristofferson, Natasha Lyonne and Parker Posey's skills are not even put to good use in this film. James Remar is saddled with an utterly thankless and inconsequential role as a police detective who disappears for most of the film. I also don't agree with the claim that Dominic Purcell did a bad acting job. He has wonderful acting skills, and delivers week after week on shows like Prison Break, so to be saddled with wooden dialogue and dressing up like a Eurotrash villain probably wasn't the best use of his skills. The only character who I thought did a good job in the film was Ryan Reynolds, who got all the best lines and witty vulgar comebacks, which propped up the film somewhat for me. Wesley Snipes looked like he didn't even care anymore and was just doing the film for a paycheck, and all Jessica Biel has to do is look sexy and kill people with her magic crossbow.CHARACTERS: By and large, most of the supporting characters in this film are wasted. Numerous people, including the police detectives, Whistler, every Nightstalker who isn't named Abigail or Hannibal, the police chief, and even the fat Irishman who gets Blade and Abigail more weapons are barely even in the film, and only exist to keep the film rolling. And let's be frank here, Blade is basically reduced to a background character in the film. It focuses on the Nightstalkers instead of Blade, which would be all well and good if this were a Nightstalkers film, but this is Blade we're talking about here. Even basic logic is thrown out the window with these guys, including a daylight(!!!) chase between Blade and Dracula(!!!!), Abigail beating up people while listening to her IPod, or the utterly stupid way Danica never kills anyone, instead choosing to goad them all the time. It's a shame, because some of these characters had real potential, but they were pushed to the sidelines to make way for the big actors. Even the character of Sommerfeld appears for all of 30 seconds and then gets killed off, and we, the audience, is supposed to feel that she made some kind of heroic sacrifice. Fat chance. No one even cares when Whistler gets killed.PLOT: There are numerous scenes in this film that have virtually no relation to the plot at all. Hey, that scene with Blade and Abigail visiting the vampire farm was interesting for the two minutes it lasted, but the topic of harvesting humans never comes up again, and the scene is only there to get the pair away from the rest of the Nightstalkers so they can get attacked. Likewise, Whistler is killed so that Blade can go into police custody, and Hannibal is kidnapped so that the big finale can occur in the villain's building. Heck, a fat Irish guy even shows up for all of two minutes to give Blade and Abigail some weapons, and he doesn't even help them out in the final assault! As it stands, the main plot is weak and threadbare. David S. Goyer must have been thinking "bigger is better", and decided to find the most evil, devious villain he could find, but the final results were limp. Heck, even the ending feels tacked-on and disjointed from the rest of the filmPLOT STUPIDITY: Including, but not limited to: if you're a vampire, you are destroyed in sunlight, period; why do you ascend a building to the top floor, only to enter a holding cell from a higher level(?); if you are hiding from Dracula, you could always run into the air vent BEHIND you, instead of huddling near the entrance; how do you take the shape of a human person out of sight of cops and bystanders when you were a different thing in the first place(??); how do you descend a building via walkways and get past scores of cops who are ascending the building at the same time without being seen; how a "UV crossbow" doesn't burn your skin from three feet away when it has the power of a sun.Bottom Line: I give this film 3 out of 10, only for the supporting cast and Ryan Reynolds' acting. The film is tripe. Save your money and rent one of the first two films instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Satisfying Conclusion to this Suckfest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The "Blade" films certainly have their fans. I like them. They are what they are. They're slick, action filled, loud, violent, and all very much convoluted fun.This time out Blade must do battle against an uber vampire which has risen from a tomb which is supposedly a descendant of Count Dracula. Dracula is joined by the group of vamps that woke him led by none other than Parker Posey. A very strange role for her, but she eats it up. No pun intended. Like the other two films, Blade needs some help and Whistler (Kris Kristofferson)is there as his right hand man. If memory serves, Whistler dies in all three movies but somehow keeps showing up. I maybe wrong about that. Blade also gets help from Whistler's daughter played by Jessica Biel and a former vampire played by Ryan Reynolds. Reynolds provides much of the comic relief.The "Blade" movies are fun. The action is always good, you'll get a few laughs. Blade: Trinity has a lot of problems with continuity though. There are gaffes all over the place and you'll be scratching your head a lot. I enjoyed this movie for what it was. Just check your brains at the door and you'll appreciate this film better. I am a little worried about Wesley Snipes career though. I hope he has something a little better than this on tap. (**1/2)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, if this is the level of intelligence of plot, dialog and camera work the average movie watcher has slumped to, then we may as well invent a time machine so that we can go back and give IL' Darwin the bird. Personally, I like computers. But when they are used to create mindless, irrelevant eye-candy such as this, then it's time to pull the plug. Pretty does not compensate for content? you need something to base the special effects on, which brings me to?Second, if you are a movie fan, then there is no new creative material in this film. This is the video equivalent to modern hip-hop music?i.e., a repetitive collection of sampled material. Instead, I recommend watching those films in which this one had borrowed so much from: The Matrix (1 and 3), Aliens, Predator and the Terminator (not surprisingly, in the beloved tradition of Hollywood, the first three of those subjects has had quite a bit of box office success recently). Even the foley work was exaggerated beyond belief?-enough so that you actually notice the silly sound effects.In short, unless you have suffered a severe head trauma and enjoy such things as the witty repartee found in your average diet pill infomercial, you are better served by a visit to your local library.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As if the first 2 were not bad enough some Hollywood idiot found it necessary to release another one. Probably to give the vacant, all-consuming-and-never-questioning public a reason to ignorantly claim that Wesley Snipes is good actor, and to prove that the dialog in the Blade movies is just as silly as he looks, as well as to prove that sequels can be just as (if not worse) than the original. With every Blade movie, they need to raise the bar with the antagonist, so expect Blade to fight Jesus Christ in the next movie. I can't believe I allowed a friend to convince me to see Blade 2 and 3. You think I would have learned after the first one.I could slam this movie all day. I could point out how predictable this movie is. I could describe plot holes large enough to launch a Space Shuttle mission through. I could insult fans of the series until my throat is raw and bloody. Yet, I'll spare you and simply conclude with: If you want to see a good movie, do yourself a favor, and don't subject yourself to this. If you feel the need to watch it, please don't expect anything more than a bad action movie. Such movies may be entertaining to others, and that's fine, but it does not change the fact that these movies are NOT art, and should NEVER be considered as such.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>CORNY! BUT IT'S GREAT!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the corniest sequels I've ever seen! Wesley Snipes did his part well in Blade:Trinity. You always hear the negatives of this movie. My only negative is that there was too much slapstick in it. Yet, the slapstick turned out to be beneficial, and with the cast there it really wasn't a bad movie after all. Ryan Reynolds who played Hannibal King, was the source of comedy relief for this movie. Kris Kristofferson looked all partied out. though he was a great father figure to Blade. However, Snipes got a little to full of himself making the movie, guess he just wanted to work a be on with himself. Luckily he didn't injure himself like he did in the second installment of Blade.Jessica Biel was the second brawn of the movie. You always having the man being the brawn of the action. She was both beautiful and dangerous. And as for Reynolds, he was more of the jester in the movie. All the references of vampire jokes, celebrities, and all the rest I heard. Triple H, the WWE sensation really flexed his muscles in this movie. He was the second jester in the movie along with the other bickering vampires, who fail to capture Blade. Saying they were caught with their pants down was hilarious, they weren't kidding about being screwed. But did they had to go hardcore about it? The fight scenes are memorable, I liked the part where King and Grimwood got it on. Especially when Grimwood power slams King. And even though Grimwood took a licking from Blade, he happened to bit more than he could chew when it comes to King. The action was great, the plot was kinda typical, but the results was great. Maybe one day, Blade would realize that he can't fight the undead all by himself. This movie was a big comeback from the second, and it has something to sink your teeth into. RATING 3 OUT OF 5 STARS. 8.5 OUT OF 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If this was the first of series there would be no sequels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I awaited this film with mild curiosity, mainly because I've heard awful things about it. When I finally saw it, all the rumors were true ? this movie is utter and total garbage. It's like it was filmed by some teenagers who were given permission and enough money to have all the fun they want. Well, it's obvious that the people allowed to desecrate this franchise, were having fun (except for Wesley Snipes who looks tired and bored), but this fun is at the expense of the audience. This movie is anything but fun. Ridiculous plot, laughable main villain, annoying supporting actors, obvious in-the-face merchandizing that even leads to one of the stupidest situations seen in a movie ? a woman listening mp3's while fighting with vampires. One of the biggest problems with this film is that it completely mistreats its main hero. He is made weak and boring. They even rob him of the obligatory love interest from the pretty girl. Jessica Biel is more interested in downloading mp3's instead of showing little care. The whole movie is one big mess that mocks at its own roots. The main villain that was supposed to be this fearsome ultimate vampire with extreme powers is reduced to someone who looks like a retarded Eastern-European drug smuggler and even has a big golden chain around his neck. I guess David Goyer was very frightened from this particular type when he visited the night clubs, while filming Blade 2 in Prague. Anyway, he's supposed to give us the chills every time when we see him, but instead of that he runs from Blade when they meet for the first time, and at one point he even serves as the thug who holds the victim while one of the villains explains what will happen to her and one of the good guys. Even the main vampire in "Underworld" was scarier comparing to him and this is something, considering that he wasn't very scary either. Everything in this movie that is at least moderately entertaining is taken from the previous two films, mainly from the first one. Well I'll stop here because this garbage doesn't deserve that much attention. Just avoid it. Good thing I didn't pay to see this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>just terrible!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was so upset after I watched this movie. The first Blade is one of my absolute favorite movies and also the second part had it's moments (particularly because of Ron Perlman), but this was just a waste of time.The story (Vampires awake the legendary Dracula to life and start another attempt to take over the world) is more than simple, but since it is based upon a comic that would not really matter to me. What matters are the performances of the actors: and they are below any level. Excemption are Kris Kristofferson (solid as always) and Ryan Reynolds(quite funny, nearly as good as Donal Logue in the first movie).But Wesley Snipes, as one of my favorite actors, disappointed me much. So cool he acted in the first two movies, so empty he is here. Instead of a Vampirehunter, he could also play a wooden stick. Jesica Beal is sexy and this is it, nothing remarkable. And the guy who played Dracula: Oh my God!? How one could dare to play a classic figure like this. All the magic of Dracula lies within his passion and nobility, in contrast to his cruelty. And here he is depicted as a stupid macho, without anything magical upon him. I went to this movie to see Blade fighting a legend, not a second class bodybuilder. But the most terrible thing about this movie, is the way Goyer directed it. I mean, he is a great writer, as you can see at other works, like The Crow, Blade 1 and Batman Begins, but as a director he is disappointing.This movie contains much too much cuts, you can't enjoy any fight, what is a total waste of potential, considering the martial arts skills of Wesley Snipes (espacially his capoeira skills are a pleasure to watch; just check out the showdown of the first Blade movie).Blade follows the same fate as such classics like The Crow and Highlander: The first movie was fantastic and just could not be topped. I really hope Snipes next movie will be more fitting to he is actual acting skills</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Major spoilers) I hated this movie. I loved the first one. I really liked the second one. I absolutely hated the third. The characterization was flat. Hannibal King did nothing for this movie. The fact Ryan Reynolds looks good without a shirt after he gained thirty pounds of muscle is no reason to cast him in what should have been a serious vampire movie. The first two had some humour but this one was over the top cheesy. Anyone who thinks Blade would not have killed Hannibal just to shut him up needs their head examined. What was up with all the wise cracks and one liners? That is not what the Blade franchise is about.I hated Parker Posey. I read a comment someone else made that said she was sexy as hell in this movie. On who's world? She was the ugliest thing I've ever seen. The over the top facial expressions and hair/wardrobe ruined any chance her character had at being a believable protagonist.Why are the Vamps at the first driving riced out imports and why is Blade's Charger pimped out all of a sudden? Gold rims and nitrous? It was a stupid thing to do to the classic black beast. American muscle, all it needs is the deep growl from a three inch exhaust and the blower on top. It didn't need the nitrous kit and bling bling. Wouldn't Blade want the car to blend in? I thought it was all about flying under the radar in the first movie. This was not supposed to be three fast, three furious.Why did the Vamps need glow-sticks? This movie had so many plot holes it would take all day and night to cover them all. The guy who played Dracula or 'Drake' wasn't convincing at all. When Snipes says he was denied the input to the script and director he was promised I feel for him. They took a successful movie franchise and turned it into an action comedy about quick, cheesy laughs and attempting to make a spin off franchise for Biel and Reynolds.On that note, slay-lists? OK, she's hunting something stronger, faster, almost silent, and certainly deadly. So she voluntarily gives up one of her senses? What a stupid character point. And on the subject of Whistler having a daughter, give me a break. He supposedly loved his wife and children so much that after their death by vampire he dedicated his life to hunting them down. But now, in the quest for 'coolness' we are asked to believe he cheated on his wife and had another child out of wedlock. The whole motivation behind Whistler is that his family is all gone, all killed by vampires. But now he has a daughter out of wedlock. And it's not even that he had her after his wife died, or before, but that he had an affair.Why were all the new vampires reapers? They eliminated the reapers in the second movie. The vampires with the jaws that split were genetically created by Damaskinos. Dracula should bite in the typical vampire way, not like a reaper. Same for Trip's dog and all the others who bit reaper style. But come to think of it Dracula does bite Parker in normal vampire mode in an extended scene.Giving this movie a two can only be justified by the fact there are some decent fight scenes and the soundtrack was good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked Blade 1, and liked Blade 2 ten times more. But this one didn't do it for me. Compared to the first two, it just does not mix. Although it appears to have its moments of enjoyment, but it fails to make sense through the rest of it. Wesley Snipes once again reprising his role, but seems to make the character less amusing this time around, I got feeling while watching this movie, that he just was not having any fun, he seems to be thinking "I wish this movie would end soon". This movie seems not to play the same level of excitement that made the first two a hit. And Ryan Reynolds pretty much steals this movie. You end up feeling, this movie is more about him then Wesley Snipes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching this film, I immediately deduced that the emphasis was on beautiful people wearing immaculate clothes. And these people were to strike a pose whenever they could, and slow motion will be used to show the viewer how cool and posey everybody was. Serious!! I felt like I was watching a fashion show or some equally vapid waste of time.Apart from this we have some spectacular fight scenes and action sequences, but these come few and far between, and in the meantime we have, you guessed it, more slow strutting and posing.Another annoying thing was Ryan Reynolds as the comic relief, his jokes were very hit and miss (mostly miss), and seemed out of place in this film.Watch only if you are easily entertained.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since Stephen Norrington's "Blade" I thought there was not going to be a better vampire action flick ever to be made in Hollywood, until Del Torro took it to a whole new level and created the amazing sequel "Blade II" that was so well crafted, well edited, and tightly told to the final climax. Del Torro stuck to the Blade character very closely, that was well defined in the first one. The ridiculous second sequel just kills the entire Blade saga from shot one. The script has so many flaws that I stopped counting after 10 minutes. The action is confusingly edited and has no rhythm whatsoever that it was painful to watch. The movie could have been less of a long Apple products commercial and more about Blade, who is hardly in the film and presented very annoyingly. The idea of Dracula was, however, the worst of all. The trailer already gives away that Blade gets captured by the vampires at one point, but they had to revive the original vampire god to kill him? Where is the sense in that? Just kill him right then and there! The same goes for the ending and the actual promise of the film, that is not concluded at all and everyone in the theater asked the same question almost immediately once the final credits came up: "But, what happened to...?" This sequel was an insult to the Blade saga, it didn't know where it was going and just exposed us to a bunch of bad jokes and bad lines while preparing us for a promised ending that didn't happen. Terrible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This was better than the first two!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Only a few times in cinema can there ever be a few franchises/trilogies that have the third film be better than the first two (STAR WARS, BACK TO THE FUTURE, SCREAM, LORD OF THE RINGS, THE MATRIX) and many times where sequels become the third film becomes the bane of the trilogy/franchise (FRIDAY THE 13th, NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, HALLOWEEN, AMITYVILLE, EXORCIST, HELLRAISER,THE GODFATHER-Part 3 sucked and you know it!). The second-and possibly final-sequel in the BLADE franchise, in my opinion, was better than the first two. First off, Blade had to grow beyond the tutelage and wisdom of his mentor/best friend/father figure Whistler, which necessitated his death. Next off, Blade had evolved into a leader, which necessitated him leading the Nightstalkers. Thirdly, what better plot point than Blade having to face off against the "father of all vampires", Dracula, whom if you look at it, was indirectly responsible for the death of Blade's mother by starting the vampire race. And fourth, in films, you sometimes need comedy to offset all of the drama, horror, and or violence. This was displayed excellently by the casting of Ryan Reynolds, who played the wiseass former vampire-turned-slayer Hannibal King. I was one of the many people in the theatre cracking up at his one-liners ("The dog's dick was bigger than yours!") and his off-the-wall insults ("You cock-juggling thundercunt!"). I also must have been one of the few people who noticed the underlying sexual tension and banter between King and his former lover Talos. And lastly, did I mention that Blade whooped everybody's ass worse in this film with even more mind-boggling, gravity defying stunts? I give this film a 9 out of ten stars.</fullReview>

Although almost all the fighting came from either the Matrix Trilogy or Resident Evil 1 or 2. And during the fights Abigail Whistler, Jessica Biel, had a silver knife in her show yet she had to hit each vampire 6 times before kicking them to ash. The comedy in this movie was HORRIBLE. I have never wanted a 'good' guy to die so badly. Hannibal King, Ryan Reynolds from Van Wilder, WAs the side-kick I wanted dead. He wasn't funny, he must have said about 100 bad one-liners. My friend and I just started to boo at the screen, no one minded enough to shut us up. And Blade, Wesley Snipes, what kind of hero is he? A man who doesn't get the girl, essentially is 'bad' and has nothing great about him. The man doesn't even get good recognition. Batman, Superman, Spiderman they all got recognition, good or bad. No powers or anything. B0O0O0O0O0O0O0O0O0O0O0O0O0O0O0O LET THIS HAVE BEEN THE LAST BLADE MOVIE E V E R ! ! ! -------------------------------------- ----------------------------------</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you are strangely intrigued by vampires, don't watch this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...because it will just about kill any fascination you might have had with them through this horribly disposable product. I never quite prepared myself for how dire this horrorshow was. The two preceding Blades had slipped my mind over the years and I just remember a haze of camp and overkill action but it wasn't a bad haze or anything. They still delivered on a basic level and the original was novelty enough to keep your interest. The third installment (and last?), Blade Trinity, is a failure of epic proportions as it isn't even attention-grabbing. Not even a little bit.This is also my main problem with this film. There are no build-ups to the action, no foreshadowing, no hinting, no calm before the storm. It just dishes out huge doses of violence galore without any motivation and this makes them lose their riveting effect and I found that I was desensitized within ten minutes of the film. Plotwise, Dracula has been awaken from the dead after centuries of slumber and now Blade must stop him with the help of two vampire-hunters (played by collagen-Biel and failed comedian Reynolds).I'm serious, that is really the plot. Dracula has been awaken and wants to kick some ass. You just have to marvel at the innovative minds of these high-paid filmmakers. Wesley Snipes' character as the stone-cold vampire-slayer Blade has gone through no emotional development during the film trilogy - he is still detached and static and to create a comic effect, this is juxtaposed with Ryan Reynolds' campy misplaced one-liners. They are opposites in this film, and it seems as though they expect us to find this really funny as it attempts nothing else.I know sheer camp entertainment value when I see it, and this is not it because it isn't an amusing film. Oh, I nearly forgot: Parker Posey. Worst actress I have ever seen. Her overacting as 'sexy vixen vampire' will actually wound you.2/10</fullReview>

I was hooked, the action was awesome, the storyline was great and I couldn't even imagine how Stephen Norrington took a comic-book character seem more kick ass. Then Blade 2 came out, U don't even want to know how beautiful that was. The storyline was even better, the new sets of character, Blade looking even more kick ass, and the action was just breathless. I had to give Guillermo del Toro so much applauses for that.When i went to buy tickets for blade trinity, I was waiting for a long time for the third installment to own all the other blade movies. When I sat in that chair watching blade trinity, I almost wanted to vomit because of how retarded the third movie was. Let me explain why.The Story Line: This had to be one of the most kicked ass storyline I've ever heard, the vampire nation or whatsoever wanted to bring back Dracula to kick blade's ass and so on.Characters: The characters that were introduced here were just so not blade movie material, I mean what was David S. Loser thinking. U got a blind women who could read computers WTF. U got side characters who are mostly worthless in the movie. Abigail Whistler: Yeah she's hott but dude when watching that movie u got more of a lap dance then what the hell what was happening in the movie. She got a gigantic laser freakin weapon that is so ridicoulus. I mean she was just x-rated. I could go on how stupid and worthless she was during the whole film.Hannibal King: This character was so retarded, yeah he brought laughs but dude he got so annoying after like 15 minutes of the film. I mean this was another character who should remain back in the dumpster. Worthless and pathetic like Abigail Whistler.Blade: I was so disappointed on how David S. Loser made blade in this film. Like dude, blade's character was so F*****G weak in this film. He didn't have that blade material that he brought to the first and second blade. It felt like he was standing down and letting Jessica Biel And Ryan Reynolds take all the spot light. Blade was so poorly brought to this crappy installment.Action: Sucks Ass, not worth looking at, looks like u could do on ur back yard. Coolest scene was when he jumped from the building, that was it. Every other action scene sucked ass.Director: David S. Loser, he's like king of all douches. He made it even worse by making a show. What a retard. He should not even direct movies anymore. I could go on about how dumb this movie was but I'm going to bed so peace.</fullReview>

Wesley Snipes should be ashamed to have been in this Trinity movie alongside Ryan Reynolds (who had more obvious one liners in this movie than I could imagine existed, not one of them being the least bit funny) and Jessica Biel (another female in a long line of female actors who ruin action movies with bad acting, there are plenty female actors who have made action movies incredible, just not in this case). I could not believe how many horribly scripted/filmed fight scenes and obvious product placement existed in this movie. Listening to MP3s on your iPod during fight scenes, PITIFUL. Cliché dork that loves making weird weapons and the following "getting laid" comment from "cool guy" vampire hunter (thats Ryan Reynolds), PITIFUL. Bad girl vampire, I am not even going to bother looking up what actress played her, she is quite possibly the most horrible looking actress I have laid eyes on.

		<fullReview>This movie assumes that its audience will think its "cool"... it isn't. Obviously aimed at impressionable youth, the makers have a low estimation of the people they expect to watch it, including a particularly patronising pause for an iPod product placement. But they obviously know more than me, the IMDb rating is a ridiculously high 5.7 as I write.About the only reason you may want to watch is if you hold a candle for one of the actors. The fighting is "poser grade B" with lots of punching while looking the opposite way. A minor hero enjoys his torture with a few "poser quips", mind you, the villains are so forgettable you can understand why he wouldn't take it seriously.The movie has no mood, atmosphere or detail, and feels bland, like the light industrial estate it appears to have been shot at.</fullReview>

The FBI arrests Blade, and the Nightstalkers, an anti-vampire group leaded by Abigail Whistler (Jessica Biel) saves him. Together with Hannibal King (Ryan Reynolds), the trio faces the vampires and the powerful Drake."Blade: Trinity" is a reasonable entertainment, indicated for fans of action movies. There are lots of explosions, car chase, shootings and the usual scenes of this type of film, sometimes looking like a MTV video clip. The first two movies of Blade are better and better, and I personally found this third sequel a little boring. The reference to Iraq, where evil is hiding below the sands of the desert, is terrible. Wesley Snipes is horrible in the role of Blade; Hannibal King, performed by the ham actor Ryan Reynolds, has many unfunny jokes; and the best role and parts of the movie belong to the character of Abigail Whistler.

		<shortDescription>The difficult third instalment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Blade: Trinity' was always going to be in trouble, mainly because Blade 1 and 2 were just so damn good. Part II was considered (by some) to be that rarest of beasts which is a sequel that even goes so far as to surpass the original. Therefore the third instalment really had its work cut out to try and go yet one step further.It tried. It failed. However, that doesn't mean it's completely bad. It's actually quite a fun film. The concept is good for a start: Blade vs Dracula. What more could you want? Well, probably a bit more of Blade and Dracula and less of the cast of Scooby Doo 'helping' Blade slay vampires.Part 3's 'big idea' was to simply add more cast members. And, to help sell the Blade franchise to a younger audience, the new cast members were all youngsters (hence my 'Scooby Doo comment'). Suddenly, Blade is less about the man himself and more of a 'teen slasher' where the young, good-looking cast-members are gradually being picked off one by one.However, it's certainly not all bad. There are some nice special effects with plenty of dead vampires to keep us Slayers happy. The new weapons are neat and some of the baddies - despite being pretty 'comic-book-esque' are quite enjoyable (Parker Posey).Someone described it as 'straight to video;' it's certainly not that, but if you've seen parts one and two, just lower your expectations slightly and you should find it a fun little outing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I base this upon the Extreme Version DVD, that adds ten minutes, and is unrated. Is this hip? Pretty please? If it tries really, really hard? No, because when you're doing this much(particularly noticeably in the dialog, seriously, does anyone actually *talk* like that? And almost everyone behaves in a "street" kind of way, it's over the top) to achieve such a status, you ruin almost any chance you ever had at earning it. The tone, this time, is one of painful immaturity. I wish I was kidding, believe me, but there are frankly cringe-inducing bits. The acting varies. Biel is marvelous. Posey is weird and off-beat, intentionally so. Snipes remains comfortable in the role, if he let's somewhat loose in this, and it feels out of place(I don't blame him, however). Reynolds is essentially playing the Van Wilder type and adding martial arts(meanwhile, he's not bad at the latter), and I suppose it's up to the individual if you find him funny. In any case, I do think it excessive how every single thing he says is a one-liner. And on the subject of things there are more of than what's good, let's talk action. There's a tendency in big screen efforts as of around the year this came out to, when doing sequences like that, have so much of it that the audience numbs to it and it ceases to affect us(also messing up the pacing), and/or the heroes show so little fear/a high level of control in the situations that there is no threat. It's not always that both are present, sometimes it's just one or the other... not with this, though, it goes for the whole thing. You simply aren't that excited during this, in spite of how well-choreographed and relatively well-shot the shooting and fights are. The cinematography and editing are mixed, with some rather underwhelming stuff at its worst. Slow-motion in this seldom works out well. This extended release holds additional character development, which is welcome, and is a pretty positive aspect of this overall. Plot reuses ideas from the earlier entries in this series. The script could be better. I don't know where or when it went wrong, or why it snowballed the way it sadly did. Things that could be excised with no change to the whole. A couple of occurrences have you question the point, the reason for what's going on, and there aren't answers, at least in the film. There are dramatic moments and interesting things, if kinda few. They got a little design-crazy here. I do grant that the new weapons are bad-ass. Back to the cast... Triple H is fine, not the best wrestler I've seen on the big screen. Purcell, I'm sorry, I like the guy, he's cool, and definitely intense, with that said... he does not have the charisma that Dorff did, and he does come out looking like a supermodel or a Latino dancer, not always conveying a lot of menace. The effects are well-done. There is constant strong language, plenty of violence and several sexual references, mainly spoken. On the discs are the two cuts of the flick, a documentary I will review on its own page, an alternate ending, a featurette that's Goyer interviewing himself(it is sort of cute, and it isn't solely the joke of it), photo galleries, a teaser as well as a theatrical trailer for the movie, promos for other ones, a hilarious blooper reel and two commentary tracks, David's on them, and he's joined by Ryan/Jessica or producers and crew, and either way, it's entertaining and informative. Perhaps this did have potential... it should have been left with a director who had a greater amount of experience(no, I'm not giving up on him on account of this). I recommend this to those who wish to watch all of the franchise, and those who are easy to please and/or want something non-committal and uncomplicated. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>so blade is wanted by the FBI. why? cuz he was framed... kinda. he meant to kill a vampire, only to find it was a human disguised as a vampire. some women gets the whole scenario on tape and now the FBI is after him... for ONE murder.whistler (blade's partner) is chewing him out, telling him that killing humans is messy and careless. cuz dead humans leave corpses behind, and vampires burn away into ash. so what? i saw blade kill humans by the truckload in the first movie. vampires have human servants called "familiars," that run around during the day, doing all their dirty work for them. sometimes blade runs into them and fills them full of holes, and nobody ever cared about it... until now for some reason.a little later in the movie, after they apprehend blade, an FBI agent mentions how he's wanted for a laundry list of federal crimes. what laundry list? they didn't care about him until his ONE recent murder.but that's not the worst part, that's just petty annoyance. the biggest complaint i have about this movie is the comic relief. this movie is full of it, for some reason. i don't know if it's the delivery or the lines, but it's pretty tacky and uncongenial. ryan reynolds and patten oswalt act like a couple of signature comedians, telling their cheesy jokes, while blade stands there and looks at them funny. it's pretty cliché.a lot of people complain about blade: trinity, and rightly so. although, it's not as bad as lost boys: the tribe. boy, did that movie suck.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not a huge fan of the Blade series. After the innovative opening fight scene in the original Blade there's not much to recommend, unless you like your action movies loud and stupid. Blade III is the worst of the bunch?a disastrous combination of MTV-style cinematography and horrible writing. Not to mention Ryan Reynolds?dear Lord did I want to see him get butchered in some fashion. The filmmakers were obviously trying to attract a young audience with the addition of hunky Reynolds and the hot Jessica Biel. Neither of them comes off well here. Reynolds's profane snark gets old after about two minutes; Biel's beautiful but doesn't have the chops to pull off a "dark" role like this. So she's "edgy" cuz she downloads trip-hop onto her iPod before a fight? Yes, there's not one but two scenes of Jessica futzing with her iPod. The film is filled with this kind of heavy-handed pandering toward moody teenage My Chemical Romance fans with black-and-purple bordered MySpace pages. Even Dracula, the main villain this go- round, looks like a douchey Eurotrash model when he's in human form. The Blade series has always been a bit cold and sterile ¬? part three is just plain bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable but disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Blade movies have always had great action, with a decent storyline to follow. And while it was a comic book adaption, Blade was one of the first comic book movies to take it's source material seriously.Blade Trinity is an enjoyable movie that ends up to be a little disappointing. The final movie in the Blade trilogy brings up some very interesting story elements, but not enough time was put into developing the story and making it as good as it could be. In addition, while the first two movies geared toward an older audience, this movie clearly gears itself to the young teenage crowd, despite the R rating, for example, here are too many clichés in the movie, everything from the villains telling the "hero" their plan, to one liners that are just too cheesy for anyone to repeat. Plus the movie had too much humor compared to the previous movies. The villains in the third movie are not as menacing or as interesting as the first two movies either.If the writers of this movie had just taken a little more time in developing the story and character development, this could have been the best in the series, but instead we're left with a movie that ends up being less then it could have.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This sequel did not have to happen, but it did any way so might as well get over it. The PROS: Tons of action scenes, some funny humor.The CONS: Jessica Biel, Whistler dies again, weak villains, way too much cursing that's not even played for laughs, limited appeal, iPod advertising, questionable stuff happens during the credits ( annoying rap music plays and what the heck is "WORD" supposed to mean? )So as you can see, the Cons heavily outweigh the Pros and David S. Goyer ( writer/producer for BLADE I &amp; II, Batman Begins, and DARK CITY ) obviously wasn't ready to direct an installment in his entire franchise.This is probably more of a "party" type of movie where everyone gets together, has a couple of beverages and sits down and watches. And when you get bored, you go into to the other room and do something else.Recommended to die-hard fans of the first two and people who love fantasy/horror films w/ Dragula in them.</fullReview>

Her character was annoying, and her performance was criminal. Secondarily, Triple H added NOTHING to this production. The theatrical version of this work was just dismal.However.The unrated director's cut DVD release went a far way towards redeeming this muck.The theatrical version? It rates a 3.6/10.

		<shortDescription>The blade has been sharpened</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of the three Blades that have been released, this one is my favorite. First of all, I like that all of the Blades are raunchy, dark, unclean, rated "R", and a more probable representation of vampire life instead of the clean suave version I so often see. But "Blade Trinity" outdid the rest by adding a team. I like the addition of Abigail Whistler (Jessica Biel) and especially the humor of Hannibal King (Ryan Reynolds). This version was spiced up a bit with more laughs and more gadgets. Now that Blade had a team that also meant he had more brains to work on different gadgets, weapons, plans, etc. I also liked the nemesis in "Blade Trinity". Instead of mutated vampires as in parts one and two, they went with the old, the original, the first of all the vampires... Drake (Dominic Purcell). This Blade was definitely an improvement.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has some good moments, but they are far outnumbered by the ones that make you cringe.Namely the incredibly painful product ipod product placement - "Oh, she likes to listen to MP3's while battling vampires!" - any sense of immersion in a film is ripped away in a giant moment of "WTF??" Others: The "honorable warrior" dude seems like a rather nice fellow, really. They talked about 'Dracula' being in the film, but I never saw him. Sarcasm aside, for Dracula, he radiates about as much evil as a bunny rabbit. He doesn't come off as terribly bloodthirsty or vile, and truth be told, does nothing to indicate he's anything out of the ordinary aside from perhaps being stronger than your average bear, er, I mean, vampire.The rest of the vampires are literally forgettable. They have nothing to distinguish themselves from one another and simply blur together. They don't come off as terribly evil, and when they're getting their rear ends handed to them by some generic humans, you have to try to recall what advantages vampires had in the first place. It certainly wasn't being stronger or faster than a regular human, because there was no evidence of that.The actors are all nice enough, and it seems like they try, though they don't succeed, and most of the fault for that lies in the source material.Very much a take it or leave it film with zero value in repeat viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a film Blade:Trinity has many strengths but also many weaknesses. I feel it's strengths lie in the characterisation of the principal villains, Drake played by Dominic Purcell and Dania Talos, played by Parker Posey. Posey is absolutely wonderful. Her acting is sensational. She has some great dialogue which she delivers with great relish. The ultimate femme-fatale. You totally believe she is pure evil as all great vampires should be! There are some great action sequences including the car chase at the beginning and the sword fight between Blade and Drake at the end. The sword fight is fluid and is at least on par with that of Blade and Frost in the first film. Another of the film's great strengths is its soundtrack. It enhances the action ten-fold. Wesley Snipes is again the ultimate Blade. It was the part he was born to play! Dominic Purcell also gives a commanding performance as Drake aka Dracula, especially in the final battle. I like it because it is completely different from the stereotypical portrayal of Dracula but still seems to work. Unfortunately I feel he is underused though in the film. He is a good Dracula but he could have been great. We just don't see enough of him on screen to make a better assessment. The other heroes are all likable with Jessica Biel standing out the most! Not only is she a 'hottie' as stated in the film itself but she kicks some serious bottom! In conclusion, there is some great stuff here. It is a action-packed vampire fest for sure. If only we saw more of the Vampire King himself!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, this movie bites. It's very bad and in all honesty, very tough to enjoy. This one got so many things wrong that it's hard to know where to begin. It has a few things going for it but not enough to save it from being the painful stake through the heart of a pretty decent series that it is. Compared to the first two, this movie is just flat-out, grade-A garbage.(NOTE: Looking over my review of Blade 2, I realize that I trashed the film upon my initial viewing but have since grown to appreciate it greatly. Hopefully my words won't come off as hypocritical.) For starters, the villains in this piece are completely uninteresting. I do like Parker Posey but she could've been handled a little better. Dracula as the villain could have been an interesting thing but it just doesn't work here. He wasn't really threatening and in comparison to the villains from the first two films, he just doesn't cut it. And Triple H? Excuse me while I go to the bathroom.Wesley Snipes is clearly bored and phones in his performance with all the zeal of a guy serving time in prison. He does dispatch a couple of people in particularly brutal ways, like when he interrogates a guy by dangling him over a rooftop and then lets him drop but in the end, Blade just looks like he'd rather be somewhere else.To add insult to injury, they wipe Whistler off the map in a pretty unceremonious manner to make room for the Nightstalkers, who get ripped apart themselves two thirds into the film. Why Whistler would want to hide this wonderful squad of geniuses from Blade is beyond me but that's just one plot hole among many. There are moments of sheer stupidity in this film that will leave you staring at the screen in awe. Awe of how ridiculous it all is and at how easy the thought of slitting your wrists can come to you. My favorite moment is when Blade and his rescuers (who I'll get to in a moment) are surrounded in front of the police precinct by a good number of cops with guns drawn and one of the Nightstalkers drives up nonchalantly in a station wagon and they jump in and manage to escape.I mentioned Blade's rescuers and it's here that I think the biggest problem with the movie lies. Abigail Whistler, Whistler's illegitimate daughter and her buddy Hannibal King show up as Blade's new partners and I'm sorry to say it but they are the ones jumping up and down on the grave of this film. You get the sense that the future of the series lies with these two and you know what? They won't be getting my ten bucks, that's for sure.Jessica Biel is nice to look at but a ridiculous character to have in this film. You need an example? I mean, product placement not withstanding, the girl listens to her iPod while kicking vampire ass. Think about it for a moment. Thank you, I rest my case.As for Ryan Reynolds, I think he can be pretty funny. In this movie as Hannibal King, he is just annoying. Not fun annoying but more painful annoying. About 99% of what comes out of his mouth are smart ass remarks and there are moments where Snipes looks like he's going to slap the guy for real. I'll give Reynolds props for getting in shape for the role because he certainly looks the part but really, after a while, I was just hoping someone would execute him.In the end, I guess I'm a bit sad to say that David Goyer, who wrote all three and directed this dreck, is the one responsible for the outcome. His direction is pretty flat, the action scenes aren't particularly exciting (the best part in the entire film is when Blade chases Dracula in a scene similar to the Keanu Reeves/ Patrick Swayze chase in "Point Break") and giving the Nightstalkers that much screen time was just a bad, bad move. A Blade movie where Blade feels like a secondary character is pretty corny.This should've been a good entry in the series and is just little more than the death bell.RATING * and a 1/2 out of *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I apologise terribly in front of the fans, but if Wesley Snipes is the embodiment of "badass cool", then I am a Santa Clause.I have never expected such a drone performance from Wesley Snipes, but after watching Blade 1 through 3, I have lost all respect for the actor. It seemed to me like he could hardly care less and put in less effort than he did.The only reason I watched all three movies is because I have rented the first two at once (I would rank 1st as worst, 2nd marginally better, and 3rd slightly better still, exactly because there was less of Wesley Snipes to look at), and then I had to torture myself with the third one (again, the most enjoyable out of the three), just to find out what happens next.Ryan Reynolds, on the other hand, I liked from Two Guys and a Girl, and he seemed to make the whole movie not as bad as it otherwise would have been.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay,Blade is already out in DVD,and STARZ is repeating it like one hundred times a month,but some people still want to know if they can rent it or not,well let's see.The first film was bloody,violent,deep with great story and a very good performance by Wesley.The second one was a little bit more bloody,which is VERY good,but the other vampires with stupid names and stupid outfits ruined this film,but not enough,so it was a VERY good film that surely pleased every fan of the series.But then they released this film which looks like a Scary Movie parody of Blade.The film was n't so bloody,and the daylight scenes killed the environment of Blade completely.Having Blade dealing with a group of computer geeks and amateurs killers with no special power at all reduced the impact of Blade,but Wesley did a good job keeping his bad attitude.Why it reduces his impact?,if Blade is so great and strong,why does he need their help?,they should have put him with a better crew,or just by himself with a defenseless woman or something like that,but the additional characters and "computer geeks" did not work at all,they just have few dialogs explaining how everything works bla bla bla,they are definitely unnecessary characters.Then the bad guy is a good-looking Dracula,you know what people usually call "pretty boy" pretending to brake the concept that movies like "Van Helsing" has been doing for decades.But,in their intent to be original they also took away from Dracula or "Drake" all the impact he could have with some people,because this character has been so exploded even in comedy films and it sometimes gets cheesy.Dracula does NOTHING in this film NOTHING!!!!!!,when he appears walking in the streets the music they play IS HORRIBLE!!!,definitely not suitable for the kind of character that they want us to believe Dracula is,UGH!.Dracula little speech about vampires and people not living by the honor of the sword is HORRIBLE,why would he care about that?,but at least he does n't seem to take it seriously,but it is stupid.Here Dracula can change his form,I'm surprised that he did not change his form to Godzilla.The final battle between Blade and Dracula completely sucks,it takes place in the wrong environment and his transformation is HORRIBLE and it does not have any sense.It would have been better adding a original character of their own than this pop star.Dracula did n't have the chance to show why he means a great menace,then you wonder why Blade needed the help of computer geeks and the very STUPID jokes of Reynolds that surely kills the essence of the series.The daughter of the old man was not a bad idea,but hers dilemma about following hers dad steps just cant work with this type of movie.Then yeah,they ruined Blade.I really liked Parker Posey,hers character was a very good idea,but not enough,and Triple H (Paul Levesque)and his little doggy was also unnecessary.If you are a hardcore fan of Blade you may be very disappointed.</fullReview>

Blade hardly got to fight and when he did King and Abby butted in taking it away. Blade can look after himself. Hes defeated Deacon and the Reapers but all of a sudden he now needs help. When hes captured thats not his style. OK i admit his father figure just blew himself and the warehouse up but I wouldn't allow to get my self captured. He did it so Blade could get away but they have him getting easily captured. And the thing with the badges. Thats just sad. The director of this seriously needs to watch/re-watch Blade 1 and 2 to see how Blade goes. He tried to get Blade to have a sense of humour this time after the police chief says the vamps will kill him if he tells about blood farming facility. I say either end it there or make a Blade 4 and let him redeem himself as the vamp ass kicker we know!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So rarely is a trilogy able to feature a set of movies, each one superb. Blade 3 captures the same amount of greatness that the previous two films delivered, and concludes the series very nicely.The action scenes were great. Blade kicks ass, as usual. Massive vampire death never gets old, at least not in my opinion. Snipes, of course, had the best action sequences, but I also felt that wrestler Triple H's character had some fantastic fight scenes as well. All of the action was rather fast-paced and kept me well entertained.The acting was well done, too. Everybody involved had a decent performance. I don't care much for Ryan Reynolds, but his character was the "witty warrior" stereotype, so he didn't bother me that much. If he would have tried to be all serious, it would have just been stupid, as we'll never be able to take that guy seriously.Speaking of, Reynolds' character was the only slight downfall of the movie. I mean, he didn't bother me all that bad, but his jokes weren't really that funny, and he cracked them way too often. Every other line of dialogue from Reynolds was an unfunny one-liner, and that kind of got old rather quickly. But, everything else that was going on still kept my attention and distracted me from Reynolds' horrible comedy performance.So, despite several failed attempts at comic relief from Ryan Reynolds' character, Blade 3 is a fantastic film. It's very well worth your money to see, especially if you're a Blade fan, or if you're just in the mood to see some top notch vampire battles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deliciously Silly Sequel: Laughter Returns to the Comic Books!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>BLADE-TRINITY is a fantastical ride of a movie that even those of us fatigued by the larger-than-life comic book hero flicks literally poured out weekly onto the hungry theater big screens can tolerate. The production values make the most of clever weird appliances and nasty structural situations that defy reason: the animation (vampire Pomeranian dogs, transformation costumes for Dracula AKA Drake, conflagration disintegration of human bodies by the silver tip, human blood farms, endless variations on the vampire denture appliances, etc) is entertaining as is the copycat choreography from the CTHD ilk of films.The cast of characters has broadened, some with bit parts played by big names, others by naughty funny parts played by newcomers. Wesley Snipes has little acting to do as Blade, the daytripper semiVampire, but his presence is strong. Kris Kristofferson was plugged into the story as a non-additive cameo with Jessica Biel as his daughter, the one who leads the Blade Aides, Parker Posey is given a tour de force role as a really bad Vampirette, and yet another fine Australian import Dominic Purcell makes a handsome Drake/Dracula. But for the new viewers some of the best parts of this entertaining blood bath enter in the form of Ryan Reynolds as Hannibal King, a hunky, buff grossly under used actor with a keen sense of comic timing who can bring script lines alive with his delivery and light up the screen every time he is given the chance. This comedic touch, a tongue in cheek approach to the silly story, is taken up by all the characters but with less successful effect. Reynolds just makes it work! You gotta be in the mood for this kind of film, but at last here is a comic book scary hero movie that is full of entertaining laughs - and that is somewhat of a first!

		<shortDescription>A poor ending for an otherwise entertaining franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The ball was certainly dropped for this movie and the blame lays squarely at the feet of David Goyer, the very man who reinvented the character of Blade and made him such a success. The first two blade films struck the right tone, a cool menacing atmosphere, exciting pacing, action packed sequences, gore and characters you could root for - this movie has none of these things! Wesley Snipes IS Blade, it was a role he obviously relished and totally owned so to find him shunted to the sidelines as two new younger characters are given the attention is criminal and the main downfall of the film. Not only are they totally unnecessary to proceedings but Ryan Reynolds and Jessica Biel's characters are also incredibly annoying and unlikeable. There are too many unfunny over the top wise cracks from Reynolds to mention, he ruins any kind of tension, Biel mean while severely undermines the back story of Whistler and is so devoid of personality you wonder why she gets any screen time at all. Whereas the previous Blade films had some memorable scene stealing bad guys Trinity is badly let down on that front, Dracula who is the King vampire isn't scary in the least and the guy playing him should be a background heavy not one of the main actors. The other various bad guys are forgettable and offer no real danger to the hero's. Trinity is a toothless movie, potentially with a few rewrites and a more capable director it could have been a worthy addition to the franchise but unfortunately that didn't happen. It has no distinctive style and even the blood letting is scaled down significantly! Anyone hoping the action will make up for it will be disappointed, the fight scenes are badly handled - uninspired and choppily edited, whilst the product placement is blatant and crass! All in all one must feel sorry for Snipes for having his most famous character ripped away from him so unceremoniously, Blade deserved to go out with a much bigger bang.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally Blade Trinity!!!!!!!!!!!!! But wait.....it sucks.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In spite of the meagre 5 out of 10 I have given for Blade Trinity, I want to say that I am a huge fan of the Blade Saga. So huge in fact that I feel I can dare to say that Blade 2 is my favourite film of all time on the grounds that I can watch it over and over again with the same massive enjoyment each time.But Blade Trinity disappointed me so much. I remember waiting eagerly for its release, my excitement rising to fever pitch when I heard that he was battling the prince of darkness himself, Dracula. In addition, being an avid fan of wrestling, the presence of Triple H in the movie served only to make me even more enthusiastic to see it. I remember dragging my best friends at university across London running all the way from Tottenham Court Road, all the way down Oxford Street to Edgware Road in London to be there in time for the preview after lectures. So tired and wet we flopped down in the auditorium waiting for the highly anticipated BT.AND IT SUCKED! The crescendo that I was expecting at the end of a three film build up fell completely flat. Snipes as Blade had been fantastic in the prior two films but in BT he was upstaged by Ryan Renolds and his plethora of major league insults for the vampires holding him captive. And if the use of the insult 'thunderc**t' was the highlight of the film for me then may the lord help the film because only at that one point in the film did my heart rate go above normal as even with my disappointment mounting up, I couldn't help laughing.Blade was, I admit, coming out with some classic comments and put downs but that is only one dimension to his character. The other is quite simply kicking ass and he just didn't do enough of it. So much of the film was dialogue and while I am not going to say that this it was bad, it just doesn't get you on the edge of your seat like the kind of action scene one comes to expect in Blade. And when the action scenes did come, which were few and far between they were, in comparison to the first and second film, lacklustre and devoid of emotion. In those Blade openly expressed his enjoyment and primal rage and it really added substance to the fight scenes. In BT however, Blade was expressionless and looked as if he would rather be kicking back and smoking a joint than actually doing any fighting.Then there are the other characters, who with the exception of Ryan Renolds were appalling. The goth female vampire with fangs in her wot-sit was, just like the female terminator in T3, not remotely threatening. Now I'm not saying all female villains are akin to the big bad wolf - the girls in 'The Grudge' and in 'The Ring' were plenty scary - but saying that in this instance when you have a character who has tackled a vampire God and the super dangerous Nomak he's hardly going to have any problems with vampire who has to perform a sex act to get her fangs into Blade.Triple H, who in the wrestling world is widely considered to be the top 'heel' (bad guy) the business has ever seen was given so little to play with that his character came across ridiculously bland. His lines comprised of growling and the occasional curse and every time he got into a fight with Blade, he was disposed of so quickly that it seemed as if he was strongly allergic to him. This is the 10 time Heavyweight champion for Pete's sake! If there ever was a person who could have been presented as a major opponent of Blade it was Triple H. Sadly this opportunity was wasted.The supposed major opponent was Dracula. Now I'm sure I was not alone when I was expecting a vampire of epic strength and proportions and I'm sure I'm not the only one who was deflated when what we were presented with what looked like Phil Mitchell's long lost brother (Phil Mitchell is an balding, overweight 'hardman' from a show in the UK called Eastenders for those who don't know). Dracula looked more like an Eastender who had just come out of a pub then the most vicious vampire who had been in slumber for a thousand years. And what really drove the proverbial stake into the heart of this character was that he was beaten more easily than both of the prior villains and he was supposed to be the lord of all vampires. Yeah right.Once again, a highly popular and brilliant series of films has been ruined by a third film that was made with only one thing in mind: profits on the back of the second one. (Matrix Revolutions anyone?) It really annoys me beyond belief when money comes before art. Now I'm not naive enough to think that profits don't matter. They do. But if you make something that is worth watching and does all the prior work justice, a celluloid legacy is created. This means not only do people who aren't fans go to watch the film on the back of what those who have seen it say but it ensures long term sales as it goes down as a classic. Unfortuanatly this situation has not come about and my favourite series of all time has been ruined by a film that does neither the actors, the prior films, and the character of Blade any justice.Thank you for reading.

		<shortDescription>Better the the second, not as good as the first.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 2 Hollywood rules of sequels is that (a) they are never as good as the first, and (b) they get progressively worse the more sequels they make. This movie defies the second rule by a mile.Blade Two had only good elements. The fight scenes and Whistler. Everything else was weak and boring and uninspired. Trinity on the other hand, had a lot of good elements.Spoilers coming: It was sad for me that Whistler died, though I'm glad that he went out a hero. He was my favorite character in both the other movies. And he remains my favorite character in this one, despite how little time there is.Go Jessica Biel for shedding her teen queen image. She's not the best actress of her generation, but it's nice to know she can rise above her past career of 7th Heaven and Summer Catch.Natasha Lyonne was really terrific in her role. It was a good part played by a good actress.Ryan Reynolds comedy is awesome as usual, he made me laugh quite a few times. But what I liked even better was how his character was used. It's so common to see a damsel in distress in these types of movies that I love it when the main victim is a guy. Seeing Hannibal first held hostage by Drake, and then later kidnapped by Danica when everyone else was murdered really helped make the movie for me. And Ryan combined his humor with just the right amount of fear and apprehension. It was nice to know that a strong man and fighter could be used either as bait or as a shield, and I loved how he acted in each of those scenes.I only had two real problems with the movie. The kid was not needed and was slightly annoying, and I typically like kids. Maybe if the vampires had never found her, she would have been okay for me. But her lack of fear and calling Drake the Gnome King was a bit much.My other problems were the villains. They were not scary at all. Stephen Dorff as Deacon Frost in the first movie was astonishing and wonderful. No one can measure up to that, but I feel like they didn't even try here.Not as good as the first movie, sequels almost NEVER are. But far better then the second, and a real good time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, hearing that this movie was terrible is a huge disappointment! i don't understand why you would say it was horrible! in my opion, and many others whom i've seen it with agree, Trinity is the best Blade installment. It had the right amount of action in it, the bad guy was totally bad a$$ as always, the techno soundtrack didn't disappoint, had a cast that fit perfectly, had more comedy than the others, had more blood than 1 and 2, and had the SPX to perfect this film. All around i just feel as though this was a great movie, and ousted the other installments. Of course i understand that there was the new director, but who gives? i mean, Goyer wrote both 1 and 2! so i think there is no reason to fret about the new director, although, granted, del Toro did a great job on number 2 and probably would've made a better director. oh well, it doesn't matter, the film turned out great and thats all i have to say.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>10 Good Things About Blade 3</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had no hopes about this one, but it went below every expectation I had. But still here are 10 good and bad things about B3+'s 1. The main villain was Dracula 2. Dracula was played by non-American 3. J. Biels bow was cool. ( The actual hunting-bow, not the ridiculous "solar" junk. 4. Vampire's death-effects were pretty decent. 5. Kris Kristofferson 6. David Hasselhoff is mentioned. 7. Dracula checking out the merchandise made about him in the Halloween store.OK, this is honestly as far as I can go.There simply isn't more!!Then to the -'s1. Dracula's actor is totally uncharismatic! 2. JESSICA BIEL!!!! 3. Biel's "hunterplaylist". This has to be the dumbest thing I've seen in vampire films. Or films in general. 4. Reference to number 3 in the "+" -list. That solar-bow contraption was simply stupid. "Half as hot as the sun!" 5. All the Biels fight sequences. She is not a physical actress. Or not even an actress in my opinion. 6. Goyer! He makes OK-scripts, but when he directs like s**t, all hope is lost. He should get together with Lucas. They have the same amount of talent. 7. Anti-vampire injection! 8. Whistler says:"You can't go on killing humans." And then he murders about 20 police officers with a shotgun. 9. All the fight scenes. 10. "Humour". Well then, compared to some other films this is not complete thrash but pretty close. No 4th one, please.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Addlebrained Triumph of Style over Substance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You can always spot a dumbed down popcorn movie just on style -- lots of pointless slowmo, lots of montages and closeups of ooh, a sword going into a sheath etc. etc. And Blade Trinity has all that. It also features the ultimate sign that a vampire franchise is headed downhill -- resorting to a Dracula plot (as well as the now none too fresh virus angle), and a none too exciting Dracula at that.But all of that might have been survivable -- maybe -- if the movie at least took the time to think about its plot, its characters, the damn rules that the earlier movies had laid down -- just anything except stupid flash and dash sequences which are nifty for 1 minute, keep your attention for 2, but bore you to tears after 5 minutes of padded silliness with a predetermined outcome. Just big budget filler after awhile trying to disguise the lack of anything substantial underneath. You can give a crappy director a big budget, but he's still just as crappy. And you can fool a few fanboys into coming to your movie because it bears the name of its far superior predecessors, but once word spreads, your garbage has no legs. And so Blade Trinity in all likelihood turns into the franchise killer -- the point where the franchise just completely runs out of fresh ideas or fans willing to sit through thoughtless drivel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not good, not terrible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Judging by what people have been saying about it, Blade Trinity should be one of the worst movies of the year. I don't think it's that bad. The story itself is entirely on par with the ones in the previous movies, and some of the production values are good. Jessica Biel is certainly hot, although she doesn't have that much to do. Ryan Reynolds is, unfortunately, an insufferable jerk whose idiotic jokes and foul language completely ruin the mood of the movie. Too bad, because Hannibal King is not a bad character, and Ryan Reynolds certainly looks the part. An amazingly built body, and I liked the beard.The storyline, with the return of "Drake", was cool enough, and the guy who played him did a decent job.Some of the SFX were not believable, and I do think parts of the plot were contrived. Natasha Lyonne seemed out of place. Although I did like the idea of Whistler having taken all these precautions to help Blade in the war against vampires.The ending was a bit weird - why would Blade need to "sleep until he was needed again"? Weren't the vampires all wiped out? Doesn't seem likely that they would come back. And what's more, doesn't seem likely that there's gonna be a fourth movie...My rating: 5 out of 10. Personally I liked Blade II the best. Trinity really only qualifies for a 4 rating, but Jessica Biel's hotness gives it that extra upward nudge...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ryan Reynolds must die!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Blade: Trinity" is the third film of the Blade franchise, and this time Blade (Snipes) has to deal with the death of Whistler (Kristofferson), his longtime mentor and father figure, the arrival of a new bunch of cohorts, the two main ones being Abigail, (Biel) Whistler's daughter, (yes, I chuckled when I wrote that) and the other, Hannibal King (Reynolds). Together, the three must find, fight and kill Drake, (Purcell) who is Dracula, the "perfect vampire", who has been dug up by Danica Talos (Posey) in a bid to kill Blade, et al so that vampires can finally take over.First of all, I really enjoyed the first two "Blade" movies; despite the fact that I didn't think I would have any interest in them. They both were stylish, had great action sequences, and the characters were, as a whole, pretty cool. Unfortunately, none of those elements were present in this, what is being sold as the final installment. How disappointing that this series would close out with a movie of such protozoan intelligence and Lilliputian proportions. I honestly cannot think of one thing the film did well. I actually felt sorry for Wesley Snipes (a marginal actor at best) who looked like he was just irritated to be there. Jessica Biel wasn't offensively bad, but she wasn't anything approaching good either, and the gratuitous shower scene was definitely one of the best eye-roll moments of the film. Dominic Purcell's character Drake (Dracula, natch) looked like he would have been right at home as the bartender at a gay bar, or perhaps as a cabana boy at a resort in the Bahamas. Yes, he was THAT menacing. If I saw him coming, I would be more afraid that he was going to frost the ends of my hair than drain me of my blood. But he did make an effective psychotic; when he walked into a novelty store that apparently only sells items with the image of Dracula on him, it wasn't the bikinis, etc. that put him over the edge; it was the box of Count Chocula. So at least he is concerned with nutrition.The worst character by far, however, was the mind-numbingly wretched, unbelievably unfunny, sub-bottom feeder Hannibal King, played perfectly by Ryan Reynolds. At first, when he would utter lines like, "Unlike other vampires, her fangs are located in her vagina?moving on" and I would just sit, watching stone faced at the television. But then, Reynolds, doing a great job as a George Michael impersonator, somehow becomes even more annoying; so completely annoying that I start telling myself that I will give the film a rating of 10 if he dies. The fact that anyone (himself included) allowed the flat one-liners to continue played a huge role in perpetuating the abject bummer that was "Blade: Trinity". Even the rubbery-mouthed Parker Posey couldn't begin to add a spark of anything positive that could make this film even sub-mediocre.The stylishness, fun, dark elements and even the good music was drained out of the franchise when the producers allowed "Blade: Trinity" to exist. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone who has even a modicum of regard for film-making, or for any of the people involved in this film, since all of the dignity they may have possessed at one time disappeared from as early as the opening credits. At least Whistler kicks the bucket, though he was at least likable in that I liked watching him during the previous two films and thinking, "Kris Kristofferson?! Where did they dig HIM up from?" Because of Ryan Reynolds' unfortunate survival, this film gets an extremely generous 3/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blue light special at Villains R Us</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie made me look back at my comments regarding Blade 2's reapers, how I felt they weren't as interesting or fun as Frost from the original, and I think I've developed a whole new respect for what Del Toro delivered. Blade Trinity's villains . . . man, oh, man . . . weep for them, fellow IMDb user, and the poor actors stuck in the roles . . .Many people have complained that Blade wasn't given much to do here, that he didn't unsheathe his sword till the end, but quite frankly, if faced with these vampiric clowns I'd probably be off screen too, cleaning out the back of my refrigerator where something far more terrifying lurks. The highlight of the villain's on screen presence was them high-tailing it away from Blade, and sitting in a circle complaining about Blade . . . not unlike trolls who inhabit the darkest reaches of internet message boards.So when the parent figure of the vampires, Drake, gets sick of his children's yapping and after deep consideration (offscreen, btw) he inexplicably decides to step in for a world that he grew bored of and children he's expressed his extreme disappoint in (?!).Wait, it gets better! The big bad villain steps in to challenge Blade and . . . and . . . are we ready for this? He runs. You heard me right, he runs, then holds a kid hostage, then talks about fighting with honor, then runs some more, then kills a blind woman, runs one more time, and then talks about fighting with honor. Cue the Dr Evil "Riiiiiiight." Maybe it was the fact that these two points (Drake's initial reluctance, and comments about honor) got my mind going and I started exploring the possibility of Drake hating his "children" and not wanting anything to do with them, or him proving more honorable than Blade, creating an interesting character paradox to further explore. And the film just decided to drop all character exploration and go with the "big evil guy fight big good guy. Fight to death, they do." And I couldn't help but feel sorry for fans of comic books who struggle to convince the world that it is, indeed, a valid art medium that does, indeed, explore mature developed themes of mature developed characters.By the time the Nightstalkers were introduced my suspension of disbelief was gone, and so I was in the mood to count action film clichés instead of trying to care about these guys. I'll leave it to you, intelligent readers, to figure out where my opinion went from there.Oh well, on a positive note - I did enjoy the opening and closing credits design; that was interesting. I was also somewhat impressed to see the filmmakers actually kill Whistler (again); I'll be even more impressed if he stays dead in the next film. I did like the look and sound of the film. The score didn't move me either way.Like the plot and characters in this film, I've lost enthusiasm for exploring anything else to write for this review, so in closing: the most potent of villains brings out the greatest aspects of a well-designed hero. I think Blade realized he could sit this one out and let the "kids" handle it while he put an ad in the paper for a decent bad guy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm sorry, am i reading this right?? another wrestler jumping from the cheesy soap opera of pretending to slap someone, to the acting world?? unfortunately yes. Triple H (the big one who finds it difficult to mumble to a dog) plays a vampire, who has a rather large part. and to my shock and horror it works. his wooden plank of acting "talent" works with the cheesy dialogue, and with immortal lines such as "and when the f*ck did you see my d*ck f*ckface?" and "they basically f*ckin ass raped us!" his wrestling background gives him the anger to give these lines.but I'm not here to talk about HHH. Blade Trinity is a good film. basically, the vampires find Dracula, now known as Drake, wake him and send him after Blade. during this time, Whistler is killed and Blade is arrested after the police raid their base. Blade however is saved by the Nightstalkers, (human vampire hunter, led by a sarcastic ex-vamp and Whistler's daughter) and agrees to help them kill Drake. however the Nightstalkers have also being working on a virus that will kill all the vampires. all they need is to mix it with Drake's blood. the catch?? Drake is a shapeshifting monster of a dude, who can stalk by day and defy gravity. but of course, after all the Nightstalkers are killed, apart from Hannibal King (ex-vamp) and Whistler's daughter, King is taken hostage, and Blade is nearly killed, they of course manage to win.but the Hollywood ending isn't the only disappointment, they have totally ruined the character of Blade. he has now gone from the quiet anti-hero, to a chatty hero with an attitude. he cant have the same effect as in the 1st two films. also the film is played much more for laughs, what with vampire dogs, and Hannibal King. not that Hannibal's character isn't good, his one liners are undoubtedly one of the best things in the film. and his interrogation scene has some of the best lines ever. also his reaction to the vampire dogs is brilliant 'Small vamp dog walks round corner. Hannibal says "f*ck me" two large vamp dogs walk round. Hannibal says "F*ck me sideways!"' its very funny. but ultimately its lost its way since the 2nd film. its never a good idea to place wrestlers in films, and while one or two new characters is good, a whole group is unnecessary. however, as they successfully killed off all the vampires, what will happen to Blade? but the alternate ending shows there are more monsters out there, it could give the films a new edge, if they decide to do a new one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blade Trinity not as good but good enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a big fan of Blade 1, and 2 and having seen the backlash of bad reviews for this movie I was delighted to find that its actually pretty good. No its not as good as the first one or second one but its close enough. Granted I'm an action movie fan, and I watch movies for the entertainment value not to analyze the production of the movie. It has the visual style of the first one, and also the second one. It does have a few scenes that are weak, and like most everyone else I wasn't real happy with who they casted as Dracula. Lets face it everyone Imagines Dracula as a more mature man (like the guy the played Victor in Underworld) so the young gym rat looking guy just didn't seem right, even though the heritage and accent fit, he just didn't look right.The bad: Intro scene of Abigal Whistler, the hat and the flashy hi res or what ever they do to make it look all jumpy I hate. it just obscures what your looking at. When I see that It just seems to me there trying to hide something there trying to fake.Casting of Dracula: Some young guy wearing leather pants and cowboy boots looking all guido? LOL woops no offense to his acting it was just poor casting.MISC scenes: the scene of Triple H's character running behind the automobile when Abigail shoots him in the eye is just ridiculous looking, its so obviously sped up it looks cheap and fake. any action scene with the high speed filming or what the heck ever it is there doing a lot more of these days I hate. The only scene in any move I have ever seen where this didn't look like they were trying to hide something when they do this is blade one the blood bath scene when all the blood is coming down from the sprinkler system. The FBI agent after whistler blows up there whole entire base in a puff of smoke then the agents says something stupid like "whats going on in there.. someone talk to me!!" Hello.. the whole place just exploded dufus there dead... can you say editing room floor?THE GOOD: lots of great action scenes, I love Parker Posey as Danica Talos she makes a great Vampire check out the deleted scenes/outtake when she walks into the FBI place LOL thats great. I won't spool it but there is a great idea they did for a scene of Dracula 'socializing' in the modern world.. good stuff coulda been more viscous but still great idea. Ryan Reynolds as Hannibal King was great, he made me laugh like crazy, but then again I like a cold sarcastic sense of humor.All in all I think its a good addition to the blade trilogy, if they would have just cut/redone a few dorky scenes and casted Dracula better.</fullReview>

I like the second film even more, it was more of a horror film than the second one, but they both had a cool energy that made them cool to watch. This third installment suffers from what most 3rd parts of series suffer, a lack of energy. It wants to be bigger than the other two, introducing the Dracula legend into the story, BIG MISTAKE. Visually, the film is much less inventive than the first two, Blade 2 had the fortune of being directed by Guillermo Del Toro, many may agree that he is one of the better horror directors working today. This film is not boring, but it is slow, and the action scenes are ordinary. Even with low expectations, the movie doesn't deliver.Grade: C-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>David Goyer should not direct</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first two Blade films, while written by David Goyer, were excellent films. The first had a dark quality that completely set it apart from other "superhero" films while the second had an undeniable style about it. Both of those flicks grabbed you from the start and you were helplessly enthralled. The reason for that was good characterization and intelligent (if somewhat far-fetched) plotting. Blade Trinity has none of those features.Goyer writes (for some reason, very poorly this time around) and directs the final installment of Blade. Not only is the mood of the film much lighter than the previous two, but the acting is as well. The character of Blade is not meant to be part of an ensemble, but it seems as if Goyer were trying to do that here.It is unnecessary -and poorly explained- as to why Whistler's daughter (played by Jessica Biel) is a major player in Trinity. Ryan Reynolds, while humorous and undeniably rough looking, is comedic relief, something that probably should not exist in the "final" Blade film.Fans of the first two films might find something to like here - I struggled with that - but Blade Trinity is sorely disappointing. Goyer, while apparently a fine writer as evidenced with the first two Blade films, should not step behind a camera. Hopefully Blade will not die with this lacking sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cannot be compared to the first two films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first Blade film was, for lack of a better word, awesome. The second Blade film was good, but had several bad qualities that kept it from the same plateau that the original reached. Blade: Trinity, the third and probably final film in the series, is like Blade 2, with all the bad parts of that film magnified a few times, plus some more. Blade 2 didn't live up to the original simply because of the lower-quality acting and script. Wesley Snipes has never failed to disappoint (he doesn't in Blade: Trinity, either), but Blade 2 had some really awful lines, and the acting ability of some of the co-stars ranged in quality from mediocre to dismal. The action, however, was never a problem. Blade 2 had the same, consistent level of action that Blade did. This is where Blade: Trinity disappoints. A lot of the action scenes that kept the first two going are lost in favor of lots of uninteresting plot development. What little action there is feels uninspired and clichéd, which is definitely not a good thing.The story goes like this: Around the beginning of the film, the vampires set up Blade by filming him killing what he thought was a vampire, but was instead a familiar (a human servant of vampires). The news media latches on to it, and Blade is captured by the FBI, which we soon learn is a vampire-corrupted institution itself. Blade is rescued by a vampire-hunting team called the Nightstalkers. Then, we learn that the vampires have re-awakened the king of all vampires: Dracula. Blade must kill Dracula in order to obtain a sample of his blood, which can then be used in a vampire-killing virus.In the acting department, Blade: Trinity seems to have improved over Blade 2. However, in the script department, it has taken a nosedive. One member of the Nightstalkers, King, appears to exist entirely for comic relief. The first two films had no comic relief, and I liked it that way. King's jokes aren't even that good, except for a few which made me chuckle. Still, comic relief in a Blade film really trashes the feel of the movie. The rest of the script has plenty of bad jokes thrown in, along with some plain terrible lines, which make me want to find the screenwriter and do something violent to him. The vampire villains don't even have the same menacing feel anymore, instead appearing kind of silly, especially the female lead vampire, who is played by PARKER POSEY. However, Wesley Snipes still brings the same energy and on-screen vibe to Blade. Except the Nightstalkers pretty much steal the entire movie, leaving Blade to stand around in the background most of the time, and occasionally say something.To sum up, I want to like this movie, but I just can't. I highly recommend the other two Blade films (especially the first), but Blade: Trinity is not a worthy successor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good (SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having waited months for this movie I was delighted to see that it fulfilled nearly all of my expectations. It was highly entertaining throughout, with excellent fight scenes, some humorous moments, some creepy and scary points, and interesting characters.SPOILERS!To be honest, it is not without fault. The biggest problem is that it contains too many story lines, so none of them get fully developed. Dracula's return, the Nightstalkers introduction, Blade being chased by the FBI, the vampires plan to all become Daywalkers etc.The Nightstalkers are a welcome addition. It is good to see human hunters, showing that Blade isn't the only one who can fight vampires. Abigail Whistler (Jessica Biel) is wonderful and just lights up the screen whenever she is on. She put a lot of work into the physical aspects of the movie and it shows. Also I was very pleased to see a female character who doesn't want or need a romantic relationship, as women are too often included in movies as just 'the love interest'. She was definitely the highlight for me.Hannibal King, alas, was something of a let-down. This isn't Ryan Reynolds fault (he does very well with what he has), but while King is funny in some parts, he soon becomes annoying with his incessant foul language. Words like f**k and d**k are not funny, not funny at all. A scene where he is being interrogated is particularly bad.Overall, 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I thought Blade was amazing 10/10. Blade 2 was different but good 8/10. And Blade Trinity was entertaining...8/10 I liked "Trinity" a lot. The movie was action packed with lots of fight scenes and the story entwine not beautifully, more twisted in to place as it seemed things were missing but it just did enough for the "Good Rating". I likes the camera work. Some places were badly edited but nothing that makes you think "OMG That was crap". In fact, you really have to look close to notice it on a few scenes. The effects were great, as always! But I couldn't help thinking, while watching, this Movie is Action rather than substance. I didn't mind but others might? Its all out action with lots of funny comments and Blade, well Blade is Blade and hes always got a few One liners which come out and just make you laugh.Overall, the Story wasn't great but the rest was. The Characters did well. Quick note - Reynolds maybe tried a little to hard to be funny but it worked most of the time. The music added some style to the fight scenes and it just oozed coolness. Effects were good like I said before and really, if you like "All out Action" with a Simple story line, this is for you! 8/10.</fullReview>

Although some people have said that the added humour spoilt things, i totally disagree. I thought that some of the jokes were quite amusing and they helped to relax the atmosphere in the cinema. The fighting, as in the previous two films is awesome, and with a few new weapons for blade and his friends to play it made great viewing. Special effects were also quite good and were used well, as they were in the previous films, to display the burning bodies of the vampires. If you put all this together with a great script and some great acting, you are left with a pretty impressive film. I would definitely recommend this film to anyone, although if you haven't seen the first two films you may get a bit confused.A great film, if you haven't already seen it go see it now!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It would have gotten a 10 from me like the other two Blade movies, but because Snipes shared the screen with two others, an 8 seemed fair. However, Snipes alone deserves a 10. He makes his character believable. I get chills even after the sixth time watching it. Even in the previous movies he has had side kicks, but they still stayed in there place behind Blade. They would just assist as it should be. Don't get me wrong, the sidekicks still give the movie that little shimmer that it needs, but Blade should be the only one that make it shine. And if the producers of Blade movies needed a 10 from me to make the next Blade IIII movie, then a 10 they'll get. Thank you Mr. Snipes for continuing to bring life to our Hero Blade. I hope they pay you good. Bottomline: If anyone else tries to play Blade, i will not see the movie. I think many fans would agree. Thanks for this opportunity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blade Trinity.....The Yawning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Compared to the two previous outings, this third movie is shallow and unfulfilling. The darkness is gone in favour of glib one-liners, horror pets (yes, you read that right) and awful clichéd moments that make you cringe.But here's the basic plot: Blade himself has apparently become so dangerous that the vampires (all the many tens of thousands of them and their human minions) decide they cannot deal with him themselves and seek to find and recruit the uber-vampire...Dracula. This they duly do and Draccy agrees to do away with Blade.Well....that's about it for plot. Now down to the substance, or rather, lack of it. Blade in this film is about as an effectual vampire slayer as Marge Simpson. Not only does he get captured on film by the media, but he also gets caught in reality by the cops (or rather the cop minions of the vampires). He is duly rescued by the new batch of wannabee slayers and seeks revenge. Blah, blah, de blah de blah. You get the idea? There are a lot of fight scenes, but all are pretty unimaginative and many seem to have as their "wow" factor simply the challenge to see how many "burning vampire" effects they can get on screen at once.All in all the film is more slapstick and humour than menace. The humour, provide by Blade's dark witticisms in the first two films, is here almost entirely replaced by glib one-liners by one of Blade's new sidekicks. The other sidekick, whilst not unpleasant on the eye, serves really only to continue the Whistler lineage and provide an obligatory tie-in (I suspect) to any Blade series that may emerge. God help us! But the film is harmless enough if you switch your brain off entirely and try not to think about how much better the first two films were.There was only one thing that really irritated me. It's a new phenomenon that I've noticed in many, many films lately and is becoming an epidemic to rival shoddy CGI. If I refer to it as "The Matrix come-on wave" you'll probably know what I mean. The point in a fight scene where the combatants square off against one another after a few moments of fighting and one makes that "bring it on" hand gesture just like Morpheus and Neo in The Matrix. This is really beginning to get on my Goddamn nerves! It's not clever anymore. It doesn't make the audience laugh anymore. All it does is destroy any sense of believability in whatever film you are watching. Just stop it! And if you needed any more convincing that this film is not the best, consider the fact that it has a vampire Pomerainian dog in it. If that doesn't tell you all you need to know, then you are already too far gone for this review to help.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great action movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't believe all the negative comments I read about this movie. I loved the original Blade, thought the second movie sucked and didn't want to pay 8 bucks to see another bomb. So finally I watched it at the discount theater tonight and found out this movie is almost as good as the original! It's got great action, Blade gets new allies and it seems like everyone in the theater liked it.Jessica Biel is buff and sexy. She listens to MP3's when she's going after the vampires and her music selections are included in the soundtrack. The worst thing I can say about the movie is it's a little predictable. The vampires kidnap a child and the good guys must save her.Here's one of those times when the critics are wrong so if you were holding off on watching Blade Trinity go for it. Or it will probably only take a few more weeks until it's out on DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong, I love the whole Blade concept. He's one of my favorite characters in the movie realm. Actually, I liked Blade II somewhat better. All in all, I greatly enjoyed "Trinity". However, I do seem to be kind of puzzled at the way that Blade took out what's supposed to be "THE VAMPIRE!". I would've thought that the ancient one would've stomped out anything and anyone. Hey, but that's why we call them movies right? I do hope for ONE MORE MOVIE from this line. And then I'll be straight. No more than that though! The action and the equipment &amp; technology that is used by everyone involved in this war, to me, is unprecedented.</fullReview>

I would have liked to see more of Whistler but the addition of his daughter was very creative. She too had lots of martial art skills that was a bonus to this film. The script was a little lame but everything else about it is definitely well worth seeing.There may be another installment with the way it ended. I hope it is. I would love to see it too.

		<fullReview>Blade Trinity wasn't so bad...it was an entertaining, mindless exercise in vampire killing with lots of loud music and prettily posing people with rock hard abs.Now, apparently other people have seen a different version of the Blade predecessors than I have, but I don't recall the first two films to be any genre breaking spectacular movies, so for all those critics saying the third one doesn't live up to the first two...well, be that as it may, the bar's not exactly very high. The first two may have been dark and intense...but let's face it, it was also a dreadful bore, probably most palatable to the die hard Marvel fans. Fluff is fluff...and I don't like my fluff masquerading as a serious movie. At least Trinity knows its place. It's fast moving, doesn't bog its audience down with incessant chatter (the most recent Spiderman comes to mind), produces lots of loud noises and bright colors, and a relatively satisfying ending. If you walk into it hoping to watch an entertaining blockbuster flick for a couple hours, you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Blade and the first sequel, Blade 2, are quite well respected movies. Fans say that they are well crafted vampire movies which do interesting things with the genre and at the same time supply an always-welcome dose of kickass. Those same fans have been less than kind about Blade: Trinity. But I'm not a fan, and I have not seen the first two films. Could a fresh approach be what it takes see Blade: Trinity in a new light?Well, I'm not impressed. I can see glimmers of what a good idea the Blade story is. Coming from an obscure Marvel comic, it features a hybrid vampire/human who is out to kill modern day vampires wherever they may be. The reason for this is not made clear in this third film, though it may well be in the original. What is clear as this movie starts is that Blade has an organisation backing him up, as well as an arsenal of cool gadgets which are souped-up versions of the traditional vampire-hunting paraphernalia (silver-plated sword, silver-bullet machine gun etc). But not even that is enough to save him when the vampires plot to bring back the granddaddy of them all: Dracula!All this is clearly warming up to be the barney to end all barneys, as Dracula (or Drake as he has named himself) won't just line up and be staked like the rest of the creatures of the night. There's going to be a lot of punching and kicking before this film is over. And boy, is there a lot of fighting. In fact, that's about all that does happen. Fight after fight after fight, stopping only for a little bit of story here and there.Blade is wanted by the FBI. Fight! Blade discovers a group of familiars (humans who are helping the vampire cause). Fight!It all gets a bit tiresome, especially when Blade teams up with a couple of other hunters (which, presumably, is where the "Trinity" in the title comes from), one of whom is an attractive lady and the other is an annoying, smug git who won't stop wise-cracking. I am sure that the previous movies must have had more depth than this, or they would not have the sort of following they have acquired. Mind you, what do I know? A lot of people enjoyed The Punisher. Damn fools, the lot of them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>where do i begin with this film? i found it neither impressive nor boring. I will admit i found the story interesting but i found a lot of flaws in the characters. for example the king character was the comic relief of the film, but at most times i found him annoying and extremely unfunny. Abigail, your typical "shes hot and kicks ass" female role, i found it all too samey with her, i could conjure up countless amounts of characters who i felt she could possibly live on the same bandwagon as (trinity, alice from resi, electra from daredevil the list goes on) also her addiction to MP3's i found was just product placement for ipods and i found it extremely annoying the way the film highlighted her putting her earphones on, every... frikkin... time! Snipes as usual made blade a kickass character, decent dialogue, great acting, i found no problems with him at all. the appearance of HHH in the film was an interesting twist but i found his acting rather wooden at times and wouldve preferred it if he went all badass wrestler more often in the film rather than just saying F*ck in every line.overall i found it an average film. nothing too special, go see it with some mates if you want something to do. otherwise, leave it out and go take your girlfriend to see phantom of the opera.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>New Blood Resurrects Dying Series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While the Blade Franchise is not the biggest or best selling movie trilogy (no Jedis, no Hobbits) it has been a fun one.What started out looking like Wesley Snipes vanity project bid for action flick stardom (see Ahnold's Terminator trilogy) has seen some ups and downs over the years.The first Blade was creative, dark, action packed and interesting enough, if somewhat flawed. There was enough to please many fans of various genres - from Big Screen Graphic Novel Inspired Action Flicks to the Vampire Goths. (This position most recently occupied by Underworld and Hellboy.) Wesley Snipes had the opportunity to show off his leading man style, kick ass chops, chiseled abs and some very groovy tattoos, all in one movie.The second Blade film seemed to fall into the usual Sophomore Slump. Neither as creative nor as clever as the previous entry, it still had enough action and dark edginess to be fun for the die-hard fans, but the series appeared to be running a few pints short and felt played out.Enter Blade Trinity - originally slated for Summer 2004, it opened last week. Normally, a delay like that signals trouble, so I had very low expectations for this third entry.While fans of the darker aspects of the genre may complain that this Blade has compromised the canon, I really enjoyed Trinity.Ryan Reynolds was the main reason. Imagine Jason Lee reincarnated as a buff, kick ass hottie and you have Reynolds character Hannibal King. I've always been a sucker for this archetype and Reynold's quintessential smart ass tough as nails anti-hero steals (and saves) the show, in my opinion.And while at first Jessica Biel's character played like a Jennifer Garner "Electra" wannabe, she managed to make something more of the role by throwing in subtle character shadings on the run.Sure, the vampires - especially the bull-necked Dominick Purcell as Dracula/Drake - seem a bit too easily dispatched by the MTV Generation of Nightstalkers, but with Parker Posey and some killer canines thrown into the mix along with enough smart one liners to keep me chuckling along the way, I found this to be a fun way to close out a series that had previously appeared to be sinking into the dour dumps of it's own disillusions.And it doesn't hurt that the Nightstalkers could easily spin off their own series of some kind, since Snipes himself has said that this will be the last Blade film.While this certainly won't be the film of the year, if you enjoy the genre, Blade Trinity is a fun way to spend an evening watching a film that will be best at it's best seen on the big screen.Roo's Reviews</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THREE'S A CROWD</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like the Matrix, this third installment of the Blade trilogy proves to be the worst. An uninterested and tired looking Wesley Snipes provides an equally tired and rather flat performance. May be that's why he's flanked by Jessica Biel and Ryan Reynolds to help him carry the load . The use of comic one liners is an attempt to juice up the hackneyed script, but I think it's overdone for an action flick, because it impacts upon the credibility of the ensuing fight sequences. The one thing that sustained the first two installments, or any fight packed movie for that matter,is the credibility achieved thru excellent fight sequence choreography. The choreography here is amateurish. This is not a serious action movie. The Vampire overlord( Dracula himself ) somehow seems out of place, if not out of context,notwithstanding the fact that this a vampire movie. I guess, I just didn't buy the idea of Dracula looking like a Rock Star in leather tights, being dispatched without a valid display of his habitually impressive super prowess. I hope the BLADE franchise survives this blunder, because I've enjoyed it until this poorly conceived platitude.</fullReview>

I personally thought it was as good as Blade 2 if not better.So everyone stop moaning about this movie not being the greatest ever and sit back and just enjoy it for what it is?

		<shortDescription>THREE TIMES IS THE CHARM?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three times is the charm... well not exactly. Blade Trinity promises to be the balls out finale to the series but instead comes across as a timid, creative sequel with some banging new characters but light on the style that made the first one so popular. Way better than the horrid second chapter but not as good as the first. Blade Trinity falls into forgettable but entertaining cinema feed. this time around the vampires led by wonderful indie movie queen Parker Posey release the first vampire Dracula to battle the half human/vampire hybrid Blade. He is helped along by some new additions after being framed by the vamps and arrested by the cops because of murdering a human. The new additions are ultra hot funny man Ryan Reynolds sporting the most wonderful killer bod ever allowed on the big screen as Hannibal King whom used to be a vampire. And hottie with talent Jessica Biehl sporting akiller bod as well with the martial arts to back it up as Whistler's surprise kick ass daughter Abigail. The film teeters along as it goes through the usual plot clichés. But the film seems fresh. Despite the tepid direction the writing and acting by Biehl, Posey and Reynolds take on a whole new dimension. the only main problem with the film is the prescence of the title character whom just seems very bored. Biehl gives a plausible and kick ass performance as the films heroine, Posey is incredibly campy and funny as the vamp leader Danica and Reynolds gives new meaning to the word smoking as the hilarious Hannibal. On the technical route the spfx are more than up to par. Dracula's design all though cg is quite mazing and he's pretty damn hott as well. he makes a fine villain for the Blade character but falls short of prior Blade Villain Steven Dorff. All in all the film is a entertaining night out at the movies, it serves up some comic and horror creativity along with great eye candy. Despite the obvious lackluster wear downs this sequel should pose well among it's fans and others whom go to see it. balde Trinity isn't cinematic gold but three times is looing like the charm as far as new charchters are concerned.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK film, bad part 3 of a trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film is almost what you expected of a Blade: Good action, OK story, nice special effects, kick-ass fun Wesley. Characters: Good choice, not too strong besides the main character, not too well-known, just being there kicking ass near Mr Snipes, excellent choice for the villain as well. Story: Not too hard to get to ... could use some more surprising twists here and there, but in my opinion it does its job: Keeping you to the action. Effects: I always enjoyed watching the vampires in Blade die :-) I recognized some glitches here and there when the action is going on behind the termination of a vamp, it sometimes looked a little crappy. Its a fun movie, if you like action vampire movies, this is definitely a must see. Its actually more like part 1, good decision in my opinion ... I'm always afraid of producers messing up sequels, this is not one of them. I'm a little disappointed with the ending: As part 3 of the trilogy you would expect it to be special, answering and bringing it all to a satisfying end, but instead this movie could easily go through as part one or two. Still 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typical end to a trilogy...almost...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the most part you will not be surprised by what you see in Blade Trinity. Like any good finale to a trilogy it ups the stakes to a new level, and now Blade has to face king vampire, Mr. Dracula himself. In the first one Blade defeats the god-like baddie (who really didn't scare me), and in the second one he faces the mutated super-vampires (who did scare me). There was nowhere left to go but down from there...unless you bring Dracula in, which is exactly what they do and despite how predictable it is, it actually works.At first it seems like Dracula (or Drake, as he's called in the movie) seems a little wimpy, running from Blade and taking an infant hostage so that he can have a cordial little talk with Blade. However, when it comes down to Blade vs. Drake, we see why he's the ultimate baddie, as Blade by himself proves to be no match for him.The unexpected part to this film, however, is the humor.What? Yes, I said humor...in a Blade film. Up till now this trilogy has been very dark and morbid (little too dark and morbid for my tastes), but in this film we are practically force-fed some of the best, but seemingly out of place, comic relief I've ever seen in a non-comedy film. Ryan Reynolds seems to have no limits on his imaginative use of dirty language and off-the-wall comments to amuse us in this film, and I think that, despite the awkwardness of conflicting tones that he brings to the movie, he makes it a better film overall.If you are looking for a dark horror vampire flick more like the first two installments of this trilogy you may be disappointed. If you are like me, though, and like Blade instead for its awesome action, cool gadgets, and seeing Wesley Snipes kick some Vampire ass, then this movie is for you.</fullReview>

What promised to be a decent film was sabotaged with some and repetitive overt product placement, and a really bad acting job by World Wrestling Federation champion Triple H. Ryan Reynolds had the thankless job of flinging one-liners off while Wesley Snipes spent most of the time kicking a** and phoning in his lines. The good news is that Reynolds got a new body out of the deal. The bad news was zero chemistry between the 3 leads, and even though I saw it at an early matinée, I felt gypped.The Blade franchise, like (spoiler alert) the vampire world at the end of the movie, is dead. Drve a stake though its heart -- or lack thereof. It's done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Goyer brought Blade back. The mystique, the style, the characters, the music, the story....you KNOW where they kill vampires!! were all there.The acting was better in this installment than any of the other, except for the noticeable absence of Stephen Dorff, who was emulated poorly by a female counterpart this go around. Other than that, the added changes, like a new team of vampire killers was a great addition, the two new leads fit in perfectly and brought their own stlye, while preserving the anti-hero motif; actually their characters expanded and updated the Snipes anit-hero of Blade. Bringing much needed imagination to the story line.The action is probably the worst of the three movies, but the style is more reminiscent of the first Blade, making the movie more enjoyable than the Second, which was totally driven by action scenes and aesthetic visuals.The music was GREAT, JUST like the first movie.Jessica Biel was out of this world. Totally blew me away, her character added to the narrative, rather than subtract by the usual zero-sum game of politically correct Hollywood rationale. Good Job Biel and Goyer!! Also her male counterpart(Ryan Reynolds) did very well. Don't believe the critics on their review of his performance, they're way off on this for some reason.I gave this movie an 8, because i want to go see it again. Aesthetically it doesn't deserve an 8, more like a 7, but its a legitimate Blade movie, and that is a beautiful thing. Its worth the money and time.</fullReview>

However, I will probably grab it from the video store to see it soon because I enjoyed Blade Trinity.It's from the same director as the first movie but this one has a better "feeling". It's hard to describe but that's how I feel.I don't understand why they choose Ryan Reynolds for the role he is playing. Probably because he has a comedy background and they wanted this character to be funny but it doesn't really work. It's just bizarre to have some guy reciting "funny" lines around Blade. it's just a couple of weird moments to pass. The rest is just normal Blade movie : shooting, jumping, slashing, etc... and some techno-babbling but (I don't know why) it works.Finally there is a decent "bad guy" to confront Blade but it is not really exploited to the max. Instead, it turns in a technology battle. I would have done it differently but it's OK as it is. There is a feeling of "WWF invading the big screen" that's a bit weird in this movie too.Overall : a good action movie. Worth seeing. Worthy of the Blade name, I don't know and I don't care. It's a good flick. If it interests you, go see it and you'll have a good time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a good review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I understand that this movie may not have stimulated the audience intellectually, but it did serve its purpose as entertainment. What more can you expect from a movie that is based off of a comic book character? Out of all 3 of the Blade movies, I still believe the first one to be the best, but third does challenge that belief. As far as Ryan Reynolds goes, I thought he served his purpose as the comic relief. If I'm not mistaken, isn't that all Donal Logue's character served as in the first one? I consider comparing Reynold's to Jason Lee a compliment. Comparing the movie to the directing of Kevin Smith is completely off. Just because there were a few humorous lines doesn't mean it put this movie in the same place as Mallrats. I don't know about anyone else, but I go to movies like this to be entertained and that is exactly what it did. The fight scenes were amazing and very well choreographed. The soundtrack was phenomenal. I liked this movie because it brought a new look and attitude to a classic character, Dracula. If there was one character that didn't serve a purpose, it would've been HHH. The only thing he did was confirm my belief about professional wrestlers. Their wrestling isn't real and neither are their acting skills. Overall, I felt that this was an action packed film that kept me staring at the screen for the full 2 hours and 10 minutes. I can't wait to buy it on DVD!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>People - this is a comic film - Not Shakespeare!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read numerous reviews of the film stating how it's a letdown and the story is choppy, etc. This film is not King Lear - It's Blade. After having missed Blade in the theatre, I eagerly rented it on DVD and loved it. Blade II I enjoyed but I felt it was a little over the top on gore for a comic book film. Blade Trinity was kind of a mix between the two first films. There was a lot more humor in the third film, thankfully given to Ryan Reynolds character instead of having Blade firing off tacky 1 liners.The only part of Trinity I found was a bit off-putting was during Blade's battle with Drake when Drake transformed. The CGI was a little on the TV movie level I found.In the end - this is a film based on a comic book. If people are going to see it with some anticipation for higher meaning they will obviously leave the film with a sour taste in their mouth. If you go to see it expecting a mindless action romp for just under two hours then you'll no doubt have fun.PS: Best shot in the film was when Blade drop kicks that guard and he hits the rafters... Priceless! 7.8/10</fullReview>

Add in WWE star Triple H and you've got a movie closer to panto than pant-filler. Sure, purists may shiver at the humour injected into the usually dark tale. As a non-purist, I thought it made the often smug tale into something way more palatable - eye-swizzling action AND good jokes. Hammy, but hilarious.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A surprisingly good film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As with most sequels, I expected that by the 3rd installment of this series it would be utter crap, I was at least somewhat wrong. The film starts off almost right away with a big car chase scene, and the action doesn't stop for very long throughout the rest of the film. The story is fairly weak, but the film is saved by frequent (good) action sequences along with well placed humor. There is much of the same action which the series is known for. Elaborate fight scenes, much vulgarity, and lots of techno music to go along with the action. Some of the acting is somewhat weak as well, but it doesn't subtract much from the film. If you're a fan of the blade series, definitely see this one. 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>when i walked into the the theatre i wasn't thinking that this was going to be some epic saga and all that.. i knew that it was just going to be another awesome action flick with lots of ass kicking, awesome soundtrack, and great special effects. This movie has all of that. The dialog was tolerable and the comic relief character (King) didn't start getting funny until about halfway through the movie. It's almost as if halfway through writing the script they actually hired REAL comedians to come in and write the rest of his script because the first half was horrible. I mean, overall, the dialog wasn't anything to be proud of but damn, this is BLADE, a movie based on slicing up vampires and watching them explode into ash in hundreds of different ways.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When the wheels fall off</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am sitting here in utter disbelief after watching Blade Trinity...Blade 1 + 2: Blade through the first two movies had consistently been a dark, edgy movie franchise and thats what made Blade interesting. The dark atmosphere that went along with the quiet, yet intense personality of Blade was in perfect balance. There was a bit of subtle humor here or there to keep it interesting but overall the atmosphere stayed consistent. The first 2 films had meticulously added detail and personality to ensure that even though this was not your average vampire movie, that its still had a realistic vampire feel with dark scary looking characters, and vampires that acted like they were superior. Believability is never been an issue.Blade 3: (in contrast) The dark edgy atmosphere is gone, replaced with an techno style, teen flop feel. Blade isn't about humor, its not suppose to be funny. If it were suppose to be funny than they would have got Ben Stiller to play Blade not Wesley Snipes. The Nightstalkers are a joke. Blade even makes the comment that they're just a bunch of punk kids that dress like idiots. Well there's some irony in Snipe's lines because thats a key element(or flaw) that ruins the whole feel of the franchise. Ryan Reynolds was funny, i'll give him that. The sad thing is that people don't go to a Blade movies expecting a comedy. Vampire hunter: rough, tough, rugged, take no prisoners type of attitude. Night Stalker: joke cracking, techno bopping, careless, moronic. Its sad that Reynolds when to all that trouble to workout and look believable when everything else goes against that effort.Blade 3 makes you question everything that happens in it. Like why are all the vampire henchmen/henchwomen all little punk kids or teenies boppers? Why would the lord of the vampires, Dracula, go running around the streets stealing babies? Dracula is suppose to be this all-powerful immortal, i seriously doubt that he would do such petty little things. Then again, why did it take this many years for the powerful vampire race that we have come to know from the first two movies, to find their lord and master? Dracula, or "Drake" (eyes rolling) looks like a backstreet boy, or some loser from the OC that pumped up on roids and has zero acting ability. For proof, reference that scene where he has a conversation with Zoe. I could just go on and on about this movies problems but i'll spare you the crap i went through by actually watching it. By the way, he goes down easier then Nomak and Frost combined... this supposed "lord and ruler of the vampires".Blade is a shadow of his former self. Just his appearance alone looks cheapened. Just as a small indication, his vest which looked very cool in the first one is replace by a cheap nylon vest with straps and a cheap looking buckle. He doesn't have that dark quiet personality anymore and its as if Snipes isn't sure how to act in this new found personality. The there's the matter of Whistler. Who they brought back in the second, went through a lot of trouble to explain his return and was an important element of the first two. He just dies outta nowhere without much of a fight. What the heck is that!!?!?!!?So what happened? My guess is that they finally said enough is enough, lets just make as much money as we can off the success of the originals and get the heck outta here. Snipes himself said this would be the last one. Just a pity considering the potential, the hype, and the success of the first two.Directing: 0/10 Acting: 0/10 Action: 3/10 Sequel appeal: 0/10General Score: (not an average): 4 out of 10. Had to consider how i would feel about it if i hadn't seen the first two.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>no Blade in this trinity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not quite sure I saw Blade: Trinity, but I am pretty sure I saw Blade, The Comedy.I am not a big fan of the franchise, but I have watched with interest, especially the second one. I expected, and I wanted, the 3rd one to follow Blade 2 in style and mood, which just was not on the menu last night. This is a light-hearted joyride, which was very entertaining and I laughed in the suggested parts. I enjoyed the man candy in both King and Dracula, I wondered how Abigail keeps the giant, uncomfortable iPod headphones in her ears while fighting, I was bored stiff by the storyline and I thought the soundtrack is probably worth checking out.Oh, yeah and I noticed how little Blade was in the movie, being all phased out by the new characters. Probably a good thing, since this is not really a movie about Blade anyway. Both Whistler and Blade, old men, are thing of the past.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Doesn't Suck!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Blade Trinity most certainly doesn't Suck! Having seen all three, I would rate Trinity below the first, but ahead of Blade 2. In my mind, the Blade movies are Action films first, horror movies second. Blade 2 strayed from the first films formula, and I think it suffered a bit because of it. Still a great film...but lacking something the original possessed. Trinity sets the balance right again! David Goyer the director keeps the action moving at a fast pace, and more importantly, he's able to write characters that are well fleshed out.Wesley Snipes knows this character like the back of his hand, and hits all the right notes. He's mostly a silent, brooding vampire killer... but it works for him! Besides, he doesn't have to be that funny, the Ryan Reynolds new character Hannibal King picks up the slack all by himself! And Jessica Biel was even credible as an action hero. The Night Stalkers may be Goyer's best innovation since the first Blade! There are certainly flaws in this film. But its a fun ride!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As good or better than #2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Aside from the X-Men films, I find the Blade movies to be the only other consistent Marvel films (Daredevil and Punisher were weak, I don't hold out much hope for Fantastic Four, and Spider-Man, well, let's just say everyone else likes those movies a LOT more than I do). The first Blade was a so-so film with a really strong performance by Stephen Dorff; the second film, a brainchild of Guillermo Del Toro (who followed it up with the lackluster Hellboy), was really sharp, opening up Blade's world a little and introducing some neat supporting characters ? all of whom they managed to kill off. Now Blade is back in his third ? and possibly last ? installment. I had hoped it would be good, but feared that Blade:Trinity would fall the way of most third movies in genre trilogies, i.e. that they would suck (no pun intended for a vampire film).I needn't have worried. Under the stewardship of David Goyer, Blade:Trinity is possibly the best movie of the series. In this one, Wesley Snipes again reprises his role as the half-breed vampire hunter, but in this film, they saddle him with a few sidekicks who ratchet up the action a little: Hannibal King, a former vampire (it's a long story), played by Ryan Reynolds, and Abigail Whistler, played by former 7th Heaven gal Jessica Biel. Along for the ride are Parker Posey, playing demented (and sartorially challenged) vampire henchgirl Danica Talos, wrestler Triple H playing the requisite muscle-bound bad guy, and Dominic Purcell as Dracula, whom they wisely call Drake here in an effort to distance themselves from, well, every incarnation of the vampire lord since Frank Langella twenty-five years ago.All of the action of the Blade films is here, but it's less gory and less over-the-top than previously. Blade, Abby and Hannibal still mow down a ton of vampires, but there's no fixation on blood and gore like previously, and the movie is overall slightly lighter in tone. There's a great deal more humor in it, but the movie never gets silly; most of the laughs are wisecracks (mostly from Hannibal), and almost all of the jokes are very clever. King has some really terrific snarky one-liners, and even Blade ? who never displayed any personality whatsoever previous to this film ? has a few really good lines. The plot's pretty smart; the vampires are tired of dealing with Blade's depredations and hit him with the one two punch of framing him for the murder of a human and pulling Dracula out of deep sleep to do him in. A fair amount of the early proceedings are given over to introducing Abby, Hannibal, and their gang (complete with pseudo-dorky fanboy name, the Nightstalkers), but these characters are so entertaining they actually elevate the film. Of course there's the requisite fighting and carnage, but there are some very clever and a few really creepy ideas thrown in to keep one thinking as well.The acting's all fine. Snipes reprises his minimalist approach to the vampire hunter, but with a little humor this time to make him seem slightly more human ? and likable. Biel is fine as a thinly disguised version of Faith from Buffy; her Abby is tough, gritty, and, as one character refers to her, a 'hottie.' Parker Posey overdoes it as Danica, though that's probably the direction; alone of the cast I thought she either took it too far or didn't take it seriously. Purcell makes a nice Dracula, which is more than I can say for anyone who's played that part in a long while. He's menacing and broody, and he manages to convey menace effectively. The movie is really stolen by Reynolds, whose Hannibal is so funny and so charismatic you can't help but like him. Hannibal injects a little bit of real-world attitude in on all the superheroics, and in doing so insures that this Blade is at least as appealing as the second one, if not more so.At this point you either like the whole vampire/hunter genre or you don't, and if you don't, then Blade:Trinity isn't going to convert you (that would be Underworld). But it's a thoroughly enjoyable film with a little bit of a brain and a terrific sense of humor. A high note to end on, should that be the case, but I would be more than happy to see the series continue from here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outrageously silly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Blade:Trinity" starts off the same way as the previous films.We get our first scene hinting what the vampires are up to,then we have the action scene,that introduces Blade.It's not as well choreographed as in the previous films and feels a little over-the-top and cheesy.But that is nothing compared to the goofiness that awaits.When does the film flick the sh*t switch you may ask? As soon as the interrogation scene starts.Listen very,very closely to the cops' ridiculous dialog and let that be an example of what the next 50 minutes of the film are going to be like.So basically,the Nightstalkers rescue blade and he joins them.Who are the Nightstalkers you may ask? Hardcore vampire vampire hunters!I mean listening to music on your Ipod and making the worst one-liners imaginable,while slaying vampires-gotta love it! What lobotomized monkey thought it was a good idea to add such characters to the movie.And to make things worse,they steal a lot of Blade's screen time.You know what the saddest thing about the movie is.There are actually some very good scenes in it.The part where Blade finds the blood harvesting lab,for example.These scenes actually want you to take them seriously.Too bad the rest of the film is so outrageously silly you can't bring yourself to do that.Between those dreaded 50 minutes and the end segment there is actually a part of the movie,that is pretty good.There is actually suspense and,can you believe it,no corny one-liners for 20 minutes.Don't worry,the ending comes along to botch that up."Blade:Trinity" is definitely inferior to it's precursors,but has some powerful scenes in it.And although the film is very silly,it's also entertaining and enjoyable.</fullReview>

Goyer though goes for the hard option and decides to direct as well as write. This comes down to a poorly directed, scripted and acted film, all because of Goyer.The choppy and stupid MTV style editing for the action sequences are poorly misshaped. After a while of having to watch these cheesy and ridiculous action sequences you can only begin to wonder how bad the rest is going to be. And it definatelly is as equally worse.Goyers directing is a shoddy mess when referring this to the script and he lacks the talents to direct and move the camera in a good way.All the characters are left out in the cold as none of them really surprise or act on a good level. Verdict:A poorly misconceived vision and a director who needs 20 years more practise.*Tragic</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really don't know where to start. Maybe why i even bother to write a comment (I saw it 2 days after the premiere and I still have bad dreams): Usually when i talk about movies with someone this one comes to my mind. It is the best example for a last part, completely destroying a trilogy. And by completely destroying i'm really talking "devastating".The first two movies are part of my all-time-favorites. And this one.. ..well. As some wise guys already mentioned: I wanted to see blade, not jessica biel. I knew she was in the movie before I went to the cinema and I already thought it might turn out bad. But it turned out worse and ridiculous.warning: spoilers ahead.At the beginning some vamps excavate Dracula. They lift a stone weighing something like 700 pounds? bare handed - vampire like. (they are vamps it's OK - but now..) Later in the movie the lovely jessica biel (just a f***** u* human) beats the hell out of a line of vamps while listening to her oh-so-cool-mp3-playlist. (Just to remind you: in the first movie the villain could dodge bullets now a human beats them up)If you deleted all the sidekicks blade has in that movie (jessica biel and her ridiculous crew) including their ridiculous equipment (*), added some story instead and replaced Dracula with a good actor, the movie might have completed the trilogy as one of the few where all three parts are nice.(*) equipment: They have some sort of I don't know - it looks like a bow when it's activated. A (HORRIBLE CGI) metal thing that wraps itself up and has a laser beam (the part of a bow where there's usually a string to fire the arrow) connecting the two ends of it, being "half as hot as the sun" and completely useless. I assume everyone was drunk when they added it to the movie and still had a hang-over until the movie aired (can't explain why they wouldn't cut those two scenes out any other way). At that point I had to concentrate not to start screaming in the cinema. And of course Biel uses a bow to add a little Rambo, cause she's too cool with her iPod to use normal weapons.-spoiler end-To give you a final impression:Imagine "Lord of the rings", having the movie "In the name of the king" as part 3 instead of "The return of the King". That kind of sums it up.So to all of you who have NOT seen it yet and like blade: Please don't watch it. Please ..trust me. Please.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first of Blade: Trinity's many mistakes occurs during the very first minute in the very first scene. There is a voice over preceding the opening credits exclaiming the legend of Dracula and how it's all real and actually happened. But the voice-over dismisses Dracula as a well dressed and fetishised Eastern European and instead goes on about how 'all that only ever happens in the movies'. Is this Blade: Trinity trying to get across a sense that from here on in it's real? Is this Blade: Trinity setting up a film that will deal with a post-apocalyptic world in a sensible and constructive manner without clichés and silly Eastern Europeans in capes? Is this Blade: Trinity possibly telling us it will be a realistic and scary take on what Dracula 'really' is? Short answer: 'No, it's not'.From this opening voice-over, Blade: Trinity slowly descends into action set piece to action set piece whilst briefly arousing our attention with the odd hand to hand fist fight. I think the idea to introduce the character of Dracula into the Blade series was not only in poor taste but opens up a ludicrous license to perhaps include other such famous, fictitious monsters - anyone for Blade IV: Battle of the Wolfman vs. Frankenstein's Monster? No? Thought not. So for the film to take on such a bold idea and then to have Dracula come across as nothing more than some Eastern European cross between a football hooligan and an oversexed heavy metal band member just buries the idea before its even sunk in. For the record, the film remains on one single strand route throughout; all the time building up and forcing us into thinking that Dracula and Blade are the only two characters powerful enough to even deserve to be in this film. The atmosphere is somewhat false and the film relies on the fact that the bad guy is actually called 'Dracula' for the majority of the eerie feeling we have when he's on screen. But for a better example of a better Blade villain, see Deacon Frost and the 'Reapers' from previous entries. At least we knew nothing of those characters and their ominous presence had to be established and then developed. Here, Dracula is Dracula and you're supposed to be scared of him. Or so the film thinks. So with the film revolving around the waking of Dracula and the coming of an apocalypse, the current crop of vampires try to disable Blade by mixing him up in real world events and having the real authorities label him insane. Why didn't they think of that earlier? But I was interested in this idea and how the story mixed Blade up into the real world where real authorities would realistically react. Unfortunately, Blade: Trinity retains your interest on this narrative for about fifteen minutes before ending up a non-event accompanied by some of the worst music I've ever heard.After the obligatory break out of the medical assessment centre, the film lost me and it becomes a series of scenes containing some God-awful and yet God-awfully funny scenarios. There is a clear shift in power in this film compared to the other two. Director David Goyer gets rid of old favourite Kris Kristofferson but does not have him killed, merely substitutes him. In exchange for sidelining Blade's mentor and all round series anchor, he introduces two new faces in Abigail Whistler (Biel) and Hannibal King (Reynolds), Abigail who is of Whistler's family. But these teenage secondary characters are nothing more than young, attractive nobodies designed to appeal to the younger crowd. Abigail may be strong and independent but she is nothing more than an object dressed in revealing costumes as she kicks and kills her way to glory. Then there is Hannibal who for some unbeknown reason has his vampire tattoo just above his crotch. Again, it's there to merely spawn a scene in which actor Ryan Reynolds threatens to pull his trousers down to reveal exactly what sixteen year old girls want to see. There is no other reason for it not to be on his arm like everyone else's.But apart from being good excuses for spin-offs, the film has the audacity to lower the role of the woman further. There is a terrible occasion when the 'nerd' of the hunting team refers to a group of people as "Gentlemen...." before turning to Abigail and continuing with "....Hottie". Such blatant sexism and disregard for women in return for a meek laugh from the male audience is somewhat shocking. Then there is Danica Talos (Posey), a female vampire whose best bit plays out like a badly composed femdom scene in a low budget porno feature as she whips and beats a chained-to-the-floor Hannibal. The added inclusion of Paul Levesque (aka HHH) complete with 'tagging out' and wrestling moves sums up what the audience are after. Then there is the instance where Abigail is in the shower and she is fetished further. The water and some blood run down her body and face as slow motion close-ups of her feet, face and body are thrust upon us - and for what? For a teenage kick, that's what.The film is not scary, it is not atmospheric and the main reason I found myself disliking the vampires was not due to the fact they wanted to enslave me and take over the world but because they kept snatching babies and children from certain places. Something went horribly wrong somewhere. If there is ever another Blade film, it will have to be a prequel or midquel just so that it is able to right these wrongs Blade: Trinity brought upon us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blade Meets Van Wilder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original vampire, Dracula, is resurrected, in modern day Iraq of course, by his "people" (vampires, of course) and is not exactly in a good mood. Danica Talos (a female version of Deacon Frost) wants him to kill Blade, but there is one problem: he has no motivation.What could have been a decent man-out-of-time tale is out-weighed by cringingly bad dialog and a story often mirroring it's predecessors too much (Blade teaming up, loved one killed, underdog suits up for vengeance against the big dogs). So, what should have been a mediocre, hackneyed if watchable rehash becomes an uneven choppy mess thanks to haphazardly edited fight scenes, out of place and sexually insecure jokesters Ryan Reynolds and Parker Posey and their gratuitous Freud jokes, and so many plot holes and illogic in the story you may think this is a parody. Another killer is disinterested and generally uninspired Snipes (though he has a few flashes of attitude here and there) leading to more screen time for Reynolds and Biel. A better title would have been "Blade Meets Van Wilder", no really, audiences would have known what to expect. Extremely disappointing conclusion to one of the best comic book adaptations up to date.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Blade: Trinity starts in the Syrian Desert where the Vampire race have discovered the ancient resting place of Drake (Dominic Purcell), or rather the original Vampire commonly known as Dracula. Meanwhile Blade (Wesley Snipes) is wanted by the FBI after his Vampire hunting exploits &amp; using Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) they find Blade &amp; capture him, Blade is saved from both the FBI &amp; the Vampires by Hannibal King (Ryan Reynolds) &amp; Whistler's daughter Abigail (Jessica Biel) who are part of a new, young breed of Vampire hunters who call themselves Nightstalkers. With Whistler gone &amp; Dracula the most powerful Vampire ever resurrected Blade joins forces with the Nightstalkers to develop a virus which will hopefully wipe out the Vampire menace from Earth once &amp; for all...Written &amp; directed by David S. Goyer Blade: Trinity was the third &amp; to date final film to feature the Vampire hunting Marvel comic book character Blade, while not as good as either the original Blade (1998) &amp; the sequel Blade II (2002) this is a fine film in it's own right but it was always going to be hard to follow two class acts &amp; as such Blade: Trinty suffers from not being as good as it's predecessors rather than just being a bad film which in my opinion it isn't. Annoyingly this is yet another film which was released theatrically &amp; then released as a 'director's cut' on DVD soon after which restores about ten minutes of cut footage although there's no extra gore despite being 'Unrated'. Like the previous Blade films Goyer was on script duties &amp; he introduces the character of Dracula, unfortunately this is one of the films weaker aspects as he is relegated to a bit part &amp; leaves little impression with the delicious Parker Posey as Danica Talos the most memorable &amp; interesting villain although frustratingly she isn't in it that much either. Also one has to say the story is a little simplistic &amp; maybe isn't as involving as it should have been &amp; the introduction of the new Nightstalker character's feels a bit forced &amp; like the film is deliberately trying to start a franchise going that doesn't include Blade. On the positive side, of which there are many, Blade: Trinity looks fabulous, at almost two hours it doesn't feel like it &amp; it moves along like a rocket, there are some good ideas here like the human blood bank set up by the Vampires as they literally farm the homeless for their blood, there are loads of fights, cool weaponry, good solid dialogue with some amusing one-liners &amp; a bit of light hearted comedy as the script throws in a Vampire poodle! Blade: Trinity is a film for lads, it provides bags of violence, good looking girls &amp; plenty of slick action that barely lets you catch your breath.Director Goyer does a great job here &amp; the film as a whole is so stylish it's a joy to watch, from slow motion to some cool camera angles &amp; a stylish flashback sequence Blade: Trinity just looks fabulous. He also packs the film with wall to wall action, from a spectacular opening sequence where Blade blows a Vampire factory up &amp; an ensuing car chase where there's a cool highly detailed slow motion shot of a car crashing into a post to dozens of brilliantly choreographed martial arts fights to shoots out &amp; the use of all sorts of cool looking chrome plated weaponry like swords, guns, triple barrelled shotguns, bows &amp; arrows, knives &amp; throwing blades (wouldn't they attract more attention walking through a street in broad daylight tooled up with bows &amp; arrows, swords &amp; some serious guns?). The whole film looks incredibly cool &amp; stylish with much to enjoy. I was a bit disappointed with the gore levels, there's nothing in Blade: Trinity that compares with the exploding Vampires from the original or the scene in Blade II when the Vampire hunter has half his head sliced off, there just aren't any really big crowd pleasing moments of gore that I both expected &amp; hoped for. There's a brief decapitation &amp; some blood splatter but very little else.With a supposed budget of $65,000,000 &amp; opening with very lukewarm reviews &amp; disappointing box-office returns Blade: Trinity certainly has that Hollywood gloss about it, it looks great, it sounds amazing &amp; has coolly stylised production design that gives it a wonderful graphic novel sort of look. Shot in Vancouver, British Columbia in Canada. The acting is alright with everyone posing in very cool &amp; stylistic ways as they kick ass, was it just me or did Wesley Snipes look a lot older in this compared to the first two films? The wrestler Triple H makes an appearance, Jessica Biel is cute but it's Parker Posey as the sexy sadist Vampire with an attitude who steals the show &amp; is as memorable as anything else in the film.Blade: Trinity is not as good as the previous two sterling efforts but don't let that put you off since it's a throughly entertaining, action packed &amp; stylish action horror film in it's own right. Well worth a watch. Followed by the made-for-TV series Blade: The Series (2006) which wasn't too bad but got cancelled after only 12 episodes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First the plot involves the FBI ? which is really dumb when you think about it (where were they in Blades 1 &amp; 2?) ? and then the movie totally forgets about them for an hour! The FBI say they've been watching Blade for a long time, but how is it they failed to notice all the dead disco kids killed by vampires in the previous Blade movies? You can't create a world in which thousands of vampires wreak havoc, and then have the FBI NOT believe in vampirism. Too dumb for words. Blade is apparently visible to the FBI whereas the vampires aren't. And then, how predictable is it that the shrink is one of them, or what? Yawn. And then they use the ol' switcheroo shtick ? just like in Star Trek which is probably why Kirk appears briefly on TV ? which is SOOOOO original. Yawn.A really dumb scene is when the good-guys' base gets attacked by Dracula; you'd think they'd be on a state of high alert and not playing basketball, listening to music and screwing around ? especially having found out that Dracula can take anyone's form ? and yet that's exactly what they do, getting ambushed like a bunch of morons. Then we have that guy playing comic-relief. (Whassisname from "Amytiville Horror".) 2 or 3 of his gags work, but most are just dumb. And how about that nonsense about that woman sorting out her MP3 collection? What was that all about? Yes, we know, it's all 'bout homiez an' vampayaz indahood. I usually like Parker Posey, but she's badly miscast as a leading vampire.Still, what prevents the movie from collapsing under its own weight of stupidity is the good action and special-effects. But it's still high retardation for the MTV generation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ryan Reynolds was the only saving grace in this film. The concept was stupid, and they should have retired the Blade movie franchise after the 2nd one (which was pretty bad too).And Parker Posey for the queen bee-yatch vampire?! What?!? Where's Fairuza Balk when you need her? She would have been so much better in that role! Getting back to Ryan Reynolds, though his humor was wildly inappropriate in context of the movie, it was still pretty funny. And Jessica Biel? - nothing more than eye candy. She didn't impress me at all.And Wesley Snipes? - what happened, dude? You lost me fifteen minutes into the film. I don't know why I even sat through the whole thing.Tsk tsk.

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed the original Blade movies and the reason for this was the strong central character Blade is the star. It seems knowing that Wesley Snipes would depart the series after this instalment the producers decided to try to continue the franchise by introducing two new slayers. Unfortunately thats not what any Blade fan wants to see, we want more Blade not a lame IPod advert from Jesica Biel ('She likes to make a play list for while she's slaying vampires') or half assed wise cracks from Ryan Reynolds.Add to this a director who seems to want to turn the whole movie into a music promo and some of the worst bad guys committed to film and there you have it a real franchise killer. All we can hope for now is a resurrection with a new director on-board Blade Begins anyone? Not only lame but a real insult to your intelligence with blatant product placement to add insult to injury 3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A piece of crap.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can honestly say that this movie is the worst movie of 2004 BY FAR. I have never seen another Blade flick other than this, and after I saw this stinker, I really didn't want to. I'll just start off by saying that the opening was an OK, if not lackluster, action sequence. After that, the movie gets boring with a capital "B". Wesley Snipes, a true badass, hardly does ANYTHING once Ryan Reynolds and Mary Camdon show up. There, the acting gets incredibly horrible. Parker Posey, who was hilarious in "A Mighty Wind" and "Best in Show" gives a Razzia-caliber performance. I wouldn't be surprised if she lost all indie credibility because of this bomb. If it weren't for "Superman Returns", I'd probably never bother to watch her again. Oh, and could they have picked a more horrible Dracula? Jeez!Ryan Reynolds...UGH! While most say he "stole the show" or was "the highlight of the movie", I think he was what ultimately brought it down. In just about every scene, he gives a stupid one liner that is hardly ever funny. In one scene that should be intense, he tells the oh-so-horrible Parker Posey "I just farted. Silent but deadly." Silent but deadly, indeed. I was hoping that Blade would snap this guy's neck the minute he burst into the film with his "F*** You" sticker on.Jessica Biel wasn't completely annoying. She had a great scene in the shower, but she still didn't do anything to improve the film. And here character always carried around an iPod for fight music. Nice product placement, Apple. Sheesh.Overall, if you want a really boring, lame, worthless, horribly acted, unfunny, piece of mermaid crap of a superhero film, rent this film. Since I know nobody wants to rent a piece of warm, steaming crap, I honestly can say that I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Actually I did not expect much as it is the third one. Nevertheless, I must admit that I was surprised by the 2nd one, which was quite good.I do not understand why so much stupid vulgarity was needed. It was cheap and did not bring any added value. Vampires looked silly and not serious at all. It is juts too bad. This could have been a much nicer movie ... Is it so difficult to write a scenario? One wonders...I would expect W.Snipes to be picky about Blade 4, if there will ever be one. It reminds me of the Highlander series. The first was good, the second complete crap, the third was OK and the last ... was the last.Hopefully Blade can go on being an interesting movie series ...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A neat way to close the trilogy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this third &amp; supposedly final (Yeah right!) installment to the popular Blade series, our hero is forced into the sunlight with a trio of vampire hunters after he is being chased by the FBI. His goal this time is to stop the main bad guy vampire of them all, Dracula! who is awaken from his slumber &amp; once out &amp; about, he orders his minions to kill the vampire hunters, however BLADE has other plans &amp; seeks to end Dracula &amp; all vampire existence world wide by using a special serum that all though could end their lives, may even end his too. In all honesty I think if they intend or is it intended? to end the Blade series this was the way to do it, with lots of action &amp; vampire killings that made the series so popular up to this point. Blade is as cool as ever &amp; the film is really exciting to watch, it has good acting, good special effects &amp; direction, but nonetheless it did run into problems, starting with the villains &amp; Dracula himself, I mean sure they often times give our hero's in the movie a fight, but they were less interesting when compared the first two films previous villains &amp; the final fight scene between Blade &amp; Dracula wasen't all that impressive, despite the fact that through out most of the film they built Drac' up as a mean villain. But all in all if you don't expect anything beyond spectacular you may wind up enjoying this, especially if you're a fan of the first two. I say check it out! **** stars</fullReview>

The whole story is so predictable and the action is so monotone. By the way, blade only uses his "blade" in one disappointing scene with Dracula, and even then it is nothing spectacular. But behalf of all these comments I give, I must say that I enjoyed some (really ridiculous)one-liners, it made the whole movie less boring :) I couldn't imagine how I could mention a spoiler, because even without seeing the movie, you could already guess how it will end. You know what would be a real spoiler? Paying to watch this movie. These producers are just after your money.

		<shortDescription>A pretty good installment to the series, but hopefully not the finale.---6/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Blade Trinity has gotten some pretty bad reviews from a lot of folks, but most of them don't understand this movie is supposed to be fun, and it definitely is. It has non-stop fight scenes, a cool opening chase, and the great addition of Ryan Reynolds who is ten times funnier in this, an action film, than he was in the horrible Van Wilder, an actual comedy. Jessica Biel is also introduced in the series, as Abraham Whistler's daughter, Abigail, a hot vampire huntress with a wicked bow and arrow, and a for some reason, a love for fighting to mp3's. Wesley Snipes kicks all kinds of ass again as the title character, this time getting caught by the police after being set-up for killing a human, and then hunting down those who framed him. Among the baddies this time around is Dracula himself played by Dominic Purcell, and his underlings played by Parker Posey and Triple H (The Game rules by the way).As fun as the movie is, i hope it is not the finale of the series. The action scenes were good, but not good enough to end a series on. In fact, most of the action scenes seemed the same. Hand to hand combat with a few bullets. The opening scene and the ending had some really good action, but definitely not a finale. The end fight was pretty anticlimactic. Plus, after introducing two new characters, they should go on at least one more film where it is a non-stop super vampire bloody battle extravaganza in hell or something like that. I have heard that this is the end, and i would be disappointed if it is. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Blade. One of the lesser known comic book heroes comes back to the big screen for the third time in this awful installment in the trilogy of Blade.Wow. Where to begin? I guess I won't really divulge into too great of detail but can we say laughable? Seeing this movie stoned may not have helped, but the unexplained plot holes and constant in your face advertising made the movie stink.My biggest gripe probably had to be the 7th heaven chick who had to listen to mp3's while she killed vampires. Of course, we're shown the device she uses two or three times, and while we are never told how she is able to hear people approaching her from behind while listening to her music, she absolutely kicks the crap out of the Vampires who are silly enough to attack her.Minor spoilers ahead There was a funny part when a vampire hybrid dog attacks one of the characters and goes out the window yelping. Sick, but rather funny.Don't waste your time. The weakest of the series. Not even enjoyable.0.5/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some of the commenters liked Kris Kristopherson in this. I caught the end of Blade II right before I saw Trinity, and thought that if Kristopherson weren't able to play in a Blade movie, they couldn't make a good one. As it turns out, though, they _can_ make a bad one _with_ him.I was completely surprised at how awkward his few lines were in Trinity. The explanation can only be bad writing and cutting; Snipes and Kristopherson aren't playing together for the first time, and they didn't suck before.Watching Trinity, we noticed, as another commenter pointed out, that in this installment vampires have lost the ability to see in the dark. Glowsticks? wtf? I didn't remember that Blade should know humans from vamps with no trouble, but recalling that does a lot to rehabilitate his character. In this flick, his inhuman abilities are just strength, durability and speed. This does nothing to set him apart from the night-stalkers, or dark-walkers, or whoever they are. Reynolds and Biel are supposed to be able to kick vamp ass just because they have some toys? Vampires _dodge bullets_, even in this movie. I don't care how ripped Biel and Reynolds are, they're human and shouldn't be so formidable.Right! After the flat and tasteless dialog between Whistler and Blade in the first fifteen minutes, I was hoping some dialog somewhere might not suck. There was just one scene that satisfied: John Micheal Higgins's interview with Snipes (after the latter is captured, encircled by SWAT team guys with automatic weapons...how can they threaten him? If they fire, they're bound to hit each other) plays quite well. Imagine my disappointment when Higgins's character bites it (and off-screen, too) not fifteen minutes later.Did Snipes growl every line in the first two movies? Having seen I and II, I said Blade was his signature role, and that he's perfect for it. To say that, after seeing Trinity, would be insulting.A final gripe about the Drake character. Choosing not to introduce a textbook cape-wearing, woman-charming, aristocratic vampire king could be seen as a very good move. A kind of warrior-prince of darkness could be fun. When Drake slams Parker Posey for the sorry state of 'his people,' he seems about to renounce them and go lone wolf against them (or better, take command and rule with the cruelty, like Darth Vader with fangs). Unfortunately, he gets distracted or something, and never spells out what bothers him about modern-day vamps. Drake makes much of the importance of honor, and the way of the sword, or something. Why would he be complicit in securing for vampire-kind a blood-farm lifestyle? Maybe Dracula could have been in one movie, and the blood-farms in another.Somebody liked the score for this movie. I liked...the lighting?Reynolds's quipping was un-called for, but did make the second half of the film more watchable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awful way to (hopefully) finish the series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS Six years ago (1998), Wesley Snipes stared as vampire human hybrid Blade. Working with Kris Kristofferson's Whistler, Blade would spend his time killing vampires and protecting an unsuspecting humanity.As a result of the success of the original film, in 2002 we were given a sequel. Again with a similar plot, but with different background characters, the sequel would be a success because of it's darker tones, resulting from some superb direction from Guillermo Del Toro.After two successful, and well made films. It should be no surprise that a third (and supposedly final) film would come along eventually. Unfortunately, with a greatly reduced Kristofferson role, a new director in the form of David S. Goyer (after Del Toro passed for "Hellboy") and two new action figure heroes, this third installment is a woeful conclusion to the series.Set in the present day (the film forever refusing to make any sign of the actual date), "Blade: Trinity" kicks off with the Vampire Nation finding their leader. This original vampire, known most famously as "Dracula" is awakened and comes looking for Blade. Add to this a subplot about the FBI tracking Blade and things look very bad for our hero. Luckily, this time he has help.The biggest problem with this film is that the plot never really settles down. Forever distracted, it wastes Kristofferson, and it abandons plot elements at will. Whilst the notion of having a Dracula character sounds useless on paper, there were such substantial thought put into him, that the character really could have worked, and to some degree he did. Dracula, when all said and done, is not a bad character in this film. The problem though is he is forever overshadowed.This film has blatantly been created with spin-off films and Christmas in mind. First and foremost is the hideous creation of Blade's allies. The two characters of Hannibal King (Ryan Reynolds) and Abigail Whistler (Jessica Biel) are so ridiculously commercial that the film looses all dignity. Reynold, to be fair to the guy, does an alright job as the wise cracking King, who DOES make the audience laugh on countless occasions. The problem though is that for every joke he makes, there's five unnecessary expletives. The best thing going for him though is that he's not Biel.Jessica Biel's Abigail is the sort of character that you find yourself despising. Listening to her iPod as she fights vampires (the ultimate in product placing, they even show her downloading onto it TWICE), Abigail is so blatantly designed as an action figure, especially with her bow, that it feels surprising there isn't a commercial half way through. She fires her bow a lot, she badly acts constantly, she's bound to be available in your local Toys R Us within weeks.It's not just the heroes who have hideous performances. Whilst Dominic Purcell was tolerable as Dracula, Parker Posey as his follower Danica Talos was excrutibly awful in every scene she appeared in. With an awful haircut which seemingly was there simply for Ryan Reynolds to ridicule, she was simply hideous throughout.Finally, and most importantly of all, is Wesley Snipes performance. As Snipes has slowly grown into the role over the three films, he has gotten used to the nuances of the character. Able to play Blade in his sleep, Snipes is solid in the role. It's just a shame for him then that his performance is going to be destroyed by awful acting and an inconsistent plot.All in all, there's no saving grace for "Blade: Trinity". With all the previously mentioned criticisms, and about a dozen more (all cut for space and the fact they'd give the entire film away), this film is unsaveable. If, as it is suggested, the film would only get made with Wesley Snipes' approval, questions must be raised about his judgment. With one or two tolerable plot elements, this story could have been superb. Sadly, by giving in to capitalism, sloppy script writing and dire casting, the film has caved in on itself and should be avoided at all costs. A tragic way to finish the series, when the first two parts were actually brilliant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see this at a press screening last night. And must I say that it is one of the real gems as of late.The most important thing I can say is this is a pure popcorn movie. It's about kung fu, vampires and random coolness, so if you're willing to accept no amazing revelations or great storytelling, and simply want to see Wesley Snipes stab 80 some odd vampires with a ninja sword, this is your kind of movie!Which is all you need to know. It's fun. It is the kind of movie you go to to unwind after a long week of work simply wanting to decompress on some level. Some will be disappointed however with the new additions. After a story twist, Blade ends up teamed with the Nightstalkers, a team of Vampire Hunters that back Blade throughout the sequel. In tow is the heart of this movie: Hannibal King, played by Ryan Reynolds. Reynolds adds a huge amount of raunchy comedy and wise-ass remarks that perfectly matches Snipe's "too cool to do anything but stand here dramatically" attitude. He definitely steals the show.Jessica Biel is hot. Obviously beautiful ladies are important to things like this.And Eurotrash Dracula no. 245018563 is actually quite entertaining. He's disgusted with humanity and has a general loathing for Count Chocula, a somewhat original little bit.All in all, it's fun, it's entertaining. It has whole sale violence and comedy. Nothing more is expected in such a thing, I'd give it a perfect 10, but even being what it is, it's not exactly holding any cerebral value per se, so I give it a 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

I was able to watch an early screener for Blade:Trinity and left the theater pleased with what I had seen. I did not expect much in terms of originality, but I did expect the same style, pacing, and action of the first two movies, and I was not disappointed. The special effects are better, the monsters tougher, the weapons even more deadly, and the new supporting characters fit in very well. The film has more humor than the first two and manages to be funny without seeming intrusive. The bottom line is, if you liked the first two Blade movies you will like Blade: Trinity. If you hated the first films, then go watch Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awful for some slightly dental reasons...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All through the 1970s and the 1980s there were very few vampire films made. Maybe someone realized that vampire movies tended to make people who had slightly pointy incisors appear to have created them deliberately for cosmetic effect-to look a bit like a vampire, when in reality, some folk just look they way they do because they were born that way and they are not part of some freaky and moronic vampire cult. Boy that was a mouthful. This film was gratuitously violent, had a thin story line and with the exception of some good acting here and there-not by Wesley Snipes- it was more or less a compete joke, relying heavily on gross out special effects.It also has several running errors where characters killed off earlier are back again not killed later on-even in the same scene in some cases.This film is part of an entire legion of vampire films made post 1990, and they all seem to do the same thing-promote paranoia and create the impression that certain individuals are deliberately trying to set themselves apart from the crowd as real vampires. Back there somewhere in the mists of time someone realized that these types of films tend to create rifts rather than foster communication between different types of people. These movies are like voluntarily going back to the days of tarring and feathering someone for being a witch...welcome to the new middle ages folks and I sure hope there is nothing different, unique or interesting about ya, because if there is-you are not welcome to the party.

		<fullReview>Trinity consists mostly of fights and chases with little substance. The thing is, none of the fights are anything new. As I remember, the stunts from the first Blade were better than this. In the third film Blade's helper, Whistler, gets killed in this stupid FBI raid. The guy survives vampires but can't escape some agents? Any ways, Blade teams up with his daughter and her friends. They call themselves the Nights Stalkers. Jessica Biel, plays the daughter Abbie. She's there to walk around in mid-driff baring shirts. Her outfits in this are so silly.The vampires have dug up Dracula, who really doesn't do a whole lot. He should have had more powers. Triple H plays the tough vamp who you know will get beat in the end by one of the Nightstalkers. I mean they use a Pomeranian and have a mouth coming out of it like in the movie Aliens. That was so dumb and such a rip off of the Ridley Scott film.The girl vamp is not an interesting character either. She's bossy and supposed to be a tough broad but comes off as whiny.The final fight where they kill the vampires was lackluster and with not much imagination.FINAL VERDICT: Why make this movie? It adds nothing to the first two. It's less creative and entertaining. I don't recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a complete waste of time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wesley Snipes said in an interview years ago that Godzilla vs. King Kong was one of his favorite movies. I instantly liked the guy, knowing that you would appreciate action and pace if you actually liked that said film. Blade came out and it was good. The sequel was released and I had questions. After seeing Trinity, ha! Well ... it is apparent that Snipes couldn't care less anymore because this steaming pile of dung has very little, if anything, going for it.Desperate for help, vampires go out of their way to resurrect Dracula in hopes that he will finish off Blade.What a waste of film. Comic book dialog has much more going for it than this. Jessica Biel, amongst others, is completely wasted. I was embarrassed to be watching vampire dogs. Unfortunately, the Pomeranian had the only funny, best part in the movie! I didn't even recognize Parker Posey, of all actresses, trying her hand at this. If you like an exercise in boring torture, watch this film. Better yet, watch the other first two (or maybe just the first), to see how good this movie could have been. That's all I have to vent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Trinity was a sweet movie i don't know what ppl are saying but it was much better than two.. i mean c'mon the writers made up something because they're dumb....the first and third were great because they used things that were already made Dracula and the vampire god... plus the ipod thing wasn't that bad... i always listen to music before Football games it gets your adrenaline going..but most of you guys don't know anything about adrenaline that doesn't come from a video game.. plus Ryan reynolds added a comedic effect that was good... inste4ad of it being so serious and a pure action movie he made it more appealing from a comedy point of view.. and it wasn't jokes it was well placed sarcasm.. you are all idiots if you think that is was a bad movie</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great idea....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vampire action flick is simply bad.Sounds great don't it? The idea of the third in a largely entertaining trilogy of vampire action movies bringing in the greatest vampire of them all, Mr Dracula. In fact, it seems like a logical step to take, and if done right it's a potentially terrific direction to go in. Add to the mix the idea that the main protagonist of these stories of the movie titles is now accompanied by 2 bad-ass warriors therefore making up the 'Trinity' label attached to this third outing and you're left with the ingredients of a really enjoyable and engaging action movie, right?Erm...The biggest trouble with this movie is it looks thoroughly tired. Even Snipes, as Blade, looks bored and completely devoid of inspiration. His performance is purely painting by the numbers, and he could have been asleep for all the difference it would have made. None of the other characters add anything to the story at all, and look equally as laboured as Snipes' Blade appears.Another issue is that the whole Drake/Dracula character was the biggest waste of time ever recorded to celluloid. We had the real potential for a well-developed story about the grand-daddy of the vampires returning to walk the earth again, and it is ruined by a completely vacuous plot totally lacking in anything to care about. Furthermore the sequence with him going into a goth store when he sees Dracula merchandise in the shop window is nothing short of embarrassing.Then we have the early loss of Whistler, which removed an integral character who actually possessed some decent charisma. After the early car chase battle sequence, however, we can already detect this movie isn't going to be great so perhaps Kris Kristofferson's integrity is better off by being written out so early.And then I come to Ryan Reynolds. Oh dear. Oh dear oh dear oh dear. What were the writers thinking of when they cast him? I cringed with just about every line he came out with. He plays Hannibal King, a former vampire turned slayer, and the makers of the movie obviously decided they needed a funny wise-cracking character to liven up proceedings. A Chandler-type individual if you like. They failed miserably in their choice of actor. Reynolds is not funny, and struggled with just about every gag. He was trying so hard to be Chandler, even resembling him to a minor degree, but his witticisms were, for the most part, absolutely awful.Jessica Biel, as Whister's daughter Abigail, successfully adds a bit of glamour to proceedings, just getting the balance between sex-appeal and psychotic vampire killer about right. She still looks as uninterested as Snipes though, and that took some doing.As Drake, Dominic Purcell was another gloriously miscast. He hardly exudes much charisma, never mind presence. Plus he's downright short, and basically unconvincing. He also talks like an angry ex-wife has her hand clasped round his throat.This whole thing was a mistake - all well and good on paper, but in execution a mess. It's not the worst film of all time by a long way, but with the components they had the end result should have been far superior.Tolerable, but only just...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sweet!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this film in the theater. We caught the late show, and I was half asleep. Nonetheless, I've just viewed the DVD (Extended Version). First off, the extended version revealed some critical elements in scenes that were cut for the theatrical version. With that said, this film was just as loaded as the 2nd. Goyer did not do half bad for his first time out. The only flaw I could see was the lack of emotional intensity in the death scenes of Whistler and Natasha Lyons character (slo-mo shots could have helped). That was definitely due to inexperience. On the other hand, the film was very well done. Regardless of what others may have written, I feel the chemistry was sufficient between the three main characters. You must understand that even in character, Wesley/Blade was a bit nervous about these "KIDS" thinking they could just jump into the war against the undead. Jessica Beil was outstanding in her action scenes. Ryan Reynolds added a lot as well with his presence, humor, and overall demeanor. He really made me believe that he was the only person worthy of the role. Purcell as Drake was a little stale particularly in the novelty store scene. And the script... It was probably the best out of all three films. My favorite line came from little Zoe when she replied to Drake's offer of eternal youth with: "MY FRIENDS ARE COMING TO KILL YOU". Perhaps some the adults could have learned a lesson are too from her. This film was an excellent wrap to a fine franchise. Based on the overall effectiveness of the character development etc. I believe the Night Stalkers can stand on their own. Stay tuned.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Blade is back for another slaughter fest with the first vampire. Wesley Snipes is back with some help from Whistlers daughter (im not sure what her real name is), and National Lampoons Van Wilder Ryan Reynolds. He is back and out for MORE vampire "blood". Blade is confronted with a problem when confronted with vampires and a vampire wannabe who is shot by Blade and has it video taped by another vampire. Blade becomes public enemy number one. There are a group of vampires that decide to raise the first and pure vampire Dracula. Near the end Blade and Dracula square off. There is a new virus Blades "crew" designed called Daystar. When this virus is released into the pure vampire all vampires around him die. This is a must see and a movie to love so go see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this installment of the Blade series - it's all out action and a must see. Right from the opening scene to the end there is hardly a dull moment. I loved Blade 2 but this one is just Super Hot. Snipes, Reynolds and Biel are all excellent. Reynolds is particularly refreshing with is one-liners and quips which is his talent. As much as I love Colin Farrell, I don't think he would have been as funny as Reynolds and btw - when did Reynolds grow up and get so friggin' hot???!!! I hope he keeps the 25 pounds of muscle he gained for the movie and we see him in more movies. I hope the series continues as Blade is just a fun series. If they keep making them - I'll keep seeing them. Gonna buy this the day it comes out to complete the set.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Blade just is not very sharp.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not that it was bad, overall I thought it was enjoyable enough...however, this Blade was just not in the same league as the previous two movies. Let's start out with the fact that the movie had almost a television show quality to it. It just did not look as sleek as Blade and certainly not as sleek as Blade II. The sets and everything mostly looked like regular street corners and warehouses. The lighting was not of the caliber as the other two movies either. It also had a rather weak plot...granted the second movie did not have the strongest plot either, but it was still better than this. Then there is the final showdown between Blade and Dracula, the fight is rather anticlimactic. I was expecting one heck of a fight instead it was just an okay final showdown, no where near as good as the other final fights in the Blade series. You would just expect that this super showdown would be done in a way to top Blade's fight with Deacon Frost or the super Reaper. There is also what happens to Whistler, lets just say considering his importance to the other movies here he is taken out of the picture with little fanfare. Not that this movie was all bad, I did give it a seven (I gave a ten to the other two), I liked the action scenes it was great just seeing Blade do his thing. I also enjoyed the addition of Ryan Reynolds to the cast as he added some very humorous dialog. This movie was also action packed so you at least were not bored. It just needed more time or something. A better script maybe could also have helped this movie. Then maybe we wouldn't have characters that seemed important to the plot just disappear and other characters that seemed unimportant become the focal points of important plot points.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film is amazing, a must see!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I went into the theatre I was expecting a film with lots of action and it would easily live up to to the two previous Blade's. Well, what can I say. It easily did. This film is probably one of the best films of the year. It had so much action in it, that you were just staring in astonishment at how good Blade was at fighting, and now not to mention the other 2 fighting characters, Jessica Biel, who plays Abigail Whistler Whistler, and Hannibal King, who plays Ryan Reynolds. Jessica Biel is an unexpected fighter in the film, but she is really good, whereas although Ryan Reynolds is also good, he has many more jokes. The story line is a good one, Dracula has come back to make the vampire race as evil as ever and Blade has to stop him. But Blade is now wanted by the police because he has been framed by the vampires who have brought back Dracula, now called Drake, this adds a good unexpected twist to the film. And as for Blade, as we all know is Wesley Snipes, there isn't really much else to say other than he kicked-ass in this film. It was just so cool to watch in the cinema watching him have all these fights which were perfectly done, and then the final battle between him and Drake was by far the best in the film. Overall, this film was excellent and the best in the trilogy, it is definitely a must see for anyone who's a Blade fan or an action fan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Blade III (2004) was a mistake. There should have never been a sequel to part three. Everything about this film was terrible. Blade used to be cool, now he acts like a selfish whinny punk. They tried to make this like the NIGHTSTALKERS comic book. Instead of reading th comic book and making it just like it, they ruin the whole concept and add the overrated Ryan Reynolds to the movie. I have no complaints with Jessica Biel (who's smoking hot). Mixture of a unfunny and non-cool acting Reynolds and a jerk version of Blade makes for one bad movie. The only thing worth watching in this movie is Francoise Yip. She's another actress who should get more work in Hollywood. Two smoking hot babes in one lame movie! I just can't take it.Recommended for die-hard Blade fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Misplaced Zombies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>These kinds of movies are very easy to evaluate. They need to be merely competent in terms of action, motion and noise. Where they need to excel is in the engineering of a unique style and the concurrent weaving of the mystical or occult history. As time goes on, the bar keeps getting higher and higher in these two categories. That's what makes these so easy; thirty- forty years ago, it was enough to as good as the previous Vincint Price effort. Now you really do have to be better.This is not better, nor even as good as any of the recent offerings. It is still breathing based on a residual "urban" market whose notion of cool is a parody of blacksploitation. In fact, take a look at the two "sides" in this war.On one side are zombies: a washed up country singer, a burned out second rate black action actor who is clearly being moved out of the franchise, and two new kids blindly doing a grown up scooby doo.And that's the "good" side, populated by zombies. On the "bad" side you have clever characters with real actors. These guys seem to be scientific geniuses capable of beguiling hoards of humans, including most of the FBI. They are animated, but even if it were just Parker Posey, that would be enough to distract all the attention from the "heros."Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.</fullReview>

Although he made the occasional joke that made me smile, his character was too annoying. As for Jessica Biel... Well she is not quite an action star if you ask me. And the ultimate crowning turd that made this movie appalling was the sponsorship by apple. Oh my god!!! Biel actually goes Vampire hunting with an iPod on.

		<shortDescription>Noisy, enjoyable action and music video direction is all well and good but nothing else is going on here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The war continues but the vampires have gotten smarter, setting Blade up to be caught on camera killing a human ? turning the media against this "madman". With the police after him as well as vampires, it is only a matter of time before Blade is captured and alone in the world ? at the mercy of the police and, ultimately, the vampires. When he is rescued by a group of humans fighting the same war, Blade reluctantly joins them to do battle with a group of vampires who have unearthed the original Dracula in Iraq and brought him to America to kill Blade.In the opening few minutes and stylish credits sequence you will have basically seen most of what this film has to offer because it is a summary of the style and visual flair that the whole product has. I will try to be a little more original than the other reviews that say bad puns like "has no bite", "lacks teeth" or "has no heart", but in essence they are right (about the film, not in the head) because it doesn't have much more going on than just flashy style. This is not a major complaint though because I did quite enjoy it on that level; the action was always noisy and enjoyable even if it didn't make sense at many points (sometimes the vampires are super strong, other times a group of 6 of them fail to beat one human). The direction is the sort of MTV stuff that usually I hate but here it really worked for me and compliments the action. The soundtrack is also great fun, although it is a matter of taste. I disliked the heavy and dumb I-Pod product placement but the music all worked well with the action and The Rza has produced quite a few movie scores that I like now.Of course the reason I liked the direction and action was because I needed something to stop me getting bored, because there is really nothing else here to enjoy. The plot does just enough to generate action but it has loads of holes and things that don't make sense. It also fails to develop any of the many characters it has ? even Blade is just a block rather than a person torn at by his inner dualities. Of course it doesn't help that Snipes sleepwalks as the daywalker; his performance is just a series of gruff dialogue delivered with a constant snarl ? and is it just me or did it look like he had more teeth than his mouth can easily accommodate? It is sad that, in his most successful role, Snipes should have his film stolen from him by someone as average as Ryan Reynolds. This is not to say that Reynolds is any good, because he isn't, but his comic relief is such a refreshing interruption to Snipes morose delivery that I could have given him an Oscar. I can only assume that it was Reynolds' impressive upper body that won him a role that was clearly meant for Jason Lee, but at least it was nice for him to deliver the whole film as if he was Jason Lee! Biel is sexy but has nothing else to work with other than her body. Purcell is more of a male model than an effective baddie, meaning that Parker Posey dominates the film on that side of things, just a shame we had to put up with some WWE guy playing, well, a wrestler vampire. Kristofferson does his usual stuff pretty well, while James Remar shows up as well but generally this is a film that none of the actors seem to want to dominate ? that is the only way I can figure out how Reynolds and Posey managed to stand out.Overall this is not a bad film, it is just one that is only aiming to do one or two things. The direction is better suited to music videos, but since Blade 3 has the same amount of substance as one then it works OK and stops boredom setting in. The action is noisy and fun, it is just a shame that the plot and characters are so poor, they prevented me really getting involved in the movie and therefore, more excited. An enjoyable action movie but nothing more than that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've never been a fan of the Blade franchise. 'Certainly wasn't looking forward to this one. A friend lent me the DVD and it had been lying on the table for weeks. When he asked me yesterday whether I'd seen it, I felt bad answering 'no'. Thus, I played the film on my DVD while doing some work. 'Blade: Crappity' was probably Wesley Snipes's last attempt to salvage what's left (if anything at all) of his long faded career. The film itself is severely overloaded with excessive high-tech visuals and sound that give a headache. The direction has no direction. The screenplay is dull and insipid. The performances are miserable. Snipes is his usual wooden self. Reynolds is bad as always and he can't utter a sentence without swearing. Biels doesn't do much to be proud of. Of course there might be a sequel as Snipes tries to make it back into A-grade movies. He hasn't been lucky so far.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved Blade I. It was spell-binding. It evoked numerous emotions.I liked Blade II. Again, it was spell-binding. It seemed to put the spotlight more on Deacon Frost and less on Blade. Still a very good show.Blade: Trinity. What a disappointment. I do not understand how the movie can have such a lousy script when it is the same writers as II. When a script resorts to sexual toys and filthy language, one has to suspect a weak script. The vampire shop added absolutely nothing to the movie. Snipes was given very little dialogue and a very small role. He was just there for the fighting scenes and I guess to hand off the torch to Jessica and Ryan.Jessica was very underused. Again, lots of fighting for her but very little speaking or acting. She is very convincing as an action hero. Like to see more of her in that role. Ryan is beautiful and funny; but does humor really have a place in a gory vampire flick. Can he do any "serious" acting? Dominic Purcell is also a beautiful specimen of masculinity and seems to do a fairly decent job of acting. Could put a little more body English into his acting. I will be looking for more on him.There were small children in our theater. Obviously they were not upholding the age restriction. I am sure parents thought it would be along the same lines as I and II. NOT! Again, very disappointed to be ending the Blade serious this way.</fullReview>

The FBI is after Blade because he killed a human. But now, he'll have to face the most powerful enemy yet. Thats right. It's Dracula. He meets the Nightstalkers that helps him to defeat Dracula. Blade: Trinity is not as good as the first two, but it was a fun ride. Blade is once again a bad@ss like he always was. The new characters are not bad. But I Prefer the ones in Blade II. Hannibal King(Ryan Reynolds) had lots of funny lines in the movie. Jessica Biel is hot and I mean HOT. Dracula was not that bad in this movie. I like his demonic form though. There isn't much of a storyline in this movie that much. It mostly delivers you the action. It's an action movie for crying out loud. Overall, it's the worst of the series, but it's a fitting end to the series and it's great to see Blade in the big screen again. But please don't make a forth one. Just let the series end and rest in peace. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did I hear someone say Oscar nomination....?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't really a massive fan of the Blade films and all that, but the first 2 were entertaining enough. But all that has changed now, I am now a proud, rabid Blade-head! Went to see Blade Trinity last night. It's succeeds in being almost as good as AvP, another one of the films of the year.It's amazing - like Blade meets Dawsons Creek meets Baywatch meets WWF. Think I am going to go back and see it again.It's really great to see that they decided to go with young, inexperienced actors for this one and that the main bad guy decides to act really badly - this helps to make the other actors stand out. He has to be one of the top screen bad-guys of all time - an unforgettable, understated performance by the magnificent Dominic Purcell as Dracula... did I hear someone say Oscar nomination....?Some not-that funny one liners by the young male vampire hunter detract from the plot and the action and the explosions and the cool CGI and stuff but some beautifully shameless plugs for ipod are worth the admission price alone;"What's she doing?" "Making up a playlist. She likes to listen to mp3s whilst she kicks a55."I also liked that bit where Blade said coochie coo to a baby, it was soooo funny - i nearly fell out my seat.Since they had all the cool explosions and fights and stuff they must've reckoned they didn't need to worry about a script at all - it's a bold move and it pays off. And anyway it is really hard to concentrate on people speaking for long without explosions and stuff. The beauty of it was, cos of all the action and fire and explosions and stuff you don't really need to think about the storyline or pay attention much - the sign of a great director (and script writer).I really liked the bit where the blind woman died, it was really scary and moving. She was a really great character and it is a shame when she dies. I wish that she appeared in the film more - one of the great performances of recent cinematic history.... did I hear someone say Oscar nomination....? Some people in the cinema thought it was funny when she died but they are just sick. It is good how she has a daughter that gets kidnapped and then Blade and the team have to go and get her back, it brings the human element into the film and I couldn't believe it that they rescued her OK - totally unexpected! Somebody sitting next to me in the cinema wanted her to get killed off but i think they may have psychological problems.The only bad thing about this film is when it ends. With half an hour to go I was sitting in the cinema thinking "I hope this goes on forever"! What a film... did I hear someone say Oscar nomination....?I won't say too much about the little twist at the end but the is a little twist at the end.In conclusion run out to see this film as soon as you can!P.S. My friend that i went to see this film with thought it was pretty bad. But he really hates vampires and comes from Germany. There's no accounting for taste eh...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blade Trinity Snipes is as brilliant as ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a man 45 years old and a horror connoisseur fanatic since I was 5. I went to see Blade last night and was completely entertained. Blade is the best vampire killer since Peter Cushing, hence Van Helsing in the old Hammer films with Christopher Lee. Blade is so cool, hence his coat and his weaponry makes James Bond look like a pussy. Jessica Biel was excellent, Parker Posy was a great vileness. The only flaw I found in the film was Dominic Purcell as Dracula, he was too buff. It would have been nice to see Thomas Ian Griffith reprise his role as the head vampire (John Carpenter's Vampires with James Woods) with Wesley Snipes; he would have been beyond perfect as Dracula. This would have put this film over the top. Dominic Purcell as Dracula just wasn't believable--his acting left a lot to be desired, as well. They could have written Griffith and Snipes more of a one-on-one verbal banter between each other, building up to the final climax. Overall though, I give this a 7 out of 10, it would have been a 10 out of 10 with Griffith and Snipes at each other's throats (no pun intended!). Thanks Wesley, you are beyond cool, man.</fullReview>

WRONG!...This what happen when studio interference and put unlikeable characters.Everybody knows that BLADE is loner (Whistler make the weapons) and we love the character because of that he don't have to give explanations to nobody but in this movie they introduce 2 new characters that nobody likes or care.And that's is the big problem,you don't want that characters there and the movie become a some kind of FAMILY fail reunion and that a shame.Stay with part I and II because compare with this movie that movies look like THE GODFATHER and THE GODFATHER part 2 compare with this crap.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Blade: Trinity (2004): Dir: David S. Goyer / Cast: Wesley Snipes, Kris Kristofferson, Jessica Biel, Ryan Reynolds, Parker Posey: About as much fun as having indigestion and three times as stupid as the average vampire film. Half human half vampire Blade is caught on camera after slaying numerous vampires but one victim happened to be human. Dracula is resurrected to bring immortality to vampires and to destroy Blade. Amounts to 90% violence where director David S. Goyer sets out to do nothing more than showcase various ways to kill vampires. Special effects freely replace story for any writing ability given was surely sidelined by the action. Wesley Snipes again plays Blade who slays vampires even though he is half vampire himself. Kris Kristofferson returns as Blade's aid in his war against vampires. Jessica Biel and Ryan Reynolds enter and free Blade when he is in police custody. Biel is Kristofferson's daughter but she is really there for sex appeal. Reynolds is there for comic relief although the only thing funny here is that he felt this was a good career move. Parker Posey isn't exactly making a big leap forward with this crap either. None of the performances spark much flair and they could have been replaced by puppets from Sesame Street. While the special effects work, this is still mindless junk that someone should ram a stake through. Score: 1 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The least of the Blade trilogy, but still worth a look for fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The third in the Blade series is the least of the three (lacking the originality of the first and the atmosphere of the second), but it does set out to deliver on what it promises, which is non-stop ass-kicking action. Filled with fluid flash-cuts, tons of martial arts choreography, camera tricks and slow motion, all set to a pumping soundtrack, this is an adrenaline-fuelled thrill-ride which offers plenty of entertainment if you're happy to disengage the brain whilst watching. The plot is as shallow as ever, but offers plenty of excellent chases and fights to keep you watching. Highlights include the opening vampire massacre, the police station escape and my favourite moment, the Blade/Dracula chase sequence which is unbelievable in places in the best tradition. My only problem with the movie is that the finale is very clichéd and contrived, just a series of hand-to-hand battles in the vampire headquarters which are just like what closed the last two movies in the series.Snipes returns to the fore and is far more likable here than before for some reason. Newcomers Ryan Reynolds and Jessica Biel are less than welcome as his new associates, the former's attempts to be a funnyman failing every time. Dracula's heavy shoes are filled by Dominic Purcell, who looks like that guy who you play in DOOM on steroids, and he's absolutely wicked. The only real miscasting is in Parker Posey's vampire queen; I don't know who this Posey girl is, but she's completely lame here and a real misjudgement. Wrestler Triple H is imposing as a bad guy, whilst Asian beauty Francoise Yip and usual heavy James Remar are fun in more minor parts.Being a 15 certificate, this film is noticeably less bloody and violent than before, which is sometimes annoying. You soon realise that you never get to see anyone clearly drive home the kill, instead everything is rushed in with loads of cool special effects to make you think you saw it. There's one good scene where Snipes snaps an arm but that's about all there is. CGI is perhaps kept to a minimum here unlike before, but still, the effects are great (especially Dracula in his true form) and there's plenty of black comedy to keep things moving along ? loved the gag with the dog(s). The soundtrack is one of the finest things this film has to offer. Although less violent than we've seen before, this outing is just as dark as the rest and a fine combination of martial arts action with bloodsucking horror.</fullReview>

The casting choices were ALL WRONG as well, Ryan Reynolds was embarrassingly bad in his role, and I'm afraid Jessica Biel was just as bad, if not worse. Wesley Snipes just acted like the whole movie, which is what he was supposed to do of course, so I really don't have any complaints there. Also, Dracula SUCKED BIG TIME in this movie, he was just Soo bland and downright boring, his performance fell flat and was very cheesy and awful. The dialogue was laughable as well, much like the acting. This movie was very hard to get through, and it was truly a waste of my time. 3/10 for Blade: Trinity. &#x1f44e;&#x1f3fc;</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disappointing end to the Blade franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Blade: Trinity completes the Blade trilogy in cinematic grandeur, and brings about Dracula, an inevitable source in almost every Vampire franchise ever conceived of.It was refreshing to have the "Elder" ruling-class/vampire-nation-lord/shadow-council thing dropped, since they were in both Blade and Blade II, and in both movies they were completely killed off, and ignored the existence of each other. Instead we have a group of happy-go- lucky vamps, who have one way or another made a mark in the world. You never find out how they managed to buy a skyscraper and a museum's worth of ancient art, but I'd imagine they had quite a lot of time to get their finances in order.Anyway, deal is these vamps, right? Danica Talos (Posey "Queen of the Indies" Parker; Scream 3, A Mighty Wind), her brother Asher Talos (Callum Keith Rennie; Case 39, The X-Files: I Want To Believe), Jarko Grimwood (wrestler Paul "Triple H" Levesque), and their offsider vampires go to Syria in order to dig up the slumbering Dracula (Dominic Purcell; Straw Dogs, Blood Creek)... Or Drake... Or Dagon... They keep changing their mind. Anyway, after Dracula kills a bunch of them, he eventually agrees to join the team after he hears about the defender of humanity Blade (Wesley Snipes; New Jack City, Chaos) whom he believes may be a worthy adversary. Blade in turn gets together with the vampire hunting cell called "Nightstalkers", led by Abigail Whistler (Jessica Biel; the The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Cellular) and Hannibal King (Ryan Reynolds; Waiting..., Buried) and together they continue the war for humankind.With me so far? No? Well you should be, because this plot is about as run of the mill as they get. While I'm on that, it's worth pointing out that where Blade's saving grace was this awesome mythos and story, and totally failed at characterising, Blade: Trinity had fantastically written characters, in a sort of non-event storyline. Where Blade II blended them, making it the best in the series. Trinity was okay, but it lacked a lot of the engaging elements from the previous two films.I think in part this is because the film is meant to sort of cater to the cinema audience. After the success of Blade II, it's like they knew that people were going to go to the theatre for Trinity so they tailored the film accordingly. You know, just little things, cheesy lines come across in a way more bad-ass way on the big screen. Montages can get tedious on the computer, but can often blow you away in theatres. Explosions and action and CG back flips always translate better in cinema than on DVD. Unfortunately, I own the DVD, not a cinema. Maybe the goddamn vampire Pomeranian they threw in would've seemed less ridiculous if I'd seen Trinity when it came out in theatres, but I doubt it. I'd like to bring up the issue of names. Not that people have unbelievably crazy names in these films, it's the' Super Hero genre after all, of course they've got stupid names! I love it! But the Blade series seems to be populated entirely by characters with the "Saying Names" fetish. It's all "Hannibal King! Die", "Blade! There you are", "Whistler! Come save us." "Drake! It's him" and gets pretty unbelievably dramatic rather swiftly.It'll be interesting to see how Ryan Reynolds fairs. This Marvel film came out quite a while ago, since then he's played Wade Wilson in Origins: Wolverine, Green Lantern for DC Films, he was the protagonist in R.I.P.D. He's set to return to the X-Men universe for Deadpool. I suppose if Chris Evans can get away with playing The Human Torch in Fantastic 4 and Rise of the Silver Surfer then move on to playing Captain America in The First Avenger I don't see why Reynolds can't pull it off. Hannibal was great, Ryan Reynolds is great but I'd be fine to see this be the end of it all here.-Gimly</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Blade film franchise comes to a rather weak ending in this silly and poorly thought out third chapter where a sleepy Wesley Snipes teams up with Jessica Biel and Ryan Reynolds to take down Triple H and Dracula.Snipes was in serious financial trouble at the time (somewhere around 2004-2005 he was charged with tax evasion) and was basically just working to get paid. The original idea was to turn the franchise over to Biel and Reynolds, but bad reviews and meager box office put paid to any such plans.Reynolds has some great insults, Biel looks hot as always, there are some decent action sequences, but Dracula is a cookie cutter creation not worthy of our thought or time. He's no Christopher Lee, Bela Lugosi or even Gary Oldman, let me put it that way. Triple H is in a lot of scenes, but doesn't say or do much, though his final fight scene is well done.Given they were trying to move the franchise along to the two younger stars, you can just about forgive how lackluster this is, but that doesn't make it any good. At least it just does just enough to not be terrible.</fullReview>

Meanwhile the vampires led by Danica Talos (Parker Posey) has awaken Drake (Dominic Purcell) hoping to use his blood to walk in the day. When the FBI finds their hideout, Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) blows it up killing himself. Blade is captured but is rescued by Hannibal King (Ryan Reynolds) and Abigail Whistler (Jessica Biel). They are a part of a group called the Nightstalkers. They are working on a virus against the vampires and they're looking to get Dracula's blood to perfect the virus.The story is simple. The action is bombastic and it keeps coming. It's mostly fights and gun action. Sometimes the story gets too silly. Ryan Reynolds has some fun joking around while the constantly sour Wesley Snipes skulks around. Jessica Biel is a bit of a wet blanket. This is more slice and dice fun time rather than anything truly dark or scary. With Reynolds, this is definitely the jokiest one in the trilogy. Dominic Purcell tries his best to be threatening. On the other hand, Parker Posey is not threatening at all. This movie may be too light for Blade fans, but it works well enough.</fullReview>

The vampire nation awakens the king of vampires, Dracula from his slumber with intentions of using his primitive blood to become day-walkers. On the other side is Blade and his team creating a virus that could wipe out the vampire race once and for all. In the end, the two sides collide and only one will become victorious, a battle between the ultimate vampire who never knew defeat, facing off against the greatest vampire slayer....Snipes basically kills his franchise with a really poor show in the last of the movie. what he does is put no effort into his role, and leaves it to Biel and Reynolds to put on a show.Snipes still kicks a lot of behinds, but his line delivery is awful, so you couldn't care less for the titular character. and when that happens, you start to doubt the film, and your whole enjoyment of it.The direction is poor also, and the action is pretty much the same as the first two, Blade having a fight with lots of vampires whilst there is a techno song in the background.Reynolds has the best lines, especially when he faces off Parker Posey, but this doesn't save the rest of the film.Oh, and there is an after credit sequence of Blade driving.... Driving for crying out loud..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Trinity gets 3 strikes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's be honest: Blade Trinity is not a good film. Where the first Blade was fresh and cool and raw, this one stands accused of "trying" to be cool, and that's never a good thing.At this point in the series, Wesley Snipes pretty much believes he IS the Daywalker as I've heard tales on set of him staying in character well after the cameras had stopped rolling as well as verbal assaults on fellow cast members and crew.What hampers this film most is the exchange of substance for style. There is a story here, and a potentially interesting one where modern day vampires travel to Iraq in order to seek out the progenitor of their species, Dracula himself. Ol' Drac (now known as Drake) has been in hibernation for centuries, apparently disgusted with the scurrying, back-alley deal-makers his spawn had become. They need a genetic sample in order to rewrite their own DNA so they can rid themselves of weakness: garlic, sunlight and silver, after which they can rule the world outright.What follows is a series of slow-motion action poses and thinly strung-together fight scenes sprinkled with comic relief provided by Ryan Reynolds and Parker Posey. The interactions between these two provide some levity in what is already a fairly campy film. While the first Blade was a serious action film and strictly about kicking vampire ass, this film seems more about spewing catch-phrases, underground techno music and drawn-out fight scenes that really don't add much to the story.Where the first Blade was bathed in greys and steel blues, giving it a very cold and surrealistic look, this film uses dark reds, rich browns and ambers giving it a dark and rich look, though not as effectively as Blade II. I think this only being Goyer's second film might have contributed to some of these issues as while he is an excellent writer, he's yet to learn a lot about the craft of directing.Another thing that bothered me about this movie is the action. In the first Blade, we see a soldier, armed to the teeth. He is waging a relentless, one-man war on vampires and has many practical and useful weapons at his disposal. The first scene of him wading into a vampire blood-rave with guns blazing is a truly awesome and the "R" rating for bloody violence was entirely appropriate and welcome in that kind of film. That kind of scene is missing here as this seems to be more a martial arts movie than an action movie. Blade seems content to go hand-to-hand with his targets resulting in a slowed pace; where he was a juggernaut in the first film, here he is a man strolling in the park.His counterparts walk the same path as both Whistler (Jessica Biel) and Hannibal King (Ryan Reynolds) want to employ fisticuffs against supernatural immortals rather than their tools. Seeing a 110lb Jessica Biel (no matter how scorching hot she is) fighting 5 armored guards with helmets and knocking them out with her bare knuckles is nothing short of ridiculous. Same goes for Reynolds and his mono e mono with WWE's 'triple H'; not only a huge man, but a huge vampire... is punching him in the face really going to work? I guess so! Anyways, this film is best enjoyed by fans of the series, and probably only once. While the first was a fresh and brutal classic, this is a disjointed and rather disappointing, sputtering finish.*NOTE* The only reason I gave it a 6 and not a 5 is because Jessica Biel is pure hotness in every scene she inhabits. Seriously, she is really great to look at.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The weakest of the series, "Blade: Trinity" is still salvaged by some good action and great humor!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David S. Goyer, whom wrote the first two "Blade" movies, directs this third and (for the time being) final entry in the series, "Blade: Trinity." This time, the tone is a lot different, and the film feels more light and fun, which is a double-edged sword. But I will give credit where credit is due- despite being the weakest in the series, this is by no means a bad film. Just a little misguided and sloppy.Blade (Wesley Snipes... more on him later) finds himself in a deadly new situation. A group of vampires have conspired to frame him for murder (he assumed he was killing a vampire, but was actually killing a human wearing a false set of fangs), and he is captured by the FBI, who have been tracking him, thinking he is a delusional murderer. Whistler is killed in the raid on their lair, and Blade falls into a deep depression. At the same time, vampire Danica Talos (Parker Posey) is plotting to unleash the original vampire, Dracula (Dominic Purcell), in order to gain power and control over the world.Blade is freed by the "Night Stalkers", a group of young vampire hunters lead by Hannibal King (Ryan Reynolds) and Abigail Whistler (Jessica Beil), Abraham's illegitimate daughter, whom was born after his family was killed. At first, Blade is unimpressed by the young hunters, but eventually forms a begrudging comradery with them, in order to fight Talos and Dracula. (Whom also goes by the name "Drake.")The Night Stalkers have a plan, involving a chemical weapon called the "Day Star", and they need the pure blood of Drake in order to make it effective- if it works, the weapon could potentially kill all of the vampires in the world, yet it also might kill Blade, whom is half-vampire.The film is a lot of fun. I really have to give it that. To be honest, I started Blade by watching the first movie, but I know many people who started the series by watching this entry first, and they were sucked in by the great humor and the fun action set-pieces, which made them fans of the character and made them track down the other films.The humor is quite funny, particularly Reynolds as Hannibal King, a wise-cracking young vampire hunter who actually used to be affiliated with Talos. Patton Oswalt also gives a lot of chuckles as the tech-geek member of the Night Stalkers. But the humor is a bit overblown, as there was very little of it in the first two films, making this one stick out like a sore thumb. It's just too "fun" for its own good, and it ruins the mood a little bit.The acting is a little mixed. As has been mentioned by others many times before, Wesley Snipes didn't like the script, so at times, he completely phones in his performance, and it gets a little annoying. Beil, Reynolds and the others all put in fun, quirky and believable performances as the Night Stalkers, and Dominic Purcell is decent as Drake/Dracula, though he looks a little too much like a hot bodybuilder type, and doesn't come off quite as threatening as he should. Parker Posey is a lot of fun, and is gorgeous as always, but a few of her lines are kinda hammy, and some supporting actors and some of the minor characters kinda suck. Mixed overall.Goyer's direction isn't bad, to be honest. The film isn't nearly as stylized as the last two films, and is told through more straight-forward visuals. (Although Goyer gives some quirky touches, such as the appearance of the "universal language" Esperanto on all street signs, and some cool set designs.) The editing is a little hazy at times, but all in all, this is a well-made film visually, just not quite to the standard of the last two films. Ramin Djawadi's score is nice, but lacks the dark brooding nature of Mark Isham's score from the first film, nor does it have the operatic beauty of Marco Beltrami's score for "Blade II."I'm really torn with what to give this film. It is the worst of the series, but it is still a fun, fun, FUN film, despite its flaws, and it is the easiest film to watch, as it isn't quite as melancholy and depressive as the last two. I'm giving this a "strong 6"- it's flawed, but above average, and should be checked out by fans of the first two films. Let the final hunt begin!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Trinity" opts for more humor and stylish montages instead of good storytelling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you look under the genre tags for "Blade: Trinity," comedy is listed. That should tell you something right there. Yeah, I must say it is a comedy, but you're laughing at the film, not at its jokes. While "Blade" set the precedent for a franchise full of sleek action and intriguing vampire lore and "Blade II" at least manage not to degrade the franchise completely by staying entertaining, "Trinity" manages to give up taking the franchise seriously and it's shameful.Apparently, David S. Goyer, who wrote the first two films and produced the second, decided he wanted a third film so bad that he decided to write and direct it himself when Guillermo Del Toro ("Blade II") decided not to return and likely when many other directors turned it down. Goyer had only minor directing experience and it shows in this film. The script could have perhaps lived up to the other two, but Goyer decided to not be shy about humor, including plenty of terrible jokes. Aside from keeping true to the stylized fight scenes of the first film, the only thing Goyer does right is continue the great pacing of these films, because despite being bad, "Trinity" never gets boring."Trinity" takes place not long after "Blade II," where Blade (Snipes) becomes wanted by the FBI who are of course corrupted by vampires led by Danica Talos (Parker Posey from the Christopher Guest mocumetaries like "Best in Show," a waste of her talent). This time, the vampires have unearthed Dracula, the first vampire, who takes the human form of a young, muscle-bound, dark-skinned Englishman (Dominic Purcell) in effort to eliminate Blade, their only real threat. Where Ryan Reynolds ("Van Wilder") and Jessica Biel (WB's "7th Heaven") come are as the "Nighstalkers" (Nightstalkers, Daywalkers...it does all get a bit confusing) a couple of gadget-loaded vampire hunters who have been running their own operation and now aim to protect Blade by helping exterminate Dracula.There's a lot going on in "Trinity" and there's really no focus or clear motivation for anything that the characters do. The film lives from action sequence to action sequence, distancing itself from any actual ideas/themes that could enhance the storytelling or deepen Blade's character. The three films have progressively gotten worse at this to the point where it's nearly non-existent. There's really no continuity in the film, with too many bad characters, actors and sub-plots. I'll give Goyer points for bringing in Jessica Biel, she's absolutely gorgeous and Reynolds' "Van Wilder" frat-boy humor makes him certainly perfect for the part, but those parts are of course horribly written. Reynolds knows his character is never taken seriously and so rather than half-ass the jokes, he just plays them up so that at least it's not awkward after awhile.Being released 2 years after "Blade II," you can tell "Trinity" was just slapped together. Goyer borrows the chin-opening model Del Toro imagined for the Reapers in "Blade II" and applies them to Dracula and a Pomeranian. He decides colored contacts are a must for vampires and that the sped up time in the city shots from the last films should be used on multiple occasions for no reason. There are also some useless scenes and weapon-loading or people-walking montages with music in the background. It's all about style and what each shot looks like, not how the film looks as a whole, which is a waste of what the series could have become based on the first film.</fullReview>

But the effects are great, especially the dogs. And again the predator faces are back. For me still part one is the worst due the stupid effects. This one hasn't got to much CGI except for the overlord, something between the devil and predator. What's funny is that everybody is complaining about the resemblance to The Matrix,well, they put a little gimmick in it that will make you think of the Matrix. Anyway, good movie, have given it a 7 for the suspense, would be less without it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Blade: Trinity (2004, Dir. David S. Goyer) Blade is back on his quest to rid the world of vampires. When the original vampire, Danica Talos returns, Blake is going to find his job a lot harder. Especially, when the public believe Blade is the real villain. He teams up with the daughter of Whistler, Abigail and a former vampire, Hannibal King to attempt a plan, which could destroy every vampire in existence.The third movie in the 'Blade' trilogy has a lot to achieve, especially after two successful movies. The action is top notch again, and the story can be quite interesting, but still doesn't feel as well made as the first two movies. Blade teams up with two new characters. Both played by Jessica Biel and Ryan Reynolds. Although they are not bad actors, they just didn't feel right for this movie. Im a big fan of Ryan Reynolds and found him great in the film. But professionally, i found he was just too comedic in the film and really toned down the horror of the series. That's what i think the big problem is in this film. There are a reduced amount of scares and horror in this film than they were in the last two films, and this really affects it. Still, it is an entertaining film, which you can at least enjoy and have fun with."Back off, Pooch." - Hannibal King (Ryan Reynolds)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first two blade films were good. The first kick started the recent vampire trend in movies and TV series and the second had a fresh feel thanks to the direction of Guillermo del Toro. When I saw, therefore that the guy who wrote the first two films had been given the directing duties I thought it would be a success. I couldn't have been more wrong. 1. The plot is a mess. 2. The supporting characters are a joke, just awful. 3. There are close to no action scenes worth any merit. Isn't this supposed to be an action film?In short, if you are extecting anything good from this film, don't get your hopes up.Rating 3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There have been many, many, many people who have seen this movie and decided that it is the worst movie ever made, trashy, etc. I'm not even going to try to dispute what others have said. Rather, I'll present my own thoughts on the film.First, the editing. This is a hot topic for many. The editing is quick, flashy, and stylish, but not jerky or overdone like AVP. I think it suits the movie very well. I'm actually a big fan of taking risks in movies and for directors experimenting with what the medium has to offer. There are infinite possibilities when it comes to cinema, so why hate on a movie just because it doesn't use standard, boring film cuts. I for one applaud David Goyer for showing some style.Second, the story. How can one say Goyer sucks when he wrote all THREE stories? He obviously knows what he's doing, and it shows in the film. There have been a lot of complaints about the Nightstalkers, and how the movie should be about Blade, not them too. Hmmm... what about BLADE 2!? Does anyone remember the Bloodpack? Moving on... I personally liked the manhunt on Blade in the beginning of the film. It brings a nice taste of realism to film that reminds me of Blade 1. While it may not be as in depth as the other films, the story in Blade 3 serves its purpose, but honestly it takes a backseat to the action here.Third, the action. What can I say, the action in this ACTION MOVIE rocked. I love seeing Blade kick ass, and Jessica Biel did alright too. Hannibal wasn't very martial arts inclined, but he made up for it with the weapons handling. Once again, the stylish editing and cinematography come in to play here, and it makes for rocking visual feast.Last, but not least, the music. I'm not usually a big fan of the music featured in the movie, but in the movie it works wonderfully. I recommend seeing this in the theaters, because the music is LOUD, pumping and fits the action perfectly. When the movie was over all I wanted to do was go kick some ass, Blade-style. Summary - If you even remotely like action movies, this is a definite must see. Same goes if you enjoy flashy, loud visually engaging movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>from bad-ass to plain bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Blade used to be cool. That's right, Blade - the comic and the original film were both great, action-packed and well-written. For me, Blade was a decent vampire flick compared to all the nonsensical vampire films that were either dull or without any substance. Sadly, the third instalment of the series seems to have joined this category (the second was just incredibly mediocre). It's as if Goyer suddenly decided he couldn't remember how to write a decent vampire story, and started looking to the worst examples of the genre for guidance. Snipes brings absolutely nothing to the role, and apart from baring his teeth a couple of times, they may have just used a waxwork to replace him. I realise he's supposed to be a hardened, bitter character, but there's a point where you need to see even a hint of a thought-process. When he witnessed Whistler's death in the first film, that was a great moment. Now he sees it again, and it's as if he decided, well I've been through this once before, so I'm used to it by now. As soon as Dracula (or "Drake"...) appeared on the scene, I couldn't believe what I was watching. Had the Blade films really run its course that quickly that they had to resort to a storyline so tacky that it didn't even make it into the Buffy series until they got desperate for ideas. And really, I think that sums it up. If you're the sort of person who thinks the idea of having Dracula in a Blade film is a good one, then you'll probably love this film. And on another note, why do all vampire films seem to have an obligatory scene where someone outlines which vampire "myths" are not real?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blade Still Rules</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Forget about Arnold, Vin, Nicholas, Dolph . . . Wesley Snipes is the real deal. For sheer excitement and intimidation, Blade has no peers. This was true in the first and second films, and continues into "Trinity." Blade really has never been about horror, though the bad guys are always horrible enough. Blade is about action, pure and simple, and this one wins Best of Breed. Blade is an action hero - period. He's bad enough to be bad, but not so bad that we can't relate to him, much like Arnold in T2, only Blade is at least half human. Blade's story is a heart breaker, for sure, his mother being "turned" with Blade in utero, but we are never subjected to any excessive sloppiness when it comes to our perception of the inadvertent half breed. His mission is simple: kill vampires, as many as he can find.In Trinity, Blade is faced with the resurrection of a critter whose claims to fame include a stint as the incarnation of Dracula - prototype of all vampires - and possibly the ancient fish-man deity Dagon. Whatever he is, "Drake" is bad and he's ugly (at least in his pure form; untransformed he looks remarkably like hunk Dominic Purcell.) Drake has been pulled from a deep sleep in the Samarian desert to help a vampire coven - led by the incredibly weird Danica Talos (Parker Posey) - defeat the great vampire hunter and save their species from being driven further and further underground.Our favorite chemist and weapons maker, Abraham Whistler (Kristofferson), makes his third appearance as the aging and bitter survivor of a vampire attack that left his wife and daughter dead. Whistler doesn't make it too far in this film, however; the suck heads take him out (again) during another raid on Blade's lair (see Blade 1.) Whistler has a secret this time; born-out-of-wedlock daughter Abigail (Jessica Biel), ex-familiar Hannibal King (Ryan Reynolds), and a group of nerdy brainiacs who call themselves "The Nightstalkers." After some initial nay saying, Blade agrees to allow them to help him avenge the death of his friend and handler, and send Drake packing back to the hellhole he emerged from. Drake is a worthy opponent for Blade. Unlike the garden variety vampires that Blade usually dispatches, Drake has evolved to the point where he is, like Blade, a day walker, only Drake is not dependent on any serum to keep him in the light. He is a vampire's vampire, with an unquenchable thirst for humans, taking four or five at a clip. He's not thrilled with his new found vampire buddies either, viewing them as inept clods that he has to handhold at every turn as they clumsily track our hero. Their strategy, however, proves very effective; Blade is caught on video inadvertently killing a familiar. Familiars are repulsive ("I hate Familiars"), but they are human, and killing humans leaves tracks. Blade's name and picture are plastered all over the place, and the FBI, tracking him for years (don't worry - you didn't miss anything. The FBI just kind of comes out of the woodwork for this movie), gets its first big break. Naturally, this FBI section is run by vampires, and they prove more than able to subdue Blade and take him into custody.The main feature here, besides Blade himself: weapons! Lots of them. From King's pistol collection, to Abigail's Compound Bow and especially her super-hot UV Arc (ever seen the Engery Sword from Halo? "Cuts through vampires like a hot knife through butter"), this is a collection that would make Osama Bin Laden drool. Loaded with sliver nitrate and vampire killing bacteria, the Nightstalkers are ready. The rest is non-stop vampire trashing and blowing stuff up . . . isn't that why you go to see action movies? OK, even this silver lining has a small cloud or two inside.Hannibal King not only gets beat up for the ENTIRE movie, but has a string of foul mouthed one liners that shock at first, then simply annoy. When Blade rescues him from Drake's dungeon, King isn't the only one who is relieved; we finally get a break from his incessant profanity-laden diatribes that add absolutely nothing to the film.The other chink in a mostly spotless film is the nagging question about Whistler's daughter. Not her origins; we aren't told much about that and it really doesn't matter either way. She's there to fight, and that's all that counts. The problem lies in her fighting ability. Along with her bow, UV Arc, and silver-shank-in-the-boot, she has supernatural strength when engaging the enemy mano y mano. The question is, how? She's human, yet she tosses super powered vampires around with the same ease as Blade does. She does it all with martial arts, and it just doesn't fly. I mean, she isn't Xena (but then, who is?) Set against driving hip-hop rhythms from the likes of L'il Flip, E-40, and Crystal Method, the movie rolls non-stop from opening to closing credits, and nobody feels cheated: Trinity delivers. If you liked the first two, this one's a shoe-in. Just don't dig overly deep for plot cohesiveness, and you'll have a great time.</fullReview>

Baby Born just sounds so real nowadays, even on screen. Even the lighting was perfect on its little plastic cheeks, how cute...

		<fullReview>If the 'carry on' gang had done a vampire movie the result would probably be something along the lines of blade trinity. This is no bad thing however and other po faced reviewers should lighten up. Blade has never taken itself too seriously and this latest edition is no exception. Ryan Reynolds is not to everyones taste but his wisecracking and colourful language really added to my enjoyment of the film. Wesley Snipes is as hammy as ever and although its true he has far less to do in this film its probably no bad thing as he seems to be having real issues with his prosthetic teeth. Schindlers List the musical would be a step too far but a funny version of blade really isn't the end of the world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Dull Matrix Clone Lacking Blade's Sharp Edge (One Spoiler)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Getting stabbed by a dull object is extremely painful. And that's how you'll feel after watching Blade Trinity.Blade Trinity is a blunt movie that lacks the sharpness of the series' first two installments. Gone is the over the top style and endless sprays of blood that made the first two movies so much fun.Instead Blade Trinity offers a battle between a super hero and super villain that's dull even for the contestants. Wesley Snipes' patented posturing and attitude mysteriously disappear after the first fight scene and "Mother of All Vampires" Dominic Purcell is just plain lifeless (maybe because he's supposed to have been at rest for millennia?). The fight scenes themselves have about as much creativity and choreography as a boy shooting ducks at an arcade.The result is a generic Matrix clone. That's right. Blade Trinity owes more to the Matrix series than its own roots. Both feature the black vet (Snipes/Fishburne), the kick butt woman (Biel/Moss) and the wise cracking white guy (Reeves/Reynolds). SPOILER: Then there are the strangely familiar plot elements like the "final solutions" proposed by both the Vampires and Vampire hunters and the trip to enemy headquarters to liberate a captured comrade. There's even mention of "The One." END SPOILERIt's all sad because Blade Trinity could have added to future of the series. Instead we're left reminiscing about the past. But that is the movie's one bright note. With Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone, Steven Segal and Jean-Claude Van Damme all but gone, it's good to see a pre-9/11 action hero in a 1990s-style movie once more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blade: Trinity is one funny, gory, ass-kicking, vamp-ashing hell of a ride - Storyline is rubbish though</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Parker Posey is hilarious. She struts in like a slutty way. I totally ate her performance up. When she and Ryan Reynolds were in scenes together, they play off each other nicely. Jessica Biel has the best weapons &amp; she's hot.Humour is a big part of this movie. Ryan Reynolds is by far the funniest with his sarcastic ways. There is a hilarious scene where Dr. Vance gets all talk-therapy on Blade. "When you drink blood, do you find yourself getting sexually aroused?"The ending i saw is rubbish but i heard there were 6 endings. It involves some weird dying exchange between Blade and Drake that just comes out of left-field. the voice-over (at the beginning and end) must go.The storyline is not very good and we could have seen more of Dracula. Also there a vampire-dogs. Funny seen again with Ryan Reynolds and the dogs.</fullReview>

We need a Blade movie at least every other year, if not every year. Seems to me to be a lot of money to be had and with the constantly growing fan club it can only mean better and better movies.

		<fullReview>I was really excited about seeing the third Blade movie 'Blade: Trinity'. But sadly, the minute the strange slow motion credits rolled I already began to have my doubts.To sum up briefly: 1) The film felt slower than the first two with less substance 2) I was disappointed with Dracula. Especially after having a fantastic Nosferatu godfather of the vampires type character in the 2nd Blade film. Dracula was unconcerned with the plight of the Vampires and his attack on Blade just felt unreal and pointless.3) What on earth was wrong with the really scary strong and powerful vampires? They mostly looked like they'd been living off heroin for 1000 years not blood! 4) Snipes seemed to be trying harder to keep to the standard of his previous two Blade films. But he looked fed up mostly and tired. I dunno, maybe the director didn't know how to get the best out of Snipes but the other thing that bugs me is that Vampires aren't supposed to age. Tell me if I'm mistaken but I'm starting to notice that Snipes isn't his perky youthful self these days.5) Apple Ipod?! I think the idea to have a bad ass babe listening to her MP3 player during battle was just a bit too stupid. Careless directing me thinks...She was OK, but again maybe the director just didn't know how to get the best out of the actors. And that Reynolds guy was really annoying! I really wanted him to die at the end.I wish I had waited to see this come out on my Sky movies channel instead of paying ?6 or whatever to see it at the cinema. Thankfully I didn't decide to see this film on my birthday, I saw House of FLying Daggers instead and it wasn't as disappointing. At least the directing was fantastic, the cinematography fab, the editing tight, and the actors acting looked right. Nothing was amiss.Hopefully if a 4th Blade film is made the director will pull things together. Get the best out of the actors, ditch pointless ideas and sloppy editing which make the feel and look of the film and acting seem slow. Get rid of the made for television style.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome movie, seriously under-rated!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I seriously have to say that people have not given this movie the credit it deserves. In my opinion, I found it to be completely entertaining. In fact, I find it better than the 1st two. Previously, I enjoyed the 1st better than the 2nd, but now I like the 3rd better than both.The 1st movie had an awesome plot and all, but was a tad bit to slow. Plus, there wasn't enough action at some points. About 3/4 of the movie kept me entertained, while the other 1/4 had me partially bored (you can never be totally bored during a movie if you're paying attention). The 2nd movie was pretty good, but the plot and the way that it was orchestrated was "just okay".The 3rd movie, to me, solves the problem from the 1st two. You're kept entertained the whole movie, there's never really a dull moment. I mean, the beginning is already Blade on a hunt. There's action throughout the movie, and the parts without action are kept lively. The plot of the movie was great, and it flowed perfectly. There was never really a moment when a part didn't fit with the rest of the movie.To add to the rest of what I've said, the actors helped portray the greatness of this movie. Each character had a different personality/attitude, each contributing to the team. Blade, as always, had his independent and emotionless appeal. Plus, the complete coolness of his butt-kicking. Abigail Whistler (Jessica Biel) added a cool yet reserved attitude to the team. She seems to try and act like nothing affects her, but at times you see her release everything she tries to keep inside. Hannibal King (Ryan Reynold) brings the funny wise-crack attitude to the team. Almost throughout the whole movie, he brings out the comedy in the movie, even in the face of danger. But, there are times when even he knows (or is forced) to act and take things seriously. To add to this wide arrange of personalities, they don't always mix. Instead of everyone happily getting along, there are disagreements and resentments even among allies.Overall, I found this to be an awesome movie. Maybe not the best movie in the world, but a very good one to say the least. Heck, I hope there's a spin off concerning the Nightstalkers! (have heard rumors about an alternate ending concerning werewolves ^.^) I give this movie a solid 9/10.</fullReview>

I really like the garlic in the vents, and the idea of the blood of the Dracula being able to vampires with in the vacinity is a good idea. Blades inhaler was and is a good idea makes things look more realistic, as for the bow with ultra violet rays is a bit to large for such a compact movie. The music on the movie was excellent.

		<shortDescription>It's underrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this movie has been consistently underrated. It's not perfect, by any means -- indeed it has some fairly serious flaws. But it's also never less than watchable, and despite it's problems I had a pretty good time with it, all in all.The direction is sharp and crisp and full of high gloss: the movie is put together well, too. I've read some reviews that criticize the fight scenes: actually I think they were choreographed nicely, although it's disappointing that the best one isn't Snipes vs Dracula, but rather Triple H vs Ryan whatshisname in a cage match kind of thing. But that one is great.I've also read reviews that make fun of the story. Yes, the idea of Blade fighting Dracula is ridiculous. But so is the idea of a half-human, half-vampire killer, y'know. We left the world of "non-ridiculous" the moment the movie started: if you're going to pick nits now, better that you don't go at all, frankly. There are real script problems here, but there's nothing wrong with the ideas in the story, per se.Snipes is wonderful. A good, intensely charismatic actor ill-served by Hollywood, he dominates every frame he's in. I would like to see him in better material than this, but it's nice to see him filmed iconicallly throughout. He carries a lot of the movie on his back and makes the implausibilities work.The sidekicks have gotten some bad press. Ryan whatshisname is amusing, and can probably find future work as wisecracking sidekicks. Biel doesn't have the presence to carry off action roles -- it takes a unique sort of skill, and often doesn't have a lot to do with acting chops, per se -- but in her defense there's not a lot to work with.The real problem here is the script, which feels like it needed more work. There's three separate ideas here: "Blade looked at from the outside"; "Blade inspires others" and "Blade vs. Dracula" and they all sort of sit in a muddle on screen, without really gelling into a whole. It feels like it needed another six rewrites or so. The sidekicks have a whole hinted back story: I would have preferred a lot more or a lot less of that, as it stands it's just sort of irritating. Plus, the logic of the movie demands Blade's death, and of course that doesn't happen, which is not surprising but still sort of disappointing.It's not great, but it's enjoyable enough, if approached on it's own comic-book terms.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blade: Trinity sets a new low for this franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Written and directed by: David S. Goyer Starring: Wesley Snipes, Kris Kristofferson, Ryan Reynolds, Jessica Biel, Parker Posey, Dominic Purcell I was kind of indifferent towards Blade: Trinity when I left the cinema. Now I aggressively dislike it.Isn't December supposed to be the month in which all the good films are released? Blade: Trinity sticks out like a sore thumb, but for all the wrong reasons. And no, I am not being hyperbolic. I was actually quite a fan of both Blade and Blade II, so this comes as a crushing disappointment. Probably more so than the awful The Matrix Revolutions.Fans of the famous vampire hunter, in both the comic book and on screen, deserve much better. Wesley Snipes, cool as he has always been as Blade himself, deserves much better. The blame should squarely be focused on David S. Goyer. He wrote the first two films in this series, but has been allowed to direct this one. Big mistake. On this evidence, he has no idea how to direct. (Snipes allegedly doesn't want to work with him again, and if that really is the case, it's no surprise.) The plots for the first two Blades WERE over-the-top, but there was so much else going on to keep you involved that you didn't really have to think about the story. Not only does this plot stretch plausibility even further, but the action, gadgets and atmosphere aren't even impressive. This is more like a weak comedy crossed with a below par episode of Buffy. It even has the obligatory female vampire slayer.We meet up with Blade again when he has taken care of another vampire - or so he thinks. It's a trap to get him into trouble with the law, and he is eventually arrested. Luckily he is saved by two fellow vampire hunters, Hannibal King (Ryan Reynolds) and Abigail Whistler (Jessica Biel), daughter of Blade's old mentor Whistler (Kris Kristofferson). These three - Blade, King and Abigail - form a "trinity", and find themselves battling against - wait for it - Dracula.You know a vampire franchise is beginning to run out of ideas when Dracula is brought in to be the main villain. It gets worse; Dracula, in the guise of nonthreatening Martin Johnson lookalike Dominic Purcell, makes Stephen Dorff's villain in Blade look excellent by comparison. The Blade series hasn't had the most memorable central adversaries, and this film certainly doesn't aid it in that area.But David Goyer has already made two major blunders on top of this. One of those is piling on the emotion in the midsection. (Take the corniness factor of the penultimate scene in Blade II, multiply it by five, and you get the idea.) Another, and this is what really ruins the film, is the overuse of the shaky-cam, slow motion shots and quick cutting techniques in the action scenes. Goyer does so to such an extent that we are beyond caring by the closing minutes of the film.Stephen Norrington and Guillermo Del Toro knew how to create the right atmosphere for a Blade film. David Goyer hasn't a clue. A film series that was once on the level of Spider-Man now feels closer to the level of Resident: Evil. How the mighty have fallen.Rating: * (out of *****)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, let's get this out of the way first. If you are going to see Blade Trinity and expecting a cinematic masterpiece, you'll come out disappointed.If you go expecting a fun, action-packed addition to the Blade franchise, you'll enjoy it. Just don't expect it to be better than the first two. This is a very different film to the first two Blade movies, this concentrates much more on action than any real plot, and where as the previous films mainly focus on Blade (with supporting characters like Whistler and the Blood-Pack), In 'Blade Trinity', Blade (Wesley Snipes) is pretty much shoved out of the spotlight to make room for his two new allies Hannibal King (Ryan Reynolds) &amp; Abigail Whistler (Jessica Biel).I'm not sure if this was Goyer's intention, but Hannibal King easily steals the show, any witty one liners that may once been used by Blade, have all gone to King and then some more humour has been thrown into the mix. I know many Blade fans are skeptical of the added humour to the film, but I personally think it's a welcome addition to the franchise, King's wisecracks are my favourite parts of the movie. The acting isn't exactly Oscar-winning (especially with the villains), but the actors do but in a good performance (Ryan Reynolds &amp; HHH put in much better performances than I expected). The fight scenes are more plentiful in 'Trinity' than in Blade two (which was mostly just shootouts) and are done well. I think Goyer has had some good ideas with this, such as the abilities of Dracula and a few references to the advanced 'Reaper' strain of Vampire.'Blade Trinity' is not perfect, it has is faults, some more obvious than others, but to some up, this is a fun, exciting action movie. When you watch it, don't think too much, just sit back, watch and enjoy the ride.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though not an amazingly outstanding movie, Blade: Trinity delivers exactly what its fans expect and a little more. The action is wowing, Jessica Biel is HOT (oh so very hot), and Ryan Reynolds actually delivers a surprisingly entertaining performance. Sadly the only downfall is the bland, overly simplistic storyline. But hey, is a complex character study really what we're looking for here? No. And thats why it still works.Blade finally comes face to face with Dracula and all's good until the final showdown which turns out rather short and pretty typical. But everything that happens around the two titans is sweet. Reynolds has a wicked fight with Triple H, Jessica Biel lays a wicked (and hot) smackdown on the guards, and Blade easily rips up a crowd of dudes in a pretty cool way. As for he man on man fight with Drake (or Dracula), they have a sword fight and make holes in the expensive marble ground with each others faces. Blah blah blah. They kick the crap out of each other and the victor reigns supreme. But who's the victor you ask? Don't be so sure its out caring little Blade, for if Dracula is killed with the ridiculous virus the humans have made for him, its very likely Blade will die too. Dun, dun, dun!!!!But all of that is just mild compared to what actually stood out in the film for me. Some of the greatest moments span from the opening fight to Blade's capture by the police just about halfway in. The video footage on TV and police reports describing Blade as a psychotic boogeyman prowling the streets were pretty neat/funny to see. On top of this, Blades showdown with swat officers at his hideout and the precinct downtown were pretty dam cool. It was just the overall fact of seeing Vampires VS Humans VS Blade in a gun showdown, with people being killed left and right, in crossfire and one-on-ones, who's hit? who's okay? It was sweet. Other than this the trio of Jessica Alba, Wesley Snipes, and Ryan Reynolds MADE the movie. The three of them play off each others characters and dialogue so well its really pretty impressive. And without Reynolds, believe it or not, I don't think the movie would have been as funny/interesting as it turned out to be. Though some are saying Goyer has done damage to the movie, this is far from the truth. Goyer has simply taken what his predecessors made great about the franchise, and has slightly improved upon it. Visually Blade was yet again just sweet to watch. The action sequences were intense, the lighting dark and eerie, and the effects were pretty much top-par considering the horrible looking fight in Blade's warehouse in front of the light grid in Blade II with that vampire chick and dude who's names I don't care to remember. Overall, if you're a fan of the series, you should definitely enjoy it. If your not and you've never seen the original two movies, you'll still have an easy time following whats going on and enjoy the shootouts. Blade is still as cool and stylish as ever, and Trinity is just another great addition to a sweet comic adapted franchise.9 out of 10. Its just cool okay.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lazy writing and too much swearing ruined the movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I Never thought I'd see a movie where the words f**k, c**t, and motherf***er are said so many times that I actually got sick of hearing swearing altogether. They officially swore so many times in this movie that it was ANNOYING, and I finally wanted the characters to just shut the hell up already.The word f**k is used one time in the movie 'Blade Runner', although they have removed even that one swear from the final cut, however the single use of this word near the end of the second act of the movie is very effective simply BECAUSE it stands alone as nearly the only swear in the whole movie, and by the time Batty does say it, it hits you like a slap in the face.This movie could have learned a lot from that lesson, but it didn't and Blade III has almost no saving graces, its loud, ugly, overly violent and as mentioned the swearing is so over the top as to be laughable and/or annoying. Swearing is not used by the writer to enhance the emotions of the character, but rather as a comma, almost every sentence has swearing in it where there would normally be pauses or commas.This type of writing is lazy, weak and just plain boring. About 95% of the action sequences have no dialogue in them either, more evidence of incredibly pathetic writing skills.I wish I could have found something good to say about this movie, I cannot think of a single thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>its all too clear to me that the writer/director used the blade franchise only to introduce the next generation of his invincible moneymaking models/heroes to us (the dumb audience): they are young they are pretty and of course they are both white. tell me when I'm wrong but i don't see that many movie series with a black man in the leading role. there goes another one... this movie is done 4 only one reason- to suck money from teenagers &amp; to prepare them 4 "oncoming highlights" with hannibal king and abigail whistler. OK *spoilers* on the way: by far the most annoying thing 4 me was the girl listening to music while fighting the vampires- like its all a video game 4 her &amp; u can see that she is a "progamer"(or maybe a cheater). yes, she handles dozens of vampires so easily (while enjoying some nice music), with her john carpenters "vampires" would be a 10 minute short film. when blade says "coochie coo" to the baby with stoic face i knew another great fantasy hero was dying, just like i knew it in terminator3 ("talk to the hand"). i don't even want to say anything about drake-boy (somehow he looked like a dockworker in his disco outfit).well maybe one question: what the hell did Dracula do in iraq?? oh and another: how did he transform into old whistler and other persons (thought Dracula didn't transform into humans..?) and why? and why the heck did he run away from blade???? the script is simply bad... no, I'm getting depressed remembering all those scenes, it is the burial of blade :-( funny thing the best one liner is not from ryan reynolds its from blade himself:criminal psychiatrist:"who is our president?" blade:"an a**hole!" :-P</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought Blade Trinity was excellent. They provided just the right mixture of comedy and darkness. Also I liked the fact that Blade spoke much more in this one. Parker Posey was quite annoying though. Does anyone else think that Blade should have gotten laid in this one though? Hey maybe it's just me. There were a few things in the movie that I was confused about though. For example, Whistler found Blade when he(Blade) was roughly 15yrs old, as we saw in blade 2. Yet whistlers daughter is quite a bit younger than Blade. Now, Abigail said that she was born after his family had been killed. How is he that much older than her? Blade knew about her though b/c in #1 Whistler said to Dr.Karen Jennsen, "Blade, myself, a few others have tried to keep it from spilling over on the streets." I assume he's talking about Abigail and her friends. Anyway I'm rambling. Final verdict, Blade 1, 2, and 3 get 2 thumbs up from me. (I may even get a tattoo:)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Forget any bad reviews of this amazing action movie, this film takes filming to the next level. The visual effects of this film are out of this world, you will be blown away when you see them. The film also introduces segments throughout the film of humour and we see the film debut of World Wrestling Entertainments number one superstar,the one and only Triple H. Also Ryan Reynolds is absolutely hilarious, he will have you laughing whenever he speaks. And the very beautiful Jessica Biel adds to the films intense action. But not forgetting the main man, Wesley Snipes. The vampire hunter produces another jaw dropping performance. He is definitely the actor of the year and you will see why when you see it. In conclusion, I say you must see this film and make up your own minds, and you will totally agree with me.</fullReview>

I was saddened by the death of good old whistler i mean, i thought he died during the sequel and seeing him again in this movie was good yet confusing, will he be back in number 4? I also felt sorry for the blind lady because the way she died was so awful, so gutless, and i really felt sorry for her and her daughter. Jessica Beil was great however i think Ryan Reynolds was being an ass throughout the whole movie and i think that triple H kept up his "everyone hates me" reputation by being an asswhole throughout the whole movie, but these things are what make a good movie a great movie!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally, action redefines it's genre. Recent action movies have lacked the excitement of their predecessors. The hokey lines that are meant for humor tend to fall flat, and gutsy fighting and live pyrotechnics have been replaced by CG. BLADE TRINITY brings us back to a world where action films can have serious drama and hilarious comedy along side some serious ass-kicking! I am a filmmaker, and I can say that this movie is a great template for future films. The casting is great, Ryan Reynolds is hilarious. The CG is only used where absolutely necessary, and the fighting has come back to a brutal, judo-type smackdown that hurts just to watch. The editing, the style, and the music choices are dead on. Amazing job. See this movie...it will remind you that films CAN be good again! (especially if you just saw Alexander, this will help restore your faith)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blade series conclusion at perfection</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All in all, Trinity was the perfect end to a well-written tale. There could not have been a better actor for Blade than Wesley Snipes. Of course then you add Ryan Reynolds and Jessica Biel in the boiling pot, and you have one heck of a comedy relief between the various buttkickings throughout the movie. Ryan Reynolds addition of his signature semi-perverted comedy style sealed the deal though, just as in his movie National Lampoon's Van Wilder. This is one series that I watched from the very beginning, and although it probably is the last in the series, it was perfected to the T. I personally commend Snipes, Reynolds, and Biel for their masterful performances, and would love to see more of their material in the near future.</fullReview>

Wesley Snipes is incredible in this movie. Ryan Reynolds is very funny in the movie. He just cracked me up in every scene he was in. Ryan makes the movie more enjoyable with his comedy. I believe he stole the movie right out from Snipes. He can turn out to be a great action comedy star. Jessica Biel is pretty amazing in the movie with her fighting scenes. Dominic Purcell is a pretty good bad guy.The bottom line is you will love this movie. If you are a fan of action and comedy this is definitely a movie for you. I think this is the best movie in the Blade Trilogy. It is a movie you can watch over and over and not get sick of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first Blade was awesome. So was the second, but the element of cheesiness was more present. Trinity was awesome because it took the necessary elements from the Blade storyline and combined them with the best action of all the movies and a strong influence of comedy. Some of the best parts of the first two movies were the most cheesy ones. Trinity never made the mistake of taking itself too seriously. The reviews I saw of the movie from both critics and general viewers made me think this movie would turn out to be lacking in the action/acting departments. However, it felt like a Blade movie except it was also a lot more funny. The humor was heavy at times but due to good writing and Ryan Reynolds' delivery it never got excessive. The CG was amazing as well, especially when Dracula change to his monster-esque form. It never looked fake. I am always looking for something cool and interesting in the weapons department and Trinity didn't disappoint. I was a little worried about acting from both Ryan and Jessica but they did fine. Ryan was never completely serious and Jessica wasn't boring. I am ready to see it again. I wasn't prepared to give this a movie a 10 because I reserve that for epics like Gladiator/Braveheart, but when I looked at the rank menu and next to 10 its has "(excellent)", I had to vote ten because excellent is what Blade Trinity was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Went in expecting another decent Blade film. This one exceeded my personal expectations. It's got plenty of action, plenty of drama, and a whole bunch of awesome stuff. Ryan Reynolds totally steals the show, and simply put is hilarious! This Blade is by far the best in my opinion, and you'll leave the theater just wanting to go back to experience the humor and action all over again. If there is a NightStalker movie, I'll see it just for Reynolds, cause he's worth the price of admission. One liners galore! The trailer is just a glimpse of what to expect. Don't believe the reports about the miscast of Dracula...he did a great job, and totally played the part. HHH is great in his scenes too. These have to be some of the best fight scenes I've scene, especially compared to the previous two Blade films. Ryan Reynolds doesn't do tons of fighting, but he makes up for his with his funny dialogue and one-liners.Go out and see Blade Trinity NOW!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie out did the first two installments times 2. I was surprised by the action sequence which out did the first two by a landslide. It also incorporated a new side that was quite funny ...This may sound strange but it was truly action packed, suspenseful, but also had a smart comedy side that quite frankly almost stole the show from Blade (Wesley Snipes). I am usually a hard critic but feel that this particular movie will appeal to everybody. I cannot see anyone giving this movie any negative feedback unless they are either blind,or crazy. It was by far even better than Matrix trilogy or Lord of the Rings trilogy. I am saying a lot and once you see it I can guess you will say the same. This will be a classic and will set a new standard in the Industry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst films of the year.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hmmm let's see where should I begin? arr..hmm, let's start with the plot. Searching, searching, searching?. Oh I finally found the sequences of poorly constructed events, which very well could be considered a plot. The latest Blade installment takes all the flaws of the first two films and expands on them, include in the lack of a plot. Pasting together a few scenes in the film, I think I've figured out the "plot" of the film. The film concerns a group of vampires who have summoned the world's first vampire (Dracula or Drake) back from his slumber in Iraq (or whatever the he was doing there) in order to kill the one thing that is stopping them from controlling the human race, Blade. Now Blade is your typical poorly developed action hero, who rarely shows more emotion then the Statue of Liberty on a rainy day. After summoning Dracula the vampires persuade him to find Blade. Meanwhile without much sense of direction Blade mercilessly fights his way through legions of vampires. After leaving over 1000 bodies the FBI locate Blade and arrest him. He is then saved by a group of kids calling themselves; the "Nightstalkers", which consist of; the attractive female and the usual group clown. Now these guys plan to use a virus to kill all the vampires in the world once and for all, but to do this they need Drakes blood. Blade reluctantly helps the Nightstalkers, yadeyadeya, whatever you get the point.Now the problems with Blade Trinity are not only the clichéd plot, but also some extremely stupid and mind-boggling scenes and continuity goofs, that really stand out and ruin what could have been; a mindless popcorn movie. OK here is the first one; Abigail the attractive female I mentioned before primarily uses a combat bow for her hunts. What's wrong with this is the bow tends to vary in its power throughout the movie. When the bow is fully drawn back it either; hits one vampire in the chest and stays there or shoots through more than five at once, from the exact same distance away. Not only does this scene question the movies intelligence, it also disrupts and distracts from the action scenes, which are also quite poor.Additionally one other scene occurs in the first half of the movie in which heavily trained tactical police officers (or whatever), raid Blades hideout. What appears to be laughable here is an old man defending it is able to shoot about six of them with a shotgun, without any of the officers moving out of the way or shooting him first. I mean, what's completely illogical here is the fact that some of the best trained officers in the world struggle to even raid a warehouse successfully and kill an old man who can't even hold a shotgun properly. Aside from being a relatively stupid film at the basics the film fails to deliver the essentials. The film has poor dialog such as; "I was born ready mother******!" said by Blade. We have terrible acting all-round from Snipes to Dominic Purcell (who plays Drake). This really makes you laugh instead of trying to care for them. Despite this caring for the characters is also hard as the characters are very poorly developed. This development consist of a simple statements said by Hannibal (Ryan Reynolds, when Blade Meets the Night Stalkers. Even the visual effects are terrible, as when the vampires die they explode into a cheap special effects consist of a burning skeleton. And believe me I have seen better effects in video-games. Speaking of video-games, even the action sequences and the gore (there is literally next to no gore, which was very well present in the first two) are worse than watching someone playing a computer game via a leaked video on YouTube. The fights always consist of a vampire jumping at someone and Blade or whoever shooting them back. The same formula is repeated throughout the movie. And this raises are further question how are mere humans such as Hannibal and Abi able to literally take on dozens of vampires at once, that are supposed to surpass them in strength and in speed. Overall "Blade: Trinity" is a poorly planned and executed film, with no redeeming qualities at all. It's better to use this DVD in place of clay targets at the shooting range then to watch it. This gets a strict 0.4 out of 10 for me, but unfortunately I can't rate below a one on this site. Hint, hint IMDb.</fullReview>

They coolness (Hannbal King) and mouth-watering beauty (Jessica Biel) just improve the movie and add to the overall value. Why is it so bad when Blade needs some help? It is not bad at all, actually. It adds some complexity and makes the plot more interesting and less predictable. In sum, Blade Trinity is the best part of the Blade trilogy, hands down. Action, suspense, tension, humor - everything is just right there and the mix is wonderful. A great movie, perhaps the coolest film ever. Grab your popcorn and enjoy it. A clear 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing movie to end a nice series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I used to hate Blade Trinity and whereas it grew a bit on me with time and I am no longer a hater, it still remains a mega disappointment.The movie is nicely filmed and its premise is interesting, as the near-extinct vampires go find their patriarch, Dracula, to help them fight Blade. Also liked the idea of Blade getting hunted by humans after he mistakenly killed one, having been set-up.The worst of the worst as to be the two new heroes. Hannibal King spends the whole movie cracking one-liners and it gets old very quickly, especially in a Blade movie where what you do not want to get is HUMOR. Blade is not a funny comic and shame on David Goyer for not getting that.Then you get Abigail Whistler. The fact that she would listen to her iPod while fighting vampires tells you how low-grade this movie has been turned into by David Goyer. It's already a FAIL to have a human beat up a vampire but to make it worst, it had to be a hot girl and she can take on many at the same time while listening to music. Absurd as hell, makes you want to throw something at your TV.These nightcrawlers' biggest achievement is to make vampires look extra-weak and to make Blade useless since they can dispatch vampires with such ease themselves. All in all, the movie itself becomes irrelevant after both vampires and Blade become obsolete.The bad guy himself looks more like a pimp or drug dealer than anything else and does not have the strong screen presence that Frost or Nomak had in the previous two movies. We actually barely see him until the end, except for a strange scene where he supposedly wants to see what Blade can do and for that purpose, runs away...?!? This all results in Wesley Snipes becoming a support cast in a Blade movie, which made many angry for good reason. Snipes gave life to an otherwise little known comic and he did not deserve such a bad movie and bad role to end the trilogy. Shame on Goyer and the studio for that.This being said, the final fight does work despite all the flaws leading to it, and this is what mostly saves the movie from total failure and absurdity. I also enjoy the new Danica Talos character, played successfully by Parker Posey. Most visuals are nice as is the camera work.This is somewhere between 3 and 4 out of 10 but at the moment of writing this review, I feel for the upside after seeing again the final fight. I do hope, though, that Blade gets another shot at the big screen at some point, this time with a director who has a clue and who will take the character seriously.</fullReview>

This film was made purely to capitalize on two popular films "Throw them a bone and they will eat it up and we can laugh to the bank"- except I didn't pay for it since I knew Jessica Biel and Ryan Reynold's were in it. Laugh on that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Drowned in it's own blood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can I say? This movie is on the s**t list for good reasons. One, it is a film that never really established any clear direction and turned into a huge mess with no discernible plot. The only mildly interesting thing about this abomination is the nonstop violence and action sequences that really add up to nothing viewers would like to feast on later (vampire pun). This movie proves that vampires really do suck (which is a pun on vampires sucking blood). Wesley Snipes delivered a very expressionless and downright boring performance as the title character. And I was expecting better from him. The Drake/Dracula character looked more like a fashion model(with fangs) and died a silly, pathetic death for someone who is supposed to be the greatest vampire of them all. Shows how mighty he was after all. Any third film in a trilogy is supposed to end with audiences having some food for thought or an ending that nicely brings the trilogy to a satisfying close. This trilogy never got that fitting ending. It was like someone almost making it to the top of a mountain only to say "I'm tired. I think I'll turn back now". Like reaching the end of a rainbow and finding no pot of gold. Or if, at the very end of the Harry Potter series, Harry and Voldemort decided to call it a draw and become good friends. The only thing that I remember from this film: A bunch of hunters kill some vampires and their master and then go home. The end. A lot of people said the first two Blade movies were great but this 3rd film just wants me to forgot the whole series altogether. It drowned in its own blood with no one coming around to save it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember watching this as a 13 year old and LOVING IT. I decided to watch it again after catching a glimpse of it on TV. The simple reaction is "I liked THAT?!"With all things said, this movie does have a few redeeming qualities such as Jessica Biel in tight leather and she has a shower scene. The fight sequences, unlike the predecessor, did not have any CGI and they were somewhat entertaining. Yes, that's about it.The movie starts out with a shot of blood and Ryan Reynolds saying the WORST opening monologue I've ever heard. I almost went back to see if he said "My name is Victoria Winters" and I missed it because that monologue was so embarrassing a writer of the early episodes of Dark Shadows would've been embarrassed enough to do a rewrite. I'd almost feel sorry for him if I didn't know that Ryan Reynolds is a terrible actor.Then you introduce the vampire villains. All of them bar Drake do nothing but whine. One of them actually says "I should've ripped his heart out when I had the chance" and she didn't do it...why?This movie also introduces humor in the mix of the Blade series. This might have been successful but the only time I got even close to laughing is when Ryan Reynolds says that Danica Talos' hair is ridiculous and she looks surprised and checks. She looked like one of the Soska sisters trying to play a huge joke by trying to imitate Superman. If I see a girl and the first thing that comes to mind is "Superman" there is something SERIOUSLY wrong! EDIT: I actually just saw her IMDb profile pic and shes actually not that bad looking which makes me hate what they did with her here even more.The acting is as good as it can possibly be. Wesley Snipes actually says "Koochigoo" on camera to a baby in this film while STILL keeping the tough guy act on which means he still can do a good Blade but the script he was given was awful. Ryan Reynolds is crap as a comedic relief and Jessica Biel is only okay. Dominic Purcell could've made an EXCELLENT Dracula, he just needed a better script.So where did this movie fall apart where the others mainly were entertaining. David Goyer. He wrote the scripts for the first two but here he also directs himself writing the script. He had nobody to say "tone it down" or "are you SURE this is gonna work?" because the directors of the other two; Stephen Norrington and Guillermo del Toro have proved themselves as excellent directors yet David Goyer hasn't had that luxury of making a single film to prove he is even on par with them.Overall yes this film IS better than most people say but is it still crap? Yes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welcome to the new world of Bullcrap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What do Blade ,Batman ,Daredevil ,xxx and Tomb Raider have in common ? Besides being above average,enjoyable and sometimes outstanding flicks they have spawned at least 1 sequel which completely ignores the rules of the prequel and uses it to create a pile of slop that torments anyone who sees it.Blade Trinity is a prime example . After watching Blade 1 and the even better Blade 2 I had high expectations for this thing especially after seeing that Ryan Reynolds was in it. God ! What did we do 2 deserve this ? The movies fails miserably in almost every category that its supposed to be strong on.When and I ask again and again when will directors learn that a SCRIPT MATTERS? Here the main villain is Dracula. Brilliant. The story is so bland that I can say in one sentence .Blade has 2 kill Dracula with the help of 2 sidekicks. THe acting is laughable .The dialogs and the childish use of swearing would probably make a 8 year old smile. The action is a combination of overuse of Cgi + Lack of proper choreography + Really sloppy fight scenes (The final sword battle between Blade and Dracula made me cry). The directors have not made an effort to make this movie look realistic or even slightly watchable. The main reason for this movie 2 exist is to promote hhh (who Im a big fan of IN THE RING, not in a movie) , show some really weird scenes (a vampire dog) . The level of emotions ,character building and proper screenplay is completely torn 2 shreds in this movieNutshell This is not a good movie ,This is not a popcorn movie ,This is not an enjoyable movie and damn as hell its not a Blade movie...I don't know what the hell this is</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blade: Trinity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Trinity definition: The union of three personalities (father, son and holy spirit) in one person, I assume that's the hero, or the villain, you make your mind up, I wouldn't know. Anyway, the critics certainly look down on this one as the low-point in the trilogy, I can agree. Basically Blade (Wesley Snipes) is set up for murder, and not long after his close friend Abraham Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) is killed, he is caught by the cops. Meanwhile, the bad guys, led by Danica Talos (Parker Posey) have brought the biggest vampire of them all back from the grave, Dracula, or "Drake" (Prison Break's Dominic Purcell), we could have seen that coming, just like Buffy. Blade manages to escape, and with the help of Whistler's daughter Abigail (Jessica Biel) and Hannibal King (Ryan Reynolds), otherwise called the Nightstalkers, they set out to kill the gang and stop them from getting Dracula's DNA (what?!) Also starring Paul Levesque, aka Triple H as Jarko Grimwood, American Pie's Natasha Lyonne as Sommerfield, John Michael Higgins as Dr. Edgar Vance and James Remar as Ray Cumberland. The director of the film, David S. Goyer, writer of the first two films, and other good works (such as Batman Begins, and a Blade TV series) is wrong, Posey is pretty poor, Biel is beautiful but boring, and Snipes remains cool in amongst the rubbish. The only reason I give this film an extra point is for the pretty good special effects, the action sequences (yeah, their repetitive, but one or two catch your attention) and Snipes, but besides that there is no point seeing this film. I would certainly confirm this is the least appealing of the three, and the first film is the only one most worth seeing. Pretty poor!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Favourite Movie...Ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know this is the least popular movie in the Blade Trilogy and I understand that because it is very different from the first two. But personally this movie totally kicked ass! It was enjoyable, fast-paced and funny, not to mention how many hot guys were in this movie.This was the first Blade movie I ever saw and it got me hooked onto not only the franchise but all things vampires. I'm glad that it was lighter than the first two because vampire movies are mostly dark and scary. I think this gives them a new dimension. Like that for vampires, killing people is just a part of their daily lives.So lighten up, this isn't supposed to be taken seriously!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've watched all three Blades, and really liked this one because it was edgier. I understand the one comment about siphoning off all of Blade's humor and fight scenes to Ryan and Jessica, but he's always had help. In the first film, it was the black chica. In the second, Leonor Varela. And Whistler's always been there as a backup. I found this movie better in terms of the technological advancements, the music, the dress, the lines, the action. Blade still got to kick Drake's butt in the end, so that was the important element of the film.Jessica's character was so poorly developed, I'm not sure who she was. Was she a warrior poet? She was so unnecessarily sensitive, it just made you go "Huh?". Blade was a little more quiet in this one, but he's pretty monotone anyway. You can't spark much conversation with the guy. I loved the look of the new vamps. Parker Posey amused me and she did an excellent job with her character. Ryan was the amusing sidekick and added an element of, "Please, it's just a movie" for all those hardcore fans.The first Blade was such a pre-cursor to the Matrix, it's not funny. It should continue to lead the path for excellent fighting scenes with it's smooth camera work. The second Blade was a little more boring, but you could watch it. I was a little put off when I found out Blade had to fight Dracula in the 3rd installment. Don't all vamp films end up with everyone fighting this guy? I mean, let him rest, wherever the he** he is (that's probably precisely where he is). But, Blade Trinity handled it well and in a poetic way. Can't say the same for Buffy when she had to fight him. What a poorly executed episode. Anyways, the movie is extremely watchable and fun to get into. It doesn't take itself too seriously and that's what makes it the best Blade so far. The feel of the film seems flawless, despite the numerous goofs technically. Any action film that makes me wanna get ripped and start carrying old school weaponry is a good movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can we sign you up for our Nightstalker secret decoder ring?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will be the first to admit that I harbor a secret fetish for the Blade series. Ever since I watched the first film back in 1998, I have thought that nobody could have created a better character than Wesley Snipes as Blade. His dark, brooding voice and personality seemed to fit so well into a role that was half terror, half heroine. It was a lethal combination that I thought worked perfectly. As the sequel arrived, I was still an enormous fan, but a bit skeptical about where Blade could go, I was impressed by the direction provided by Guillermo del Toro and as always, the acting of Ron Pearlman, so I was still hooked. This final chapter (maybe) brought us right back to the roots. A dark, brooding Blade has now been matched with some hotshot kids that prove that the battle against the vampires is getting to be too much for just one person. So, like so many other sequels, we add in some comic relief and new characters ? I was worried, because Hollywood doesn't have a green thumb when it comes to this overused device, but to my surprise, it worked perfectly. New characters gave new blood to this series and provided two hours of sheer enjoyment. It felt as if I was watching the original all over again.The excitement, the chaos, the thrill of the hunt were all present, and while the villain wasn't that menacing, it was fun to see Parker Posey place her high heels into a role that just seemed to fit. The characters and the actors that took control of their roles is what made this film the most enjoyable. I will stand next to my thought that Ryan Reynolds is the next Chevy Chase, and proved in this film that he can tackle both humor and action in the same stroke. He was phenomenal in this film, nearly stealing every scene away from Snipes. His blend of raw powerful humor and deadpan eyes seemed to fit perfectly into this world. He was a very convincing hero. The same can be said for Jennifer Biel, who could have used more screen time, but was still very exciting as Abigail Whistler. She seemed to provide that emotional depth to the Nightstalkers that was desperately needed. Then there were the Mighty Wind moments that I was not expecting, but was utterly surprised when it happened. Director David S. Goyer talked in the supplemental features about how he was watching A Mighty Wind before filming this and how he wanted to see how many of the cast of that film he could get into a vampire film. I am glad, because it blended expert comedy into this comic world perfectly. While Snipes kept his character traits from all three, it was nice to see a different blend of characters into this film, reviving this series from what could have been a trilogy nightmare.I think that David S. Goyer did a great job by deciding to helm this project. He provided the right amount of humor, darkness, and horror that originally created this series. He kept the tone light, while feeding the idea that perhaps Blade isn't the heroine after all, but instead this cursed creature forced to walk alone in the world. I liked the idea of Blade trying to find some friends, and fighting along side of someone else. It was impressive to see a more human side to this half-vampire that we did not see in the first two films. I could see where Goyer was trying to show Blade evolving, and I can only applaud Goyer for trying this. Sure, there were elements that just didn't work at all in this movie, which may disgust some faithful viewers, but for me the good (humor, characters, and story) outweighed the poor. Dominic Purcell was not that convincing as a villain, while his true image looked more like a Predator instead a vampire. There could have been more used with the rest of the Nightstalkers than just creating weapons and shooting hoops, but again, Goyer took these weak moments and added enough classic moments that you could easily forget the bad.Overall, I was extremely impressed with this film. Ryan Reynolds stole the show, proving that he can handle even the smallest of roles no matter what the genre. I am hoping that the whispers of a possible Nightstalker spin-off is definitely in the works because I could thoroughly enjoy what both Reynolds and Biel created in this film. Their chemistry and intensity really pulled this film together. Also, check out the special features to this film. I am not normally one to watch them, but for some strange reason I was pulled in this time and really enjoyed it. There is an alternate ending, which just had me laughing and thinking of how big this comic world really could be. Blade: Trinity was a decent story coupled with some amazing acting that pulled this series away from a possible fatal death.Grade: ***** out of *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>blade trinity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The blade trilogy is the best series of movie I have ever seen. The first movie set the scene perfectly for a high fighting fast moving action thriller. This movie is where blade (Wesley snipes) runs the streets slaughtering vampires. Then the second movie didn't disappoint reluctantly i admit that I didn't see it but the reviews I read said it did not let the first movie down. The final movie blade trinity was action from the word go. In the start we have three vampires attacking whistler (Jessica Biel) who is disguised as a mother carrying a baby to hide the fact she was part of the group the night stalkers she eliminates all three without to much effort or messing up her hair too much. You then get the main character blade who splits up a vampire meeting which leads to a high octane chase through the streets and ends up with blade accidentally killing a human, worst of all Danica Talos catches this on film and give it to the FBI making Blade a wanted man. Later in the film we meet Hannibal king (Ryan Reynolds) who tries to take on the vampire's. In the beginning he does this quite successfully but when he is left without his electric pistol (a creation of the night stalkers) he is quite useless in my opinion. I mean he got beaten up by Danica Talos (Parker Posey) the female vampire in charge of the vampire group featured in this movie. She is a vampire granted but being able to beat the Hannibal king, former vampire and leader of the night stalkers it is a bit pathetic in my opinion. But even having this sad character in the movie could not ruin the excellent movie Blade Trinity. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>movie was too fast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the first two Blade movies, I wasn't expecting too much on the story part of the movie. I was looking forward to Blade's moves and seeing Triple H on the big screen. It's always a good thing when you don't expect too much from a movie because chances are, you won't leave the theater utterly disappointed.It was a good movie, purely enjoyable. It was fun to see Blade perform his moves again. Ryan Reynolds was a good decision, too. He provided a lot of the humor in the movie, which was needed to distract the people from the otherwise faulty plot. And since they had a professional wrestler in the movie, they, of course, had to incorporate some wrestling movies in their fight scenes. Hehe. Cheap thrill for me.On to the bad part, pacing was too fast. People will definitely not watch this for the story but for Blade so the producers don't want to bore the audience. But it was just too fast. Blade II was better for me.Actors were miscast. Dracula, played by Dominic Purcell, was so unimpressive. Parker Posey was convincing as a villain, as usual, but her vampire teeth are so distracting. You think she's not still so not used to it? Character developments were too forced. That thing with Jessica Biel and the iPod was a bit lame though. It's not very endearing.And my biggest gripe of all, there was just too few action scenes. This must be the reason why I loved Blade II. The action scenes there were the best. Oh and one more thing, I will never look at a Pomeranian the same way again.I'd recommend this if only for some light-hearted fun. It won't kill you to try watching it. Just don't expect it to be a great movie because it's really not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Action Genre Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was simply meant to be a fun movie with an action component. And Blade Trinity does a perfect job of meeting that goal.What I liked most about this movie is that its action scenes looked less computer generated than in many recent 'Action' movies.Unlike, Spiderman and even the Matrix 2 and 3, the movie is shot in such a way that the viewer feels that the action is real and not just people on wires doing things that only a computer is capable of.In fact, many of the action scenes in Blade Trinity were original and intense (I love the sword move in the last segment of the movie).In addition, it was wonderful to finally have a movie that could put good action together with a decent soundtrack.One of the things that I was most miffed about with the Matrix 2 and 3 is that the soundtrack was not as complementary to the action scenes as it had been in the Matrix 1.The soundtrack for Blade Trinity does what the soundtracks for the Matrix 2 and 3 failed to do. Blade Trinity's soundtrack recognizes the importance of the right music for each scene, and entertains the viewer with the perfect mix of action and music.This movie is not brain surgery and it was never meant to be, but it is interesting and engaging.Good going guys!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was off the chains!!!! Don't believe the negative press concerning this film. This movie is indeed better than that utter crap they call "Blade II." That movie was so terrible that it should've been called "Bullsh*t II." This movie had it all, that is, great action. The action sequences were top of the line and they really upped the ante for this film. Especially the beginning action sequence. Man, that was something. "Blade: Trinity" seemed like it had a little bit more dramatic moments in it than the past two Blade films. The dramatic moments were done well which was accompanied by an excellent score also. The score for this film is perhaps the best musical score out of all the "Blade" films. This movie is terrific. A must see. If you haven't seen any of the "Blade" films you should definitely see "Blade" ignore that mess they call "Blade II" and watch this film. A must see for action fans!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blade III (c'mon wes!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading Anne Rice vampire books and then watching Blade 1 &amp; 2 -- I thought vamps portrayed in the Blade flicks ruled compared to Rice's terribly homsexually-toned books &amp; movies (nothing against gays, but just cuz you become a vampire doesn't transform you to a gay one, or metro-sexual at that). Blade 1 &amp; 2 were awesome in comparison to other vampire flicks I've seen. The only other vampire movie I like is Nosferatu w/ Willem Dafoe- that was some real sh!t.However, for me, the quality of the Blades went down after viewing Blade 3- Wes' lines were terrible as compared to his work in Blade 1; the story was weak, even the fight scenes were hard to follows cuz of all the overly tricked out camera shots. And that main vampire they were after- was too pretty and looked like he sold suits in an Armenian men's fashion store in Glendale. The way his monster self looked was great though- nice make-up. I wanted to punch Hannibal King- lines were bad- and really took away from the seriousness of the film- why was comedy needed? Vampires were taking over the world- and we have this clown questioning Blade at every scene- Blade shoulda just killed him- afterall, Hannibal only killed Parker Posey and 2 dogs. Oh Parker- not a film for her to star in-she's only good in comedies- she looked so clumsy in her role- compared to Dorff's acting as Deacon Frost in Blade I, she was plain weak- too funny &amp; funny-looking to be bad. Maybe Kate Beckinsdale &amp; her should have switched roles.I hope there's a Blade 4- I still have hope that Wesley can pull it off- maybe he should be in a crouching tiger hidden dragon movie- cuz he's one bad mf!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blade Trinity...terrible.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie should have been called, "Blade: 90210". I could have handled Dracula being the main villain...it's cheesy, but I guess it's OK if he shows up in a vampire flick. What I can't handle, is that after they wake Dracula up from his centuries long sleep, he looks like he was on Queer Eye For the Vampire Patriarch...that's right, Dracula is a metro-sexual. Merry Christmas. This movie had too much back story. It sounded like this story they were filling me in on could have been interesting to see...like maybe in the first two movies of the series. It also had too much comic relief. Wesley Snipes normally makes a convincing tough guy, but when you have him striking tough guy poses and add a companion who cracks jokes about him doing it, he becomes a caricature. Too much product placement...I understand that this is how movies get paid for, but don't beat me over the head with it. How does getting a close-up on the Tacoma insignia further the story? Do I need to see Jessica Biel downloading songs to her I-pod every time she is going out to beat vampire butt? Does it make for a good film to see her making a production of putting them on as these supposedly deadly creatures are rushing in for the kill? Well no, of course it does not...but hey, don't you want a cool I-pod now?I could have forgiven all that, but the end made doing so impossible. Remember, Dracula is a metro-sexual, and apparently he demands that his fledglings shop at Abercrombie and Fitch. But the vampire hunters...they shop at Old Navy, and apparently the two just don't mix. The type of Carnage seen in the film's climax hasn't been seen since these two stores had their after Thanksgiving sale. Everybody was good looking, dressed nice, but casual, and they were plenty mad.If you're a fan of the Blade series, wait until this movie is released on video, then wait until one of your friends rents it and make fun of them for spending cash to see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slightly entertaining, and the worst Blade to date</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like I said, Blade: Trinity is entertaining; but the worst of the franchise. And there are many reasons for this (possible spoilers)...Firstly, I didn't enjoy the fact that it didn't have that "Blade feeling" to it. I was thinking through the whole thing, "Okay, how is this different from Buffy?...What makes this unique to Blade?". And by the end I didn't find the answers.I don't know about other people, but it really moved away from what I saw and felt with the first two. One of the things I noticed was that there wasn't NEARLY as much action as the first two, and therefore not nearly as much blood and gore. We were simply left with ash. I mean, does anyone remember the first Blade when blood flowed from the sprinklers in the ceiling? What happened to that type of Blade?Also, when there was a fight, there were barely any vampires involved other than the main villains, and that scene with the unrelated vampires at the bus station. That's one of the things I enjoyed about Blade II. The fact that the new race of vampires were literally wall-to-wall really intensified the film. For most of the scenes, we saw henchmen (which I question the logic: If they are human, how come the vampires don't eat them? And if they are vampire, how come Blade simply knocks them out with one hit?). So ask yourself, if there are only a few vampires that they actually DO fight, how desperate is the vampire situation?And that's another thing....Something that irritated me a hell of a lot, was that I didn't get the sense that there was a real threat against the good guys. Sure, Drake is a powerful vampire (who I might add can dodge bullets, yet uses that hi-speed ability only when shot at, and not in the final battle), but do you seriously believe that he's a match for Blade when he runs from him? Or perhaps by the fact that you really don't get a sense whether Drake worked with, for, or above the other vampires.Goyer also introduces this fascinating idea of the FBI on Blade's trail; but abandons that concept up until the last five minutes where he reminds us that they're a threat. By this time, I think everyone had forgotten about them, and if they hadn't, they didn't consider them a threat because Goyer hadn't shown or proved to us that they were.Anyways, I could go on about bad qualities of this film (Snipes coming out of character, tools used, the overall reaction to Whistler's death, and how long they recover from it, etc.), but the idea behind this is a review (and I think you know where that will be going). I entered the theatre thinking that it would be fun flick, but not a Oscar winner by any means. And in fact it wasn't even fun. However, on some level it was at times, entertaining. Overall, 4/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where do I begin with how annoying this movie is?!First of all Wesley Snipes is an arrogant smart-ass. In the original he had emotions, he could be physically injured. Here no vampires are a match for him except the ridiculous Dracula. Yes The Dracula ineptly played by Dominic Purcell.Second of all Whistler is killed within the first 20 minutes. The way he was brought back in the sequel was stupid. But I guess they realized he was too strong a character to remain dead. In almost every scene there is an annoying techno song playing in the background. The product placement from Apple is shameless and annoying. And the soundtrack of the movie is what Biels character is listening to. Give me a break. Jessica Biel is sexy and delivers the best acting performance in the movie. And she can really kick ass.Ryan Reynolds character is stupid and useless.The first one had it all, a great plot, a great villain: Deacon Frost, brilliantly played by Stephen Dorff and great action. I recommend just watching the original and stay away from this crap and the half decent sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Ending For The Trilogy, But Why Choose Jessica Biel?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think the producers of Blade: Trinity could of chosen a different woman to play Jessica's character, maybe Jennifer Garner, or someone more established with acting, not a pretty girl from "7th Heaven", either way, I loved this movie, I think it had a great ending, but it did leave me with a few cliffhangers, why would the Super-Vampire become Whissler for a moment, and what happens to Blade at the end? There was a bit of comedic entity added to Blades personality which wasn't there in the previous two films, I thought this was a good plus. Another thing that bothered me in this movie was the choice of using a wrestler, Triple H, as an actor. He just ruins the point of the movie, hes just there for laughs, and he uses some wrestling moves. The idea of having a wrestling superstar, I think is just to sell the movie. If your a Blade fan, like I am, go out and watch the movie, I thought this was going to be sold out when I watched it, in fact the theater was quite empty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ah, they were doing so well?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, so the original Blade was a sad, ridiculous mess, Blade II was awesome, and in Blade III, rather than continuing the upward arc started by the first sequel, we get another sad, ridiculous mess. Back in the old days when I was writing a review of Blade II, I mentioned that I wouldn't be too disappointed to see Blade III come out in a few years. Well, I was right, I wasn't disappointed to see Blade: Trinity come out this year, it was WATCHING the film that disappointed me. We're right back to where we started, but at least the comic relief was funny, if completely out of place, and Jennifer Beal was just ridiculously sexy, I couldn't believe it. This movie made me want to start lifting weights so I could be as muscular as HER. And that is to say nothing of Ryan Reynold's whose impressive bodily transformation rivals the results of Brad Pitt's in Fight Club. I also want to say that he has come a long way since Van Wilder, but he hasn't. He's still the same character, he just has bigger muscles and can fight better.Of course, the most surprising thing in this movie was the complete transformation of Parker Posey into the Gothic vampire Danica. Consider her role in Best in Show compared to her role here, and you have a truly shocking change. Not for a second did I see Parker Posey under all that black and white make-up, colored contact lenses and fangs. It wasn't until after I saw the movie that I realized it was her. I had no idea she could move her lips like she does in this movie! As for the plot, Blade has become a wanted man, admitting under captivity to be responsible for something like 1100 or 1200 deaths. But they were all 'familiars,' he explains. He hates familiars. It seems that the vampires have conspired to have him kill an innocent non-human person on live television, destroying his image in the eyes of the public and sending the cops after him. It is indeed strange when he is deemed mentally incapable of standing trial that a team is brought in to take him away, and no one in the police station seems to take any notice when they all start beating the crap out of each other. On the other hand, when they left, they leave the building through the lobby of an office building, so maybe it wasn't a police station after all. Mr. Bean introduced the movie-going world to Whistler's mother in 1997, now we are introduced to Whistler's daughter, who is one badass daughter indeed. In keeping with the lifestyle of her father, she is also a vampire hunter and killer, and is introduced to us in an outstanding scene where she is attacked by a group of guys at a lonely train station. She does, however, have a curious little quirk. She likes to listen to music with big beats while she's fighting vampires. I guess she doesn't worry about things like hearing vampires sneaking up on her or any other such nonsense.Product placement is one thing. I admit that I am wholly incapable of seeing a name brand in a movie without immediately thinking of it as a commercial, but I have no problem with product placement. Blade III, however, literally and completely stops in its tracks in order to turn into an iPod commercial.Twice.This is complete with a screen shot of iTunes, some slow motion shots of her putting in her earbuds wearing all manner of cool clothing and sunglasses, and a detailed description of how she makes playlists on her iPod so she can listen to music while she's hunting. The only thing they left out was the word 'download' or some phrase like '99 cents per song.' Then the selling out would have been complete.Which leads me to the character of the Original Vampire. He was born perfect, and has never had to evolve. He's played by Dominic Purcell for the majority of the time he spends on screen. Purcell gives a great performance, but the previews led me to believe that there would be some epic confrontation between Blade and the most powerful vampire that ever lived. Having them kill each other would have been the perfect end to the trilogy, but no. Once Drake, as the vampire is called, takes on his true form, he gets killed seconds later. I guess Apple didn't fund the film enough for much screen time for him. Drake does, however, have the expandable jaw that we saw featured on the Reapers in Blade II, but I was really disappointed that they were not in this movie as well, especially since they are the best thing that ever happened to this franchise. There are some cool vampire-killing gadgets, although one curious little bow-and-arrow looking device is described as being 'half as hot as the sun.' Given the fact that the sun can burn you from 93,000,000 miles away, consider what it would do if it's heat were cut in half but it's distance from earth was zero. I would predict at least one accidental structure fire.The vampires themselves explode into showers of sparks and dust the moment they're touched with silver, completely erasing their threat and placing even more importance on the final conflict between Blade and someone who can actually resist attack, but that fight just doesn't happen. It's over as soon as you realize it's starting. And by the way, could the most powerful vampire who ever lived not think of anything better to do than take an infant hostage while running away from Blade? No wonder Blade can't be stopped?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For Starters, Who the hell gives some of theses writers their jobs. I mean Really, The Blade Franchise is totally ruined now because of this movie. David S. Goyer Apparently does not know his facts about mythology, i mean Dracula has nothing to do with Dagon. They are two separate beings. And Dracula Was not the first Vampire, Cain Was supposedly the first vampire. As far as the alternate ending goes, a werewolf\Vampire Cannot exist because a vampire is undead and a werewolf is a living creature.The only way that would work is if the werewolf and the vampire were Magically fused together and the odds of the creature living after that would be nearly impossible. the geography where the vampires found Dracula is all wrong. Dracula Was in Romania not Iraq. And Come on, at least they could have given Dracula an original look instead of making his original form in the movie a Predator Rip Off. Silver does not kill vampires either, burning or cutting their head off and removing the heart and burning them is the best way for killing a vampire.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was great it was so surprisingly of what happened, but I can't give it away to you boys and girls. I would say that Blade Trinity was better then Blade 2, and I'm serious about this. I would rate this movie a 9 out of 10 because there were some parts in it that were just not right for the storyline. Blade Trinity was full of horror, action, adventure, and even comedy which makes it better and different from all of the rest of the Blade movies because in all of the rest of them it's mostly just horror, action, and adventure. Overall this movie is a perfect movie for you to watch, but I strictly advise you not to let children under 13 watch it. So if you go to see Blade Trinity I hope you would have as much fun as I did when I saw it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was a huge fan of both of the other Blade films. I had huge hopes for this movies as it's David Goyer's first time at the helm of the franchise he built. I have to say that I was both extremely disappointed and pleased with the movie. It's nowhere near the same as either of the other movies.The opening scene just about caps off the best of the action scenes until near the end of the movie. The plot is that the vampires have trapped Blade by making him up to be a murderer to the humans. The Nightstalkers, another group of vampire-hunters led by Ryan Reynolds, Jessica Biel, and Patton Oswalt, come to the rescue. The vampires then enlist the unstable help of their patriarch, Dracula. And then from there the plot starts twisting uncontrollably.I was disappointed in the overall sense of style of this movie, and there were far more missed opportunities for great action than ones that actually hit. There were even moments where they tried to turn it in to a horror movie.But what I did love about this movie were the details. There were a lot of moments in the movie where anyone familiar with comics just gets an instant sense of nostalgia. Not cameos by Stan Lee or catch-phrases. Not for any particular franchise, but just generic comic-like moments. The way the shots were set up, a lot of the dialogue. Things that I miss when I watch movies like Spider-man.Which brings me to another thing I was pleased with, Ryan Reynolds. As a fan of both Van Wilder and "2 Guys and a Girl", I was perfectly willing to let Ryan Reynolds take over this movie as Hannibal King. I can safely say that I would count this movie as a disaster if Goyer didn't entrust as much screen time to him as he did. His quips are great and he easily steals the show from anyone else on screen.Overall, I found this movie completely different than the other 2 in the trilogy, but not all bad. Things like keeping Jessica Biel's screen time to a minimum, and not having HHH say any meaningful lines resulted in a lot of mistakes being glossed right over. I give the movie a 7/10 for comic fans and 5/10 for people who probably had no interest in the movie to begin with.</fullReview>
