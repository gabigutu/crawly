		<shortDescription>Not enough for anyone else, but fans should enjoy it for the most part.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In what is only the fifth film of the Saw series released over its five year Halloween run at the box office, this latest installation suffers from the same detrimental qualities that made number four slightly disappointing for fans and casual audiences alike. Making his directorial debut here, all eyes are cast upon David Hackl to see if he can either bring something new, or at least keep the momentum going for the popular franchise. The good news for some is that Saw V feels natural and consistent to its recent predecessors helmed by Bousman, yet for many others this won't be something to get excited about. Insofar as the movie itself goes; this is mostly typical Saw material throughout, going through the motions almost. This of course will please those looking for a continuation of the previous instalments, but it will undoubtedly feel too stagnant and jaded to interest anyone else. Nevertheless, for his first feature film at the reins, Hackl proves he can live up to Bousman's style that has been engrained in the series thus far, creating yet another engaging and loyal sequel that will be sure to cater to those craving more twisted games.For many fans and casual watchers of the series, Saw figuratively died when lead character and focus for the film Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) eventually succumbed to his cancer in film number three. Yet just as instalment IV managed to incorporate the mastermind into its story, as does V in the same manner; through flashbacks. Playing a game of two sides and narratives that eventually collide, Saw V first and foremost continues on where we left from IV, detailing the continuation of Jigsaw's work through forensics expert Hoffman and how he eventually has to tie up all loose ends regarding the deaths of those in III and IV. This narrative, although a little tiresome in its approach of filling in every detail and hole in previous features, nevertheless provides as the real meat of the script. Characters are again rather shallow, and motives are less than clear, yet much of this goes out the window when Mr. Bell graces the screen with his presence. As he has proved time and time again, it is within the character of Jigsaw that Saw's real heart lays, and with plenty of reminiscing going on here in regards to numbers I-IV, there's enough material and characterisation work here to satisfy hardcore fans of the series.On the other side of the pitch however is a much less character/dialogue driven narrative which focuses solely on another unlucky five as they work their way through the latest of Jigsaws traps, this time set up by successor Hoffman. For those who attend screenings of the latest Saw movies only to watch people get their comeuppance through a series of bloody and grisly tests, then this will be where your thirst is quenched. Taking on a tone that is strikingly similar to instalment two, the challenges presented here are graphic and extremely cerebral, shot in the same berserk ways so far explored in the series (although, the blending scene segment style incorporated in IV is gone) which add to the movie's intense ability to draw you in.A consistently forceful element of the series, cinematographer David A. Armstrong here follows the movie's mantra of "don't fix what isn't broke", and the film's sense of coherency and embodiment of the script's themes works just as well here as it did in previous features. Sure enough, Saw wouldn't be Saw without its morally challenging undercurrent squirming underneath all the corpses and violence, and in this regard V does well to incorporate the same subtext. Of course as has been the case with all the sequels thus far, the message isn't quite as clear here as it was in the original, and the ideas always seem to be justifying the gore rather than the other -more appropriate- way around, but there's enough here to stop the whole ordeal boiling down to a silly slasher flick with no fibre to it at all.Needless to say there are many audiences out there who outwardly oppose everything the Saw series stands for, be it involving the gore, the message, or just the tacky horror-movie-sequel feel in general. Yet as I have been witness to many the genre has to offer so far this year I can safely say that while Saw V is by no means a masterpiece nor as significant as its first production, it still beats out most of the competition by quite some distance.In the end, the entire ordeal feels more like an add-on; a tid-bit of flavour designed to tie up the loose ends left dangling from all the other features, and in this respect V will feel a little underwhelming; even to rabid fans of the series. And yet, it's the fans that will make up most of Saw V's audience. I recommend V, but only to fans, and only because there's hope that VI (which the door is left wide open to here) might get the ball rolling again and begin to tell a new story. So by all means, if you can appreciate the series' unmatched ability to make you squirm, to have you question your moral code, and to fascinate you with its lurid, engrossing world made of cogs, puzzle pieces and of course, saws, then you can't go wrong here. Saw V is everything that fans of the series as a whole will want, but a lack of progression in narrative and its disregard for relevancy to anyone outside of its core audience inevitably cuts it short; not enough for anyone else, but fans should enjoy it for the most part.- A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A stumble, but still on mission.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched Saw V with a good opening night crowd here in Sydney. I've enjoyed all of the Saw films, predictably liking some episodes a lot more than others, and Saw V is, again, very watchable, with some intense moments and no shortage of grisliness. But I'd still say it's the weakest entry in the series to date. The trouble is that the main narrative addition for this episode, which has to sustain half the running time, turns out to be a dramatically weak one. I don't think a Saw film ever previously failed to create excitement or new meaning via one of its big twisty revelations, but Saw V's add next to nothing. The knowledge gained doesn't force any re-evaluation of the past events it concerns; you just see and know a bit more about them, and to no great effect, except for the fact that Tobin Bell's performance is always compelling, maybe even more so when he's talking to people who aren't stuck in Jigsaw's deathtraps.The Saw films have demonstrated an unfeasibly high success rate over time in terms of pulling off twist after twist and having them nearly all hit home. With this track record, it seems inevitable that there'd be a significant stumble at some point. They've never been bulletproof films (and thrillers are the genre that are hardest to bulletproof), but I'd say Saw V is definitely the stumble. In spite of this, it still keeps in enough with the series in general for me to be ready for Saw VI in 2009 - which I hope will be better work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Acceptable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To say the least, I was NOT disappointed. I enjoyed the film as much as I thought I would. Going in, I had some doubts, what with a new director and this being a fifth installment in a horror series (they usually start sucking by the 3rd). As soon as the opening credits start, you can already tell that a different director had his hands on the project. Acceptence doesn't take long to sink in though. As expected, the film meets the typical Saw requirements. Multiple traps and more revealing back-story. Simply put, Saw V should not disappoint the loyal Saw fan. I know I'll be back for the next installment with bells on.Seeing that this is the fifth film, you simply MUST see 1-4 in order to truly understand all the flashbacks. I don't want to give anything away, so all I will say is this: The very last trap in this film is one of my new favorites. . .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A review of mixed feelings...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Saw series has always been a standard of sorts. After what I felt was an iconic debut, the series has always remained consistently interesting, with one of the most compelling and ever expanding plots in film history. People may complain that the series is in decline, but what people need to realize is that each part is astronomically better than the corresponding parts of other horror series (for example, Saw IV is better than Halloween IV, or the 4th Nightmare on Elm Street film). The same holds true for Saw V, though the film definitely shows that the series is in decline and needs to end soon before it descends into pure absurdity.A universal truth of the Saw series is that every entry, no matter who does it, will always be well written and contain a plot twist or two at the end. Again, Saw V continues the tradition of revealing the 'huge' (if you could call it that) twist whilst "Hello Zepp" by Charlie Clouser plays in the background. The film answers as many questions as it raises, and serves as more of an origin movie, like Saw IV did. Only this time, the origin doesn't focus on John Kramer/Jigsaw, and therein lies the problem.Why does Saw V fail to impress me? Simple. Not enough Jigsaw. Tobin Bell, who has managed to create an iconic villain over the last 5 years, delivers another sublime performance that is not to missed in the world of horror as perhaps the greatest villain of the decade. It really amazed me how Saw IV had the best acting of the series, but just one movie later, pretty much every performer falls flat on their face. This is especially sad considering most of the cast are returning characters, except your typical "why is this happening to me! AHHH!" type characters (which got unbearably annoying, considering they killed off the two least annoying ones first). Meagan Good and Costas Mandylor are acceptable in their roles, however.Back to the lack of Jigsaw. Tobin Bell really doesn't physically appear that much in the movie, and that is far and away its biggest flaw. The film is similar to Saw II more than the others. To get my drift a little better, imagine the second film, except reduce Jigsaw's screen time by about half. Yeah. This is the only weakness of the screenplay for me, which appears to have matured from the over the top torture porn in Saw III and the ridiculous attempt to run Saw IV concurrently with its predecessor. The film's biggest flaw is in the acting and lack of Jigsaw. Besides this, I really felt that it fit the mold as a worthy entry to the series.After watching this, however, I no longer feel that Saw is the standard of excellence in horror as it once was. That said, the film has the advantage of being short and never dragging. It's well paced and will more than deliver the thrills. Another thing I feel obligated to mention is that this is the least scariest film in the series, which is okay, because unlike every other cheap horror film, Saw V doesn't try to be scary. It's more of a thriller with some gruesome images (like the first film) than a full blown horror movie (like parts II &amp; III).In the end, what it comes down to as far as your ability to enjoy the movie, you have to ask yourself this question: "why do I watch the Saw series?". If you watch it for the story and plot twists, you should be at least satisfied, if not entertained. If you watch the series for pure shock and awe and disgust, you'll be disappointed, because Saw V does not try to be a horror film outside of a few scenes. It's a decent entry to the series that is tolerable, despite a lack of the iconic Jigsaw, horrid acting, and a somewhat predictable plot twist (easily the most predictable of the series).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I believed how it ended</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Given that the Saw films are notable for their unexpected plot twists, the fact that this was the most predictable one makes it difficult to see why it scored the "You won't believe how it ends" tagline. Otherwise, it's decent. It blows Saw III out of the water, but I don't feel it really compares to the other three. I can appreciate that they're trying to bring it back to what the original was all about; a brilliant plot with a couple of gory scenes (the previous two have been somewhat gore-laden with little story for my liking), the problem being, unfortunately, that the plot is fairly weak. The intensity of the torture scenes is greatly increased, though, by the rest period between them. As a horror film, this works, but don't expect Saw - and don't expect to be blown away by the ending, because it is nothing special. That said, if you're addicted to the Saw saga as so many of us are, there's no harm in going out to see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SAW V - Hyped to be a miss but definitely hit.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like everyone else, I was expecting this movie to live up to the hype and be absolutely horrible. Since though I have seen SAW I-IV, I had to go see this at the midnight showing. What started it off, I was already impressed with that I saw. As the movie was going forward it was hard to tell how it would all add up. By the end though I was expecting to be disappointed and it really did not.While SAW fans will appreciate this, it really depends on what you like. If you are expecting a SAW II - III where it is mainly gore and such, maybe not so much. If you are like the few who want to know more about the story, then it is a must to see this.Now while every question is not answered, it makes up for it in its own ways. Do not be like me or most of the people who were hesitant to see this film due to people not enjoying it. I think many people would be surprised on just how great this film really is. To me, it was the best since the first one, despite the weak twist and sometimes cheesy kills. Then again, name a film that has been perfect because everyone has a fault.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of all the SAW films so far this has to be the worst! Where all the others had twists you could never see coming or endings that nearly everyone was shocked by this film was a massive letdown.There was no imagination going into the traps in this film. They were nearly all as gruesome as possible with no real thought going into making them all seem different. They just seemed like nothing made any of them different or original.The size of some of the contraptions were ridiculous and totally unrealistic to have been made by any less than a team of probably half a dozen engineers. The SAW films have gone from being shocking but realistic situations like two men handcuffed to radiators in a room to completely far fetched unrealistic situations.As a huge fan of the series of films I was bitterly disappointed when the credits started to role and I just sat there thinking "was that it?!" Honestly this will ruin everything you love about the SAW films, if you love the rest then go and see it just to say you've seen it and so you can just get the tiny little bit of the story this film adds to. If you've never seen any SAW films before go and see ANYTHING but this film.I know this just sounds like a rant about how much I hated this film but if you've seen the rest, go and see it and I really think you'll agree with what I'm saying. Shockingly bad is my final thought! a real letdown in every way!-tom_lewis86-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the strongest, but it's still SAW</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After so many sequels, one should expect a series to be driven to the ground. Although it's getting a bit tiring, Saw fans, &amp; for that matter, fans of gore, shouldn't be disappointed with the fifth movie. Saw 5 still follows the same routine of the cat and mouse game... but of course, as always, telling you too much of the plot is a ruining the game for you. Let's keep it at the thin plot description already given: a detective goes out of his way to make sure that his secret is kept, before an agent uncovers his identity. The subplot involves 5 individuals who are somehow connected, and must work their way out of traps.The traps still prove to be especially cruel, perhaps a little too cruel, but even that is worked into the story. It involves quite a bit of the past, much like Saw 4, it will give you more of the origin of the characters, whether it's needed or not. Minimizing flashbacks, it instead will fill in a number of plot and character holes.This is David Hackl's directional debut. Considering he's been around since Saw 2 as production designer, this is a solid step forward. There's no doubt that these somehow ingenious, if not over the top story lines that interconnect were made up well after the fact, but that doesn't change the fact that the scriptwriters were keen on at least making an effort to do exactly that. Tie things in, making the package look neater, &amp; hoping you don't think about it too much that you start to see the implausibility of it all.If you have not seen the previous Saw's, you will be lost here, as you will be left with confusing tie in's and past incidents that mesh too well with the present. It's just not kind to new viewers.All in all, I can't complain about Saw 5, because I got exactly what I expected. Clever, deadly traps, uncomfortable situations, &amp; of course, the "twist" at the end. There's no denying that one particular actor that's been in all the Saw's is especially good at what he does.For the most part, I would suggest waiting for a rental. I think that some viewers may grow tired of the series because it comes out every year. The nature of an audience viewing sequels is that it dwindles in number over time, as "sequelitis" sets in. But if you enjoyed the previous Saws &amp; all their abusive, bloody, cruel, &amp; heartless drama, you don't need me to suggest anything to you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saw 5 - One pointless prologue to Saw 6.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**Review Written With Possible Spoilers** So i just saw Saw 5. And how to sum it up.. I think my brother summed it up best as "One long ass prologue for Saw 6."Now i remember the first saw being one of the best films I've ever seen. Saw 2 was a major let down to me.. it was just too random and didn't have the calculated brilliance of Saw 1. Saw 3, i actually didn't mind, just because i found it more interesting then Saw 2. Saw 4 was pushing it but i kept on watching just cause all the little questions that had built up over the series had to be answered otherwise i couldn't sleep at night.. So we come to Saw 5... And what HUGE revelation do we get in this movie? ...... Well... actually we don't get one. Oh sure there is the back story of how Hoffman became the new saw killer.. But its so cheesy that a 6th grader could've strung it all together. And the story isn't...well...Good... There is no twist (none... NONE..).. And the entire movie we just see an agent going from scene to scene of the old Jigsaw crimes.. and somehow imagining how they all happened... by just standing there (and self narrating the past events..). There is a sub plot involving a bunch of 5 other subjects.. but if you don't pick how that ends after jigsaws "i wanna play a game rant" Then you've obviously never watched a saw movie. (**major spoiler** -also the 5 people in that subplot game didn't seem to mind killing each other at any given chance as well.. Not to mention it was random as.. the literally just turn on each other without giving reason.. then at the end instead of killing each other they decide to work together... it didn't really fit with the characters that we had been shown through the movie... Im surprised that the guy didn't shove the girls arm into the trap after finding out she was the one who set him up for the murder of the 8 people.. He just goes "Its your fault I'm here... But hey.. lets work together... Umm... OK...).OK.. So lets ignore the terrible story that doesn't go anywhere (not to mention the B grade acting..) So we come to the traps... Saw 3 + 4 mainly rode on the fact that the traps got more and more gore filled then the original first movies.. And that helped carry them a bit since the story was semi lacking... So I'm confused why every trap in this movie... Is... Well lame.. We see a guy get sliced in half lamely.. A girl lose her head.. Some dude blown away without seeing anything.. Girl stabbed in the neck.. and a couple of people bleed a little out of their arms (probably the most violent scene in the movie..) Maybe the other titles have desensitized me to gore and violence.. But it was all quite tame in comparison.Plus the lame attempt to fill half the movie with Flashbacks just to have jigsaw in the movie (while its nice to see Mr Tobin again..) just seemed like a massive time filler... Which sums this movie up nicely. Its just a filler. No questions are answered in this one... Apparently there is some huge underlining plot that we still aren't privvy to because the producers want to milk it for all its worth for at least another sequel. And you know what.. I'll see the damn sequel just cos i want to see how the series ends.. Which we all know is going to end with Hoffman getting killed by Gordan who will be the final new Jigsaw. We all know thats where its heading.... ;)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For Shame Hackl</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a huge Saw fan I can say without a doubt I look forward to each and every offering but this years installment was by far the worst of the bunch. I never claim Saw movies feature terrific acting( besides 1 and 3) but 5 featured some atrocious performances. On one hand you have the wooden Strahm who is literally dictating his thought to... well no one, on the other is Julie Benz, normally a fine actress in Dexter, spouting of ridiculous lines that sound meant for trailers (ex. " It's our next nightmare"). On top of that the movie is just full of sloppy film-making. Let's start with Strahm, he's just unnecessary, he seems only to be there as a vessel to fuel the flashbacks. On to the main trap, The best of the characters is killed in just the second room. Why did they even have to kill him? He was savvy and sharp but I guess the director just wanted to remove all intelligence from this movie. Finally the ending. This might be the worst evidence of a cash-grab I have ever seen. There was no ending, as my friend put it " It's like they ran out of ideas for 6 movies so they cut five in half", and thats really how it felt, INCOMPLETE.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lionsgate and Twisted Pictures...what the crap! I'm offended."Saw V: What happened?" Did you run out of money? Listen...I realize it's just a movie. But when you have the four before it and you set a certain expectation, there is just no excuse for what we just sat through. I have seen movies made for $7,000 that had more substance than one single frame of this movie.- Score was mostly reused from 3 and 4. When you could hear it at all.- Unrivaled pacing problems.- There were massive technical problems. Looks like the digital intermediate never got finished.- Better than 80% of the movie is just reaction shots with no dialog. People standing around staring at stuff and each other. The other 20% is Straham SAYING THE PLOT OUT LOUD.- Speaking of which, this movie was very short. Am I correct when I guess that there were somehow massive problems with the movie and you guys went back and added Straham infodumping the plot and just took out the action and replaced it with dialogue-less reaction shots because there wasn't time to do anything else? - Did that include editing out the third act in its entirety? - Did you guys hold the Saw IV special edition DVD until after this movie was released so you could recoup losses from this movie because people will be so angry about 5 that they will be GLEEFUL to buy 4 on DVD? - Did you re-edit it in such a way that you knew you were going out on this one so you just tried to make do if you *HAD* to go out like this? - What in God's name happened? How can a movie be messed up this badly? It's like...you have the SAME crew. HOW DO YOU SCREW SOMETHING UP THIS BAD!? Anyways, Saw was fun while it lasted. They just messed up on this one big time. The whole movie is a disaster. We lost half the audience at the midnight screening in the third reel (when nothing was happening on screen...like most of the movie).There was no twist. There was nothing intellectual. Jigsaw said things he would never say. The characters had no arcs, and they would go between being crazy and entirely coherent. Again, there was no third act. The ending was lame.Normally, people cheer at the end. At our midnight screening, people just looked around and stared each other like it was a joke.It was the kind of screening that was SO BAD that people called their friends because they had to tell someone how unbelievable it was.You guys lost me on the Saw franchise. Sorry.1/10 (It was, after all, at least successfully *PRINTED* to film. The one thing they got right.) AVOID</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably the least interesting Saw movie as of yet.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, the Saw-franchise is beginning to get a bit tiresome. I'm still a fan of it thought but it needs some new fresh ideas fast.Of course in essence all Saw movies are more or less the same. However all previous movies still knew to keep me interested and guessing throughout the entire movie. It still featured some surprising and interesting elements, while "Saw V" really doesn't feature any. No big surprises or twists here, not even at the ending, which in my opinion was a bit weak and disappointing. Normally the end of a Saw movie provides a big twists that will leave you shocked and stunned in your chair, for a few minutes after the movie has ended. I missed this in "Saw V".The movie is also the least interesting Saw movie as of yet because it features some lazy writing. Normally Saw scripts are airtight ones but not this one sadly. It often takes the obvious paths.Like always it is also featuring lots of different plot-lines and characters again, although in this case not all are connected well enough to each other. Seriously, what have all those people going to the Jigsaw-trails have to do with the rest of the movie its plot? It just seems to be there because its a Saw movie and it needs to feature all these sick and twisted games. The story lines don't ever really get together well enough. The movie again is also featuring lots of flashbacks, which shows events that happened in the previous movies, often seen from a different side this time but some of these flashbacks however are quite pointless for the movie once you start thinking about it.I also blame Hoffman for it that this movie doesn't work out as good and interesting as any of the other sequels. He's the new Jigsaw and as of yet he also is the least interesting one. It probably also has to do with the fact that he is featured a lot in the movie, while Jigsaw normally always remain on the background. Also the reasons why he became the new Jigsaw, as gets shown in this movie, are a bit shaky and not exactly believable.The movie itself is perhaps also lacking in one clear good main hero and character.It still is a superior genre movie of course. It's concept alone is already good and interesting enough to please the genre fans and provides the potential for an infinitive amount of Saw-sequels. All Saw movies have a great look and atmosphere over them, though this one works out as the least effective one when it comes down to its atmosphere and horror/thriller elements because of the reason that this movie features very little new elements.The Jigsaw games themselves also seem less innovative and clever. It's still gruesome and lots of bloods and guts can be seen flying around but it's just less surprising and shocking all.Lets hope "Saw VI" will have some fresh new good ideas and a better script with some better- and more interesting characters in it.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Definitely Can't Believe How It Ended</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay i'm a very big Saw fan, and in my opinion, the directors should have just stopped making Saw movies after the third one. I could rave on about the fourth installment, but considering I'm writing a comment about the fifth, I won't. There were so many things wrong with this movie, especially the horrible ending. There was no twist mid-movie because they couldn't think of a clever enough ending.I'm also extremely disappointed about the lack of relevance the main Saw trap had to the movie. They all had something to do with a fire where eight people died...so what. But they'll probably reveal why they were all chosen in the sixth one, which I'm seriously considering not seeing.Yet another flaw, the crappy traps which could have easily been escaped by the seemingly mentally handicapped victims. At least in the final trap the two left had a moment of clarity realizing what they should have done to get out. But they ruined it by sawing half of their arm in half, when they could have just sawed off a finger and let the blood drain out.Alas, even more is wrong with this awful sequel. Detective Hoffman, in my opinion, seemed to be randomly thrown in to the entire storyline because the writers weren't clever enough to come up with a real twist. The story has become way to complex and I found myself, an avid film watcher, bewildered at points. Good thing Agent Strahm was there to reveal the plot line aloud and to himself.Now there's a series of questions that have been built up and Jigsaw and all of his accomplices are dead. So i guess the writers are going to have to come up with another random plot line, random character, take random scenes from the other movies, put the random character in them, and add a random trap that kills a bunch of moronic random people. Again.I hate to say this, but I actually caught myself laughing at the lame traps, stupid people, and a lot of Jigsaw's lines. (i.e. "Killing is distasteful.").All in all, this movie was a disaster, an atrocity not even comparable with the rest of the Saw movies. I gave a 2/10 sheerly because it gave me something to whine about to my friends for the next couple of days.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While this is still a watchable, well acted movie that continues on the Saw tradition well I have to give it a lower rating because it just was not as good as the previous installments. The plot and the traps that we have come to be surprised by seemed to be a more predictable and rushed along by the makers of the movie. It seemed like this movie could have just been tossed in with part 4 to make one big movie as the prequel to the next part. So to me it seemed like the studio just split up 1 movie into 2 parts to capitalize on the profits....which they have done well I might add because myself and many other movie goers packed the theater for the 5th Saw installment. So in closing I think this movie may be adequate for the die hard saw fans, not nearly good enough for new comers, and winds up lacking far more than it gives. That is why I can only give this movie a 5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will it stop if we say we learned our lesson???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lionsgate seriously needs to know when to stop. The tagline of the movie is "You Won't Believe How it Ends", but really, what I can't believe is that the series has NO end. I mean, if you look at it the way I do, the series pretty much died with Jigsaw. And that's saying quite a lot. Talk about beating a dead Jigsaw. Saw IV was pretty pointless but it had its moments. Saw V shows that the filmmakers are now trying to make money.The film picks up where Saw IV left off- Hoffman is now the newest person to carry on Jiggy's legacy and will do whatever it takes to get it un-noticed. That is, until Strahm survives one of his traps and is now off to kill Hoffman. Meanwhile, somewhere else, 5 test subjects are in a house, one named Brit, played by Dexter's Julie Benz, who wears a hilarious fright wig that somehow changes itself in every scene. The goal is to kill each other until one's surviving to get out of the house. Some traps include the necktie trap, and even the razor hand trap.And that's all you need to know. This one is a real dud, Not only are they carrying on a series that didn't need to be carried after our very own Jigsaw died, but they're also trying to be like Saw I in some bits and even Saw III. Plus where's the gore? With how gory it is, this should be rated PG-13. The only gory bit is in the beginning with the pendulum trap. Not to mention the ending, which sucks big time too, because there's no twist!!! I'm sure the Ultra Super Director's Cut with a Holographic cover, and even a ticket to Saw VI, will no doubt showcase all of its alternate endings, but at this point I'm not sure if I even care.Overall, this is a complete waste of time, and is just another attempt to milk the cow from Lionsgate and Twisted Pictues. Maybe I'll see Saw VI, but just to see how it all ends. Saw, your time is over, and it's time to pass your crown over to Bousman's upcoming "Repo! The Genetic Opera".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still good, but past the point of necessity.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, even though I was quite wary of this sequel (as I am of any series that goes past a third installment), I must say that Saw V is still pretty good. However, this might be one for fans only.The reason I say that is because the story this time around is not really all that necessary. Saw IV wrapped up the entire mess pretty good, leaving Special Agent Hoffman to carry on Jigsaw's legacy. This entry just reveals more backstory that, while still somewhat interesting, is not something anyone really needs to know. It doesn't wrap up any holes or really reveal anything new.In any case, this is a good entry, and I am amazed that the producers could keep it up for this long.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A different type of saw.......But flawed on what we were promised.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just got back from seeing the new saw tonight and i must say i was a little surprised. The Saw franchise has officially been run into the ground ever since saw 2, so you either really need to be a fan of the series or go in knowing all the saw movies and having an open mind. Knowing that this was probably just a milk the cow and grab the cash type of deal i was a little surprised. This saw film is different from all the others, it returns a little to its original roots.Much like the first saw this time around we are given more story and little on the deaths and traps. This movie seems more of a detective thriller than a gore slash em up type of movie however that still is present. The movie also moves at a slower pace. So here is my rundown of the film.The death traps to me seemed very unoriginal but i guess thats kind of hard when you have probably used them all, and overall that sadistic feeling is just gone now. The story continues where saw 4 left off and pretty much really stays the same nothing new really happens. The viewer may get more story but it's really unnecessary. The only new things we learn is how that detective came to work along side jigsaw. We learn nothing new about jigsaw or his past like we were promised. Also again his wife is left with nothing new other than a box with something in it that we don't get to see or hear from again...probably till saw 6. So overall the traps are kind of boring and have been done, you also get cheated out of some, the story is quite pointless, and the ending is....The ending is well the tagline reads "You won't believe how it ends" well guess what i can believe how it ended and all i'll say was wow it is nothing excellent or twisted. Just open ended no surprise or nothing unlike the other saw films, but maybe it's just setting up for the final act so there is no need to bring in other killers or major twists like the last saw films. Overall the movie was alright not great but probably more worth watching when it comes to DVD or blu-ray. Saw fans will probably either love this or even shrug it off because of its slower pace. For people who haven't seen all the saw's will want to avoid this one because of the constant flashback's and confusing story line.Best saw films overall: -Saw -Saw 3 -Saw 2 -Saw 4 -Saw 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jigsaw should be Stopped</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where do I start, this was a total pointless piece of Film making, and the franchise now is living of the name, which is slowly deteriorating. There is nothing fresh or exciting left about Saw any more. There are 2 Games in Saw V, the first game with the 5 Participants while at first appears to be the Usual, Play by the Rules and Survive, or Play as you wish and Die, turned out to be nothing more than a plot allow the FBI to think that Agent Strahm is Jigsaw, which in my view is not a worthy game for Jigsaw, his mission should be above such shallowness. The entrapment was tried in the first movie, when they planted the Doctors flashlight on one of his victims. The 2nd Game, is a Re-Hash of the game with Mark Whalberg from Saw 2, with the almost the same Rules,Stay in the Room and Live, or Follow your instincts &amp; The building will become your Tomb.Were there any good bits in the movie, well yes, there were some nice touches, Agent Strahm giving himself a Tracheotomy, &amp; Hoffmans Revenge on his Sisters killer was a very nice touch, and, oh, no thats about it, these touches while good, are not enough to hold a whole movie together.The Tag Line You won't believe how it ends, is a total let down, the ending was the same as Saw IV, and we already knew who took over from John as Jigsaw. You won't believe how it ends, more like, We could not think of a proper Ending so we re-used Saw IV ending. Poor Poor Poor.Also and Unfortunately in my view, one question was never answered and has left a unfortunate reason for Saw VI to be made, Whats in the Box thats Johns wife was given? In short, Saw V is like the Labour Government, It's running out of Ideas - This is a truly awful movie, and like Jigsaw, should be stopped. I pray I have the will power to leave Saw VI well alone, but I'm stupid like that and I just know I will talk the wife into going to see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though not the worst horror sequel I've seen, as a movie itself, Saw V was definitely flat, especially for an originally groundbreaking series that keeps getting worse. The acting and dialogue was seriously laughable, the plot crawled at times and attempting to explain every single frame of the previous films is definitely getting tedious. Would it have made Friday the 13th series any better if it was eventually explained where Mother Voorhees bought the car that took them to Crystal Lake or just who attempted to give Jason failed swimming lessons? The most comical scenes in Saw V were the flashbacks within the flashbacks, reminding me of the great Simpsons episode that made fun of this very tactic. And here's the spoiler ? another accomplice to the crimes? It's like the writers just keep making up &amp; adding to scenes/details of the previous films, as if the thought never occurred them to go in a new direction. I probably won't see a Saw VI if I learn of yet another accomplice, a plumber who rigged the bathroom from #1. Well, now, that makes all the sense! I so wondered how he made sure the plumbing worked enough to get the tub filled! Recommendation: Watch I, II and finish with III. IV and V should've been straight to DVD. Hell, Hellraiser gave up after 4 and went home.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw V was a decent film, but sadly it is nothing compared to the first 4 and is the weakest of the lot.I felt the acting was very poor at times from most of the cast, but Tobin Bell still managed a very good performance as the sick and twisted "Jigsaw", it's a shame he didn't get much screen time.The other problem I had with the film was that it didn't really feel like a saw film while watching, it seemed like they wanted to focus on the drama more than the actual traps. But with saying that, the main game with Malick, Brit, Luba, Charles and Ashley is VERY well done and entertaining, it's a shame they didn't show it more.Overall, this is a pretty good film, with a bit of a let down ending (but still shocking).PS. The rating would have been higher if they focused on the group game more.</fullReview>

The acting is just horrible and the story line is just ridiculous the only good thing about this one is the most brutal Saw death or maybe even movie death ever ( Wall closing in scene)This movie is about Marc Hoffman the last living predecessor of the jigsaw murderer. He sets us a new game as another FBI agent tries to close the book on the jigsaw murders and put away Hoffman for good.This movie was terrible compared to the other saw movies. Even the third and fourth one were much better then this one. These movies keep getting worse and worse</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Saw series definitely loses it's teeth.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is always SOME small pleasure to be derived from watching the Saw movies. Some teeny tiny bit, be it from seeing the nasty deathtraps placed in front of prospective victims, the irony of people realising their mistakes at the very last moment or even just the solid acting from Mr Tobin Bell (who, surely, can't believe how lucky he has been with each sequel released).That ends here though. Okay, there are still a couple of choice moments for gorehounds but this sequel (with Jigsaw's accomplice trying to stay one step ahead of a determined cop while 5 fresh victims are put through a few, surprisingly dull, trials) really loses it's way. While I did not enjoy part 4 of the franchise, that at least had the decency to throw some more great death scenes in there and fill out the runtime with back-story/flashbacks that were actually mildly interesting. This time around all we are left with is filler material - stuff that seems to have been cast off from earlier instalments either due to time constraints or because it was simply considered too ridiculous.The acting is pretty lame, although that has always been a factor of these movies with the possible exception of part 3, the script is convoluted, self-devouring and dumb while it thinks it's being smart and you really don't care what happens to any of the main characters. Even if you do care for them you can tell the final outcome as soon as you see them gathered together and hear their instructions.David Hackl the director just needs to remove the letter "l" from the end of his surname if he continues to give us movies of such a low calibre.See this if you like: Saw 4, Untraceable, Captivity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saw films back on track...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have thoroughly enjoyed the Saw franchise and am glad to say that for me, Saw 5 has totally resharpened the blade's teeth. The first Saw film was awesome, and Saw 2 built well upon the story and was excellent. Saw 3 was also good, but I felt that some of the intensity of the first 2 films was missing. Then after watching Saw 4, and even though I still loved it, the film seemed a bit too loose and didn't maintain that tension and atmosphere of the previous 3 films. Now, after seeing Saw 5, I am sooooo happy and pleased to have my love affair with this story rekindled. For me, the story for Saw 5 is excellent and has been directed in a way that has returned the tension back to the series. And I know some fans have felt let down by the lack of a huge 'reveal' ending, but the look of triumph and dominance in Hoffman's eyes as he watched his nemesis crushed to a bloody squishy death above him was classic. But all this is my opinion of the movie, so best make your own mind up...enjoy x</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First things first. I am a HUGE SAW FAN. I love these movies. I love the gore, twists, characters, just everything about it. I am actually surprised many people gave this movie a high rating but it defiently deserves it. I find it hilarious when people that hate these movies so much are always the first ones to go see it and the first ones to post bad comments on here. I think people just want a reason to hate this series because it has been so successful over the years but they cant find a reason. I found this movie just as entertaining and gory as the other movies. It has its plot and twists and turned out to have a pretty dam anticipating ending. The ending trap was wicked by the way and I totally didn't see it coming. The movie had a good pace, people in earlier comments said the acting was bad but it defiently wasn't bad. I always hate when people go so in depth to explain how crappy a movie is. I usually say to everyone, if it entertained you then the director did his job. Relax people its just a movie, if you don't like it that doesn't mean everyone else has to hate it. I can't wait for another one next year hopefully they continue the series. I give it a 10 out of 10 because its a worthy addition.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Slop. There' I'll say it. Trash, slop, gutter garbage. Dave Hackl has, in every course of thought, forethought, and even dreamlike subconscious, raped the Saw franchise. I don't mean like made it boring, or made it slow, no I mean made it incoherent, trashy, and completely illogical.I am a DIE HARD SAW FAN!! I will say that now. I LOVE SAW!!! But between little to no creative traps, absolutely terrible dialog, and the worst ending to a film since The Village (really the ending is that bad), I think it stands a testament how terrible of a director Dave is. Actually, come to think of it, I would have been happy with a M. night ending. What if...Jigsaw was really the number 5. And his witchery was the epitome of pure evil. And he had flying 8's that would ravage your children. That ending would have been better then what I just watched no more then 2 hours ago. I will not let this dreg sink in. Jigsaw is barely in the film, and so many VERY IMPORTANT questions are left unanswered, but not in a Saw way. Sort of like in a Clue or Jeopardy kind of way. It's like if Alex Tribek asked the question, nobody got it right, and then he didn't tell you the answer.The plot was horrible. The acting was bad. The last trap (involving hands) in the film was pretty good. The real last trap (that's not a trap, it's just uncreative and stupid) looked like something from a bad library book you steal just to resell it. Not good, not fair, not even terrible. If there is anything worse then abomination to Jim Jones, that is this film. God, Jim Jones couldn't even be this sadistic.</fullReview>

Meanwhile, the sadistic vigilante John Kramer (Tobin Bell), a.k.a. The Jigsaw Killer, and his apprentice Amanda are found dead and Agent Strahm (Scott Patterson) unexpectedly survives to the criminal's game.Agent Strahm is sure that Detective Mark Hoffman (Costas Mandylor) is a follower and apprentice of Jigsaw and seeks evidences to prove his theory. However, Hoffman lures Strahm and incriminates him making Dan Erickson (Mark Rolston) believe that Strahm is the criminal in another deadly game that Strahm has to play to survive."Saw V" is another stupid films of this absurd franchise. The gadgets and facilities used by Jigsaw and Mark Hoffman would be easily traceable and the owner or buyer could be easily found. Tobin Bell is a good actor but unfortunately I can not write the same about the wooden Costas Mandylor. Everything is pretext for torture and I really do not like this franchise. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): "Jogos Mortais V" ("Mortal Games V")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, let's get something straight. This film is truly awful. Yes, I've seen all the other instalments (although I did see Saw 2 prior to seeing Saw 1),and I would go so far as to call myself a fan. Saw 1 was the best, Saw 2 the next best, and so on. And to be honest, I can't really remember what happened in Saw 3 and 4, they kind of just blended into one film.And so to Saw 5. Believe me folks, save your money. I couldn't believe how bad it was. No plot, weak characters, poor acting, no twist at the end (couldn't believe it?) and a story that jumps around more times than a kid on a pogo stick. I couldn't figure out where the film was on the timeline at certain points - at one point I though Jigsaw had come back from the dead.The truth is, you don't really care about the characters, the games are poorly conceived and it seems that the makers just want to go for gore and guts without going any deeper, which would be the smart thing to do.I expect these films will just keep going and going, they should have quit while they were ahead but alas, money is the dictator. So 1 out of 10 I feel is fair, only because it didn't last longer than 90 minutes. If you have to watch this, wait til it comes out on DVD and go see Ricky Gervais at the cinema instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Little Imagination, Much Gore and No Jigsaw</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By the fifth instalment of the franchise 'Saw' was infamous; infamous for its abundance of what could be termed sadism. It's no small wonder that the BBFC did not outright ban 'Saw V'. If the British ratings system were tasked with only letting good films be provided to cinemas, then without question 'Saw V' would never have seen the light of day. The creators of the franchise turned not to a Director to complete 'Saw V', but to a production designer for the series. This would account for why Saw V's length feels longer than a month, the acting as torturous as the traps themselves and boring beyond belief. Even the small relief of Tobin Bell's Jigsaw is gone and we are given a dull villain with a complete lack of motivation; horrifying indeed.'Saw V' takes place directly after the events of 'Saw III' and 'Saw IV'. As Jigsaw and Amanda are dead, the only living Jigsaw killer is Detective Mark Hoffman (a grim Costas Mandylor.) He is praised and awarded after saving Jeff's daughter (last seen in Saw III.) However, not everyone thinks him the hero. Agent Strahm (an effective Scott Patterson) becomes suspicious of Hoffman and pursues him. Hoffman is tasked with carrying out Jigsaw's dying request, a further game for more victims. This group of strangers must realise their connection to each other if they are to win their game and survive.How do you rejuvenate a franchise, when its premise is running thin? The answer, you don't. 'Saw V' takes great joy in putting the audience through a test of their own. How many blood splattered set pieces will you endure before you walk out. Watch or leave. Make your choice. Many audience members, even the ones addicted to Jigsaw's twisted traps, will I am sure choose the latter option. You can't blame them. After 'Saw III' I thought I was desensitised to violence. 'Saw V' proves me wrong and shows that I have plenty of puke left. What 'Saw V' does not understand, is that it is the tension and set up that is fascinating in Horrors, not the pay off.Every sickly set piece tries to outdo the other, without creativity, spirit or a brain. Blood is splattered across the walls and all you can think is how worse can it get? As it turns out a lot. Jigsaw is replaced with the unlikable growling Hoffman. He would have been serviceable if the character he was replacing was not so iconic and key to the franchise's success. The supposed story holding together all the gory details is Hoffman's recruitment and eventual loyalty to Jigsaw. But we never feel that Hoffman has the necessary motivation to carry out the horrendous acts of violence that he so frequently does. He is obligated to carry out the tests, but only when Jigsaw is present. Why he continues is anyone's guess. Maybe the screenwriters know?If you thought the acting in 'Saw II' was excruciating, then you haven't seen anything yet. The actors and actresses cannot act, even if they were put in a trap for real, they would be painful to listen to. You get the impression that they were picked up off of the street or the premiere of 'Saw IV'. Horrors are lucky if they have likable characters embedded within them. But when I do not care about the predicament of any of the characters involved you know something went terribly wrong. The only redeeming feature of 'Saw V' is that we see a trap that involves the walls closing in. Gruesome? Obviously.'Saw V' is what happens when you hire a nobody for a Director, leave the casting choices up to a monkey and force random people off of the street to act. The traps sigh inducing, the back story laughable and the film a pain from first frame to the last, Jigsaw it would be best for all of us Horror fans, if you and your apprentices stayed well and truly dead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the fourth sequel to the gruesome horror movie Saw, where Jigsaw's deadly game continues despite his death, luring a new set of victims in his trap - five strangers trying to play a "survival the fittest" game. Meanwhile, Agent Strahm is on the trail of the case of Jigsaw's games and his apprentices.The story continues the same elements seen the previous three films, including mind-playing games, blood, gore and graphic scenes. It is pretty gritting seeing the five strangers take it out on each other in order to stay alive in the grisly game. The plot is pretty exciting like the previous films, but the disturbing elements of sadism and increase in gore will just make you wince and give you nightmares. The acting was also below average and the characters really seem ignorant as to what is going on, giving the Jigsaw a victory again and again, even after his death. This unending game gets more and more annoying as it progresses, making you wish all the carnage would just end.Grade D-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saw V</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While the blood and guts content hasn't changed, the plot twists and traps are becoming just a little less inventive to the point where you can't follow all events at once, from new director David Hackyl (production designer of Saws II-IV). Basically, following the demise of John 'Jigsaw' Kramer (Tobin Bell), his last apprentice Det. Mark Hoffman (Costas Mandylor) has found his body and the trapped little girl, and is praised as a hero. Meanwhile, after escaping a "test", Agent Strahm (Scott Patterson) who should really be resting is trying to find out more behind Jigsaw's crimes, and he slowly realises Hoffman's involvement. Meanwhile, five subjects are trapped together and need to find out their connection to each other, learn horrible lessons of teamwork, and apparently, only one of them can get out alive. Obviously there are a few flashbacks seeing how John met Hoffman, and them getting some subjects and the traps of the four previous films ready. Also starring Meagan Good as Luba, Betsy Russell as Jill, Mark Rolston as Dan Erickson, Julie Benz as Brit, Carlo Rota as Charles, Greg Bryk as Mallick, Laura Gordon as Ashley, Joris Jarsky as Seth and Mike Butters as Paul (from the first film). You can't complain about the inventiveness of blood spill, and some of the methods to make it happen, but story wise this fails almost completely. I think the biggest problem is that the previous film saw that Hoffman got a tape from John's stomach saying that he would get his test or whatever, he never did, so I'm afraid to say there has to be another film (which there is). Traps include: the pendulum swinging which only stops if the victim saws his hands off, the box that will slowly fill with water to drown, the wire triggered to pull the victim back into large blades for beheading, keys in jars (only three fitting safety points) and a bomb set for one to die, a bath for someone to go in and have electric cables connected to trigger door, and a box with saw to cut through arms to collect a pint of blood, and a coffin for someone to get out in safety while the walls slowly crush whoever is still inside. Okay!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's really no reason to review this movie. At this point only people who are fans really care about what others think about the newest "Saw"-flick. The only reason I'm writing this, is because I have reviewed all the previous entries in the franchise, so call it a tradition if you will."Saw" has become an institution by now. We expect gruesome death traps and the movies deliver just that with some sorry excuse for a story to fill the in between. In a way "Saw" is the only modern successor to series like "Friday The 13th", but while F13-movies were deliberately dumb fun, "Saw" always tries to outsmart the viewer with twists and turns. And that has become as annoying as the quick cuts and the cheesy stage design that are inhered in each sequel.Once again, the makers try to convince us that there are pieces of the puzzle that we haven't known, yet. The thing is, nobody is really following the story, anyway. Seriously, it's a major flaw of this series that the audience is expected to have all the complicated ongoings of the previous parts in mind all the time. That's another difference to F13-movies. That franchise had giant continuity errors, but at least you could enjoy every movie by itself. Besides, who wants to dive so deeply into the background story anyway? "Saw V" continues to explain how a crime that was committed three movies ago was set up. It's like a Jigsaw "Behind The Music"-episode, and I can only repeat: nobody cares.The storytelling is offensively stupid. One investigator keeps explaining the obvious to the audience by talking to himself. He figures most of what happened by asking himself a question and then imagining how things went down. Seriously, that's how he ties all the clues together. He magically guesses it.The characters are a joke. Shallow is too good a word. The chief detective (or whatever he is) is constantly wearing a headset. Did nobody think that would look funny in the finished movie? Then there's this group of people who have to go through a maze set up by Jigsaw (or one of his accomplices), similar to the people in part II. These characters could have jumped right out of "Cube", only they must have lost their personality on the way. It always goes like: "Hello! I'm the Junkie and I'm unpredictable", to which another character replies: "And I'm the alpha male. I'm going to hit you, because this is the survival of the fittest." They don't literally say that, but it's pretty damn close.As for the death traps, they're still gruesome, but somehow the fun isn't there anymore. It's become stale to always hear Jigsaw's (or his impostor's) neverending self-righteous babbling first, then see the victims struggle in vain before they ultimately die their inevitable deaths. And some of the traps aren't even very creative. The first one - I'll call it "pendulum of death" - was taken right out off a "MacGyver"-episode. Speaking of which, wouldn't it be great to see how MacGyver would deal with some of these traps? Here's an idea for part VI: "Saw: Jigsaw vs. MacGyver". Now, that I'd pay to see.Bottom line is, if for some reason you still haven't gotten enough of the same old same old, "Saw V" isn't much worse than the previous three parts. From an objective point of view though, this series should have ended after the almost perfect original. There's a sentence, which I'm afraid I'm going to have to put at the end of reviews to many more unnecessary sequels to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jigsaw murders continue.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The franchise splatters on. From the first gut splitting to the last bones snapped, SAW V manages to deliver. Forensic detective Mark Hoffman(Costas Mandylor)is in a mad scramble when he leans that his secret connection to Jigsaw(Tobin Bell)may be exposed. He does his best to rid every trace that links him to the gruesome serial killer. Agent Strahm's(Scott Peterson)investigation comes too close for Hoffman's comfort, but can he turn suspicion around? Meanwhile a group of trapped victims must learn teamwork to avoid their gruesome demise.Right when you think you've lost interest in the heinous Jigsaw murders...crack, splatter, squish...there just has to be a SAW VI. This installment features: Julie Benz, Betsy Russell, Greg Bryk, Mike Butters and Meagan Good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Definitely one of the worst films I have ever seen. Everyone regards the original as a fresh of breath air in the flagging, stagnant genre of horror films. But this effort signposts the determination of the producers to milk this baby for every last penny. The worst part is that they don't even try to hide it. There is the ridiculous excuse of a plot, which contains little imagination or surprise, but more simply, is just plain boring. The plot and the gruesome deaths are no longer even interwoven, the plot is simply there as an excuse to showcase some ridiculous gore porn. The action just cuts from one to the other again and again...I wasn't expecting a lot from this film, but it was so much worse. It's become this generation's Friday the 13th or Nightmare on Elm Street...what are the odds that we'll see Jigsaw rapping in a Saw 9? I will be glad of the year when I can walk around near Halloween without looking at adverts and thinking 'Oh god...they've made ANOTHER one'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw V is more of a filler that gives information. It is more slow paced then the other films. If you are a hardcore Saw fan you will like it. It tells the back story and what influenced Hoffman to join Jiggy. It leaves many open answered questions which will make you excited for Saw VI even more. If your expectations aren't high then you will like this movie. I warn you the twist is not good in this as the others. It is very well the worst so don't have your hopes high for the twist. The ending trap is just perfect and its my new favorite trap. There is a trap with 5 people and they go from room to room together. This seems kind of out of place but I still liked it. All in all Saw V is a welcome addition to the franchise</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After Saw 3 and 4, I didn't really wanna see more people die horribly for no ways. It was weird to me that someone would take orders from a dead guy. As Saw 3 came around, the horror and suspense was gone and it seemed to just be a gore show with another twist that led to another sequel, which is what this one did.The story continues as Hoffman tries to hide his identity as Jigsaw's apprentice. Agent Strahm believes Hoffman is linked to Jigsaw and tries to prove it, while another game of terror is in store for five connected individuals. Full of confusing flashbacks, not so much gruesome acts compared to the last sequels, and a horrible ending, Saw 5 was here whether we wanted it or not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Getting' Jiggy With It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the producers of Saw III needed to replicate the jigsaw killer's bathroom from the first film, they knew exactly where to turn: Scary Movie 4, which had already built a near-identical set for their movie spoof. It's entirely fitting. The Saw franchise is now virtually indistinguishable from the Scary Movie series. Except the former has better jokes.If you've wound up here, this far down the trail, you're almost certainly familiar with the sprawling backstory, as interlaced as any prime-time soap, so let's cut very brutally and without anaesthetic to the chase. Number five picks up immediately where the previous sequel left off, with detectives Perez (Karkanis), Peter Strahm (Patterson) and Mark Hoffman (Mandylor) leaving the house of pain in various states of disrepair.Perez is close to death; Strahm's on a stretcher, having given himself an emergency tracheotomy with a ballpoint pen tube to survive one of those fiendish traps; and a remarkably intact Hoffman practically skips out of the Gideon warehouse with the rescued girl.Given their wildly different outcomes - no. Hold up. Backtrack. Mandylor? Costas Mandylor? For any users unfamiliar with the surreal British TV news spoof 'The Day Today', that's a name that could have been plucked right out of the line-up. "An American election update now, with... Costas Mandylor." Brilliant name, though. If ever you're in the pitstops of depression, say the name 'Costas Mandylor' out loud a few times. Feels better already, doesn't it? Intoning the name 'Mandy Patinkin' aloud works just as well, if not even fractionally better.Anyway, given their wildly different outcomes, a Strepsils-craving Strahm suspects his fellow agent knows more than he's letting on, especially as Perez's dying words were "Hoffman". No messing about with red herrings here: as we've already gleaned from the previous episode, yes, it's him. He did it. That's our boy. The rogue agent's been aiding the enthusiastic Darwinist for ages, donning that pig mask and helping to set up the fun and games like an assistant cub leader.Through flashbacks we see how Hoffman was persuaded to become a protg (blackmail almost always helps), as Jigsaw aka the late John Kramer (Bell) guides him through the intricacies of helping people to rip their own scalps off. Or as the unexpectedly chatty serial killer puts it, "to explore a method of rehabilitation that will permit you to sleep at night".Unlike in previous sequels, Jigsaw orates at length, even humorously chiding Hoffman for his inferior handiwork, and stopping just short of coming across like a twinkly-eyed, hairy-eared grandfather with whom you might share a Cuppa Soup on a blustery autumn evening, as he warms your cockles with tales of dunking victims in vats of liquefied pigs' guts.The remainder of the film cuts between Strahm on the trail of old Jiggy's No 2 in the present day, Kramer's widow taking possession of a mysterious box as part of his will, and the progress of five fresh hostages in this 18-certificate version of 'The Crystal Maze'.So what ingeniously cruel games have the props department cooked up for our delectation this time round? In the past we've had The Rack - capable of twisting a victim's head and limbs a whole 360 degrees. We've had the Needle Trap - in which the key to a nerve gas antidote is hidden in a deep well among 120,000 filthy, infected needles. Just add woman. And we've had the Angel Trap - a woman (it's usually a woman) must retrieve a key from a jar of acid to stop a timer device that will tear her ribcage open. In the event she gets the key out in time, but the trap detonates anyway, leaving her innards plopping on the floor. And her hand a bit pink.In Saw V, the reluctant game-players are placed in rooms containing... nail bombs on a timer. In glass jars. Has it come to this? Where was the props master? Shopping at Macy's? The final trap is a bit of a kicker, but it's too little, too late. The decision to focus on what amounts to a dreary police procedural is the series' most misguided step to date. If the traps have lost all their imagination and pizazz (for the gist of one of them, see Radiohead's 'No Surprises' video), the continual cutting to other, less than gripping subplots results in a tension-hemorrhage.All we're left with is the sight of two cops creeping around in the dark behind the scenes, like celebrity guests on 'Big Brother'. Makes you long for the days when it was all kill, kill, kill. "The only way to enlightenment is by detaching emotionally," Kramer instructs Hoffman, though the audience may seriously consider detaching itself physically from the theatre. This is one long teaser trail for Saw VI, and as such, the lamest entry in a past-its-sell-by franchise.As for the twist; please waste no more of your valuable time. There is no twist. Is that the twist? After all, the tagline does say 'You won't believe how it ends.' But honestly? We could probably have taken a wild guess, unless... unless... Unless just before the credits rolled the CEO of distributors Lionsgate were to directly address the camera, pledging to pour the entire proceeds from all the Saw films into shelters for victims of domestic violence. Or unless editor Kevin Greutert, who has already signed up to direct the next installment, succumbed to an attack of conscience in the interim, and carved the phrase "I beg you to forgive me for what I'm about to do, signed Kevin Greutert, director of the forthcoming Saw VI" into the negative with a compass.Or unless the whole brand, along with the entire mouldering torture porn phenomenon, just ended, there and then, quietly, without fanfare or fuss, as if it had never existed, and put itself humanely and painlessly to sleep.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good entry into the Saw franchise!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I expected Saw V to be the worst, but after watching it, why is it considered the worst? Sure, it is not as action-packed as the others, and does not have a lot of story lines like IV. It was more about plot, and while I did think some of the reason Hoffman became what he is was flawed in it's writing, I overall very much liked this film. The new director, while still good, is not as great as Darren Lynn Bousman or James Wan. I thought the direction was the weakest, but the screenplay was better than the fourth's. I liked the slow pace of it, and I loved the whole group of victims playing the game. I am surprised that many did not like it, I honestly thought it was overall better than Saw 4, and pretty much tied up with 2. The original Saw and the 3rd remain the best, but from what I expected in 5, garbage, I did not get that.</fullReview>

I was so disappointed because how Agent Strahm doesn't listen to jigsaw. I thought that by the fifth movie he would have learned to listen to jigsaw, I mean come on on the exploding doll from the fourth saying something along the lines of "your next move is important" you think he would have listened to him in this one.So over all i didn't like the ending, everything else was OK, like how the jealous people were overly greedy to save themselves, but this movie was no where near as good as the first and second.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Weakest Entry Yet....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SAW V is about Hoffman trying to conceal the fact that he is Jigsaw's apprentice. People are put in traps...can they escape? Really, do I need to explain the plot of a SAW film to anyone by now? It's been the same movie for years now, only gradually getting worse and worse. SAW V is without a doubt the weakest entry yet to the SAW franchise. It tries too hard to set itself apart from the previous films and yet at the same time try to go back to it's roots. So why do I still see these films, well, it's a tradition. So you can bet I will see SAW VI and you can bet I probably won't like it.So why does SAW V fail so much? Well, let me crack out the list.One, it does not feel like a SAW film. SAW V puts the traps on the back end and focuses more on the story. Good right? Wrong. They basically took the same story from SAW III with Amanda and put it with Hoffman. This time we get flashbacks of Hoffman with Jigsaw, all of which I guess are suppose to be twisty but none ever catch you off guard. I don't know if it's weak writing or the fact that we've seen so many twists in this series that we can't spot them anymore. That goes for the ending too. Ever since the original SAW there has been a twist at the end to let the audience leave the theatre talking. This one doesn't have that. I was a bit disappointed. Seeing the twist is half the fun...isn't it? Two, can we please stick with some characters here? Every film there are new characters introduced, fair enough. But do we always have to kill off the ones from previous films? I mean, you have to be a bad ass to jam a pen in your throat so you can breath, aka get out of the trap, then you flip the audience off and let them die at the end? Can we pick a character and stick with them? How are any of us suppose to connect with anyone when we know you are going to kill them off soon.Three, the script. It has horrible dialogue scattered throughout the entire thing. Half ass scenes with the detective. We see Hoffmans's flashback and all of a sudden he puts the pieces together. Is he seeing what we are seeing? That can't be, but the film sure plays out like he can. The characters are not likable at all, specifically Hoffman and the 5 lucky people trapped in his game. Who are these people, they came and left quicker then you could say "I Want To Play A Game". Also, can get get some people who aren't completely stupid? You've been on this case for awhile now and you still don't know to actually 'listen' to the tape and follow the instructions. Maybe it's because I've watched all the films, but when I hear the words, "get in this box, it will save your life". I'm going to get in the damn box and not try to do something else that will eventually and obviously lead to my death.We are given more scenes with no substance, that we have to wait for the next film. The box with Jigsaw's wife. We have no idea what's in there, we could guess, but hey, then what the hell would be the point of the next one right? The traps aren't as creative and seem even more implausible then before. Giant swinging pendulum of death??? I gave the creators of SAW credit for always turning out new films year after year and making it somewhat enjoyable. The sugar on top was how they all connected and how you actually did need to see the first ones to know what was going on. I'm sad to say the quality is slipping here. Sure they all still connect, but do we care about the connections anymore? I'm starting to grow tired of them. People still seem to love these movies, so let's have VI then call it quits before the films become a complete joke. To the fans, the critics have already sung their tunes on this franchise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just like the last one, this one won't let you down! SAW V delivers like never before! Good amount of gore and good amount of the story line, and a handful of more puzzle pieces for the NEXT SAW!!!!! I love it!Detective Hoffman, chief of police, is the new Jigsaw maniac. But in order to continue his reign of terror, he must stop Lieutent Straham's proof that Hoffman's a murderer. While Hoffman struggles to protect his secret, he has himself 5 victims in his little game that must survive their mayhem.I made a comment about last year's SAW saying its possibly the best one. But I am DEAD wrong! THIS one's the best so far! Storyline's amazing, the special effects are incredible, and the twisted ending wants you to be begging for more SAW. SAW fans will love this one!

		<shortDescription>Sheer Brilliance once again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Contrary to most of the reviews I've read, I found this movie to be simply brilliant and mind-blowing. I've watched every Saw prior, and have always been left wanting more, and this movie delivered a lot. I'm also a die hard fan of this series. This movie gets an 8 out of 10 for me because the games could have been a lot more sentimental to the individuals who were being tested. As opposed to the pendulum game, which both the message and the sacrifice he had to make was related to his flaw, they had no connection to the people. They were merely eye candy for those who wanted to see someone die. Aside from that, everything else was great. The information given, though not all questions have been answered, tied all 5 movies together. It fills a lot of holes in the story throughout the movie, and to me, that's what Saw is about; the message that Jigsaw makes. To those who think that Saw has been dragged on for too long and think the games are getting old, I insist you open your eyes and see the saga for what it is meant to be. Understand the story and the philosophy behind John Kramer. He never misses a beat with everything that's happened, and this movie I feel was the most clever of them all. This movie was focused around Agent Straham from beginning to end. Everything else was simply to entertain/enlighten. In the defense of opposed opinions, not everyone who watches these movies watch it for the message, but to see blood and guts, so your opinion will depend on what you're looking for. If you're looking for blood and guts, I trust you will be disappointed. There's not much here and where they had some opportunity to give more, they didn't. If you want to know more and have questions answered, I trust you will leave the theater satisfied, and guaranteed wanting more. I don't want to give away too much of the movie, but all I will say, is it's not over yet. Expect a Saw VI and possibly a Saw VII.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw V was just as good as all the others ones. It does have the same amount of gore. It does start right away with a bang just like all the others. The story was very good in this one as well. It didn't have the best acting but was okay. It wasn't that jumpy or to scary but did have a few scares and jumps. It is a great movie to go see during Haloween. It did have a few boring moments but for the most part keeps you entertained. The movie does go very deep into the story with this one. Some of the games were fun and some were bad. This saw was more like the second one. The ending was led up very well for a great finale. The whole movie was fun though and intense for the most part. Overall would recommend seeing this saw if you have seen all the others.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw V is a bunch of redundant flashbacks combined with a thoroughly boring main test scenario while an FBI agent investigates Jigsaw's new apprentice. That's all this is. This time, there isn't even an amazing twist-ending to satisfy the viewer. S5 is a pretty painful experience on the whole. It's a horror film with less bite than a toothless puppy and, despite being a horror film, virtually no horror at all. The violence is extremely weak and unscary and this doesn't even earn its 18 certificate. The direction is bland, the acting is unbearable and the script has no surprises, no scares and no entertainment of any kind. Saw 3 and 4 may have been bad, but at least some of the stuff going on outside of the traps was interesting. Here, while there are occasional interesting moments and a good scene involving Jigsaw and Hoffman, a deeply boring investigation plot and various pointless flashbacks of Jigsaw and his apprentice setting up traps are all there is to distract from the atrocious main scenario. This one reeks of the writers having completely run out of ideas and this absolutely lacks any kind of oomph. Since the plot is so bad they could have at least did the fans a service and made the traps interesting, but even that aspect of the film is sorely lacking. A bomb.3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Explains Hoffman without offering anything of value</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very unimpressed with the previous Saw film, so much so that in my review I went into no detailed plot analysis. In the case of Saw V, there is no real plot to summarize. The film attempts to explain how Hoffman (Costas Mandylor) became entangled with the Jigsaw killer.It turns out he decided to impersonate Jigsaw's method to create an unwinnable trap in order to take revenge on the man who killed his sister. Jigsaw, who somehow knew in the third movie that a woman who has never come forward witnessed a crime, uses his God powers to find out Hoffman impersonated him and tries to convert him to Jigsaw-ism. In the meantime FBI Agent Strahm (Scott Patterson) turns out to have a history with Hoffman. The dim witted Strahm gets played like a harp from hell by Hoffman and ends up getting himself crushed to death in the trash compactor from Star Wars.We also have a reasonably likable group of thinly connected victims being put through a group trap, but the script cares so little about this group, it doesn't even connect their story to the main plot. If the makers of this film don't care about this group (one of whom is Julie Benz) than neither do I.And that's this movie's biggest crime. There is no one. Absolutely no one in it that the audience is given to care about, and the film doesn't even care enough about what it's showing us to offer us the thinnest of connecting fiber between the A story and B story. Mandylor would improve in the next, but the plotting wouldn't get any smarter. I guess this can just about be satisfying if you're in the mood for a Saw film, but any time put into thinking about what this film tells you to swallow will wreck the mood pretty quickly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw 5 (2008): Dir: Mark Hackl / Cast: Tobin Bell, Costas Mandylor, Scott Patterson, Betsy Russell, Julie Benz: Reprehensible garbage featuring more graphic torture. Jigsaw is dead and featured only in flashbacks building between a corrupt cop and another who narrowly survived and seeks conviction. This is the worst film in the franchise since Saw 2. Directed by Mark Hackl with a screenplay that should have been given the same treatment as the victims. It is mainly graphic instrument entering human bodies in explicit methods. Tobin Bell is featured as Jigsaw but here he seems more or less limited despite any flashback information. Costas Mandylor as his apprentice / cop holds true as a strong and resourceful villain being hailed as a hero by police but being investigated by another. Scott Patterson plays a cop investigating after a near death experience but he isn't quite as clever as Mandylor, as the ending clearly indicates. The lovely Betsy Russell appears as Jigsaw's widow who is given a box for which she has the key. She hasn't nearly as much screen time as perhaps she should have. Five other character go through a game so that viewers can be subjected to more scenes of bodies being sawn and other crap. This works against the story when focus given to a body count. Pointless slasher that is about the equivalent to toilet paper. Score: 3 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best entries in the series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After escaping from his lair, a detective begins an investigation into the connection behind the traps which leads to the true identity of Jigsaw's disciple who is out conducting another game and must race to save them before the game is finished.This one was better than the others, and right now is the one that can be tolerated more than the others. What really helps here is that there's plenty of fun and exciting traps here delivering solid and brutal gore scenes here that are certainly up among the series' best. The opening pendulum set-up is quite brutal and somewhat chilling here with the slowly-lowering blade drawing some nice tension in here, while the main game that plays out here is filled with several awesome traps and set-ups here. The opening in the room where they have the collars attached to the blades to decapitate them when the timer runs out is a fun game, the search for the keys in the jars before the bomb goes off is a nice, frantic race which is quite suspenseful, while the final two set at the end in the electrical wiring room and the razor contraption are some really impressive ones that are more important here in detailing how the game plays out which is the most impressive parts here. How they get to the gradual realization of their connection to each other makes for a really enjoyable time here which is not only given a nice reasoning but unfurls at a rather nice time here with the resolutions coming off rather well. The last plus here is the final twist which is a bit of a shock that is about as good as the first one was that manages to get several plot points tied together from the past into a fantastic effort overall. These points here hold this one up, while it's still pretty terrible. The biggest issue here with this one is a problem that's plagued the rest of the series as it's still utterly irritating and annoying as the flashbacks are just not so interesting throughout here with the continued clarifications and spelling out what happened in previous installments here being just not in the slightest bit interesting. As well, the detective investigating what we already know and taking up a ton of time on that issue alone simply combing through police files and reports is just absolutely dull as there's simply a ton of rifling around here where nothing much becomes of these scenes beyond merely confirming what's already known the whole time here by finally unveiling the true disciple here that becomes the whole point of the investigation. That's wholly boring here simply using all this time here on this one issue. The only other small flaw here is the fact that the rather lame ending to the game's set-up, which gets pushed aside to the back as the main focus shifts to the other plot-lines and feels quite a bit of a cheat considering how good the game here actually was. While this wasn't as flat-out terrible as the others, it's definitely up to a somewhat respectable status.Rated R: Extreme Graphic Violence, Graphic Language and Brief Nudity.</fullReview>

Yet there's no getting away from the familiarity breeding contempt factor, narratively it offers nothing new, and irritatingly it becomes quite evident that it's obviously setting up the next film in the series. It's a sad state of affairs when the flashbacks involving Tobin Bell (Jigsaw) prove to be the film's only strengths, well there is the death traps to keep us awake I suppose... 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Feels more like a deleted scenes compilation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The fifth Saw film. Well, the fact that it is the fourth sequel of a horror film says enough, but I will review it anyway.Let's start with the plot, or the absence of one. The film is more or less a compilation of flashbacks showing how Jigsaw trains a new recruit. In between these flashbacks a detective is hot on the trail of the new Jigsaw. Meanwhile there is also another game taking place and all kinds of stuff in-between.Like it's predecessor not much can be said for the plot of saw 5. The flashbacks are interesting for fans and there are some scenes that tie in to the previous movies nicely. Saw 5 isn't as incoherent as number four, but it still lacks depth and a story of it's own.The acting in saw 5 is alright. Most of the actors from 4 are back and they do well considering their characters are pretty shallow.Saw 5 saw a new director in the franchise. Considering the script he did an adequate job. The tension wasn't brilliant, but the editing was much more coherent than the predecessor and the cinematography was alright.Saw 5 is watchable, but it doesn't really expand the franchise. With all the flashbacks it feels more like a deleted scenes compilation from the first four saw movies than a film in it's own right. Not much else happens in the film, the focus is clearly on establishing the new Jigsaw's role in the previous films. All in all saw 5 would fail as a film on it's own, but makes an interesting addition to the series. If you're not doing a saw marathon like me, but looking for a stand alone horror movie, I suggest you don't watch this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saw V (2008)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm going to have to chart the Saw franchise down as a guilty pleasure of mine. Quite simply I think they are so consistent that it's amazing they have kept it going this long. I think the secret is in the pacing and the quality. Many horror sequels start to look camp and cheesy. Saw has kept the stylised cinematography, the twists and time jumps. The acting is also very good. It's believable at least and one needs good actors when trying to convey fear and pain. It's fun watching the traps, thinking about what I'd do in such situations and so on. Now we have another apprentice for Jigsaw, and his attempts to frame an FBI agent for the crimes.The franchise is still going strong because it adds depth and continuous back story. Though not always a good thing here it proves to be a blessing. I wish I could hate, but it is the first film in a long time that made me forget about drinking my coffee, which is now cold. Sad me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A burning surge went right through my viens, while watching this movie. Even though I never saw any gore flicks, and I disregarded 'Saw' as it, I was thrilled watching it. It was a pure Crime-Horror-Thriller, as I would like to put it.The movie's screenplay is a complete non-linear fashion, and at places I felt the movie had done too much justice by rapid editing. But moreover, the movie did carry the message.The traps were awesome, and the most spine-chilling is the first trap you'll see in the first murder sequence.Don't listen to critics who submit this as 'torture porn'. This is a rightfully chilling thriller all the way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>trapped by the devices</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It became a classic, Saw opening with a gruesome killing. But naturally regulars left the building and in came David Hackl to direct his first flick. It all goes well and it is filmed (with the fast moving images) and edited as the previous entries. But the problem is slowly showing himself. How can they still come with some gruesome killings or Jigsaw traps. That is a bit the negative point on part 5, they went back to show a group of people being trapped in the same room. But that doesn't give you the feeling to be interested in the characters. And for me I really didn't care of one of the five died. And there was another problem. Some killings were shown off-screen, a thing not done in torture porn. We have a bomb going off but you can only guess what is happening or the bath tub were ones electrocuted wasn't convincing too. In came Julie Benz (Dexter) and I was looking forward to see her performance but it wasn't really developed. Once you are into the story of Saw you want to know who is who and what connections they have so Agent Strahm goes deeper into the Hoffman. And he do have proof that Hoffman had something to do with Jigsaw. On the other hand the story goes deeper into the Hoffman/Jigsaw connection. By doing so you really need to know what went on in the previous Saw's. And we do see some scene's from the first part until part 3 and shows us what we haven't seen back then. So part 5 is really on for the Saw geeks but not for some who like to pick up a Saw flick. Storywise it delivers but on the traps it failed for me, I guess the fall of Saw had begun.

		<shortDescription>Transformation of Hoffman becoming what Jigsaw is... a killer!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film was good in all but it needs more of a punch to really let people know that this could happen to you and never forget it in the future. I saw in the last film that Hoffman is Jigsaw's next apprentice(better job than Amanda)and is slowly in this film becoming what Jigsaw is a killer who can come back for doing what he seems to be right testing other's will to live. And now the FBI is still trying to figure out who Jigsaw is and why Seth Baxter died without having a chance of escaping his trap(pendulum trap-inescapable-Seth killed Hoffmans' sister and was given 2-3yrs in prison). Now things are bad because Hoffman was visited by a now alive Jigsaw(who had died in saw 3?)who wants him to work for him and help him with the traps and learn why he is doing all of this. I nearly hit the floor when i saw Jigsaw alive and talking to Hoffman and still making traps even though he died a few films back. The traps were good but i was scared when that man's head was in the box filling with water and how that scene was made out. Pretty good film but I can't wait for next film to come out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Masterpiece fabulous story told in 7 years. Some movies are made to tell us Why the movies are made and give us a good reason to watch movies. Marvelously written and brilliantly filmed, Very Interesting and Intriguing. The message of the Saw series movies are clear -- don't abuse yourself, don't abuse others, control your emotions, and be fair. Do not take drugs, do not smoke, do not cheat or lie, do not frame others, try to forgive, do not keep vengeance, control the obsessions, do not make profits on others death -- Follow the Rules, and you will win in the end. Do not sin from the tiniest to the gruesome/ heinous. There are many gore and horrible scenes when the victims are TESTED. But I think its a glimpse of hell, what we can expect as the wrong doers will be punished in the after life, because they did not followed the rules or had not got the clues. Its not a game -- Make Your Choices! Cherish Your Life!When the Legacy was handed over from John to Detective Hoffman, it all started going in the wrong direction. He tried to fulfill John's Will, but as he had lesser human side, and was going himself against the rules. He became a Victim to be Tested by himself. The Final Chapter is also more interesting with more gore and gruesome scenes and more people getting killed now, mostly innocent and police officers. Before it is Game Over!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw V is the 5th out of 7 films in the Saw franchise. Saw V is really good! The game in this movie with the "Fatal Five" is horrible, but the other storyline with Hoffman and Agent Srahmn was amazing! I wouldn't of cared if that was the entire movie! Just one big story movie! Saw, Saw IV, and Saw V are the two big story movies in the Saw series, Saw IV, was the best, and Saw V was my 4th favorite, that doesn't mean its bad! Saw V is a good movie, that's what is. I don't really know what else to say about Saw V, but all I can is that it is a good movie! Also, the ending is great! Very unexpected, but not as good as the ending to the first movie. When you first see this movie, watch the whole thing, in your other viewings, just skip the game scenes and only watch the Hoffman and Strahmn things. Although that only make the movie about 45 minutes long while the entire movie is 92 minutes. Oh well. Saw V is a good add in to the Saw series. 7/10</fullReview>

Violent for the sake of being violent--nothing else seems to drive the story, and there doesn't even seem to be much of a story. So, Agent Strahm (Patterson) suspects Detective Hoffman (Mandylor) is Jigsaw, and we know this series doesn't know when to stop--hmm, I wonder who's going to win? The film's most interesting line, "You were supposed to be the hero!" fails to have the impact it's supposed to.

		<shortDescription>The worst in the series but it's still a little entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The new taglines for the latest Saw movies is now "If it's Halloween, it must be Saw" which is actually true since every Halloween, I know that a Saw movie isn't far round the corner. The story is by far the worst in the movies as they start to become more complicating yet answering some questions fans might have had in the previous movies. The acting isn't great at all and is probably the worst I've seen in the series, you just didn't care for the characters and they didn't feel connected to each other at all. The characters were written poorly except for Jigsaw whose past story has been in the last two or three movies. It yet again answers questions asked in the last movie only for them to be replaced with new questions. I liked seeing the traps as the five people were figuring out why they were there and fighting for their lives at the same time which added a nice twist. Unfortunately, it wasn't enough as there were poor character development and badly written characters. It would have been much better if they focused on one story instead of two (the characters in the traps and the Jigsaw story). The traps were brilliantly done and the special effects and blood and gore scenes were well executed.Overall, I liked and hated the movie. I liked the traps and some of the story but other than that, Saw V is just very weak which is a shame to say. The thing I loved about the Saw movies was the unpredictable endings and for this movie's tagline, it says "you won't believe how it ends" yet I did believe it because I predicted it. I thought I would be wrong but I wasn't which surprised me since Saw is normally unpredictable sometimes. However, I shall probably be watching the series still, hoping they improve a little. The traps were good but other than that, this is definitely the weakest in the series Read more reviews at: www.dudedazzmoviereviews.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still great, just not as good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw V is the fifth entry in the Saw franchise and is the movie that made me become a true Saw fan. The plot consists of Special Agent Peter Strahm hunting down the new Jigsaw apprentice Mark Hoffman. It also focuses on 5 strangers going through a series of demented traps known as "The Fatal Five." I thought this movie was fantastic. It shows us how and why Hoffman became involved with Jigsaw, and has great traps involved. Better traps than in Saw IV, that's for sure. As much as I loved Saw V, it has some problems. First of which would be the acting, in particular The Fatal Five. The Fatal fives acting except for Carlo Rota aka Charles was terrible. It felt like everyone was reading off of cue cards and wasn't even trying. Second would have to be the directing. It felt to me like director David Hackl was more interested in traps than in story. Proof would be how a lot of the time he didn't care about acting (TFF), and how brilliantly shot the traps were compared to everything else in the movie. Not only that, but he has been the production designer for Saw II - IV, so he has been working with traps a lot. Another problem is that there was too much CGI in this film. The Saw movies hardly use CGI, and it was really bad in this movie. Finally, my last problem would have to be the ending. As much as I love the ending to Saw V, I felt like killing off Strahm was a huge mistake. Strahm felt like the perfect character to end the murders of Jigsaw. Oh well. Overall Saw V was really good, but is my least favorite of the Saw franchise.7.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>and this sequel lacked the cool traps set up and didn't have as much gore. In my opinion, this is by far the worst of the Saw sequels. I thought the others were half descent and at least had some good blood and gore shots. I didn't think this movie even had that. And it just ends with little conclusion and was a very short film at 90 minutes. There was plenty of time to add more to the plot. And what did those 5 people have to do with anything. They just show up as part of jigsaw's game. It was like the writers couldn't even come up with a single idea as to why have those people thrown in.FINAL VERDICT: I think any other sequels just need to go direct to video. This idea is just too played out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not half as bad as what critics are saying but definitely the worst of the series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The fifth saw movie was really bashed by critics, and to tell you the truth, I was expecting myself to be very disappointed, but on the other hand I was pleasantly surprised. Of course, I am not saying by any means that this is a good movie but it was better than most critics were saying it is. But besides showing gore and traps, Saw V isn't good at very much anything else. The acting most definitely sucked...Scott Patterson is at least halfway decent as Strahm but Costas Mandylor always has the same facial expression all movie long. Mark Rolston (Erickson) is also good, but besides that, I wouldn't consider any of the actors of Saw V as being extremely talented. Tobin Bell's character is what hurts the film most, because he isn't shown much.The traps on the other hand were imaginative and each one of them felt like a new exciting experience. The ending was dumb, I was expecting a somewhat better ending than having my second favourite character die a sh*tty death, but besides showing gore, blood and guts, Saw V isn't a good film to look at because the lack of experience in directing makes the actors work by themselves and almost makes them look foolish. If you're searching for a good movie, then do not pick Saw V. Watch the first saw instead. Although I give the movie 4/10 for the traps, I 'll give it two extra points for the freakiest scene in Saw history: The scene with the two pig mask guys. I can't stand that dude!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was completely bewildered as for most of the movie I thought Scott Patterson and Costas Mandylor were playing the same character. It seemed to me (and I'm not alone, everyone who watched with me were of the same opinion)that Mark Hoffman was the alter ego of Agent Peter Strahm and that the same actor was playing both roles. It wasn't until I checked out the casting here on the IMD that I realized my mistake. This has got to be one of the worst bits of casting in a long time. Why on earth cast two actors in the same film that look so alike. Was it deliberately designed just to add to the disorienting effect of what was happening? Or was it just plain bad casting? I put my money on bad casting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The "Saw" franchise is losing it's flair. This is a weak sequel in the "Saw" franchise, Mark Hoffman(Costas Mandylor) who is a fed is the new inferior Jigsaw, except he doesn't give his victims the chance to survive. The original Jigsaw has created multiple monsters that are revealed thus far, one being Amanda Young and the other is Mark Hoffman who is even more sadistic and a hypocrite. Hoffman basically takes the law in to his own hands to exact justice while trying to look like a hero. I hated Amanda Young but Hoffman is way more evil and sadistic and a prick than Amanda ever was. The film is basically about two feds fighting it out and trying to take down one another. While Agent Peter Strahm is trying to dig into Hoffman's past and bring him down, Hoffman is setting up traps for Strahm and plans it out in a way where Hoffman can get a clean getaway while getting rid of Strahm who is on his tail. While this is going on 5 victims are going through the game set up by Hoffman which is set up similar to the TV show "Survivor" except you really die in this. There is 5 torture games total but one person has to die in each game. Hoffman is a inferior Jigsaw wannabe and only one of the victims really had to die throughout the whole thing and 4 of them would have survived if they managed to be more conservative. In the game where they had to crawl into the small tunnel to avoid the explosion, two could have fit into each tunnel, they probably had to spoon each other but it would have worked. The next game where they electrocute one person to open the door, they could of just taken the body of the first dead girl instead of the keys the girl with the big ego goes for in the first place and put her body into the bathtub to be electrocuted. As for the final game they could of just taken the body of the dead girl after the door opened and used her arm to bleed out, thus surviving the game with 4 members. And if they couldn't figure out the strategy to survive with all 5 which the last remaining 2 victims find out about during the final game, they had plenty of other strategies including trying to urinate into the saw machine, if they couldn't get the water out of the bathtub from the 3rd game they had to play. But the audience wants blood and gore so for them not failing miserably was unavoidable. Agent Strahm falls for the same exact trap again with the unbreakable door closing behind his back again, and pays for it dearly. So he is smart enough to poke a hole through his neck in order to breath when he almost drowns to death but isn't smart enough to avoid the same trap he fell for before. There are some flashbacks in this one as well but nothing interesting or new, except why Hoffman became Jigsaw's apprentice. The quality of the film also seems to have went down compared to the past "Saw" movies and the script seemed really rushed and just seems like an excuse to add more gore into the film. I also don't get the tagline for this movie "you won't believe how it ends" making it sound like the final movie in the franchise or as if the ending is just super outstanding and unbelievable which wasn't the case. In fact I am pretty sure most people would have guessed it. If this was in fact the final "Saw" movie the creators would have really hyped it up and would have tried to advertise it as the final "Saw" movie and if this was the case Strahm had a chance to beat Hoffman at his own game. But most people probably doubted this was to be the final "Saw" movie like I did so Hoffman had to have defeated Strahm. The tagline was a joke and the plot was a joke. But at least the torture devices were creative this time around and watching idiots and selfish bigots fight amongst one another and get killed was somewhat entertaining. This film is more of a prologue to "Saw 6" and isn't anything the audiences haven't seen from the "Saw" franchise so far and is a weak continuation.5.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I really like the traps</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw is considered to be one of the best horror series. Besides all the gore, the twists, and the meaning behind the torture, personally I really like the design of the traps. Just like computer programming, designing a perfect or good enough trap requires great effort and carefulness. Jigsaw must spend a long time in adjusting the trade-off between a trap that is inescapable and one that is easy, in order to find the perfect "degree" of the toughness of the traps. In addition to the already intricacy of designing a trap, Jigsaw must also consider the unpredictable nature of human kind. However, one of his remarks said: "If you know the human mind too well, there are no chances." If Jigsaw becomes a programmer, he'll be a really good one. I hope to see more interesting and creative traps in the future releases.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The New Jigsaw is revealed, he takes his mantle seriously, and this time he goes after those he thinks deserve it. Saw V picks up where saw III/IV ended, after being revealed as Jigsaw's Apprentice at the end of Saw IV Matt Hoffman(Costas Mandylor) tries to make sure that everyone involved with the case is dead and cannot tell. He places Special Agent Strahm(Scott Patterson) in a water torture device with no way out, But, Strahm is smarter than Hoffman expects, he escapes drowning, and Hoffman is given an award for closing the Jigsaw case, little does he know, Strahm will not lay down. Brit(Julie Benz), Luba(Megan Good), Mallick(Greg Bryk), Charles(Carlo Rota), and Ashley(Laura Gordon) all have a secret that binds them, they were all given privileged lives, but wasted them. Hoffman chooses these five people to be in his first solo game, they are told "your instincts will tell you one thing, but I implore you not to follow them" and room after room they all are looking out for number one, until the end when the two remaining figure out the sum is equal to all of its parts. They are left scarred forever. Strahm goes on the warpath, hunting for clues to Hoffman being involved, or just how involved is he, so much so he doesn't look out for what's happening, he is looking out for himself and thinking only of solving the mysteries that plague this case. Hoffman uses that to his advantage and leads his superior officer right to where the game is being played, framing Strahm for the Jigsaw murders Again, I watched this multiple times and try as I might my knee-jerk reaction was not to like it, that it was pure filler between IV and VI, but after watching it for a second time I can't help but be pulled into the mystery and intrigue if you follow the pieces right you just can't help but saw "What?!" all and all this is an addition to the lore of Jigsaw and it teaches you how Matt Hoffman became his Legacy holder in the first place Now you're probably asking me "but Thomas, haven't these gone on long enough?" I would venture to say it at least has one more installment til it gets tiresome, but I don't know for I haven't watched Saw VI yet. All I know is I am now officially intrigued to see how this second act will end(I split Saw I-III and Saw IV-VI up into acts or books because that is the best way to handle them in my opinion) Now all the pleasurable things being said, I do have qualms with it. For one thing the Flashbacks that reveal everything to do with Hoffman are not clear, Why it is still Tobin Bell's Voice on the recorder is not clear but I guess that can be explained by audio tricks. And some of the storyline does seem muddled in bits and pieces. But, if you ever want to see six you'll have to sit through V no matter how you feel about it All in all the six games that we have been privy to seeing are great thinkers, and moral stories wrapped in a horror package and I'm sorry but Tobin Bell is one of the hottest old sociopaths out there today</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought that Saw 5 was not as good as all the other saw films in the series. Following Jigsaw's grisly death, Mark Hoffman, the final apprentice to the serial killer is a hero. Meanwhile, Agent Strahm is tested and puts the pieces together. While Strahm realises that Hoffman is helping Jigsaw, five seemingly unconnected people face a horrible lesson about teamwork. Strahm tries to follows all the leads he can get off Mark Hoffman, including the death of his sister and why he joined Jigsaw. Hoffman and Agent Strahm fight each other until it comes down to a gruesome finale. I found this film to be a bit more different than the other ones in the series. although it was still a good film, with a lot of gore and strong violence in it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It makes no sense when people say the Saw series is going downhill. It never did...Saw III, IV and V are as good as the first two.I only just watched Saw V last night. When it came out, I was only a couple of months too young to see it in the cinemas - bought the DVD, and after reading some of the reviews here I didn't know what to expect.Apparently we're supposed to expect the worst in the series, and something that could never hold a candle to the first Saw. NO. To get to the fifth instalment without losing any steam is a feat to begin with. Even if you don't give them any credit for getting to the fifth film, Saw V is crucial to the development of the ongoing plot.Okay, here are some spoilers. Don't read on if you haven't seen it yet.The most surprising part of the plot in this film is where and how everything happens. You'd think after the third and fourth films finished running together, John Kramer being dead, Amanda being dead, the whole thing would have to start with a new plot. That isn't entirely true.You find things that begin before some of the first ever traps and games were shown in the first Saw. Most of the flashbacks in this film work as a prequel to the first Saw. It gets you thinking where and when everything happened.The plot is very strong in this film. There's no huge twist like in the other films, but it ties together a lot of questions that, despite not being directly asked, make a lot of things clear. After watching this you understand what might have been in Amanda's letter in Saw III, and you understand why she might have let her emotions get the better of her (as an example).The subplot was very interestingly designed too. I tried to be a pessimist and poke holes in some of the traps, like "wait, but those shelters can fit more than one person!" but at the end, it was designed like that. Some of the acting was a little out here and there, but it doesn't ruin the film for you. It was very clever how the subplot here is like Saw II, where people had to work together to get out alive. Obviously this is Hoffman's method as he helped Jigsaw set up the game for Saw II as well.If you go to watch the film wearing your thinking cap and ready to anticipate whatever happens, you probably won't enjoy it. Take things as they appear on the surface, and you're all the more surprised.The gore in this film is astonishing, to say the least. Were it not for the morgue scene in Saw IV, this film would be the nastiest one yet - a good example is the opening scene. These traps aren't cringe-worthy, like the needle pit or the pigmask hair trap...but they satisfy any core desire you'd want to see in gory maiming and dismemberment, and nothing braces you for the horror of the final trap.TO SUMMARISE - This film has the coal to keep the Saw train blinding down the line with full steam ahead! Just as clever, just as violent, just as essential to the ongoing plot. I'm eagerly waiting for VI.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You wont believe how it ends!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a big Saw fan and believe Saw is one of the best films I have seen. Obviouslly the sequels have to live up to that but they unfortunately haven't quite had the same impact. Each Saw has had audiences on the edge of their seats with delightful plots and twists you just have to love. Sadly, Saw 5 does not. I remember the tagline of the film being 'you wont believe how it ends' and i believe that it was a pile of crap. There is no twist, no suspense and the only WOW factor is WOW thanks for wasting my time. The film should of being titled 'The life of John Kramer' due to the many, many flashbacks of him telling us what we already know. I am going to ignore that this was in the Saw series and look forward to Saw 6.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This series is getting weaker and weaker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a pity it looks like this series is starting to decline, which is such a shame, the first film was great, the 2nd was even better, the third one was solid and the 4th was pretty decent.And now "Saw V" is confusing and muddled, if you haven't seen the other Saw films then you would be completely lost because this one just keeps jumping back and fourth between flashbacks, which even I found confusing and I've seen the first four films loads and loads of times. The main problem with this one is that they seem to be running out of ideas, it just seems too similar to the 2nd Saw movie and plus this doesn't have the feel of the previous Saw movies, even Jigsaw's part was reduced to nothing more than a cameo. This time we are introduced to Jigsaw's newest apprentice Hoffman (Costas Mandylor) and we're also given a backstory to his character, although he makes a good killer in the making but he's no Jigsaw. And also Betsy Russell comes back briefly again (a cameo) but something tells me that she'll have a bigger part in the next installment. "Saw V" again has non interesting characters and sadly non interesting traps, but as a standalone movie this would have been really good.All in all this is proof that the Saw series is taking a downward spiral, although I am still looking forward to part 6 hopefully it will be better than this but I seriously doubt it though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh dear... they're beginning to go downhill</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a huge fan of the Saw franchise, and so couldn't wait to watch the fifth instalment. The first time I watched it, I thought it was good, it kept you on the edge of your seat, it made you gasp and recoil... but that was about it.The second time I watched it I realised how it doesn't compare to the others, not by a long shot. Yeah sure, it's gory, it's a lot of people screaming, just like the others, but the others had depth, the others had unbelievable clever story lines that made you want to watch it again and again. Saw 5 however was flat. It seemed like it was trying go in depth but couldn't and with a storyline so complicated that after the sixth time of watching I still have no idea what's happening. It's not even that the storyline is complicated, it's just that it's hard to follow, which is not what you want with a Saw movie.I felt that the acting was bad by one or two people, those people being in the fatal five trap, but I would say, the only reason I keep watching this one as much as I have the others is simply because the best performance from the low key characters is from Greg Bryk (Mallick in the fatal five trap). He plays his character so well, that you can see the anxiety, the emotion and the fear on his face even when he's not saying anything. His twitching and uncomfortable posture are really good too.It's a shame this one didn't follow terrificly on from the awesome franchise (where was the twist at the end?). Some blamed it on the different writers, yet, even though Leigh Whannell's writing on the first three will never be beaten, the fourth was still pretty good, so I'm not to sure what happened in this one.Either way, I'm hoping the sixth will make up for it, I'm hoping they learn from their mistakes (such as not using a tag line that has nothing to do with the movie) and make another gripping movie which I was hoping for from this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Saw Yet... But is that a good thing?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I say that this is the best film of the Saw series, but that's not necessarily a good thing. It's the best because the others sorta' sucked. The original was really quite boring and overly reminiscent of Se7en (the crime scenes, not the crimes are shown; the killer's morals are way too out of whack). The first sequel was decent with its drama, but after the interesting deaths, it degenerates fast. The third film took the drama way too far, though it had a decent idea for its main character's background and some pretty decent deaths. Saw IV was nearly unwatchable due to its color palette. Call me crazy, but it's an important part to making a film tolerable, even if nothing else in the film actually works.Anyway, we're at Saw V now. After the twists and turns of the other films, this seems like a generally straightforward Saw film. It's got a hero and characters that are... I couldn't say "smart," but they're less idiotic considering some of the other characters in the previous films. There is an actual genuine mystery behind what's going on and why the five victims have been chosen, though the film sort of reaches for ways for them to be killed after they get through the first trap. The villain, this time around, is someone that had been in previous Saw films, but I hadn't quite remembered, which brings up another plus to this film: it actually got me to pay attention during the passages when nobody was being killed. Back to the villain: He/she wasn't as far of a reach as the Saw II twist, considering his/her backstory.All in all, most of the kills aren't as creative as they have been, yet they aren't too far-fetched, and there is a feeling of deja vu in regards to the victims' predicament (a la Saw II), but the twist, as we've come to expect them, is pretty plausible. It by no means makes for an excellent film, but a better-than-average C-film and the best entry in the series to date.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A better ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw 5 is a must see for if you loved the first 4. It delivers everything that you would expect a saw movie to contain.The only disappointment for me was the fact that it was advertised with "you won't believe how it ends". If you make that kind of statement you better have a very good ending. The ending was typical Saw but it wasn't "you won't believe how it ends" material.The ending trap was the largest mechanical trap in all the 5 movies. The way to escape the trap was to seemingly be caught in it, but then you find out that this is the only way out. The trap closes the walls in and drops a container into the floor. How is this done? In every other trap we see how the mechanics of the trap work. They are basic mechanical traps derived from the mechanics of a clock. We don't see how this last trap works. Is it believable that 1 person could build a contraption where the walls close in evenly and the floor drops out at the same time. Keeping with the mechanics of the previous traps the walls and floor would have to be connected by gears and shafts and run off of a singe motor to move evenly. To me it's not believable that 1 person could have done this alone. Maybe this would be a subject to be revealed in Saw6. Also without a living jigsaw in this movie setting the traps, it's more like a spin off of the saw movies rather than a continuation.I have a better ending.....Have the traps continue with more suspects loosing in the traps with nobody knowing who is setting the traps. Then show a second jigsaw setting them. Show that jigsaw had a twin brother who is still setting traps. That's right, 2 jigsaws! Then use the fast half-second flashbacks that are used throughout the series to flash back to every single trap of the first 4 movies and show the 2 jigsaw twins working on each trap. This way the "jigsaw" character will continue. Then in typical horror movie ending have the living twin say to the camera "what have you been doing with your life that you are ashamed of, do you have the survival instinct to stay alive and endure what you've put others through, live or die let the games begin" and then go to black. Typical ending that says the boogeyman is still out there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>prepare for another ride to the world of jigsaw... the first scene itself gives a clear hint of the goriness of the movie,, .. this sequel is more bloody than the previous versions. the most interesting part is that like the previous parts, this part also connects to the principle concept and previous characters. Tobin bell again steals the show with his part.. the person giving him a straight head competition is Costas Mandylor aka detective Hoffman. you can smell the same sense in him as Tobin bell. being a true follower of jigsaw,, he plays the games and put the traps justifiably unlike Amanda. so he fits up to our expectation as well as jigsaw's. but yes it may disappoint you that the climax is not so tempting and suspenseful as we are used to in earlier installments. the story ends in a rather guessed way. still for a die hard fans of saw series like me, it definitely works to keep you glue eyed till the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Personally i thought this was a great movie.The story , although still a bit jumpy, was a lot less complicated than 4. Some people may disagree saying it lacked depth and it was just Agent Strahm talking the plot. However, even if this is the case i still thought it deserved more credit than what it got.The acting was pretty good. I liked Scott Paterson (Agent Strahm). I liked his character and he played it well. He was my favourite character and it was good he got a chance to shine. Some of the acting in the fatal five trap was awkward but not to bad.The traps were my favourite of the series.The only downside for me was the predictable twist(if you can call it a twist). It definitely leaves it open for 6.Still many of the hardcore Saw fans like me will be pleased.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll be the first to admit, that I am a fan of the Saw franchise. While the original is still the best, I do like the thriller aspects of the follow-ups. The fourth sequel (and by far not the last one as anyone can imagine) takes a step back. At least the theatrical version wasn't as brutal as the last two Saw movies.Which I think is a good thing. There's a limit to what you can show, without completely dulling your audience. Which would of course be a bad thing. So the thriller/crime aspect, is bigger here. While I like the fact, that it does have a continuous storyline, some viewers might be appalled that they actually have to remember or even have seen the previous movie to get some of the things shown in the movie. Of course a few flashbacks do help out, but it's always better to have the other movies in mind.I didn't quite like the ending, but the movie leaves quite a few things open again, so I will be there for part 6, to see where this is going ...</fullReview>

Granted maybe this one isn't' as per say exciting as say 1 or 2, but that's because we know one comes out now every Halloween,, but as a whole i think the movie does have enough merit to stand out on it's own, but is better if watched definitely 1 thru 4 first, otherwise you really ain't gonna understand any of this movie, in my opinion, because there is an obvious running story throughout the whole series , but all in all a decent horror flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hello (your name here)...I want to play a game...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw 5 goes something like this, as if you haven't seen 1 through 4 before...Hello (your name here)... I want to play a game...There is always some device that these fools wear and they basically get killed trying to get out of the device or room because there is always some key that they have to get in order to escape. One guy manages to survive "the game" and typically obsesses about the departed Jigsaws story just like the other "protagonists" in the four previous sequels and makes the same mistakes they made.Same thing over and over again. But the Saw series is like a fart I like to keep on smelling. I just can't get enough of it. I almost don't mind killing my brain cells with this story that tries way too hard to be a murder mystery. It is already given who the killers are and this installment feels like busy work for the main plot in itself. What's next? Do we see more flashbacks on what Jigsaw likes to eat for breakfast? Or how about some trivial B.S. about Agent Hoffman? More "rehabilitation"?I am going to predict that Saw 6 is going to be like the other Saw's with more traps, more keys, more double-crossing cops, and that same jingle with a "game over" in the end. But maybe we will see a conclusion this time. No more Saw after that. This is a series that gets spat out to the public way too fast and the audience doesn't really have time to savor the sequels. Over all, this film isn't entirely flawed, but I wasn't really moved like I was in the first one. I only recommend it if you want to connect the dots with the story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw V (2008) picks up where the last installment of Saw left us. Special Agent Strahn has been obsessed with finding the real mastermind behind the Jigsaw murders. A few suspects and an ever growing victim pool leads to more questions than answers. Even though Jigsaw is long dead and all of the trails have led to dead ends, what keeps gnawing at Strahn. Who does he suspect is behind the Jigsaw murders? Is there another accomplice? What happened to Special Agent Perez or little Corbett? Will Hoffman be tested? To find these answers, watch Saw V, you wont be disappointed.I like this movie, it's a very good sequel that's a great build up to Saw VI. Hoepfully all of the questions will be finally answered in the last chapter. I love this series and all of the installments have been great (except part II which is good).

It should have been some twisted freak with an IQ greater than John who had beaten him in his own games by predicting John's mind.It sounds and looks so silly watching the head of police taking guided tours from John to become John II.

		<fullReview>This is mainly because of the opening scene and the last trap for the five people.I love the Saw films, but I feel they could have ended after two. You can tell they've changed writers and directors. I don't think it's been for the best.This one follows agent Strahm as he tries to find the new Jigsaw killer. We all know who that is after a viewing of Saw IV. Like everyone else trying to find out the secret, he dies a gruesome death. The movie, like the others leaves you hanging, but it keeps the same moral. There is a group of five that end up killing each other at every trap until they have to cut their arm in half to fill a beaker with blood.I do feel that this was the weakest of the series. The over the top gore factor is taking this from the torture genre to plain out splatter film. The gore is useless to make a movie effective. If only Wannel and Wan were still writing these.Well, I guess like everything in a long franchise, the Saw films are going to start degrading.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This "Saw" has been constructed from recycled materials.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If the "Saw" films are meant to follow in the tradition of the great 80's horror franchises, then it's fitting that the fifth installment is undoubtedly the dullest blade in the toolbox. Just like "The Dream Child" or "A New Beginning," "Saw V" is where the series starts showing it's age, and, most importantly, a lack of new ideas. In all honesty, after spending an hour and a half with this film, one is left with the unmistakable feeling that they've seen this before. From the gratuitous, anti-climatic opening to the telegraphed ending, "Saw V" does little to break new ground or even make it's audience squirm.Now, let's be honest, it's not all bad news for Number Five. Stepping up to the plate as first time director, David Hackl injects a new look into the world of "Saw," making it a noticeably different film than the previous three sequels, all directed by Darren Lynn-Bousman. Whereas Bousman had a fully-functional, early-David Fincher-like eye, Hackl roots his film in gritty reality. Even if some of the CGI'ed gore doesn't hold up, the rest of the film looks and feels very real -- a first for the highly stylized franchise. Of course, that also means that with all the cop-drama at play, it feels a little more like a weeknight network crime show and less like a horror movie. But I suppose that's not a bad thing. Afterall, since the horror aspect doesn't quite pan out in this film, it's strongest suite is the cat-and-mouse chase carried on by the two surviving detectives of "Saw IV" (as well as "Saw III," I suppose). Even if it all caps off in the most predictable, least-thrilling ending of the series, "Saw V" has at least got a pulse.But let's talk about the traps. Or the characters in the traps. Or Jigsaw, for that matter. All these elements are heavily borrowed -- not just in flashback -- from the other films. If you thought "Saw IV" leaned too heavily on "Saw III," you haven't seen anything yet. The movie is so wrapped up in it's main plot, that the five characters that are tested in the mid-section of the film are barely even fleshed out, let alone serve a purpose in the movie, other than to lead into the ending. The traps and the gore that results from them is boring, which would be forgivable in any other movie, but not in one where such elements are characters themselves in the movie. "Saw V," unfortunately, is a sagging let-down. It's perfectly watchable, it's got a somewhat engaging story, but if they are to push forward with a "Saw VI," they are really going to have to grab at straws to come up with something interesting. "Saw V" feels played out and tired, and by the time it ends, it's tough to see how the story can continue in any logical or intriguing way. Recommended for fans of the franchise, worth seeing at least once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After escaping a trap set up by Jigsaw's newest apprentice (The head detective of the last film) a cop discovers Jigsaw's newest successor's identity &amp; attempts to prove it to the cops who believe the heinous torture games are over. However Jigsaw's newest apprentice is now onto him &amp; is determined to silence him before the truth is known, while a group of people are locked in a chamber &amp; forced to participate in a series of games if they want to make it out alive (But not with all their body parts attached!) Fifth in what seems like an endless series that is quickly losing it's momentum &amp; freshness established in the 2004 original, pulls the same bag of tricks seen by fans in the first four, though with not as much fun. While the film has many painful, bloody kills, good acting, directing &amp; sports an interesting story, it overall fails to match up to the first four films in the series. TOBIN BELL appears briefly in flashbacks showing how his new apprentice wound up getting the job &amp; his involvement in the other four films captures &amp; trap executions. But the film has worn out it's welcome at this point. The film has a smaller cast than the first four, with the main focal point of the story being the three detectives &amp; less attention paid to the captured victims in an underground cell forced to overcome a series of deadly games in order to survive. Not that this matters much, since you could take the scenes with the captured victims out of the story &amp; you would still have a movie! &amp; the bulk of the film is merely flashback scenes that's set before the first four films. All in all if LION'S GATE/TWISTED PICTURES hopes to continue the franchise, they really need to come up with something fresh &amp; interesting to help bring the series back up to par, since each passing installment seems to be weaker then the last (with the exception in my opinion being SAW IV, which I actually like better than III) Heck even Tobin Bell's character now used in flashback is becoming less &amp; less interesting &amp; is really no longer needed in future installments. Why not move the story forward &amp; have the detective/apprentice character come into his own &amp; make him the new villain without having to share most of the movie with JIGSAW/JOHN KRAMER? The ending also fails to supply the interesting twists the first four exhibited (Though I liked it's small twist) &amp; Billy the Puppet is only shown in a couple of scenes as is Jigsaw's wife, who's role (Like Jigsaws) is limited here) All in all I think it's pretty safe to say that the SAW series is the new Friday The 13th series for the 21st century, in English in the 1980's when Friday The 13th kept making Paramount money, they pretty much had a new sequel come out every year. The same goes for SAW, as long as they keep making money, the sequels will continue to made each &amp; every &amp; every year until the audience says they have had enough &amp; with each sequel receiving lower &amp; lower ratings, the SAW series burial could be coming shortly. All in all worth a look for Saw fans &amp; followed by...you guessed it, another sequel! SAW VI.*** stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first Saw movie was a horror-thriller. Its opening scenes contained a shocking surprise of blood and death which prepared you for an exciting film. This opening and idea that the people had to find a way to escape before time ran out all made Saw an unusual and novel horror film.You know how sequels go, not so good, then worse with trilogies usually. When you have 5 films! Scraping the barrel isn't a sufficient description. By now its going through the motions or parting blood by numbers. The real horror of this movie is the lazy textbook way it tries to get to the audience. As franchises go on they get cheaper and cheaper directors and it shows. They really on the fame of the first movie to keep on flogging it.There are some merits to these movies in that they broke new ground and the cinematography is surprisingly good.

		<fullReview>Going in to the cinema I was both excited to see Saw V after being pleasantly surprised with the fourth instalment, and apprehensive that the film might crash and burn.The opening scene gave me the hope that again I might enjoy the film just as much as the previous ones - however I now know the reason for this - it was guest-directed by Darren Lynn Bousman...After that the film steadily spiralled downhill. Although some parts were clever and well conceived such as the 5 victims' need to work together and Hoffman's framing of Straum, Saw V in every sense lacks the spirit of the previous Saws.The audience is wrongfully made to believe that the twist at the end shall be the most vigorating and exciting of the franchise so far...and instead we are given a gory ending which anyone with half a brain could have spotted a mile off. Indeed I couldn't believe how it ends...and not in a good way.Let's hope that the 6th and final film recaptures some of the heart and muscle of the other parts of the franchise, and focuses more on an engaging script and clever direction and less on trying to make every member of the audience throw up</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"is easy to predict human mind ". indeed , this does apply to VIEWERS more then it does to the plot itself and this is the beauty i found here...as a stand alone movie this will likely NOT make sense to any new viewers. furthermore, even me, that i had seen the previous 4, i HAD to go watch again the endings of part 3 and part 4. THIS is likely the main most of "reviewers" have not gave a higher rating.the main "game" makes no sense in its first chapters but DOES so towards the end. i was just about to get very disappointed there and thoughts as "ah typical horror crap" came to mind only to freak out a bit later as in HOW i could actually THINK that in seeing the circumstances that the game plays out... i just realized how much human mind is indeed easy to predict no matter how smart or intelligent one think he/she is...for SOME fans of the original saw, this one does NOT have many twists, and for that i liked it more. while VERY gruesome and brutal at times, i liked very much how the plot's integrity has not YET been compromised. however there are not much suspenseful thrills here, but i think this is the best aspect to handle the TRANSITION from a dead killer(S) to a still alive one.i gave it only 7 because two main issues:1- the TIME lines are all over the place and unless a huge fan of all "saw"'s, as i mentioned above, a new viewer will likely get VERY confused as in what the heck is going on. i am so glad that number 5 did NOT fall in the typical commercial aspect of trying to attract even more customers and thus make a childish plot...2- the ending was simply not on my taste, and i think only a sadist will like it. however, UNLIKE, other serial based movie parts("species" comes to mind), this one will have a very logical continuity</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So much better than Saw IV</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw V - My Review I know this may be hard to believe but I'm not always right! Last year i castigated the film "Saw IV " for being a confusing mess and a continuation of a tired franchise. The first part of that statement still remains true but somehow the fifth installment has breathed some life into the series - unlike the some of the victims in the movie!!! Jigsaw might be dead, but his traps live on in this fifth Saw entry, which finds the series' production designer David Hackl at the helm for his debut directing gig. Costas Mandylor reprises his role as Hoffman, the detective whose involvement in the string of grisly murders turns out to be more than meets the eye. Picking up where the fourth entry left off, Hoffman is revealed to be a hidden accomplice in Jigsaw's grisly games of death, which look to be continued by the lawman. The plot bounces back and forth from the beginning of their relationship to the present, as Agent Strahm delves farther into the case. Fans of Star Star Trek will know that the movies have a pattern. The odd numbered movies are not as good as the even numbered ones. It's not deliberate , that's just the way it has turned out. The Saw films have gone exactly the same way. The original movie was fresh and exciting the second a let down . The third had some amazing contraptions and a gritty story while the fourth just sucked.It is disappointing that we have had to wait until the fifth film to clear up the confusion surrounding "Saw IV", but it does do it and once you get that clarity the film becomes quite enjoyable .The very first scene is a great one. A convicted killer is seen chained on on a slab with his neck locked on a brace. All of a sudden the TV flickers into life and Jigsaw appears- "Hello Seth, I want to play a game. Right now, you are feeling helpless. This is the same helplessness you bestowed onto others. But now, it's unto you"...... And believe me what happens , ain't pleasant!I didn't have any high expectation when i started watching Saw IV yet at the end i was pleasantly surprised with how much i enjoyed it.Sure , it's not going to win any awards for acting ,screenwriting or direction and some people are always going to hate films like this but it's firmly put the franchise back on track for me.Saw VI is set for release in October 2009.7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At the beginning i was not a very big fan from the Saw movies, but one day i got myself watching to the first movie, then the second and so on ... And honestly i was very pleased to find out that they made a good gore movie, with some good interpretations and some final twists that leave the audience in a stat of: -" What the hell(?) (...) and now ? "I would like to say that with Saw V that happens to me but honestly it didn't happen ... from the 5 movies this was the weakest. They dragged the story so further that they don't know were and how to end the movie. Jigsaw is maybe one of the best( or at least one of my favorites ) "criminal minds" made for the big screen, but in this movie they take from him a lot of "star quality" if you know what i mean ...When they say ... " you won't believe how it ends " i really believe they don't really know either !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Please tell me that Jigsaw is dead?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm going to keep this review of Saw V reasonably short and sweet ? with four Saw films already under our belts, we should all know exactly what we are letting ourselves in for. Saw I was a little rough around the edges, but the ending was brilliant. Saw II, eh, I can't even remember. Saw III was little more than ninety-odd-minutes of gore and torture which should have wrapped-up the series nicely, but didn't. Saw IV just left me standing in the cinema car park spouting a torrent of obscenities at the heavens, a scene reminiscent of Jennifer Love Hugetits in 'I Know What You Did Last Summer'... obscenities that ranged from 'what the hell was that?' through to 'why the hell did they keep making these films, and why the hell do I keep paying to see them?'. So avid reader, you can imagine my enthusiasm when it came to reviewing Saw V? Oh well, it could have been worse... I could have been reviewing a Will Ferrell film instead.Having summed-up my Saw experience pretty accurately in the introduction, I had to wonder what the hell was left for Saw V? We, the ticket-paying audience, have been lead to believe that Jigsaw apparently died back in Saw III, or at least that's what my fragile little mind can recall after the self-inflicted case of brain damage brought about from sitting through the logical abortion that was Saw IV. Now I use the word 'apparently' to allude to Jigsaw's death, because, let's face it, the writers love nothing more than to screw with the entire time line and history of the franchise with each new installment. Rather than the parallel time lines running through Saw IV, Saw V picks-up directly after the events of Saw IV - this time pitting Detective Hoffman (Costas Mandylor) and Agent Strahm (Scott Patterson) in a head-to-head battle over the investigation of the Jigsaw murders... all of this bubbling in the foreground while five brand new subjects are about to get a crash course in Jigsaw's very unique and equally effective rehabilitation program.Now as much as I would like to sit here and rip the absolute crap out of Saw V, I can't, and I won't. Sure, overlooking the fact that the whole franchise has been done to death, Saw V was actually one of the better films in the franchise. While I haven't entirely made up my mind as to where I would rank Saw V in the scheme of things, I must admit that this new film addressed a lot of my own personal criticisms of Saw II through Saw IV. While the aforementioned sequels relied heavily on gore and torturous traps, avoiding some much needed focus on plot and storytelling, Saw V actually bucks this trend and devotes a lot more time to plot. While the screenwriters have opted to continue the trend of screwing with the narrative of the previous films, almost forcing us to concede that everything we knew about Jigsaw is probably wrong, there is a definite vibe from the earlier films. Gore fans shouldn't be too disappointed, but the storyline is the real winner in Saw V. Instead of the usual paper-thin story wrapped around numerous and varied methods of torture and means of death, Saw V intersperses the trials and tribulations of our five Jigsaw victims through a reasonably developed take on the Jigsaw/Saw mythos.I must admit that the Saw series has always intrigued me more than other long running horror franchises, namely staples of the genre like 'Friday The 13th' or 'Nightmare On Elm Street'. Aside from the fact that Saw is a new brand for a new generation of horror fans, I found the whole backstory of two rookie Aussies making it big in Hollywood to be a fascinating tale. If I had my way, I'd love nothing more than to sit down with my two Antipodean brothers, Leigh Whannell and James Wan, and quiz them about everything Hollywood: especially the direction that the Saw franchise has taken.Unfortunately (fortunately for their bank balances), Whannell's and Wan's baby has become an inevitable victim of its own success. When the boys killed Jigsaw at the end of Saw III, they must have put the studio in an uncomfortable position - how could they invariably kill off an incredible money-spinner along with him? Hell no. With Jigsaw's death, the audience now find themselves subjected to the continual retelling of the same story, however from a slightly different viewpoint. I certainly understand why they do it: without keeping the story fresh, Saw films have about as much going for them in the longevity stakes as Marilyn Manson has in the take-home-to-mother stakes: somewhere between 'not at all' and 'bugger all'. As painful as these retellings have become (for me at least), especially with Saw IV, without the opportunity to reinvent and re-envision the setup, Saw films are little more than a ninety minute pornos for sick bastards. You can only torture and torment the characters, and audience, so much before you lose them completely. Saw V amends some of these transgressions, but to be honest, I think it's really time to pull the pin on the franchise with Saw VI.At the end of the day, it's really difficult to get that interested in these Saw films anymore - it's just the same old tired crap over and over. Don't get me wrong, the original Saw was inventive and fresh, but every inevitable sequel just feels like a case of flogging a dead cash cow. The sad thing is that the franchise probably costs bugger all to film compared to most Hollywood productions, and the punters are still streaming in to plonk down their money for a ticket. Ah well, if you love Saw, no doubt you will enjoy the sadism of Saw V... and Saw VI... and Saw VII...Edited excerpt from: www.youseenthat.com</fullReview>

Just like the previous parts in the series this film adds more plot holes and more inventive ways of making sure people have a miserable moment before they die.It's a typical film for the fans of the series - it brings nothing really new and story wise it only works out when you allowed yourself to sit through the previous parts as well, forgetting they had plot holes as deep as the grand canyon too. I guess this one is a little better than the previous one though for I know I saw it but I can't remember anything of it.So if you like to watch people snuff it in a nasty way after being held hostage by an evil game host this is the film for you.5 out of 10 ways to die</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saw all right but not enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As i said Saw all right, Thriller, keeps the user glued to the edge of his seat, ill keep on wondering whats gonna happen next, but then Saw has set the trend to go beyond that and thats where this one fails. ITs thrilling and entertaining, but the end must lead me to the "What the.......I didn't c that coming" this one doesn't. The traps seem to be set only because of the name Saw and don't seem to go naturally with the film. *POTENTIAL SPOILERS* The wild goose chase goes on as usual but culminates to a let down. The typical flashback sequence at the end does not lead to a revelation, the viewer is shown what hes seeing all along, nothing new. The movie seemed to be an answer to quite a lot of the unanswered questions but also raises a new set of questions as well. Also, if jisaw leaves nothing to chance, what would have happened if certain characters would have chosen another course of action? What if (at the end of part 4) the detective had not crashed thorough the door at the last second or a couple of seconds later? 3 characters would still be alive, and Hauffman could never be the hero. What if detective Stram had not left the room with jigsaws corpse? The body of Jigsaw was found which means he would be tracked alive later anyway. Then how could it be concluded that everyone was supposed to die and Hauffman was supposed to be the hero? What if Peter Stram entered the glass box at the end of the movie and survived? *END SPOILER* Overall good film, fine acting, very good traps and the revelation on the end of the traps was good. First time non involved members survive the traps. The unanswered questions will keeps die-hard saw fans waiting for the grand finale. I still feel the movie should have had an end commensurate to the Saw requirements, the tag-line does not live up to its name. Recommended for Saw fans and thriller fans (but ull have to watch the first 4 parts to make complete sense out of it) Good but could have been much better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been following the Saw series right from the beginning, and the setup for the fifth installment had me eagerly waiting for it. But it turned out to be a complete disappointment. Many of the questions raised in saw IV remain unanswered, the games are rather simple and even the final twist lacks the sting in the tail of previous installments. The focus keeps shifting which means that gore too is limited compared to its bloodier predecessors. Perhaps the producers of saw need to look into different direction, like a prequel with more role for jigsaw, or better still start of in a whole new direction with a new "killer", a new puzzle. Otherwise it may very well be a game over for the series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Metaphysics of the Saw pentalogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw Saw V. I liked it. Its one of the best in the growing series. I then saw Saw 4 to fill in the gaps on DVD as I missed its theatrical. Here comes Tricky Dicky's analysis of the saw Pentalogy of films, that shows no signs of stopping as it moves next year onto a hexology! The Saw films are about torture. But they also claim to about existential authenticity. The Saw films are presented as a caveat about the dangers of not appreciating life in its fullest existential dimensions. I have commented elsewhere that while the Saw films offer us a picture of 'torturing for your own good', they have failed to meet up to the challenge of their own thesis on occasion. The problem? The Saw film series premise often has tortures that no one would care to survive alive. So, built into the 'torture for life' motif is its own erasure with the 'you will be tortured until you don't want to live or sustain injuries to be sure you won't' motif.This negative dialectic is part of the series charm and appeal, I suspect. Its extreme nihilism has resonated with the under 30's of today. The torture conundrum of its plot they must relate to on some deep level, as it probably best condenses the emptiness of their lives into short torture porn vignettes.The Saw series is highly original in its theme and gruesome nature all the same. It presents a metaphysics of torture that is both disturbing and prescient, albeit negative.The new movie Saw V is one of the best of these films. The director of Saw V is David Hackl. The name Hackl recalls to my mind the early proto-fascist biologist and eugenicist Ernst Haeckel who believed and advocated the scientific guidance of all nature coming together to form the perfect organism; i.e. the monism. Interestingly a Haeckel motif is at work in Saw V! That of perfecting the organism. Jigsaw does it through torture. Haeckel did his work and theorising through science. The desired result: Nature perfected! Hackl, the director, weaves two stories together in Saw V. The first concerns a detective hunting down a renegade psycho cop who is now carrying on Jigsaw's work. The second is about a group of five people who have to survive the Jigsaw advocate's games. A third element concerns more Jigsaw back story, which is always fun if you like Tobin Bell, as I do. The torture scenes in the second segment slowly apply Social Darwinistic laws to the five folks under Jigsaw's world view made flesh. Soon only two are left. The challenges up to now have been believable and challenging but leaving the all important room for survival unscathed. The last torture though is absurd and revolves around ripping your arms to shreds to feed blood into a trap to release you. Again here the return of nihilistic motif of complete and utter hopelessness and defeat.The metaphysics of the Saw series could be and should be more fertilizing with its clever premise. Still after five films they are still Nihilista par excellence. Maybe this metaphysics of nihilism is the key to the series success? It is now the biggest horror franchise in US history. James Wan and Leigh Whannell can be very proud of that fact. My favourite Saw film is still Number one, where Jigsaw's games had some semblance of possible escape and a more fertilizing mythology of violence.But at bottom it seems the films and their makers are aware of the twisted nihilistic logic of the Saw pentalogy and are afraid to fix something that 'aint broke. Financially, that is of course, due to the films continued dominance at the B.O. every Halloween. With future installments could the franchise be moved in the direction of a more fertilizing orgy of positive violence? And less the cul de sac of unending nihilism? I would hope so? Whatever happens these films need to receive more serious critical attention. They are often dismissed as 'torture porn' or just gruesome, going over the heads of most reviewers afraid to confront what the films might actually portend. This dismissal from critics only goes to show the disturbing intellectual and cultural issues at the heart of the Saw series. Issues that I hope would receive more serious attention from film critics world wide.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A typical Saw movie and I must say that I'm very thrilled about it as a fan of these movies. As all the other films, it had an element of surprise and I was kind of surprised about the way it ended - very good ending, by the way! It is well constructed and the story seems very thought out. Very good acting, especially from Hoffman who seemed to have a Jigsaw-element inside of him. It seemed a lot to me that he had learned a lot from Jigsaw and he seemed a lot like Jigsaw in the first movies. Furthermore, you could feel the thirst for revenge that he obviously had inside. To me, this was probably the best Saw-movie since the first one - especially because I, as a fan, am very interested in the story and this is really a must if you desire to know more about the story and the minds of Jigsaw and Hoffman. I simply can't wait for number 6 to come out - hopefully it will end these fantastic series in an exciting and surprising way and finish the awesome work!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a big fan of SAW series, the 1st and 2nd of it were "extraordinary" for me. Its unique in every way, its different if you compare it to other psycho movie, Jigsaw play his game smartly and wisely, and better than what giant brainless psycho such as what you see on: Hallowen, See no evil, Texas chainsaw massacre, etc. However starting on the 3rd movie i felt losing my excitement on it, i would say even though it was possessed with more budget, the movie just not that smart and attractive anymore. On the 1st movie i saw how smart was him, he pretend to die when both of the victim struggle to make their best decision in order to save their lives. At the end the winner went out from the bloody bathroom safely. Saw 2 was completely different story, i never thought if you don't follow the rules it will cause you that much, it was great. Just after the movie i felt exciting to watch more about him and his newly born partner. The third one was just okay, its supposed to be the last of the trilogy just like what was planned, but its below my expectation. I honestly felt Jigsaw didn't die beautifully together with Amanda. When i heard about SAW IV, one thing on my mind "Does he haven't die yet", i thought maybe he is immortal. Agent Hoffman screw this movie, he don't posses Jigsaw look, i know he trying so hard replace jigsaw, but its still different. If you watch a newly released cartoon movie, BOLT, you will see the similarity of his expression compare to bolt. I just finished watching SAW V, i don't know how he will win the game, but i know he will win at the end for sure. His way of putting Strahm phone on the his desk and let Strahm to take the newly born Jigsaw credit was too awful, its like a drama movie. One big question on my mind, When did Hoffman learn to be a good engineer, remember he is a detective, it just don't make a sense, how can he create such deadly machine? I think i have enough of this, i will be at USA next year in for study purpose, i am sure that i wont watch SAW VI on the cinema. I hope James Wan will create a brand new thriller movie which is just as good as original SAW movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sadly one of the Horror series greats is slowly diminishing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the very first film Saw stuck out as finally finding new disturbing, horrific ground in the horror slasher flick genre. It built from the decent first one to the outstanding second installment but then started to stumble a little. The biggest problem I think with the Saw series is also one of the unique twists and that is the terminal illness and eventual death at the end of the third installment of the killer. Jigsaw/John Kramer is one of the greatest killers in horror movies and Tobin Bell single handedly made Jigsaw his own. Granted the film makers have always managed to bring Jigsaw back in one way or another but he is completely dead in this fifth installment and that means we only get to experience Jigsaw/John Kramer in flashbacks which is just not the same. Even the apprentices he works with including Amanda just aren't the same unless he is there. Still I give the Saw writers, producers and directors kudos for trying to keep the series fresh and original and always finding ways to tie all of the films together right from the very beginning. The only downside to that is each film makes a lot more sense if you're fresh from seeing the other ones.I touched on Tobin Bell earlier but he truly IS the heart and soul of the Saw series. Certainly in the later installments including Saw V we get to know a lot more about his past and how he became what he is and why he does it. Bell is amazing and they MUST continue to bring him back. He is awesome. Costas Mandylor plays Jigsaw's latest apprentice as we discovered at the end of Saw IV. Mandylor is decent and certainly has a very ominous quality about him but he doesn't hold a candle to Bell. Still he does a solid job in his role. Scott Patterson plays Agent Strahm hot on the heels of discovering Jigsaw's final apprentice. Patterson's Strahm is a great protagonist and although he often comes across a little reserved and monotoned he still does a good job. Betsy Russell also returns as John Kramer's estranged wife Jill. I am determined to believe that there is more to her character than they've unraveled so far. I hope the focus shifts to her in future installments. She has been great so far and really added to the story and I think she could do a lot more if given the right chance to.David Hackl picks up the helm and he is new to the directors chair. I'm not sure I would have given the Saw series to a newcomer but he seems to do alright. The film still has the Saw feel to it which is good however some key things have changed which make this on a bad track that they need to put things back on. First of all with each Saw film culminating in Saw V the victims have become rather faceless. In the first film you became very involved in the characters and their situation and then that aspect decreased with each film. I think its important for the watcher to become attached to the people Jigsaw preys on. And secondly for the first time the traps seem to be losing their originality and their shock value. You can't blame the writers for running out of ideas but they really need to get that shock value and originality back in the traps and deaths. Still the series continues on and I will continue to come back for more. I'm just hoping they can continue on strongly in future installments. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pendulums, flash-backs and buzz-saws... Oh, my! "Saw V" makes up for a few plot-related shortcomings with stylish traps and informative back-stories...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Detective Hoffman, the apparent heir to Jigsaw's legacy, feels that his secret is threatened, he embarks on a mission to protect his identity. At the same time, Peter Strahm, the FBI agent on the trail of finding the truth, must go on a rogue hunt for answers when he is removed from the case.That is the basic, spoiler-free plot outline of "Saw V', once again proving that with a little thought, a horror series can consistently have quality and spirit.This entry, the reigns of the director are handed over to David Hackl, who was a production designer and second-unit director on several of the other "Saw" films. Hackl is confident in his style, which has some of the touches of "Saw" II-IV helmer Darren Lynn Bousman, but is also different enough to not simply be a copy-cat of Bousman. Hackl seems more content with showing us the traps in a slower and more direct light, as opposed to Bousman's flashy, mile-a-minute pace. It functions as a nice contrast from previous films, and it serves the story well. If this is only his first film, then it is safe to say that Hackl very well could have a future as a director. Or at least a horror director.But let's get down to the film itself. Here's the checklist...-Returning characters who play larger roles than before... check! -A slew of new, twisted traps... big check! -Flash-backs galore that fill in more of the back story... check! -New plot elements and/or characters or mysteries to keep the pace for another sequel... check! -Etc.Basically, this film follows the formulas established by the previous films faithfully. Though this isn't necessarily the greatest thing.You see, this is the fifth film of a wildly successful horror/suspense-franchise, and by now, most series have lost their heat. "Saw" has maintained much more quality than most other series by this point. And sadly, from some fan reactions out there, this may pose a problem, as the formula becomes more familiar. At this point, we have a fair idea of what to expect, and by now fans know to look for hints and clues. This poses a problem, as this makes the many twists and turns the story gives us easier to predict. Hence, some may feel a little let-down by the film's story in the end.But, if you are willing to look past the fact that this sequel is essentially just another "Saw" film, with enough credibility and originality to keep it fresh, than you will undoubtedly love it.The bottom line: "Saw V" gives us more of the same, except polished and refurbished, but isn't that what we all want? I don't go into a "Saw" film and see a radical departure from the past, I go in to see a "Saw" film, and in that respect, "Saw V" fits right in as an appropriate and blood-curdling entry. And so, strictly as a fan, I give it a good 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sad story of a movie that lost the plot.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sigh. What to do with this series? SAW has been kicking and flailing its way through a trail of mediocre sequels ever since the first one became a hit, and this one really isn't that much worse than the others, but it's just so apparent here that the series has lost it. Yeah, it's been signed on for six movies total, but that doesn't make this any good.I mean, come on, this movie is almost a total Cube ripoff, without any of the sophistication or most of the suspense of that killer movie. The most obvious problem is that there isn't really any story to these movies anymore. It started off convincingly enough, but by now even the series' most fervent fanboys must be able to admit that the directors probably had no idea what they were doing after the first sequel, and just started ad-libbing and aping Se7en for all their ideas. They keep changing their story and adding stuff in, and you just know they didn't intend for the series to end up this way at the start. Total garbage.And another thing. These movies are just too damned dark. I like dark themes as much as the next guy, but this is just literally too dark. As in, I can barely see anything that's going on. That is to hide the gore and make this one more appealing to Hollywood audiences, while still claiming that this is "SHOCKINGLY GORY AND GROTESQUE!" The gore here isn't that bad at all. Nonsense.The most aggravating thing is that I still don't hate this. It sucks, and it's pretty much the lowest you can get while still being good enough to get into theaters, but it does have some pretty interesting twists. It's just that they are not actually applied to an ACTUAL MOVIE. This isn't so much a movie as it is a collection of plot twists, and half the time it can't even pull that off because the story makes no sense! Seriously, it just goes back to what I mentioned before about the series basically just being a running gag of ad-libbing mania - they just keep throwing in new plot devices and new characters to hide the fact that there really is no story here at all. The good ideas here are so muted that nobody will really give a crap in the first place. A sad story of a movie. God, go put on some No Country for Old Men or The Dark Knight instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In The End All The Pieces Will Fit Together CONTAINS SPOILERS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now I am one of the biggest ever hardcore saw fans, i love nothing more than the saw movies ever since the first saw came out I've watched 1 a day. I was hyped up the most for Saw V. I fell in love with the trailer with Agent Strahm being in it, and i loved the idea of the head box water trap. Then i saw the tag-line "You Wont Believe How It Ends" now that got me more pumped up than ever. But when the movie ended in the cinema i said to my brother beside me "Thats how it ended?!" and i left the cinema trying to get my head around what happened. After a few days i started to love the movie, mainly because Agent Strahm, who is my favourite character, got his chance to shine. The BIG TWIST in the end was actually very predictable but that dosn't matter. I think the tag-line is right because it is played out pretty shocking and i don't think it matters that we could predict it. There were about 4 AMAZING TRAPS in this movie: The Pendelum Trap, Head box water trap, hand saw trap and the grand finale glass box trap. The Rest weren't that good. There are some confusing moments like why is the saw 2 house refurbished and have they found the bathroom below it. I was disappointed that they didn't show Officer Rigg die, but they did mention his death, same for Agent Perez. It's good we got to see what happened to Jeff's Daughter. Agent Strahm's water trap has to be my favourite scene in the movie, ever since i saw the trailer i loved it. I'm very disappointed that Strahm died and that is pretty much the ending, Hoffman has pinned strahm as the apprentice and now that he is dead Hoffman can go on without any further threats...or so he thinks. Saw V could of been better but i loved it, i like Saw IV a bit more than V. Are they ever gonna explain what happened to Dr GOrdon!?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saw Part V</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally, after waiting for a long year, I got to see SAW V two days ago, I was really scared, not because of the movie, but because of the negative comments that it had everywhere around the web; I was afraid to be disappointed. Well, i thought SAW V was really good, and I think it's an improvement over part IV, where the plot and some of the twists looked really forced (for example that Riggs was going to be just on time to mess it all up) or had scenes which I hated and considered unnecessary (Eric Matthews' death), I think that V saves the whole saga from going downhill and I was delighted to see the new traps (they're not all bloody, but very smart and creative and believe me, they kill - don't know why so many people complain about the traps of this one). On the negative aspects, I have to warn that there's some bad acting, but not from any main characters (Jigsaw/Hoffmann/Strahm) but from one or two test subjects, so it's not an important flaw at all; about the story I have to say that is really interesting, because we finally get rational explanations (with the flashbacks) about what happened on Saw I, II, III, IV, and almost everything fits nicely and without forced or absurd assumptions, hell yeah, Jigsaw you're a genius. Obviously, we don't only get these clarifications, but a whole new story that will challenge the viewer and will pose some new interesting questions to sort out. V kind of drags when they start investigating way too much, but the payoff is really worth it (awesome ending).I'm eager to watch the conclusion to the series... (Btw, 5.9/10 I think it's way too underrated).8 out of 10. Definitely recommended if you're a true Saw fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Average Sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was not expecting much from this film. It is pretty much more of the same. The ending was predictable. The death scenes were good. The acting was average. One thing i will say is how impressed i am at how the writers are managing to come up with sequels when the Jigsaw is dead. Very cleaver how they have done it.I think it's time now for the makers of saw to put their own franchise in a Saw-esquire torture device and kill it off. So, please please please, in Saw VI, kill off all the bad guys because we have now had 5 films where the bad guy wins and I for one am getting very bored of the same ending.So, this film is worth a watch, it wont win over any new viewers but die hard Saw fans will be pleased all the same.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alright to begin with, Saw 5 did a great job with the story and developing a background of the characters, however, what it lacked is the ending smart enough to make you say, "are you kidding me?" just like saw 4..I solemnly feel that the saw franchise has gone too far, because we all know that coming up with different styles of gory killing methods is the new American style of pleasing people, and it does not implore you to be creative, just sadistic..Also, with every movie the writers are giving away an opening for another saw movie. If this goes on like this, this franchise will never finish its self righteous path and fans will dissipate. We all know when things turn absurd.I have given this movie a 7/10 for two reasons, the story (despite the ending) and new traps, nothing else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw V- **1/2 By Kevin MullerThe new entry in the "Saw" franchise starts off promising, but just like one of jigsaw's tricks, the movie screws over itself by getting drowned out by the over the top violence. It is as if the film is afraid of making the its audience do the one thing most fans don't do when they watch a Saw film...think.New director David Hackl films the story in the same style, but early on adds something new. This aspect of the story would be more frightening than the blood, guts and decapitations; it is something called influence.See, there are people out there who are easily influenced by many things: movie stars, sports stars or political figures, etc. Then there are those who are influenced by perversions because deep down they are as evil as people like Jigsaw, though Jigsaw acts out his sick fantasies. What if that perverted person, who once was a good citizen, sees Jigsaw as a savior or maybe that he gets how to deal with the dark world we live in? See, these are all questions that Hackl raises in the first act of Saw and it is really interesting to watch a certain character be manipulated by Jigsaw. The moral of the story is how easy is it to hold on to what makes us good when everything is taken away.I was going to give this film three and half stars up until it became afraid of its own intelligence and resorted back to being what we expected it to be. The five victims in the main trap this time are so uninteresting that you don't care what happens to them or why they are there. The only mildly interesting one of the bunch is one of the first to go, leaving us with a remainder or characters that you just say to yourself "Just get it over with already."Agent Straham (played by Scott Patterson) is on the case for Jigsaw and his accomplice this time around. Patterson seems like a good actor, but is given absolutely nothing to work with besides responses to crime photographs. It is one of the most one dimensional characters I have ever met. He is worse than the victims in the main trap. With them, at least they have some sort of characteristics about them, even though they maybe annoying. This is a Saw movie, I will take what I can get.It may seem like I hated this movie, but I didn't. In this reviewers opinion, I think it is the strongest film since the second one. It just really annoyed it didn't have the guts to expand on the great ideas it had going for itself in the first half, because it would have surpassed the original in terms of film making if it did. There is a shot in the movie that perfectly captures how I feel about this film. The Jigsaw copy cat had small figurines representing the five victims in miniature version of the room they are held captive in. To me, those figurines represent many things to me: the actors who sign up for these movies, the audience members who feed this franchise and the director who didn't have the will do something different when he had the chance. Well, maybe they will do something next year when "Saw VI" comes out. Probably not though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When will this end?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As long as the cash keeps flowing in, chances are we'll be stuck with the Saw franchise for a very long time, despite a significant drop in quality and, more crucially, the fact that the series' "hero", Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) died two installments ago (not that something similar has ever stopped producers from demanding sequels in other horror sagas either). Only three things matter: gore, a twist at the end and die-hard fans paying to see the latest episode, no matter how disappointing.Interestingly enough, Saw V is a bit of a breath of fresh air in that it marks a departure from previous entries: aside from the bloody prologue (which, apparently, was directed by Darren Lynn Bousman, whereas the rest of the film was handed over to newcomer David Hackl), the usual game scenario, which borrows heavily from the premise of Saw II, is given less space than usual. Sure, there are the usual unlucky people (including Dexter's Julie Benz and 24's Carlo Rota) who have to mutilate themselves in order to survive, but one has the distinct feeling those scenes were added just to spice up the main storyline, which plays out like a traditional mystery film: Special Agent Strahm (Scott Patterson), having survived one of Jigsaw's traps, is firmly convinced the case isn't closed, and rightfully suspects foul play coming from Detective Hoffman (Costas Mandylor), who - as the audience already knows - has been assigned to carry on the philosophical serial killer's legacy. As Strahm gets closer to the truth, a series of flashbacks explain the real nature of Hoffman's association with Jigsaw.In the previous entry, those flashbacks were a blatant excuse for providing some moronic back-story (and yet, for some reason, they worked) and giving Tobin Bell some screen time in spite of the events of Saw III. To that extent, the gimmick is fully justified in Saw V, since Bell's presence is the only thing that adds a minimum of tension. The downside is that the writers take this opportunity to expand on the series "mythology" and reveal new things we didn't know about Saw I-IV, meaning anyone who doesn't have a thorough knowledge of the franchise won't get most of the new stuff. Plus, as is customary in this sort of production, the acting isn't much to write home about, not counting Bell, Benz and, occasionally, Mandylor (although Patterson deserves credit for his first two scenes, a hint of which can be found in the spot-on teaser). Everyone else is just like the character they're playing: expendable in a torrent of blood.As for the twist... Well, that's actually kind of worth enduring 85 minutes of dodgy plotting for: it's arguably the most predictable one in the series (the first ten minutes practically give it away), but it's executed with a sadistic brilliance that makes it ironically enjoyable. However, even that guilty pleasure can't cover up one incontrovertible truth: these films should have died when Jigsaw did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creative mayhem keeps franchise moving</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It goes without saying, doesn&#x2019;t it, that if you didn&#x2019;t like the first umpteen movies in a horror series, you aren&#x2019;t likely to enjoy number umpteen and one. It&#x2019;s also a truism that the later you get into a horror franchise - or as I used to say, the higher the Roman numeral - the worse the movies will be. This is sometimes because more movies can mean bigger budgets, which can mean more special effects and less of a focus on plot. After all, those Freddy, Jason, and Michael movies had the same basic plot framework each time out - everyone tries to run from the very obvious, lurching murderer, he slices and dices them, one person survives, and so on. After a few movies of this, you might start watching them ironically.But Saw breaks that mold a little bit. Oh, sure, you know who the bad guy is, or was. But obviously Jigsaw&#x2019;s death a few movies ago didn&#x2019;t end the story. Even finding out he had a new recruit - who also later died - didn&#x2019;t end things. And even finding out that that recruit might not have been the only person helping out Jigsaw doesn&#x2019;t put a damper on things. Such twists seem plausible, not gimmicky. In other slasher movies, the only exposure one would have to creativity on the screen would be the various ways people would be killed off. Everything else would be by the numbers.Now, on the one hand, Saw V might not make a lot of sense if you&#x2019;ve never seen any of the other ones. But it&#x2019;s not as bad in this area as, say, Lord of the Rings. With LoTR, if you hadn&#x2019;t seen the first two, you&#x2019;d be lost watching the third. That&#x2019;s not entirely true with Saw, because although there are countless references to the earlier films - and, indeed, some events take place parallel to events in other films - there&#x2019;s also a new thread to follow that makes sense in and of itself: five strangers awake in a room with no obvious escape; they all wear collars (all wired together, of course), and the keys to the collars sit in glass boxes on the other side of the room. They have a limited amount of time to get their collars off, because after the clock winds down, they&#x2019;re decapitated. Ahem.Alongside that drama, there&#x2019;s the unfinished business of the last movie. Who really is behind the Jigsaw murders now, with Jigsaw himself gone? We got our answer at the end of Saw IV (no spoilers here), but you&#x2019;re never really certain, up to the end, that that answer was authentic, either.I think what makes the Saw movies work for me is that they&#x2019;re not a simple matter of hacking people to bits. There&#x2019;s always some sort of twisted morality at play. Jigsaw makes people play his games because he wants them to be rehabilitated. He wants them to atone for their sins. As he famously tells his accomplice, he never killed anyone; he always gave them a way out. (Sure, sometimes that way out would be to cut off your foot to escape a chain, or to reach into a dead guy&#x2019;s intestines to retrieve a key, but those are ways nonetheless.) Jigsaw may be a broken man, but he&#x2019;s not an entirely vengeful one. Well, he is vengeful, sure, because he doesn&#x2019;t mind if the person winds up dead, but he&#x2019;s magnanimous (in his eyes); he wants them to choose their own path.I also like the creative gore. I like mayhem of this magnitude, but I gotta tell you - just trying to shock me isn&#x2019;t going to work. Saw is effective in that every &#x201c;game&#x201d; is an elaborate plan that depends not only on excellent project-management skills but also on predicting how a particular person will react given a choice. Knowing human nature, Jigsaw says, means nothing is left to chance in his games.As with the rest of the Saw movies, I had some questions. Now, there&#x2019;s nothing wrong with unanswered questions, really; not every loose end must be tied up. (And, truth be told, there are loose ends partly because there will be another Saw movie.) After mulling things over and researching a bit online, I had some plausible explanations for those questions. But even if I didn&#x2019;t, I wouldn&#x2019;t feel as if the movie was incomplete or a gyp.Saw is a sort of harmonious discord, ordered chaos that makes perfect sense when viewed from afar. But the terror that the victims feel is extremely palpable, and there are several scenes that might even force you to look away for a moment, as there are in all Saw movies. Of course, if you&#x2019;re in the theater for this one in the first place, you&#x2019;re probably not going to be too squeamish about the visceral violence. But even the droolingest slasher aficionado will nod approvingly at the tortuous, needle-threading plot that effectively sets up every last millisecond of bloodletting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is defiantly the best Saw movie yet. The traps still had the old 'OMG! How are they going to get outta that' factor, but were still so original. What I really love is they are still able to work with it even though they killed off the main character. This eventually destroys a series (if the deceased is a mortal) or it loses something, but it went the total opposite with this and it seemed to encourage creativity in the writers; most if not, all of the movie, was a flash back and gave you more of a feel for who Jigsaw really was and what he wanted out of his subjects. And the characters in this one were what you'd expect; the corrupt, the druggies, and the people that take life for granted. But, like all of the subjects you feel sorry for them, but then you think of what got them in this situation in the first place and smile. The FX in the movie were pretty dang good as well and for a true fan or someone with a natural curiosity, it would dazzle them and make them wonder "how did they pull it off". Highly recommend it if you're a fan, but it wouldn't be wise to start with this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fine Resurrection of a Probably "dead" franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into Saw V with the curiosity of how they would manage to tell the story where almost all major characters have been unraveled. Having watched the previous ones I was expecting a sequel that does not follow the same path as its predecessors but at the same time makes sense enough to take the almost ended story to a new level. From this perspective the movie was somewhat gratifying as it answered some hanging questions after the abrupt end of Saw 4 and gave a new start to it too.I would empathize with those who could not enjoy this movie as much as I did considering that the concept of the story is now a bit old and reknown. But the movie does have a lot of engrossing moments and does not seem to compromise in its entertainment value. You cannot expect a completely fresh and different approach altogether in context of the on-going story since last 4 movies. It is a feat itself to have come up with a 5th one for such a complicated movie. I am still a fan curiously waiting for the next one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I watched the original movie, I had my doubts - two blokes in a room with a hacksaw? Sounded very limited. But the script was fantastic, and the movie showed just how good a low-budget movie could be with a good script (matched with decent performances and direction). The popularity of the movie led the money people to draw the conclusion that elaborate gory violence was the key to Saw's success, and Saw II etc. followed.To be fair, there is probably some truth to that conclusion and, to be even more fair, the notion of some nutcase providing those with guilty secrets with a choice between death or redemption through pain is a good one.After Saw II and Saw III I dipped out on Saw IV. Saw V therefore contains a number of elements which made little sense to me as they derived from a film I have not seen. To be frank, this doesn't really matter that much - the suspense-filled script is no longer the heart of the movie: instead we are concerned simply with how messily people are going to die. And the answer is "very messily indeed".There are flashbacks which are not very effectively signposted as flashbacks, so there are times when you're not very clear whether you are watching the progress of the story now, or some piece of fill-in information illuminating something which happened in a previous film.If you liked II, II and IV then you'll like V - it delivers exactly what you expect it to, no more, no less. Simple, really.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where do i start? contrary to what many are saying about disliking Hoffman's backstory, i thought that it was definitely plausible and it is the main reason why i enjoyed the film. where the film lacked was the 5 person game which did not emotionally involve the audience. the traps were weak, with exception to the necktie and the final. more suspense shouldve been built within the game. i hated all the characters, especially mallick, who i think was given the role of a heroin addict only because his acting was so poor. Meagan good is a decent actress, but this film doesn't allow her to use her magic. the bombs were lame and so was the trap that killed Meagan good. i could care less about how these people were related, and i felt like the game was a sorry excuse to repeat what was done already done in saw 2 with the group. the movie would've been better as a short 20 min film that explained Hoffman's connection than a full movie. the ending was actually pretty good, but again, the writing was so bad that it felt as though the movie ended while it was still in act 1. the ending could've been set up a lot better. of course there was no real twist and nothing that made the audience really have to think. Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan(whatever their names are) really need to focus on their writing ability because i truly believe that if Leigh had both of the same scripts, he would've delivered a lot more. 1 more thing, I'm sure i speak for all fans when i say that i am tired off cliff hangers and plot holes. The writers and directors need to start delivering and quit just trying to make a quick buck. y'all are screwing up what once was the best horror series by far.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lets not play a game.Saw V I hate to say was one of the weakest films of the series. There are spoilers ahead so read at your own risk! Saw 5 leaves a lot of unanswered questions, unanswered. Some are from the previous films as well as the the film itself. Now I am a big Saw fan,despite the amount of gore in it, was very displeased with saw V. Not only did it make parts confusing, the actors dialogue was horrible. The only reason why I gave it a six out of ten was because even though it was very bad I don't have the heart to give one of my favorite series a horrible grade. it was just boring to me and not at all suspenseful for me. It made me yawn and drowsy. Sorry David Hackl Bring David Lynn Bousman or James Wan back to direct.Gore- As far as gore goes I didn't really have a problem with it. The only parts that were kind of gory was when Charles died from the explosion and when Agent Strahm arm cracked in half (actually kinda graphic) and was crushed by the walls. Who dies obviously. Glass box is shown during this.Plot- Worst I have seen so far of the saw films. There really is no plot. It is more a extended part to Saw 4. Meaning its not even really a film. The ending will not shock you. The ending is more hype than anything else. The ending was not even good. Characters- There are 5 characters who are the next contestants in Jigsaws game. Or should I saw Hoffmans game. They are linked by the relationship to a house burning down.(could be the house from saw I and II) where 8 people died. Those people could be all the people form saw II (thats 6 excluding Detective Matthews son and Amanda) then there's Adam and Zepp from saw I. That's the magical number 8. Don't take my word that is just my guess. Other people have guessed that too. Tobin Bell (Jigsaw) did not have much of a part in the movie just in flashbacks. Really the new characters are boring. I thought that they were supposed to explore more of Billy and his Trike but nope and explain what happened to Jeffs Daughter who gets rescued by Hoffman who's is deemed the hero. Also Jill is back and gets a box from john it does not explain what is in it but from guessing it is evidence that Hoffman is now the accomplice to jigsaw. This is how the characters die in case you cant handle the blood and Gore. Warning spoilers ahead!!!!!!Jigsaw-already dead Agent Strahm- crushed by walls (arm breaking most graphic) blood goes onto the glass box where Hoffman is in. Luba-stabbed in the neck(apparently by Brit, she didn't trust her) then electrocuted (has to do with the trap). Charles- blow up by C-4 (kinda graphic you see remains)(did anyone else know he is Morris O'Brian from 24.) Mallick- he survives all the traps but he could have died from the blood loss in the end trap. Ashley- head decapitated (head clearly shown falling off and blood surrounds the wound. Seth- cut in half (I couldn't really see that he was cut in half but blood clearly shown though). And flashbacks of others being killed in their traps.So if your are a die hard fan and really like the four first movies cover you ears and close your eyes and ignore saw V. Go see another movie worth your time. You wont be missing anything important. But don't take my word for it, go see it yourself and critique it yourself. I was literally urging an hour into the movie out of my seat to leave but I respect the Saw films so I stayed. Plus I paid ten dollars for an 92 minute movie!!! That is only one hour and 32 minutes what a waste of my money! But see it for yourself and see what you think of it. I really had high hopes but they were shot down. lets just hope Saw VI is the last film. it will have to make up for Saw V. also i think they should stop making sequels after saw VI. they said they might even make a Saw VII. Please don't!! with horror sequels the way they are we might see saw XVI (16) in the coming years. just like many other movies that have a zillion sequels they don't need.Anyway go see it yourself and see what you think.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lacklustre installment in a struggling franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the past few years a new entry in the "Saw" franchise has become as much a part of Halloween as trick-or-treating and media hysteria about candy apples being flavored with razor blades. However nothing lasts forever and, based on the evidence of the fifth and latest installment of the series, this particular tradition may be running out of gas.After a promising opening set-piece that pays tribute to Edgar Allen Poe's classic "The Pit and the Pendulum", the film divides it's running time between two parallel plot lines. The first concerns the fate of the latest collection of wrongdoers who have been selected to run a gauntlet of the grisly tests that are the series' trademark. Some of the new traps that this unlikable quintet have to endure are equal to the best from the previous films, others however are most definitely substandard. Nonetheless, their misadventures are filmed compellingly and there are some delightfully horrific moments during their efforts to escape the mechanical hell that they have been condemned to endure.The other plot centers on the efforts of an FBI special agent to prove that troubled homicide Detective Hoffman is responsible for at least some of the Jigsaw murders (which are shown in flashback). It appears that the screenwriters have lost sight of the fact that the "Saw" movies are slasher films, not murder-mysteries. Since the original (much, much stronger) plot was conclusively wrapped up by the end of "Saw 3", it is inevitable that an ever-more convoluted backstory would be necessary to explain why new Jigsaw-style killings would continue to occur. Nonetheless, the plot is carried forward this time around by a bewildering series of flashbacks that threaten to overload both the audience and the fragile narrative continuity so carefully constructed in the previous films.In any case, director David Hackl raises the overall suspense to a reasonable level and there is enough gore to satisfy franchise loyalists. However this is also the first installment of the franchise that is better value as a DVD rental than a full-price movie ticket. All good things...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jigsaw was one clever sadist; not only was creating elaborate torture traps to use on countless victims his forte, but he also managed to stay a step ahead of the police at all times, outsmarting them even in his death by using one of their own to carry on his bloody legacy. The latest set of grisly games are perpetrated by Detective Mark Hoffman, an embittered cop who?unbeknownst to his fellow officers?acted as the right hand to The Devil himself. His plans may go awry however when he crosses paths with the sole survivor: Peter Strahm?a devoted and astute federal agent who slowly begins to piece together the clues that will crack the case. Fifth installment of the interminable series doesn't have much of a story to tell, instead relying heavily on flashbacks accompanied by the usual violence and gore. You get used to it after five films, but hopefully by the time Saw XVI rolls around everything will finally be unraveled. *?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw V was one of the worst ways to spend my Friday evening. I went to the movie expecting the satisfaction I got from Saw I-Saw IV. The movie opens with a great plot, something that you would expect from a Saw movie. You think it is great until you get that terrible way to keep a movie going - a character talking to no one (the camera). Agent Strahm goes throughout the movie talking to himself, explaining his thoughts to no one as the movie progresses. The style of going from one scene to another leaves the watcher confused as to when that particular scene took place. The first scene that has Jigsaw in it seems to be a present time, but he had an autopsy in the beginning of Saw IV. Now what you might be thinking is "Why would you give it a 5 out of 10 and not a 1 out of 10?" The traps in this movie are done fairly well. The main trap that lasts throughout the length of the movie is amazing. As a huge fan of Saw, I recommend this to anyone who is already a fan of Saw. If you have not seen any of the Saw movies, don't. This will leave you disappointed and wanting your money back.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When a franchise is built from the ground up by producers who know that it will cater to a rather specific audience, most would be under the impression that the creators of said franchise would try their best to continue to please their fans. Unfortunately, Saw is an example of a franchise that has not been able to maintain the gritty, twist-driven premise of its first outings. It has instead fallen drastically in quality, now mirroring the likes of Friday The 13th and Halloween, with each sequel bearing less and less resemblance to the hidden gem from which it came. Saw is considered by many to fall under the classification of Gore-Porn, a term originally coined for Hostel, directed by Eli Roth (Cabin Fever), referring to the pointless exploitation of blood and unsettling imagery. Although this point is commonly disputed by fans who insist that the franchise is built off of "psychological suspense", the term has slowly grown more and more appropriate as each continuing piece is released, and Saw V is unfortunately no exception. Revolving around Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) and his apprentices, Saw V follows Detective Hoffman (Costas Mandylor) and his quest in tying up all loose ends that could possibly trace back to him, and consequently to his involvement with the franchises key villain. While the plot is rather thin, viewers are given their fair share of blood and head-turning gore, as well as many flashbacks that fill in holes from the past films. Where its predecessors have all relied on one massive, final twist at the end of the films, Saw V is the first movie in the series to leave a majority of the audience underwhelmed. A franchise that reels in half its audiences based only off of its final 10 minutes, it is almost guaranteed that Saw VI, to be released in 2009, will be victim to a sharp drop in box office intake, as this film has most certainly lost a good number of its fans. With a budget of $11 million, Saw V contains the highest budget in the series. This is largely to blame for it's effect and gore driven appearance, as it no longer has to rely on intelligent plot point or script. Operating on such low costs, Saw is Lionsgate Productions cash-cow, a definite source of income that is destined to send them money by the truck-full. This is also the reason for the increasing lack of quality in each of Saw's successors, as film-makers have realized they need not waste effort on what is a definite money winner.When all is said and done, the creators of the Saw franchise are 100% correct. Fans of the franchise will return to theatres each and every year in order to shell out their 10 dollars on the film, no matter the quality. This being said, hopes are still high that the writers of the franchise manage to please fans with a satisfying end to the series come October 30th 2009, which can unfortunately not be said for this years outing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Again Jigsaw/Tobin Bell executing murders full of scares , chills and suspense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Kramer (Tobin Bell) still lives from beyond the tomb , thanks to tape dug out of his autopsied stomach and by means of various flashbacks with the puppet-master Jigsaw. Conscious, throughout , Kramer entertains himself by monitoring the tests against his victims, he's devised. Thus the machinations begin again and the story tries to spark life into a disembowelled body. The picture starts with an unknown man tied and under the torture of pendulum (Edgar Alan Poe's The Pit and the Pendulum). As the newspapers publicize Jigsaw killer responsible of the pendulum murder . Later a group of characters (Meagan Good, Julie Benz, Grey Bryk, Carlo Rota) locked and tied into a room of pain. Inside the house the five incarcerated hapless attempt to figure out cryptic videotaped tracks and getaway fiendishly body-trapped places.The challenging is how to get out of Kramer's imprisonment of new unfortunates in a single looked room. Parallel plot strands threaten an obsessed FBI profiler (Scott Patterson), another survivor of the last bloodbath , furthermore interrogate Jigsaw's estranged spouse (Betty Russell). One time dead Jigsaw, now Mark Hoffman (Costas Mandaylor) is the last person who can follow the legacy of the strange series killer. The agent receives a letter saying : I know who you are . Meanwhile agent Peter Strahm looks for antecedents about Hoffman , as he discovers : 'Local woman brutally murdered in domestic dispute, boyfriend kills Detective's sister' as he suspects about heroic agent Hoffman of having had a hand in the killings. After all, he investigated every one of the murders and had a personal interest in one of them that of his slain sister.The twisted imagination Jigsaw and his pupil lavish upon their engines of pain with thrills and chills. Although the perverse master/protg is explored to some effect , the flashback edition structure is more complex and confusing than the previous films and is packed with some flaws and gaps.This exciting denouement details astonishing murders at the hands of the dead deviser who is planning again gruesome and complex killing set-pieces. This fifth sequel from original by James Wan, contains grisly terror, tension, suspense and lots of blood and gore . The film takes accent as suspense as well as terror with creepy use of images-shock and slick edition. Provides an imaginative and well-knit screenplay plenty of twists and surprises although develops the mythology of Jigsaw in an ambitious but ultimately predictable manner . Like David Fincher's Seven and Dario Argento's Tenebre, Suspiria, Deep red, it packs inventively twisted murders , this fuses an intricate chiller argument with horrible sensibility and relentless tension. Sinister and mysterious atmosphere , well made by cameraman David Armstrong and eerie musical score adequate for mystery and horror by Charlie Clousier, both of them usual of franchise. This sequel employs the same brutal puzzle logic as its predecessors toying the viewer in much the same manner that cruel murderer , well performed by the soft-voiced , pale Tobin Bell . He's a secondary actor working from the 80s in TV series(Walker Texas Rager, Stargate SG1, Alias, 24) and occasionally for cinema(Goodfellas, The firm, Ruby, Black mask 2), achieving success with Jigsaw character. The motion picture is professionally directed by David Hackl.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The curse continues...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a curse throughout horror movie franchises (or franchises in general) condemning the fifth episode to mediocrity at best, or unfocused, mundane nonsense at worst. The fifth episodes of the following franchises: Friday the 13th pt. 5 (the "Jason impostor" episode), Halloween 5 (that corny man in black gimmick), Star Trek 5 (the lame Shatner directed ep), Leprechaun (okay, that series sucked to begin with), Hellraiser 5 (Craig Scheffer as a debauched cop, while Pinhead is over on the sideline), Return of the Living Dead, Nightmare on Elm Street... the list goes on and on.Saw V is no exception to this rule. After a cool opening involving an FBI agent beating a jigsaw trap, we get scene after scene of Scott Patterson walking around with an angry look on his face, Costas Mandalor in an exceptionally stoic offering as Jigsaw's apparent heir, flashbacks that make no sense (the chronology of the Jigsaw/ Hoffman link is especially convoluted), drab photography that lacks the flair of the Wan/ Bousman directed offerings, and an ending that is telegraphed from pretty much the opening scene. Even the relevance of the "game" is not explained until Kevin Greutert's superb Saw VI. As it stands, the subplot comes completely out of left field. People looking for ingenious traps better stick to the other sequels as Saw V hasn't a single interesting gadget throughout its running time. And if you're a Saw fan the plot developments are not so germane that subsequent films would be confusing if you haven't seen this one.</fullReview>

But everything is not as it seems and things get more complicated when a new series of victims are selected, on the basis of them squandering gifts they were blessed with on their own gain. Two detectives start to close in on the twisted madman- but are they as clean cut as they seem?From the off set it's pretty clear to see the plot to no less than the fifth instalment of the grisly Saw franchise is just a little bit piecemeal to say the least. The gross, stomach churning torture/murder sequences are in abundance too, to the point where it helps just to laugh at how blood lettingly outrageous they become.It's always best to leave it at three, but this franchise has become so frequent you can count on a sixth one later this year. *</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Finally we got a Saw movie with several enjoyable elements: a good story, reasonable characters, a reasonable amount of violence without being too over the top( like Saw 3 and 4 were).Do you have to watch the earlier movies in order to understand Saw 5? YES!!! You really should, or you'll be totally lost throughout this movie.The movie starts with a very interesting trap and ends with another trap. It's also sad that Hoffman didn't get what he deserves.The main problem in Saw 5 was the huge amount of flashbacks. Yeah, be ready, because this movie is 45% flashback( the opening scene is a flashback). The "twist" isn't as good as the one seen in Saw 1 and 2. However, I was glad they focused more story, instead of torture( Saw 3 anyone?). Of course, there are even more questions to be answered, so you can expect a Saw 6 sooner or latter.My vote is a solid 7.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jigsaw puts the 'old' in 'up to his old tricks...'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So the tagline for Saw V is "You won't believe how it ends." Yeah, whatever. More like, "you won't believe THAT it ends." And you shouldn't believe it, either. The grisly series has been a dead horse for three movies by now, but if the rumors circulating the internet are true, there will be at least two more.In the movie's defense, there are times when the premise is interesting and creative, at least more than I had anticipated. Eyes will glaze over throughout the audience when the movie starts out with Jigsaw saying Hello so-and-so I want to play a game, but the story that the movie tells is a lot more ambitious than you might think. It's better than part 3 and 4, but that's not saying a lot.The vicious, brutal death-traps remain the centerpiece of the movie, but this one gets extra points because it goes behind the scenes into Jigsaw's world. The problem is that the movie tries to tell a bigger story than the material can sustain. There is a series of flashbacks that jumps back and forth between past and present (and more than one previous Saw sequel), making the movie convoluted and confusing. You may find yourself wondering why Jigsaw is masked and kidnapping people one moment, and lying in a hospital bed struggling for breath the next.There are three main stories going on in the movie. Five apparent strangers are forced to perform violent tests in order to get a door to open before it locks forever, and during each test, one person will be, ah, voted off the island. The whole scenario is remarkably similar to Cube, a far more interesting movie.The other story is a detective named Mark Hoffman who is involved with Jigsaw as sort of an unwilling accomplice, and then there is an Agent Strahm that is investigating the killings from outside Jigsaw's world, trying to figure out what's going on while the five strangers are killed off one by one.By this point in the series, hardcore Saw fans (which I am guessing make up about 90% of the remaining audience) will probably be mostly interested in the new torture devices, but the movie spends a huge amount of it's relative short running time jumping around in flashbacks and side stories, including one about Jigsaw's daughter, who has inherited a mysterious box, the contents of which Jigsaw explains are "of grave importance."Agent Strahm, early in the film, escapes a trap that was not meant to kill him but to test him, and he begins to suspect a copycat killer or that Jigsaw had an accomplice. Hoffman has a unique involvement in Jigsaw's killings, and is forced to try to cover his tracks while at the same time overseeing the deadly game involving the five supposed strangers, while they themselves try to get to know each other enough to figure out why they were put there together in the first place.As before, Jigsaw once again is taking on the laughable mission of trying to clean up where America's shoddy legal system screws up. The movie opens with a stomach-turning scene involving a guy who slipped through the cracks, serving only five years of a 25-year sentence because of a technicality. I appreciate the effort of the movie trying to make a comment of the shortcomings of the American legal system, but it's pretty hard to take it seriously when it tries to present the Jigsaw Killer as doing the Lord's good work. He's like a Boondock Saint with a violent imagination and a lot more time on his hands. The performances are passable, given the movie that they're in (which doesn't really ask much of an actor except screaming), although there are a few moments of remarkably awful acting. Tobin Bell once again lends his creepy voice to a nice synthesizer and then to that creepy doll, but the look of the movie is pretty thoroughly boring. It's totally lightless from beginning to end, a cheap horror technique that gets real old real quick.Not much effort is put into having a good twist at the end of the movie, although the closing scene does have the element of surprise and, like mostly all of the movies before it, is pretty painful to watch. This is not the worst Saw film that they have sprung on us so far, but there is definitely nothing in it to make me look forward to any more sequels.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not incredibly disappointing, but clearly running on empty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I genuinely want to like a Saw film. Really. I give each one a try, but progressively, they have deteriorated. Sure, the original film was not a brilliant piece of film-making, but it was one hell of an original idea when it originally came out, and gave a much needed shot of adrenaline to the heart of the horror genre. Five years later, the "torture porn" subcategory this one little film basically created has started to grow stale. And the yearly sequels are not faring much better.Picking up after the rather bizarre finale of Saw IV and a ridiculous graphic torture scene, Saw V begins with Detective Mark Hoffman (Costas Mandylor) emerging virtually unscathed from one of Jigsaw's (Tobin Bell) traps. No one knows that he was another of Jigsaw's apprentices, so he is claimed a hero and the Jigsaw case is wrapped up. Unfortunately, he is not the only one left alive. FBI Agent Strahm (Scott Patterson) has also survived, and believes that Jigsaw's work is being continued by a new apprentice.What follows, for anyone who knows the franchise well, is a series of flashbacks, turns, crosses and wrap-ups. If you have yet to watch a Saw film, this is probably not the best one to start with. But if you do, you will see some tried and tested problems that still have yet to work themselves out.Taking out any glaring continuity errors and changes made on the fly, the film suffers from the same fate as Saw IV in that it does not feel like a complete movie. It feels more like a mere piece of an even bigger film. While the first three films could stand on their own, these last two do not work without the others. They absolutely hinge on your having seen the previous films in order to understand what is going on here. Yes, there are flashbacks explaining scenes, but even those flashbacks do not explain everything. Even for fans, they bring on a lot of new questions, and only a portion of those are ever answered. There is little to no character development for Strahm, and the development we get for Hoffman is never fully realized. We find out why he leads the double life, the reasons for wanting to hide it (besides the obvious), but nothing more. We learn very little new details on Jigsaw, and the entire dynamic the last two films have been building to for Jigsaw's ex-wife Jill (Betsy Russell) are barely there. I assume we need to wait for Saw VI to have any of those details resolved.The film also suffers from having too many characters introduced into the plot, and too many characters the film goes back to go over again. It is never too confusing or muddled in convolution like in Saw IV, but you never really get the opportunity to grasp onto anyone either. Even the emotional connect we feel to Jigsaw is not there, because he is barely in the movie. Patterson never gets the chance to make Strahm much of anything other than the person bridging the gaps between the films (some needed, many completely unneeded), and Mandylor never manages to fulfill any of the ideas he developed back in Saw IV. He is convincing as the bad guy of the film, but not convincing enough to make up for the absence of Jigsaw. Even the new players to the franchise never get a chance to shine because they either get killed, or are barely on the screen long enough to make an impact.The traps are also a bit disappointing. The filmmakers just seem to have lost their creativity for testing and killing people. While they have not gotten to the point where they are basically rehashing their old ideas, they just seem to have lost the juices of originality that were once there. The devices used now seem stale, like they were offhand rejects from the earlier films. And in a bit of a shocker, they seem to have scaled back on all the excessive gore once thought to be the key to the franchise's success. Yeah, the graphic violence is still there, but never to the amped up heights of Saw III or Saw IV (albeit, some moments from those films are replayed).It may sound like I hate the movie, but I will admit that I was surprised I was not incredibly disappointed. Yes, I went in thinking it would be worse than Saw IV, but throwing in new director David Hackl seems to have done the film a little bit of good. The film is very break-neck paced to the point of almost losing the audience when it attempts to dwell on something (as few moments as those are). He has a keen eye for the gritty, and does not go as over-the-top with his shots and sequences are Darren Lynn Bousman used to. And with stronger writing and a longer runtime, I imagine he could have fleshed out Mandylor's character as much as he needs to be if the filmmakers want him to live in the same realm as Jigsaw. This film is not as good as the original three, but is a small step up from IV.I think what this movie proves, more than anything else, is that the franchise is on its last breaths. There is not much left for the filmmakers to explore, other than tying up a few more loose ends. Instead of making another entry into a stale genre, why do the writers not go back and create a whole different scheme for Saw VI, and bring back the originality the original film breathed into horror five years ago? Bring back some genuine horror, and some genuinely frightening moments. Maybe then the series can finally end, and we can get some new blood in the genre.5.5/10.(Portions of this review originally appeared on http://www.dvdfanatic.com).</fullReview>

Here he says that this is the goriest of them all. What's up with that? Haven't he seen the others? It's either that, or he hasn't seen his own film. Very disappointing.It started great.

		<fullReview>No spoilers till I say so...OK, let me preface this critique with the following:1) I LOVED the other 4 Saw movies...all of them, in their own way...they were great. 2) Understandably, each sequential movie lost some steam from the preceding one, but that was to be expected...that's how sequels always are... 3) Last but not least, with the cast containing mostly unheard of actors/actresses, my hopes in the acting department were not unusually high for this film.But I digress...Saw V was pretty much exactly what all of my friends that saw it before me have told me it was...and that is "VERY BAD." The fact is, that the movie has 2 basic plots going on at the same time:(Possible spoilers ahead)1) Agent Strahm is chasing down Agent Hoffman, trying to prove that Hoffman IS indeed Jigsaw. 2) 5 random victims are stuck in a dungeon-like labyrinth, trying to survive through a multitude of tests and games.Here's the problem though...Plot #1 is consists of almost 60% flashbacks, answering questions about the first 4 movies that most people with half of a brain have already figured out. Plot #2 consists of 5 characters that the audience neither knows anything about, nor cares. Without proper emotional attachment to a character, you simply don't care if they live or die.(end Spoilers)It's unfortunate that after waiting a whole year to see how the fifth installment panned out, the film ended up being such a letdown.The only positives of the movie are the 3 main characters...John Kramer, Detective Hoffman, and Agent Strahm, all played by brilliant actors......everything else about this movie sucked...even the traps...Will I see Saw 6? Yep...but only to see how bad it gets, at this point.</fullReview>

I am not usually one for horror or really gory movies but these films always seem to grab my attention and always seem to capture me in their cleverly twisted plot lines.Whoever wrote the script for this film must be sick in the head as the things they come up with just make you want to cringe.If you like Saw 1,2,3, and 4 then you'll also love Saw 5. It explains a lot of what and why certain things have happened in the current film and also in the previous 4 films. However, it still leaves you guessing in a lot of the plot/story-line. I think that's what makes Saw so exhilarating to watch and to experience and why it has had sooo much success for a sequel set of films. It draws you in and then leaves you hanging, which means you have to go and see the next one in order to get some answers.I would highly recommend anyone to go and see this film. It's Absolutely Amazing and that's why I've given it 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rather boring entry in the long-in-the-tooth series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SAW IV (2008) * Tobin Bell, Costas Mandylor, Scott Paterson, Betsy Russell, JulieBenz, Meagan Good, Mark Rolston, Carlo Rota, Greg Bryk, Laura Gordon, Joris Jarsky, Mike Butters, Al Sapienza. Yet another entry in the ever indefatigable "Jigsaw" franchise with its share of gore and splatter-ific Rube Goldberg contraptions to punish sinners, that takes place after the last chapter involving the two surviving police men (Mandylor &amp; Paterson) attempting to solve the mystery behind the late madman (Bell, reprising his iconic role?.again, in flashback, since? well his death!) Ultimately the repetition and murky cinematography prove to be the kiss of death: boring. While David Hackl, a production designer who concocted many of the mangling machinery for the franchise makes his directorial debut he doesn't exactly rise to the occasion; maybe next time (yeah, I'm sure there'll be a sixth installment!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Im going to keep this short but not so sweet. The first 3 saw movies were brilliant. The 4th was alright but this is the black sheep of the saw franchise. I have to admit along with the consistency of the previous sequels and its tag line saw v dragged me in instantly with wonder and excitement wanting to know what happens next...nothing the twists are predictable and the death scenes are poor compared to their predecessors. Actings okay but that cant carry what is essentially a tedious been-there plot that shows the sad truth of Hollywood...entertainment is second to making money. I feel more worse off than a jigsaw victim. YNWA</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Complete destruction of the franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay so I've loved Saw ever since I saw the first movie in theatres opening day. However, since Saw 2, there has been a slow decline in overall quality and themes of the movies. Not surprisingly, when the entire original writing cast was replaced in Saw 4, the franchise took a dive, and I thought the fifth installment couldn't get any worse than its predecessor. I was wrong. Among the lack of character development and badly written lines were ideas that weren't even close to their full potentials. I find myself waiting for the next movies only for unanswered questions from this and previous installments. How can I demonstrate how bad this movie was without spoiling it? Well it's a bit complicated so I'll go with what was good about this movie. Gore. That's really it. Aside from the traps introduced to us, and watching character after character meeting their demise, there were no highlights that make me think "great job, Saw crew." Not to mention that the writers just seemed to have been grasping for filler. There were so many parts that could have been neglected, and the only 'suspense' comes from flashbacks (yet the outcome is known, so nothing keeps you on the edge of your seat) And if you're expecting a great twist ending, you're in the wrong place. The 'twist' was more disappointing than The Happening. Oh did The Happening not have a twist? My point exactly.My friends, you're looking at not only a new, but not improved, era of Jigsaw, but a similar new, and not improved, crew behind this franchise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Awesome Piece For Jigsaw's Puzzle!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw V is awesome and just as good as the first four! As I've said, it's another awesome piece to add to Jigsaw's puzzle! I love all the flashback sequences with Hoffman and Jigsaw. Hoffman thinks he's the only one to survive Jigsaw's traps during the time of Saw III and IV, but Strahm makes it out of his trap. The next day, the police hold a memorial service for all the cops who died while trying to capture Jigsaw. Hoffman receives a letter that says "I know who you are." So, he tries to frame Strahm to look like Jigsaw's apprentice. Meanwhile, five people have to play a game and work together in order to survive. Some of the traps were pretty cool. Strahm revisits some of the old Jigsaw traps, like Paul's razor wire trap from the original Saw. Jill receives a box from John/Jigsaw, but we don't get to see what's in it, maybe we'll find out in Saw VI! I love the twist ending! In conclusion, I'm glad Saw V was made and adds more to the story! If you love the Saw series, you'll love SAW V!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Film, But not the best in the Series.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw V was a very good film, and lived up to my expectations. It is Definitely the quietest SAW film, which never really happened since the first film.David Hackl did an excellent job of Directing the film, although he is new directing, he is way is very different from Darren Lynn Bousman's, who helmed the previous installments. As I said it's much quieter, and dare I say, eerier. His way of Directing produces an Uncanny ability to Effortlessly tell the story and glide through scenes very easily (kudos to the editing for that one too).The traps of SAW V are very much different from the previous films, they are much more practical and have multiple methods of solving or dealing with them. The consequences for failing them are (as usual with the SAW films) deadly and very bloody.The Fatal Five trap is the one that contains most of these practical traps (The Neck Tie, The Sewer Bomb, The Bathtub, The Saw-hand trap). These traps are much easier compared to the traps from the SAW II house, but still effective. On a side note, the Fatal Five trap contains some very beautiful scenery (kudos again for David Hackl), although it is set in the sewers.The cons of SAW V: Although it has many, many things that will make a SAW fan proud, there are a few things that should have been better. The writers had a lot of room to include many things such as solutions to a lot of mysteries, a more action-packed storyline, they have opted for the simpler plot. There is also a lack of Jigsaw/John in it, except for a few flashbacks.Now for the main characters. Hoffman's part in this Film is to eliminate anybody from knowing his secret identity as the Jigsaw's apprentice, but Agent Strahm is very close on his heels. The chase in this one is very close to the chase in the first SAW, but much more complicated, but I'll let you decide for yourself.Now for the END. The tagline "YOU WONT Believe HOW IT ENDS" has been everywhere these days, but is it true? It's up for the person viewing to decide. For me, I did't believe how it ended. It was that good. It very much left me wanting MORE AND MORE.All in all; If you're a fan, you'll love this. But if you're not, you'll have a very hard time figuring it out.SAW V IS RATED 10/10 BY ME. A MUST WATCH.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The worst Saw movie so far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hoffman, now taking Jigsaw's place has set-up a trap involving 5 people. Meanwhile, Agent Strahm, after escaping a trap set for him, is determined to find out what Hoffman has been up to.....I liked the first 3 Saw movies. I thought that after the third one they should have ended the series then. I thought Saw IV was the worst so far. That is until I saw the new one. Simply put, this movie has no intelligence, no twists, and is a major let-down.I don't blame the cast, who give decent performances. I don't blame the director, David Hackl. He directs okay and stages the trap sequences pretty well. It's possibly the bloodiest of the series so far, but I have no problem with that.No, for me the major problem is the script. Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunston, who also wrote Saw IV have written a script that holds no surprises. What makes it worse, is that there isn't even a twist at the end, which makes a mockery of one of the tag-lines of this movie, which was 'You Won't Believe How It Ends.' Well yeah, you can see it coming a mile off.What also is frustrating is that there are several plot threads left hanging. The first 3 Saw movies at least had an ending of sorts. But Saw V (and Saw IV for that matter) have movies that simply stop without really resolving anything.......and this brings me to the worst thing, the already announced Saw VI. By announcing that there will be another one, before the latest one hit cinemas, you just know that you are going to be left frustrated.It's a shame that a series that began so brilliantly is descending into rubbish. If Saw VI turns out to be the last one, then I might go see it, if only to see how they finally end the series. If however, there is a Saw VII announced, then my involvement with the series may end here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The previous Saw films were not entirely devoid of story but this one is pushing it. There was no real twist because the ending was obvious at the beginning of the movie. For some of the slower audience members, this could have been difficult to pick out but it was really easy to pick out the entire plot of the movie. Most of the film is flashbacks to minor events and further explanations of things that have already happened. The story pushes forward very little and leaves you in the same place you were before seeing it. This film was entirely unnecessary to the series and other than to see a few good traps, this movie could be excluded from your Saw collection and not be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>nothing special</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was reasonably entertained for the majority of the film and thought a decent job was done on the traps. The major letdowns were the predictability of the plot which was compounded by finding out that there was no clever ending to make my jaw drop. There are already reviews up which share some of my views, so instead I'll just type out what thoughts immediately come into my head when I think of the good and bad points. SPOILERS AHEAD.Pros: - Some of the traps were pretty good and creative (particularly the ones for the group of 5 where the outcome could have been different if team work was applied). - Tobin Bell's performance as usual, more so when he's interacting with other characters in the same scene as opposed to simply voicing the puppet via a TV set. - Each movie in the series has tried a different narrative and this one is no different. There's some obvious effort been put into trying to connect intricate plot details to previous films, which you normally don't get in horror movie series. This does have its drawbacks though (see last point of the CONS).Cons: - Hearing "Hello Zepp" start to play at the end, then getting excited and expecting an amazing twist to be revealed but getting nothing. The fact that the person outside the trap ends up dying instead of the person inside is not what I would call much of a twist if that's what the film makers were hoping to achieve. - It's all well and good that the narrative style is different from earlier films but what's the point when one could figure out the whole story within the first 15 minutes (ie. the good guy getting set up to protect the bad guys secret). - The usual annoying Saw gimmick... throw in some absolutely random item/occurrence (but don't explain it within the movie) to provide something for the inevitable sequel to build a plot on (Jill's box). - There's about the same number of traps as previous films but it felt a little empty, maybe I'm desensitized from the previous entries. 1 or 2 more traps would have been good to add some wow factor since the story obviously didn't achieve that. Hey if they're going to flog a dead horse, then they may as well flog it good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Back in 2003, 25-year-old director James Wan debuted his 10-minute short film Saw, winning enough acclaim and attention to produce and direct a feature film based on the concept of self mutilation for survival.The 2004 Saw was, in my opinion, brilliant. The endless sequels tarnished its reputation somewhat, but this, the fifth (or perhaps this should be Vth) is the absolute lowest, lowest point of the franchise. Saw II was boring as hell and featured moronic characters that deserved to die. Saw III, which I believed was pushing its luck, wasn't any better. Saw IV only offered the flipside of the story from Saw III. All were burdened with epileptic seizure editing and fake-tography.Despite being stone cold dead, Jiggy's work is being carried on by mental cop Detective Hoffman who could actually bore people to death instead by being such a crap character. The guy has one facial expression. Five people are trapped in a yadda yadda yadda...blood, dismemberment, CGI gore effects, blah, blah, blah. If I were in that giant trap I would have gotten free without a scratch since there are several big flaws. But dumb characters are a staple of this series. Where would it be without them? Though this is the only film where they are intended to all live. Can you imagine if Jeff saved the witness, the judge, and the killer in Saw III and all four of them turned up to see Jiggy on his deathbed? It just wouldn't work.Usually when the writers of this series paint themselves into a corner they weasel out of it with flashbacks. Well, more than half of this movie is flashbacks, with the "present time" story being entirely disconnected from everything else. The latest victims are only there because it is expected, not because it is vital to the on-going story. But without it the movie would 60 minutes long. Take away the flashbacks and the movie would be nothing more than 10 minutes of FBI agents wandering down corridors with their guns drawn (count how many times this happens, I dare you).By this point,these movies had become a parody of themselves. Everything is all here, the icky atmosphere, the stock cop characters, the dull victims, the elaborate traps, but, curiously, no big twist. The tagline promises that we won't believe how it ends. The shocking ending, lingering on what is probably the worst way to die, is the only thing that saves this film from a 1/10 rating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My excitement for this film could only be compared to my excitement and expectations for The Dark Knight. The outcomes, however, are extremely different. The Dark Knight was not a letdown...Saw V was quite well acted, however the plot was nothing but an explanation or a recap that didn't answer any of the questions I know many people have on their minds regarding the series. It lacked that famous Saw twist that we were all hoping for. It seemed like they just took a bunch of filler and turned it into a film while waiting for the next twist to come along. The traps were repetitive and uninteresting, though they made plenty of blood to make up for the lack of cleverness. There is an explanation for this though. New writers and director. If you noticed none of the writers or the director from the first IV were involved in the making of this film so you couldn't expect this film to be at all like the first films. The movie wasn't all bad, however. Like I said, there was PLENTY of blood to spare. The acting was once again impressive and Tobin Bell's performance is unmistakable.All in all I was disappointed in the plot of the movie but quite entertained by the film as a whole. I really, really hope that this was the only stumble in the Saw series and that Saw VI brings more to the table.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Saw V' goes back to the formula that made the original so good, and succeeds</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since 2004, the Saw series had been going strong, making tons of money at the box office due to the low budget for each installment. However, as each sequel came along, the reviews steadily declined until we got to the fifth installment, which was the second lowest- reviewed behind the final film, Saw 3D (or Saw: The Final Chapter). Heading into Saw V, with a new director, and the tagline of 'You Won't Believe How It Ends,' the filmgoers obviously expected something amazing to happen at the end of the film. Armed with this knowledge, how does this film play off of the things revealed in Saw IV? And how will this film, like it's predecessor, deal with Jigsaw being a minor character? Let's find out.Saw V follows Agent Strahm as he looks for evidence as to if Mark Hoffman is the other accomplice in Jigsaw's giant game, and at the same time, Hoffman sets up a deadly game for five people all involved in a tragic incident.In my humble, non-subjective opinion, I think Saw V is a much better film than III or IV. Don't get me wrong, I still like those films, but Saw V takes more of a police-detective approach to the film and we also get more backstory on both how Hoffman fits into the previous films, and how Jigsaw and him came to be known. I like that kind of stuff. The only reason I've stuck with the Saw films as long as I have is because I like the storyline threads that go through the series. I don't like the gore so much (although some of the traps are pretty interesting).The acting is decent this time around. The principal characters (Hoffman, Strahm, Erickson, Jill Tuck and Jigsaw) all turn in fantastic performances as they have in previous films. However, the characters inside the actual game are hit and miss. Some of the best actors (and most interesting characters) are killed off pretty quick, and that's sad because those are the people I would have liked to see make it farther, or even all the way to the end.The gore is a hell of a lot lessened this time around. As I've mentioned before, I can handle the blood and a few shots of cut necks and stuff. But intensines spilling all over the place? That's not exactly my forte. The opening scene was a bit disgusting for that reason (but, again, I watched the Unrated), but everything else was actually pretty tame (except for the final trap. Don't ask for more details, just go see it or look it up yourself.) I didn't have to pause the movie because I was so grossed out (cough, cough, Saw III, cough).The effects to achieve the blood and stuff worked really well, and looked fairly realistic. I was kind of surprised. The script was written very nicely. I mean, some of the dialogue that took place in the actual game-trap of the film was a bit dodgy, but the other scenes worked well and the characters played off of each other fairly easily. When you have good enough acting that the characters work just that much better, it truly does help.The music, once again done by Charlie Clouser (his 5th consecutive year of doing these films, surprisingly), was better than IV was. It put some new spins on the original themes, and the version of 'Hello Zepp' used in the finale was very well put together. I truly enjoyed the music this time around.Overall, Saw V is a very well constructed film. While I had some issues with the main game of the film, everything else worked very well. The acting, cinematography, effects, less gore and music all worked in the film's favor. While some may have dissed the film because of it's more detective-Law and Order approach to the film, I enjoyed it for that very reason. Well done.'Grade: B+ | 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Upon viewing Saw V, marked the first time I seen a definite slip in the franchise. The cast that was thrown in a group as the core group to get through the traps were really undeveloped and had weak characters. Only Hoffman and Strahm had relevant roles in this film and they both lacked character than even the previous film. The death scenes, or known as traps to Saw fans, didn't quite seem as unique to past films either. It seems the writers had a good run because they are beginning to drop the ball with their films. I give the film kudos for staying true to the story and bringing back past cast members, which is important in my book, but in the end it was quite the letdown. Watch Saw V (5/10) immediately after the forth film to receive any sort of satisfaction for watching this sub-par horror flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mimicking the sadistic modus operandi of infamous killer John Kramer (AKA Jigsaw), F.B.I. agent Mark Hoffman (Costas Mandylor) exacts bloody revenge on the man who killed his sister. Kramer, none too pleased at copping the blame for Hoffman's handiwork, blackmails the agent into becoming his successor, forcing him to accept the legacy of Jigsaw. But how long can a government agent get away with being a serial killer, especially with fellow agent and Jigsaw survivor Peter Strahm (Scott Patterson) on the case.From its very first scene, in which a massive pendulum blade graphically bisects a hapless victim, it becomes very apparent that this fifth chapter in the Saw series is going to be highly preposterous. It's always been quite a stretch to swallow that Saw's ingenious killer Kramer (Tobin Bell) would be able to single-handedly design, build and execute the complex mechanical devices with which he confronts his victims, but now we're expected to believe that an F.B.I. agent also has the funds, spare time and incredible skill-set to engineer similar elaborate traps.For me, however, the insane level of gore in Saw V actually outweighs the farcical nature of the plot. As a card carrying gore-hound, I couldn't help put appreciate the twisted genius that has gone into realising the diabolical instruments of Jigsaw's justice. Victims are dispatched in the sickest ways imaginable, with none of the gruesome details spared?this is for the strong of stomach only, with the yuckiest moments including a nasty decapitation, the gory aftermath of a nail bomb, an arm being sliced length-ways by a rotary saw, and death via what appears to be the trash compactor from the Death Star.</fullReview>

In the meanwhile Hoffman has another group of people who are his toy and he put them to get through some traps and win their lives.I think that "Saw V" was a little bit boring as the fourth was and I believe that all have to be ended in the third movie. Although for one more time I liked the interpretation of Costas Mandylor and Scott Gordon-Patterson.Finally I have to say that "Saw V" is a movie that is more predictable than all the previous movies of Saw, and that was the main disadvantage of this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent, In My Eyes At Least</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So you're probably wondering why I might have given this alleged "worse Saw film ever" a 10 out of 10. Well, like the other Saw movies, I saw this one opening night and then many other times.First off, Scott Patterson takes the lead role as the movie's protagonist. Unlike the protagonists in prior Saw films, Patterson's character, Agent Peter Strahm, takes heed in declaring just who Jigsaw's alleged 3rd accomplice is. I think people underestimate how important Agent Strahm is to the series, giving it a bad review and moving right on. Overall, this 5th installment may have not been the grossest and may have been a little bit of a 'filler' to some folks, but I think it was very well directed and definitely explains the method behind the mayhem of Jigsaw's accomplice, Detective Hoffman, while making a really great suspense story with a brilliant cat-and-mouse sort of chase story out of the rivalry between Hoffman and the newly involved FBI agents.I think if you are truly interested in the plot (and plot-holes) within the series, this installment will most definitely please you. I think the gore was toned down a little bit, aside from a few scenes, so that might wipe away the anxieties of viewers who think that the series was merely a compilation of grotesque death(s) up until this point. Those who found the acting inferior in prior installments might at least be happy with Scott Patterson's acting, alongside Costas Mandylor. Their acting is excellent and their characters' rivalry is even better.Ontop of the new storyline, I think this one offers a gut-wrenching finale and has a lot of classic flashbacks that further explain the life of the series' original antagonist, John Kramer, and his wife, Jill Tuck -- as well as Amanda and several other hyped-up characters from the earlier installments. This one definitely falls more into the genre of a crime-drama and is more interesting plot-wise than some of it's predecessors. Don't overlook it if you missed out. All-in-all, it has some vital information leading into the next 2 installments.10 out of 10. Superb.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saw V is clearly made for the bucks here with this weak attempt at continuing the franchise.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you've just started out with The Saw franchise don't read any further, because of spoilers.I'll get this out in the open right now, I enjoyed this for what it was, but the heart and the energy was sorely lacking this time around. Jigsaw's story ended in number three, as should have the movies, but they find an apprentice to continue his legacy, which is a bad movie, because this series has grown tired. As it was fully revealed at the end of number 4, Detective Hoffman| Costas Mandylor| was helping Jigsaw with his Handiwork, but this was clearly an out of the blue movie, to keep the money piling in, because it should have stopped with Amanda. The traps are tired as well, and not original or inventive like they 1st 4 were, it all just seemed lazy to me, though there is one gritty one that will have you squirming in your seat, for even the strongest of stomachs. I did like how it ended though. It was a bitter-sweet ending for it all, even if the result I wasn't supposed to like, but ended up doing so. The people in the traps are very shoddily written, we aren't given a reason in the world to care for them, much like this movie.Performances. Tobin Bell does fine in his screen time, but it's getting old now. Costas Mandylor is great as Detective Hoffman, fittingly intense. Scott Patterson is annoying this time around as Agent Strahm lacking all the qualities that made him so great in number 4, but I fault the script for that. Betsy Russell is classy as Jill, but she does not have much to do this time. All the characters that were in the traps aren't worth mentioning, because I didn't give a damn about them.Bottom line. I guess I had an OK time with it, but it's really way too lazy for its own good. It knows it's success by now, it knows the formula, but this time it worked against it. It passes the time decently enough I suppose, so give it a whirl, but if I were you I'd rent a Saw movie that's great.5 /10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Without doubt,better than Saw 4.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me personally it was far,far better than the 4-th part,isn't only cause,others opinion are mostly the same,but worth taking a look for some reasons,cause this time it was better than the 4-th part was.(all the way).Dialogue:I just can not remember dialogs from the 4-th part ,but I can remember 5 sentences from this part,one of the most important sentence of the film,and of the film history is about what means to kill somebody,(from the killers side.) So this sentence is all the way a new good idea,against it was a crime,horror,thriller movie,with mystery,now you are interested more like in the 4-th part.The characters isn't only about how they will die,,what they did,there is a question why are they here ?Can they help for each other?(If they understand what is the situation) Less boring gore,rather suffering,and character study,and another movie focusing to the main character,and he's personality.6/10-better than the 4-th part,but not as good as the first,and the 3-th part.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never expected the Saw series to go this far but i'm glad that it is still going and is still worth watching. This Installment didn't feel like the usual Saw movie. Saw goes from a gross out series with twists and turns into a cat and mouse thriller.I always fear seeing the next installment every year. I fear that the next one will be terrible and will ruin the whole series. Luckily this has not happened yet. Saw V wasn't the best Saw but it ranks nicely in third place in the series. Coming up behind Saw II and IV. This is my order...IV-II-V-I-IIIUnlike the other sequels Saw V doesn't have blood and gore every 10 seconds. It is nicely set out apart. But when the blood and gore does come it is very graphic and makes the squeamish cringe in there seats. Saw I wasn't too big on the gore. Saw II took it to the next level and made the gorno fans cheer. Saw III took the fans need for blood and went way over the top. Saw IV went to the next level in blood but held out on the gore. Saw V showed us that the movie does not have to be blood and guts all the time to be good. None of the Saw movies ever scared me but this time i actually jumped for the first time in a Saw movie.The acting was like every other Saw movie, Average and i don't expect it to ever reach Oscar worthy in a Saw movie. Tobin Bell was good like always. Costas Mandylor and Scott Patterson did good jobs also. I always know the plot of every Saw movie. It's always the usual, people get put in traps and have to get out alive. But there is always the main plot in every movie. After the events in Saw IV, Detective Hoffman goes on a hunt to eliminate all loose ends. Special Agent Strahm suspects Hoffman and goes on a hunt to find out his secret. This doesn't seem like it can fill up a whole 90 minutes but like always we get answers to questions from other movies through flashbacks. As well as new questions to keep you excited till the next installment.The Saw series feels like a TV show. You just can't wait till the next episode to see what happens next. Saw V felt like a lead up to the big finale where all the Sh*t will hit the fan. I just hope Saw VI will wrap up the series in a major twist. If this doesn't happen then the entire series will feel like a waste of time. See Saw V if your a fan of the series. You know you want to. I'm counting down the days till Saw VI. But while i'm waiting i'll give you my rating....7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saw V (2008) **1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A much-needed improvement over the disappointing SAW IV, this one has Detective Mark Hoffman (Costas Mandylor) now firmly established as Jigsaw's apprentice and successor in crime. He is trailed closely in his gruesome activities by the intensely committed and undeterred Agent Strahm (Scott Patterson), and there are some neat twists and turns that help this entry sustain interest. Old flashbacks reveal more and more new information (and feature Tobin Bell again as Jigsaw), and tie up loose ends. It's a real challenge sometimes in trying to keep up with what events over this ongoing series happened where and when, as everything is out of sequence. This chapter is boosted by the dedicated and determined Agent Strahm and features some cool and grisly new death traps, along with a strong ending. **1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Getting back on track a little</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw was a modern horror masterpiece, as was Saw II. Each had something unique. Saw III followed that pattern a little but overall fell short. Saw IV was a little better but not much. Now Saw V in my opinion is bringing the series back up.Although each movie has less and less big name actors, that doesn't make them any less good. Saw V had some pretty decent performances in my mind. Tobin Bell once again delivers as Jigsaw, I didn't expect anything less than excellent from him. Costas Mandylor was good as Hoffman and actually delivered a good performance as a killer. Scott Patterson was great as the over-the-top FBI agent Strahm.The plot was thicker here than in 3 and 4 in my opinion although it did depend heavily on the previous installments.I was lucky enough to catch this on opening night and can tell you the fans loved it.Over all, fans of the Saw series will enjoy this.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>if you like the series, you will probably like this one. a lot of great traps, good characters, and a decent twist (but not the best). you definitely have to see the others before you see this one. each movie spoils the one before it. my biggest annoyance with the movie is the fact that at the end, "jigsaw" didn't say the classic end line: "GAME OVER" which kind of ruined the experience for me, but a great saw film nonetheless. traps: 10/10, main game: 10/10, victims: 9/10, twist: 7/10, overall: 9/10. i gave it a nine because 1.i didn't really like the first trap all that much. 2.some flashbacks made the movie really confusing. 3.i thought that traps in the main game used a lot of the same idea, which got kind of boring. however, this is still a good flick that you should check out if you like the series.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Detective Hoffman (Costas Mandylor) has became the final person to carry on the legacy of Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) to tie some loose ends that he gave Hoffman instructions before his death. Agent Straum (Scott Peterson) needs to put pieces of the clues to find out who is really behind the new Jigsaw murders as this time five folks are playing the usual sick game of life and death.The weakest of the series! this one goes all over the place with some flashback sequences and the plot is weak as well. However the acting is decent even by co-stars Julie Benz and Megan Good, there is the usual crowd-pleasing dosage of gore ridden traps such as the buzzsaw trap, the water box trap and more that will make viewers cringe. David Hackl who did production values on parts 2 to 4 did a nice directorial debut on this installment with flash and stylish directing, maybe "Saw 6" will improve on this installment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Detective Hoffman (Costas Mandylor) is been Jigsaw's (Tobin Bell) new apprentice. Dectective Hoffman took over Jigsaw's work after he got killed. FBI Agent Strahm (Scott Patterson) feels, there's something isn't right about Detective Hoffman surviving Jigsaw's unique (sadistic) traps. Since Jigsaw doesn't make mistakes. The FBI Agent tries to piece the missing clues together, since he knows that Hoffman is certainly corrupted. In the meanwhile, five strangers (Julie Benz, Greg Bryk, Meagan Good, Carlo Rota and Laura Gordon) are trapped somewhere in the city, while they faced new dangerous traps.Directed by first-time director David Hackl, who's been production designer on the previous "Saw" sequels. The fifth movie in the series is actually less gory and less stylized that the previous movies. Screenwriters Patrick Melton (The "Feast" Series) and Marcus Dunston (Saw 4) tries to have more character development, some suspense, a few memorable new death traps and more back story on the characters of Detective Hoffman &amp; Jigsaw/John Kramer. The filmmakers works hard to make it fresh and new but they somewhat succeed. Also there's some amusing moments of black comedy.The Director's Cut DVD has an good anamorphic Widescreen (1.78:1) transfer and an fine Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has two running commentary tracks by the filmmakers. Commentary one is by the director and the first assistant director Steve Webb. Commentary two is by the producers Oren Koules &amp; Mark Burg and Lions Gate's executives Peter Block and Jason Constatine. DVD also includes five featurettes, original theatrical trailers and previews of other features. "Saw 5" is actually more entertaining than "Saw 3" and "Saw 4" in my opinion. Die-Hard fans will enjoy this one best as usual. The filmmakers certainly have two more sequels in the future. I just hope "Saw 6" will be much fresher in story ideas. As sequels good, this one was pretty good. Especially for horror fans. (****/*****).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw V it's not a bad movie, but my expectation when I went to the theaters was so much bigger! Unnecessary appearance of characters from the first movie and few appearances of important characters from the other four movies. The history took a completely different way in a point that Hoffman almost made us forgot that Amanda had existed once on Saw movies. Why did they choose David Hackl to direct it? Why!? An unexperienced director! I really miss the style of Darren Lynn Bousman. The movie didn't lose the "Saw spirit", it's good, but not as great as I expected. It's hard to know what to think about "Saw VI" because everything that I had imagined for the fifth was lost in my thoughts. The director has changed again, and is another one without experience on directing. I hope the series stops on the sixth movie, before they destroy completely the legacy of Jigsaw.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a mess...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was a wreck. The visual style was off. The traps were dull and boring, and the script was so all over the place that I could never get a good grasp on the story. It didn't help that all the actors looked bored out of their skulls. Really, the script is the biggest problem with this film. Usually the Saw films have several plot lines that all connect in the end. This film does not. Well, it kind of does in that character A arrives at a location and interacts with character B and something is kind of explained or resolved, but the traps have nothing to do with the main plot. At least I couldn't connect them. It tries to pack so much into this one film, that the part where the people have to escape the trap is nearly impossible to watch. The traps are lame, the characters vanish from the story to quickly for their dilemma to have any real impact, and whatever happens to the people stuck in the traps has nothing to do with the main storyline. This is the first time I have ever really felt that a Saw movie was made on the quick and cheap. The look is bland and the script seems like a rough draft of a screenplay, not a shooting draft. This is as bare bones as the story could get. If I had to rate all the films in order I would say:Saw III Saw II Saw IV Saw Saw VThis really doesn't leave a good taste in my mouth for part six. Fingers crossed though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You have to be a fan and know the series to enjoy this one or you'll be baffled. It's a background story on how and why Hoffman became involved as Jigsaw's partner so he can carry on the franchise. I may be wrong but i don;t remember ever finding out what was in the box for the ex-wife or why it had any relevance to the rest of the film? You have to give the writers credit as its rare to be able to string a story out as long as they have. I remember seeing III and IV and being surprised at the additional twists and turns being squeezed out and flogged from the dead horse (almost as if the concept was being reverse engineered). The original Saw was a genre-maker for torture porn and incredibly smart: a killer "rehabilitating" victims through horrific traps and walking an immensely difficult moral line as he never killed them himself and ultimately led them to a more righteous outcome.The single most important scene in V is when John (Jigsaw) confronts and interrogates Hoffman after kidnapping him. It retro-activates a larger picture holding together the previous movies and really broadens and deepens Jigsaw's character by going deeper into his motives, reasonings and aims, as well as showing him setting up the traps/challenges. Hoffman's plain brutality is compared to John's elegant artwork and more erudite aspirations. A horror where the killer is a genius you can almost admire is truly terrifying. The intelligence edge has always been the key selling point of the Saw series for me.Saying that though, the anticipation factor is still there with the traps, and the last one involving volunteering their arms to be sawed through was horrific and made me shudder like the other traps really hadn't (even the needles in II). I did get the ending though contrary to the marketing - if there was going to be a VI, Hoffman had to win. More bone-snapping of course to just drive it home.Watch if you're a loyal fan. If you're not, watch films 1-4 first or you just won't get it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The scariest part of Saw 5.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>while very slightly better than saw 4 ( and to me they all went downhill after saw 1) the scariest part of this installment is that they leave it open to make saw 6... who knows where it will end.. saw 10? I guess the producers of saw 1 think that anyone who enjoyed it will enjoy any movie that come out with Saw in it will enjoy it, or at least go and see it. Which Im sure a lot will if not to see if they will ever do as good a job as saw 1. So we will keep going and keep getting disappointed. I am starting to feel like we are all playing a part in a jigsaw game and keep missing the lesson in it, that being that its just about how much money they can make off the hype of Saw 1. While this movie includes flash backs of the last (as does all of them) there really aren't anything that we cant see coming or big shocking surprises. There are a few things that really seem a little pointless that I suppose will be explained in the next one, Which I'm sure will be in the works if it isn't already, but if you've seen the last 5 then there's no need to get all that excited about the next 5 they make, nothing new... people getting killed in human bobby traps.... none of them live up to the first one. I guess the one good thing is that is wasn't as bad as the last one... so who knows.. maybe they will keep getting better... or maybe we have all fallen for another Saw trap?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A 'Saw' film without enough 'Saw.'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And so it begins again. The film series that started a chain reaction within the horror genre that set off a new trend of films, the likes of which range from awful ('Breathing Room') to great (Umm). Regardless of its impact, the series itself also spans a wide range of quality. After 'Saw IV,' I swore off the series. That installment was a bore to me and the conclusion was such a convoluted mess that it distracted me from finding ANY merit in the film whatsoever. But, I went back on my word and continued on with my yearly tradition of revisiting the series.The film starts with a bang (actually, more like a slice). The token opening kill in this fifth installments is one of the best death machines featured in the series: A more perverse take on Poe's 'Pit and the Pendulum.' The victim's choice: Let his hands be crushed or be sliced in half. Seems like a pretty easy decision to me, but what do I know? I've never been shackled in a dungeon with a giant steel blade swinging inches from my torso. As the scene moves on, Seth (Joris Jarsky) makes the easy choice and attempts to save himself. And this is where I got a bit confused. He sticks his hands into the device which would trigger a stop to the pendulum. His hands are crushed, and the vices rise. . . but the pendulum keeps swinging and eventually slices him in half. From what I saw, it appeared that his hands were mostly intact; so, I assume he either chickened out and wanted to keep his hands (or maybe thought he was too tall and thought the pendulum's effect might do him well). . . or the way to save himself wasn't truly a way to save himself. Either way, it was confusing as to what they were attempting to show us here.From there we move back a step and re-join up with Agent Strahm (Scott Patterson) from the last installment. We get a little bit of a recap (something 'Saw IV' probably should've utilized better), showing Strahm back in Jigsaw's surgical room where he finds, you guessed it, a tape from Jigsaw; and, he's sent to, you guessed it, his death trap (where he shows about as much emotional range as a coffee mug). But, unlucky for HIS pig-faced murderer, Agent Strahm is actually Agent MacGyver and doesn't need no stinkin' savior when he's got his own crazy little methods of saving himself. Take that suspiciously frightening Hoffman (Costas Mandylor)! After this first night of mayhem clears up, the sun rises and Jill (Betsy Russell), Jigsaw's ex-wife who was the catalyst for the entire series, returns to the spotlight as the inheritor of a videotape (of the baby bird-looking Jigsaw delivering a message) and a mysterious box (hopefully with Gwyneth's head in it). Here, we're met by another emotionless droid (Russell) whose surprise is nearly as convincing as Scott Patterson's previous attempt at fear.It's at this point the style changes. The film turns from being another simple Saw film and becomes more of a perverse 'race-against-time' crime drama (like a low-quality 'Se7en'). Strahm uncovers the secret of Hoffman's past which explains the confusing opening kill and seeks to take down this new Jigsaw. It's also at this point, however, when the film delivers some of the most poorly written 'outwardly spoken inner dialogue' (which is an embarrassing mistake for any experienced writer) I've seen since 'The Wicker Man' remake. It's a flaw that can sometimes be overlooked, but when it's coming from the ridiculously stiff Scott Patterson, it's hard to ignore the error.The main Saw story (or so I thought) focuses on a group of men &amp; women who have used their 'natural-born gifts' selfishly and at the cost of others. . . which is the weakest motive yet for murder. But, hey, maybe Hoffman was beat up by a gang of rich kids when he was young. Anyway, this gallery of torture in which the 'victims' travel through room-by-room plays out like Jigsaw's Chocolate Factory. In every room, a new theme. . . but, also a new death (but, this time, the river's made of blood, not chocolate). Ranging from a decapitation machine through, unsurprisingly, saws, the secret is to either work together or die together (unless you're willing to betray everyone else, then you can just go on through without worry. . . kinda like life). The characters, as expected, are all extremely unlikable and the surviving ones are fleshed out from the start, which limits any surprise the viewer might've had of the outcome. Not helping the annoying characters, the actors portraying them deliver some pretty poor performances.As the completely obvious 'secrets' unravel, you're left to wonder: What's with all the useless crap in the film? When it comes down to it, Jill's character was entirely useless here. Also, sadly, the five victims of the Jigsaw traps were all unimportant. Those entire story lines went to waste without any real connection to the rest of the film. It was like Twisted/Lionsgate had a cop thriller but wanted to make it profitable, so they tossed in the torture scenes to make it a Saw flick. It just didn't feel like a Saw film to me.To sum up, this is not the type of film that's going to please all film-goers, but die-hard Saw films will, at least, enjoy it. While it does fail in some technical aspects, like the acting and writing (which were NEVER strong points in this series), it does succeed on having some cool deaths coupled with fantastically grotesque gore, and that's really what this series is about at this point. And though it is an improvement on the last installment, it still comes up quite a way's short of the early films of the series in quality, watchability, and general 'Saw'-ness.Final Verdict: 6/10.</fullReview>

The acting is stale, the message is convoluted in a self preserving and arbitrary plot, and the twist, what has in this franchise been not only the silver lining, but more often than not the foundational ground on which the movie rests, is here insultingly obvious, amateur, and wholly meaningless.

		<shortDescription>"Saw V" Wrap-up, wrap-around game</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, while I'll admit that this is probably the weakest entry in the "Saw" franchise, that by no means makes it a bad entry, just a weak one, as in it didn't quite live up to the quality of films past. "Saw V" is directed by David Hackl, filling in for his two predecessors original "Saw" James Wan and Darren Lynn Bousman.Leigh Whannell, who played Adam in "Saw" (2004), also scripted the original film and two of the sequels; one of the reasons in the drop in quality may be due to his departure from the series. In "Saw V," of course this is the second film in which we know that the "Jigsaw" serial killer (Tobin Bell) is dead, having met his demise in "Saw III" (2006). It can be argued about whether or not Jigsaw is truly a serial killer because technically he has never killed anyone, and the tricks &amp; traps torture devices that he devises for his victims very often lead to their own demise. But of course, just because Jigsaw is dead, that doesn't mean his legacy won't live on.In "Saw IV" (2007), we also learned that Detective Mark Hoffman (Costas Mandylor) had taken over Jigsaw's crime spree. In this latest entry, Agent Strahm (Scott Patterson) is hot on Hoffman's trail, determined to uncover his true identity as the new Jigsaw and expose him. In the meantime, Hoffman has devised a tricks &amp; traps fun-house for five unlucky individuals who must learn to work together in order to survive. And thus, let the games begin.I could probably tell you right off the bat that "Saw V" is probably the goriest film yet in the series. These torture devises and the special effects used to carry them out are pretty tricky and neat. But this film seems to push the envelope in many, many scenes that even had me cringing a few times.What makes "Saw V" stand out as a worthy entry (and the "Saw" series stand out from other film series that where themselves out with each subsequent entry) and earn some degree of admiration is its story. The plot for this film recaps events from the past films, and even characters from those films appear in flashbacks. (This is a real neat treat for fans of the series.) As in past films, the story builds upon the story of the past film, adding multiple layers to a storyline that literally has the potential to go on forever.Just think about it: a hundred "Saws" packing 'em in for the next 20 years...7/10</fullReview>

I mean I was waiting for Dr. Gordon to appear of even Tapp, but the didn't show up. Danny Glover was offered to make a cameo but he turned it down so... we almost got him.The only couple problems with the movie was a couple acting faults, but the director was the guy who chose which takes to put into the film, so everything wasn't the actor's fault (except the first girl to die of the 5, she sucked (no offense) I didn't expect the ending that took place either, but because they chose that slogan (You won't believe how it ends) everyone was thinking something completely different, something bigger, but we didn't get it.Plot was good the two story lines were both great, especially near the ending. My heart was thumping out of my chests as Strahm was in the original Saw house.A few yawns occurred (when i say a few i only mean 3) I mean it was good. And so many people are throwing it down.I agree with the fact only Followers will ADORE it, but everyone else could get a kick out of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disappointing Game</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(There are no spoilers here, just comments on the storyline so don't worry)First of I am a huge Saw fan, from the first film to the fourth film. Each Saw film has a good story line with decent actors and can definitely deliver a scare. The main thing about Saw of course is the ending. Saw 1, 2, 3 and 4 all had fantastic endings that very few people guessed that made the viewer shocked and surprised. Each film got worse as they went along but not by any means bad, they were all clever, but Saw 1 had the best twist that you don't see coming and as each one progressed they got more gruesome and not as brilliantly clever as the first, but they were all entertaining and smart films... Until this one. I honestly was expecting a good film, because I know a lot of people who thought Saw 3 and Saw 4 weren't that great but they never let me down. Especially with Saw 5 having the tag line 'You won't believe how it ends' I was expecting a good film with a very good twist that I wouldn't believe. I am such a Saw fan, but when the Saw 5 credits started to roll at the end everybody in the cinema had the same look on their faces... Disappointment. We all looked around at each other wondering if that was really it. The main thing that makes the Saw series different is the ending, and Saw 5's ending was very very predictable as it was the entire storyline anyway. Now if we exclude the ending itself the actual film was not that great anyway. The storyline repeated itself and never progressed as far as the detectives are concerned, except for one discovery. The game that is played by the 5 people is the only good part, as the traps are still original but unfortunately what connects them is not predictable (as their are no clues given) but is not clever, what connects them is just boring. So the film itself is only entertaining when you are watching the game play out and the relationships between the 5 people, but even their twist is predictable if you pay attention to the first trap, and nothing much is explained either. The gore is up to par but there is not as much as the previous 4, but when there are gruesome scenes they are quite intense. So as far as the ending is concerned it is the actual storyline, do not expect a huge twist that you can't guess because the ending just justifies the story. There is no real shock factor, you don't leave the cinema thinking wow I never saw that coming. It almost seems like it was just made to fill space between Saw 4 and Saw 6, or even just for the money. So to conclude (sorry this is so long) if you are a huge Saw fan then I would suggest to watch it just for the sake of it but don't expect anything great, and to be honest if you don't watch it but want to watch the 6th one when it comes out I doubt you will miss anything. Just read a quick synopsis here or wiki or something, cause the film is a waste of time if you are expecting brilliance. If you want to watch it for fun or for some entertainment then go for it. If you really want a great film with the ending it promises, then pass. I wish it was better and I think it is a real shame for fans and for the franchise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>potential spoiler*** I've been a big fan of the Saw series and while I had a feeling it would be a little redundant, I still got the spooks. What made the series interesting was the fact that it wasn't just another slasher movie. There was a real point to the traps, each movie connected to the other and there was always an unexpected twist. Saw 1-3 were the bases of the plot and 4&amp;5 were all about history of the characters. What was different about Saw V is the traps. While some of the traps in the first four were about getting yourself out or working together to get each other out, this one was about assumptions. Like the trap at the beginning of IV, you knew the two guys had to work together (too bad it didn't work). We all figure it's about saving yourself and the group losing one each round. But soon we learn that all 5 were supposed to work together and survive the entire test. But in our world it's easy to assume it's about saving yourself and sacrificing others, when in fact it's just the opposite. And at the end of the movie we assume it would be safer outside of the glass box, but again....we assume wrong.It's true that two apprentice's traps were inferior...there was no way out. The pendulum one was particularly nasty. The victims didn't learn anything and couldn't redeem themselves. John was the true master of the traps and I really hope this was the last of the series. Finish it while it's good instead of making 23 useless sequels like Friday the 13th. One last thought....what the heck was in the box Jill got from John?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is what I do not understand: the Jigsaw guy catches the police officer who killed a killer of his sister using a Jigsaw elaborate method to hide this revenge crime. So the Jigsaw man and the cop get together after many Jigsaw crimes and surely way after one of his first kills, (which was already in Saw I) of a fat guy who attempters to slash his wrists, prompting Jigsaw to ask: did u really want to cut yourself or did u just want some attention? So how on earth the cop helps Jigsaw catch this fat guy in Saw V, if the fat guy kill was before the cop and Jigsaw got together? Right??? Unless the killing of the bad guy in the beginning of Saw V is also before the Saw I begins? But then immediately after this they promoted the cop to detective, showing also the photos of the two dead cops from Saw I. It all does not add up, or am I missing it?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I rate it above Saw II, but beneath all the others</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was never interested in the Saw series for the gore. I don't think it's particularly more so than the previous ones, but it just happens to be in methods we haven't seen before, and so it may seem gorier.The story is basely simple, yet starts stranding together intricate threads, sealing some plot holes from the previous films, and creating new ones destined to be filled by the next sequel.Special Agent Straum survived, and is out to discover why Hoffman is the only agent of the investigation on Jigsaw to escape alive and unharmed. Straum was meant to die, but survived in a gross way via a trap which was possibly explained off-camera, but on-camera was given no explanation save for an execution.I was angry at the opening trap, in which a man must crush his hands or else a pendulum blade will cut him in half. Aside from the sheer impossibility of surviving such a trap (crushing his hands would probably kill him from the shock, or he'd bleed to death before he could get help), the trap is not a "trap", but a murder device designed by Hoffman as revenge on the murderer of his sister. Despite the guy carrying through with crushing his hands, the pendulum doesn't stop and kills him. Later on, it's revealed this took place during Jigsaw's traps, and was a copycat made by Hoffman to kill this man and blame it on Jigsaw. This is how Jigsaw catches Hoffman, and basically forces him to carry on his work.The main trap of the movie is, I think, an infinitely more sophisticated version of the multi-person trap in Saw II. The brilliance of it is that Jigsaw's message gives a double-meaning ("five must become one" which could imply the five of them working together as one, or four of them dying), and then clearly states what he intends ("Your lifelong instincts will tell you to do one thing, but I implore you; do the opposite"). By which he means he wants them all to work together in every trap. At first glance, they all seem to be designed to kill one of them off with each one, and yet they are clearly designed with the ulterior motive of having ALL of them survive, if they think to work together.But of course, this being a Saw movie, they don't bother to listen.The penultimate trap disturbed me worse than any other trap in the movie, involving filling a beaker with blood to open a door. Since it was designed for five people, the two people remaining have to bleed more to open it. However it was designed, it was impossible for these two to do it. They have to stick their hands into a blade, which cuts their hands and wrists in half vertically. Absolutely no chance of surviving this---that old joke "down the road, not across the street" of wrist-cutting would apply here, as they would simply bleed to death. It makes for a fun visual if you enjoy gore, but it only sickened me and made me hate these two for actually trying to carry it out. They failed as soon as they started killing one another.For Agent Straum hunting Agent Hoffman, it plays out in a way that is not particularly brilliant, but still a bit entertaining. I'll spoil a bit in saying that Hoffman is framing Straum as the other Jigsaw killer apprentice, while Straum actively sets himself up by acting suspiciously after he's been dismissed from the case. The last trap is indeed a spectacular one, which in typical "Saw" fashion, could have been easily avoided if Straum just LISTENED to "Jigsaw" on the tape (It was Hoffman's voice on the tape rather than John Kramer). Instead, Straum ends up throwing Hoffman into the glass container, the one Hoffman told him to go into if he wanted to survive.As a whole, the movie is not the weakest of the series (I still consider Saw II to be that), but it's clearly one of the weakest. It had strokes of genius, and kept true to Saw tradition, in that no subplot, or seemingly random string of dialogue is ever a red herring or throwaway---everything is connected to the other Saw movies in some profound way. There's even a new mystery to make you wait for the next movie: what's in the box John left Jill in his will? Stupid rhymes.However, the main failing of this movie; the main reason why I consider it less than its predecessors, is that because the films are seemingly moving at a breakneck pace, they can't predict who will take center stage in the next film.Because of this, Agent Straum was only in Saw IV, and was little more than "Guy Trailing Jigsaw". The major string of Saw V hinges completely on us caring about Agent Straum as a major character; he is supposed to be for Saw V what Detective Matthews was for Saw II, Saw III, and Saw IV---someone given enough time for the audience to not only care about, but to sympathize with, identify with, and begin speculating wildly as to their role in the next film. Look back on old message boards and see how many people between Saw III and IV wonder if Detective Matthews would be the new Jigsaw.It may not seem like much, but it was sufficient character development to make Matthews a solid entry into the "Saw" franchise. Saw IV did not do this for Straum, and Saw V stumbles badly because of it. Saw V wants Agent Straum to be its Detective Matthews, but Straum is not.The big tag-line "You won't believe how it ends!" is indeed a huge letdown; why do we care what happens to some asshole who doesn't listen to Jigsaw? The ending is very believable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>More of the same. Saw fans and horror fans will probably find something to appreciate. Enjoyable in it's own way, but definitely not the best. The series is starting to go through the motions at this point and is beginning to show its age. Saw IV was where the franchise really began to get stale. Now with Saw V its accelerating. Each consecutive Saw movie's plot continues to become more and more convoluted with heavier use of flashbacks to explain what's happening. I was struggling to stay awake here and there. The Jigsaw killer will wreak havoc on screen in cinemas at least for a few more sequels until the movies are unprofitable to release in movie theaters. I'm still looking forward to Saw 6 anyhow even though I'm lowering my expectations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I LOVE the Saw series. Jigsaw's idea of rehabilitation is pure evil genius, and I have always delighted in the gory creativity in each installment. There was still plenty of that -- the traps and solutions were all sickeningly wonderful, but the rest of the film was pure crap.Fans of the HBO series Dexter will recognize Julie Benz, who plays Dexter's girlfriend Rita. In Saw V, she has brown hair and eyes and plays one of the captive game participants. She was one of very few people in this movie who did not overact.Now, I have knowledge of the four prior movies AND fancy myself to have above average intelligence, but this movie is CONFUSING. It is difficult to discern during which time frame each scene is supposed to be taking place. I am pretty sure that if I watched it again, I would still not know exactly what was happening when. There were too many flashbacks.To add to the confusion, the two main characters (Costas Mandylor as Officer Hoffman and Scott Patterson as Agent Strahm) look so much alike that it ruined the flow of the film for me.Long story short...it's worth a rental, but don't go running to the theater. You'll be more likely to forgive the shortcomings of the movie if you do not stand in line and pay $12 for crappy popcorn. ;)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"You won't believe how it ends." I honestly could believe how it ended, but this was still a great film. I was really excited when I heard about this sequel late last year and it did live up to my expectations. The traps in this film were pretty good, especially the very last one. You will be squirming in your seats when you see it. The trap before it was very genius as well. The story was written pretty well, and the directing was really good. It was better than, Bousman's first crack at the series in Saw II. THe one thing I did like was that Hackl, kept the score in the credits, like Wan. Instead of putting a heavy metal song near the end. I personally think that Kills the mood you get the shock of the final scene. Anyway, Saw V is a good film in the series, solid, but slightly flawed. What I mean by flawed is that there are still quite a few loose ends that were not tied up in this film. But I am willing to wait till next October for Saw VI. THe final chapter will be, I hope, the best since the original. Ps. PLease get James Wan for the last one!!! IT would be totally awesome, for the creator of this beast, to put the beast to rest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A boring and mercenary film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think that there has not been any film franchise which leads to its fifth part with the original level of quality,specially on the horror genre.Friday the 13th Part V : A New Beginning; Halloween 5 : The Return of Michael Myers; Nightmare on Elm Street 5 : The Dream Child...all that fifth parts were simple rip-offs of an established formula which were made with the only porpoise of making more money for the studio which produced them.Now,Saw V clearly belongs to that mercenary group of films which sacrifice quality and coherence for continuing the economical success.The first Saw,which was an excellent movie,established a very interesting villain who had understandable motives for what he did.Saw II was a decent sequel; I did not like the third part; and Saw IV was entertaining but nothing memorable.But,now in this fifth part the formula is simple routine,so it was very tiring.Saw V has a boring structure but the weakest point from it is that you have to remember every single detail from the other movies to completely understand what is happening.I honestly do not remember everything with a so detailed precision.That fail also appeared on Saw IV but,on this movie,it is worse.I think that for completely understanding the plot,you have to be a very big fan from the other movies.For one sight,I appreciate this movie is dedicated to that fans,compensating all their attention to the details.But,for the other sight,it is not fair to think that this film will only be viewed by the fans,so the people who decide to start in the Saw franchise with this film will not understand anything,so they will not enjoy it too much.As I said,although I saw the other films,I do not remember every single detail from them so,in my case,the final result was an extremely confusing movie.Also,this movie never provokes suspense on the spectator and we do not care too much for the destinies of the characters because they are not well developed by the screenplay.Let's remember Saw I,which had had a very thrilling,solid and logic story endorsed with ingenious twists and surprises.Now,we have all the contrary and the final result is a more bloody but much less entertaining and satisfactory film.Continuing with the tradition,Saw V is very gory (although Saw III and IV had shown a more sadistic and graphic violence)where we can appreciate a lot of impressing digital effects.But the problem is that all that blood does not produce any emotional impact on the spectator because of the poor script.In other words,this movie never reaches a dramatic connexion with the spectator.I do not recommend Saw V.I am starting to lose interest on this franchise.</fullReview>

They don't make this stuff up as each movie comes along, they are carefully planning it out as Jigsaw would have it. anyway, in short, this movie has a different pace than the others (also no real twist) but i think its only for hard-core fans that have really been keeping up with these films. i still found it to be a lot of fun and i can't wait for VI and hope that will be the last one, because i'd hate for this series to slip into mediocrity!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my review for the previous Saw movie, I said I have a feeling the series is regressing. And I'm afraid I may be right. I came into Saw 5 with mixed expectations. Part of me was saying "This could be the Saw movie that recollects the magic of the first!", another was saying "This one will be the black sheep of the Saw family" and then the other part said "This one won't be horrible, but it wont be great." Well, the neutral part of me was right.Well, does this offer anything new at all? Not really. What was once a fresh thriller has now become a by-the-numbers slasher flick unfortunately. And let me say I do love slasher films, but how many would be disappointed if another memorable thriller such as Silence of the Lambs was to go to the slasher route? You just don't do that. Almost everybody on this movie had "victim" written right on their foreheads, thus killing any suspense at all. The twist and turns that make the movies great were pretty bland, making Saw 4's twists look like the first movie's. The tagline for this movie is "You won't believe how it ends." Well, yes I'm quite speechless about the ending, but not in the "NO WAY" type of speechless of the first Saw.Still, it's not a horrible movie. There was quite a bit of stuff that made me go "Hmmmmm" which kept me intrigued enough to look past the predictableness. And what would a Saw movie be without the grueling traps? If the gore in this movie doesn't make you go "Ooooo" or "Ouch" or wince a bit, then I don't know what to say about you. Not the best Saw traps ever, but good enough.So hopefully Saw 6 will be the last movie. I love this series so much and will even add the lesser sequels to my collection, but I said after the second movie that there was only so much they could do, and they may be running out of that kinda stuff.</fullReview>

Tobin Bell's acting was very good, once again. I think its better than saw 4, but not better than the others. Personally, i liked the concept of their not being too much blood and gore in this film. Furthermore, it one of the very few films that actually scared me, once i had left the theatre.Overall, you will like it if your a saw fan, or somebody who likes suspense films.

		<fullReview>No doubt, I am one of the hugest fans of the SAW franchise to the point where I can't help but notice the smallest details every time I watch them. I have to admit that they have done a fairly good job in creating sequels around a film that wasn't necessarily designed for sequels The growing plot of Jigsaw, Amanda and Hoffman grabs me every time and as i try to understand leaks before the films come out, I can never understand until I watch the actual film.While this film kept me on the edge of my seat throughout, I've reached a point where it's becoming predictable. While we know Hoffman is the 'apprentice', it was difficult for me not to think that a main was going to die i.e. Strahm. Considering that there is already a 6th film in the workings, one can only imagine what would have happened in this film for the 6th to properly work because they are running out of plots to keep the film alive.I have an undying love for the franchise, and while I enjoyed this film, I am hoping that the 6th or possible 7th film is the last one because anything exceeding that will be stale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining Entry in Enduring Horror Series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a serial killer and pop culture icon in the eighties and nineties was hard work. Not only did Freddy, Jason, Michael, Chucky, Pinhead, an ageing Norman Bates and others have to find new and interesting ways to slaughter young innocents, they had to compete with each other too! But even if the late Jigsaw gets frustrated laying out his traps, and even if they don't go to plan, he can at least rest in peace knowing that his place as the definitive horror icon of the first decade of the twenty first century is relatively uncontested.Fifth entries in horror franchises are hardly a prestigious lot, and it's also very rare that you find a good film in which the main character happened to have died (with no chance of a resurrection) two films ago. So it's nice to find that the fifth entry in the Saw series isn't half bad. The narrative is somewhat muddled, but it's much more cohesive than the previous film's; and whilst the plot generally seems a little pointless, it is at least fairly engaging. The jarringly solemn pretentiousness of some previous entries is also thankfully absent. The main draw with these movies, whether people like to admit it or not, is the elaborate lethal traps set off during the course of the film, and the traps in this film are perhaps the most consistently innovative of the series. While this is a considerably less gory and sleazy film than Saw IV, there are enough gross out shocks to please those who delight in such things. Doesn't add a whole lot to the series, but at least shows that it still has the ability to entertain (if not actually frighten).</fullReview>

A new director and the traps weren't traps this time, they were more like puzzles...I'll admit that the opening scene and last 2 'traps' were executed greatly (pun intended) but the others were so so.The acting was spotty in places and there was way too many flashbacks...the story itself was interesting but the film just didn't possess the intensity of the first 4 films which was upsetting.I must say though that the last 20 mins or so was very enjoyable and bloody...its just a pity the rest of the film wasn't so graphic.I really think they should end it with VI.

		<shortDescription>Holes have been left permanentley...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**SPOILERS** Saw V as we all know wasn't exactly the best movie, at least by the Saw franchise's standards. Popular reasons for this are because there's too many plot holes, there was no twist at the end and the fact that Hoffman is a boring character and shouldn't have an entire film based around him. Well to begin with, I think Hoffman is in fact a good character, and better than Amanda as there's more depth to him, Amanda was a mere crazed b****, so better option to career on Jigsaw's legacy. As for the 'there was no twist' ending, I think that it's probably because there was no necessary twist to be placed. There may have been ideas placed but in the end producers just didn't see the point and would rather create more hype for Saw VI and in particular, its twist.The reason there are plot holes is because we need questions for Saw VI? What was Jill so affected by within the box? How did Hoffman get the Billy puppet and Jigsaw's voice for the Seth trap? (and my favorite) WHAT WAS DR. LAWRENCE GORDON'S FATE!!?? A lot of people are annoyed by the fact that these queries exist, but on a personal note I think it creates the perfect hype for Saw VI. If all our questions were answered, there'd be no reason to watch VI, unless you want to see a whole new movie. The alternative option would be to merely end the series at 5. I look forward to Saw VI a lot for these reasons, in particular whether or not the Lawrence Gordon conspiracies reach a halt. There as so many theories as to how he's still alive, and to be honest I think it would be a brilliant twist for the next installment. What better way to finish off the saga, then by bringing back a character from the first movie, and shotting him into the 6th. None the less, and back to my point the reason why there are so many plot holes is to create question marks for Saw VI, and this is indeed a good thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saw V has breathed new life into a series that almost died on the operating table.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Saw series nearly lost all my respect after the dreadful Saw IV. Saw IV was an abominable pile of trash that could never in a million years serve as actual entertainment. However a year has passed, and I have undoubtedly cooled off. I decided to give the series another chance, so I payed ($7.50 of my hard-earned money) to go see Saw V in a theater. I walked out an hour and a half later, and guess what...no headache, no shaking of the head in fury, and certainly no shouting of "Oh my god, how could it get any worse!?" (Like I did after witnessing Saw IV). In fact I really enjoyed the newest installment in the Saw series. Saw V has breathed new life into a series that almost died on the operating table.Saw V picks up exactly where Saw IV left off. Agent Strahm (Scott Patterson) is locked inside a room containing Jigsaw and Amanda Young's dead bodies, and proceeds to shoot and kill Saw III's anti-hero Jeff. Strahm finds his way out, but is attacked and placed into a trap that he miraculously survives. On the way out we see that Jigsaw's newly revealed apprentice Hoffman has "rescued" Jeff's daughter. Not long after this, Hoffman is ironically considered a hero. However Strahm begins to suspect that Hoffman is the new Jigssw, and that the games are not over yet. As Strahm attempts to dig up evidence against Hoffman, a new game involving five people is taking place. These five people are told that they are connected in an important way, and that they'll have to work together if they want to survive their upcoming tests. All of this leads down to a grand finale ending that I thought was even better than the original Saw's classic ending. And if you're familiar with the Saw movies, you bet that's a good thing.Saw was a great horror film that was original in its own twisted, psychological ways. Saw II however was a bit of a wash-up until its shocker ending. Saw III was a good horror film for taking risks, and although it's the goriest in the series so far, it was gory in a very creative way. And Saw IV...well you already know how I feel about that one. I can't believe the series has made it to a whopping fourth sequel. It's like a new age Friday the 13th or Nightmare on Elm Street. Although Saw is different since every movie follows the other and keeps to a strictly connected path.There were always things that bothered me about the Saw series, some more than others. The acting was sometimes subpar, and not all the characters were well developed. But it technically is a horror series, and at this point in time who really expects either of those two in a horror flick. The thing I always hated about the Saw movies was the editing and cinematography. Is it too much to ask that the camera stay steady for a second? This always made it hard to appreciate the gory traps, because bright lights are flashed in your eyes, there are too many lightning speed zoom-ins and zoom-outs, and the camera pans and spins around the victim faster than Lind Blair's head! However Saw V has an all new director named David Hackl, who worked with the Saw films since the second movie. Saw V really cuts down a lot on this insanely annoying editing style. I was very happy walking out of Saw V because I realized I wouldn't need to pop an Excedrin.Saw V has a pretty good story for a horror sequel, and the flashbacks used to explain the past are nothing short of excellent. The flashbacks are also the only scenes in which you get to see John Kramer/Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) alive. And Tobin's acting is as good as ever. They also explain why Hoffman became Jigsaw's apprentice, while at the same time they help make the past films seem a little more, dare I say, realistic. The plot about the five strangers having to work together to survive their game is the only weak point to the film, but just because it was a little bit weak does not mean it wasn't entertaining. Plus it's a Saw movie...that means at least a few people have to get mangled in torrents of gore and blood. They couldn't just make a whole movie about flashbacks and Strahm piecing together clues. If they did they might as well rate it PG-13 and sell the series to Fox!Some are disappointed with David Hackl's direction with Saw V, saying it didn't feel like a Saw movie, or that it was the worst in the series. While it did feel a little different from the previous films, I felt that Hackl did the best direction job since James Wan of the original Saw (Darren Lynn Bousman directed Saw II-IV). Hackl relieved Saw V of the cracked out editing style of its predecessors. He created a mature sequel that was simply more about the plot and revelations, than it was about gore and carnage. I'm disappointed David Hackl won't be coming back for Saw VI (the supposed series finale).All in all Saw V was the best film in the series since the classic original. And it's certainly a huge improvement over the atrocious Saw IV. Hoffman is going to be an interesting new villain, and Saw V's ending sets up for an "All Bets Are Off" attitude. I have no idea where the series is going to go next, or even if it's going to end with the next film. All I know is I can't wait to see Saw VI! I give Saw V a 4 out of 5. It resurrected the whole series in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie requires a doctorate in memorization of SAW 1,2,3.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the 4th installment of this movie. I thought I would be fine, watching the last scene of saw3... to prepare for sawV.... WRONG! The final scene of Saw3.. (look I don't nor do I want to remember character names...its that bad.)... the old dead guy on the hospital bed....guess who that is... he says blah blah blah... play the tape... yippie..another microcassette of doom.... the other guy gets freaked out.. and then there a "im gonna do nasty things to your little girl".. and you see her..via a pseudo tiny keyhole viewer. Fade to black... OK. its a hook...I get it... poor little girls gonna be blown up, gased, or something..playing the game. Heres my $9.00 bring on the GORE!!!So... I was expecting.. in SAWV.. that this guy was going to bust into another room right next to the old guy on the hospital bed... because thats what are where he was looking...in Saw3. and try and save the girl.... WRONG... now you can totally forget about fiddling with your popcorn or enjoying the blood and guts.. because if you get distracted.. you are lost... Here comes the flashback scenes...all over the place at random times... which is not a true flashback scene.. its a scene that they didn't tell you about in either SAW 1, SAW 2, or SAW 3, that didn't happen.. but does in the present.... yea I will give you 10 minutes to think about that.. and make a better sentence that explains this bizarre movie style. I call it.. filler. like those bad meats they put in hotdogs. so if you come in to watch this movie... for its face value.. a horror movie... and you didn't do your homework: study saw 1,2,3.....you are so confused as to what the heck is going on.. not to mention the two main characters look ridiculously alike.. Its like a constant battle of which came first...the chicken or the egg? Jigsaw.. or the other guy?Wait.. now they are together....WHAT!?! My brain exploded...Later on...fbi dude mumbles.. we found 12 bodies... Why do I care about these 4 people only? who might get their heads chopped off? Why did jigsaw.. or wait..the fed.. make this masterpiece of mini model of the game.. and the detective fixes one of the fallen over pieces... what? why do I care? FLUFFFFFFFFFF! Two people WALKED OUT OF THE THEATER.. out of 15 suckers that stayed, myself included. But Im the type who rubbernecks in traffic hoping to see a dead body for the excuse why I am late for the office! Save your money.Oh and for you gore fans.. does shaky camera work, and barely any solid locked in views at the blood and guts as its happening...make a horror movie? Its like a Japanese game show you are watching...with murder.. and confusing as all.. just like when you don't know their language. So if you have a doctorate in memorization of 3 previous movies.. you might do well. But the only person I see being that way ... would be the director. I want my $9.00 back!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a review of the unrated directors cut. Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) is dead but detective Mark Hoffman (Costas Mandylor) is carrying on his work. We get flashbacks explaining how and why he was with Jigsaw. However someone knows what he's doing...and Hoffman has to find out who and stop them. Meanwhile five more people are put through "lessons" with Hoffman using Jigsaw's methods.The first four were gruesome and depressing but managed to preserve continuity with each other and didn't treat the audience like a bunch of idiots. This one is still gruesome and has the same atmosphere but continuity gets increasingly hard to follow in this. There are multiple flashbacks (you have to see the first 4 to get this one) and flashbacks WITHIN flashbacks! It gets muddled and difficult and halfway through I was totally lost. It got its bearing by the end and I (sort of) understood it but it was a frustrating movie to get through. That aside this is well-done and has the gritty, grim tone of all the others. The acting is good and the murders are VERY gory (the first and last ones had me cringing). So, as a horror movie it DOES work. This DID get the worst reviews of the series (so far) and it's easy to see why. Fans might like it but it's very confusing at times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first Saw movie was a good psychological thriller.But if Saw 2 hadn't made any money, do you really think they would have made Saw 6? They are making up the 'story' as they go along.The films are like the elaboration of a bad lie.The film makers just want you to hand over your money. They don't care about artistic merit. The movies are so repetitive they are laughable, if they weren't so sadistic.If the Saw movies didn't have any torture scenes, would anyone still watch them? They aren't about the plot or storyline. They are about pandering to humanity's worst instincts. Should we really entertain these instincts? Please don't hand over your money to watch any more Saw films.Don't encourage them.</fullReview>

How wrong was i the film was great fast paced and intelligent with its storyline. I think that as the film went on and the tension built up and the ending was great. I think if you have not seen a saw film before it will just seem like a pointless killing fest but if you are a true saw fan then its a great addition to the collection. I just hope they don't flog the idea to death (excuse the pun!!. I think i can see where they will take Saw 6 if they make it but would not be upset if they ended it now.

		<shortDescription>Saw 5; Anything New?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The answer to that question is "sorta." Obviously the details have changed but the same basic format has been used. This is the reason why I gave this movie 8 out of 10. This is extremely similar to the format of Saw 2 with the house. This time its 5 individuals in a warehouse course. The ending is yet again a cliffhanger but the ending suits a future Saw 6 possible. In fact, its almost perfect. The storyline is very good. It explains the past 4 movies while giving new details and summing up the whole story. It can be safe to say that you must see all past 4 movies before seeing part 5. If you don't, confusion will take place. The gore and sounds of displeasure are here again. And in my honest opinion, the most gore and horror out of all the movies.In conclusion, I highly recommend this movie. I just wanted to give a brief observation of the movie and this does just that. If you like slow torture, heads getting cut off, bombs exploding bodies into dog chow, bodies being used to secure an electrical current, saws cutting arms to supply enough blood to escape a trap, bodies being crushed to death, bones popping, and LOADS of suspense and thrill, then this movie is for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing special; however still gets the job done</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start out by saying i have seen every saw so far. At this point i feel like I cant stop now as i've come this far. The majority of horror movies these days are awful as they are very unoriginal and predictable and more importantly not scary..Saw however, has an interesting premise and you can't say that it is unoriginal. But then again it is not exactly scary, but extremely gory. It tries to be a horror movie but succeeds in being a low-rate thriller.This one is no different then the other Saw's and it succeeds in packing in the gratuitous gore. Like other Saw's the acting in this is horrendous. The story is now getting old. Saw tries to leave a few questions unanswered to leave the audience wanting more and for that reason plays somewhat like a serial TV show rather than the traditional horror movie sequel franchises (halloween, Friday the 13th, etc.) In this one however it adds the most pointless story elements that the audience just doesn't care about. The thing that really got me is it seeing how clueless the filmmakers. They realize that people have grown to expect Saw every halloween so they rush to get a new one out with little or no regard to what they can do for the next one. This is obviously the case with saw 5. It seems they just built some more BS into the series using flashbacks to show how "it was there all along". It is clear that the filmmakers originally had no intention of these aspects of the story. As this one really doesn't deliver a complete story, it does not even tell us if the main characters end up dieing or not (which is the case in most of the other saw's) That being said there are some clever "traps" in this one but its nothing that is too different then the other Saw's. It is a decent movie to see around this time of year and undoubtedly fans of th series will love this.. But otherwise it is just not a good movie</fullReview>

But in SAW V, nothing in the movie made me say that..I was a bit disappointed because the trailer said "You Won't Believe How It Ends.." And yeah..I kind of figured something like that would happen. No twists?? What the heck! That's what SAW is all about! Twists! Nothing made me shocked or surprised. Throughout the whole movie I thought I had figured out what the exciting twist at the end would be: I thought the Realtor lady was going to turn out to be Amanda's sister or something. THAT would have been a WAY better ending than the ending that did occur.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Honest review with some spoiler. Saw V is on par!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the movie had ended, I sat in my seat and had to think a couple mins. about what just happened. At first i was disappointed but after thinking about the movie and how it relates to the others, the movie turned out to be very good and on par with the rest of the Saw Movies. The series of the 4 traps was very good, the traps were well thought up. The only thing that was bad about this was the acting was not that of a brad pitt. As some other reviews say, jigsaw was not it the movie a huge amount of time. But this is, imo, good because the story needs to focus more on Hoffman and other characters. Overall the twists were pretty good, obvious not as good as saw or saw ii but still they make you think and keep you surprised. I definitely did not see the death of a agent coming and i like the way they delivered it. This is a good leading up to Saw VI. Which should be the last in the series so it can still go out on top. Maybe if they wait 2 years to release it, the crowds will be ready again to play games. Game over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since it's wide theatrical release only 24-ish hours ago, Saw 5 has been taking heavy criticism. Although it's not much, I do think it was OK. For me, the problem wasn't the stupid ending as much as the lack of explanation. I read countless interviews with various Saw 5 affiliates who said the following: -Billy the puppet will be further explained -The tricycle will be further explained. -The piece of skin cut from victims will be further explained -Cecil, from Saw 4 will make a re-appearance Where was all this stuff??? And I read the confirmed character listing for Saw 5 and there were many returning people (Eric Matthews, Rigg, Amanda, Art, Perez, Tapp, Obi, Jeff, Lynn, etc.), some who could've lived, and some who clearly would just be in flashbacks. But they were all just in pictures of dead cops, and in 2-second flashbacks of Saw 3 and 4 which weren't even necessary. There's about 3 main characters in this movie, and Hoffman and Straham were the only ones of any importance at all. Very dull and poorly thought out. The fact that it's a Saw movie is enough to make it at least borderline enjoyable, but this really does fail in comparison with all of the first 4 movies. The one good thing is that there's no mind-tricks being played here. It's simple and easy to understand the entire way through. No extra thinking required. But is that truly a good thing? Honestly, the elaborate complications and mind-games are what made the others (specifically 4) as genius as they were. Like I said, not horrible, but quite disappointing for all the hype and suspense which carried over from III and IV...Don't set very high expectations for this movie, but if you're a true Saw fan then a theatrical view of this movie is considerable...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very disappointing.. may contain spoilers.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I thought that this was the last saw so walking out of the theater I was very disappointed.In Saw 1 when they showed the trap with the man going through the razor wire, detective Kerry (I think it was) said that this couldn't be a jigsaw trap because even if the man got out of the wire, the door was locked so he couldn't get out. At this point, we would think this was an Amanda trap, but it showed Hoffman and Jigsaw getting the guy. I know it's something small, but I just don't understand how they didn't catch that.Also, if Jigsaw wasn't behind the pendulum trap, and it was all Hoffman, and this was before he became Jigsaw's accomplice.. how did he get the clown, and how did he use Jigsaws voice? This movie also didn't focus enough on the game being played throughout Saw 5. We don't know why they were in the room together, or anything they have to do with.One more thing is in the end, I don't understand what detective (strohm?) was doing in that room, and how Hoffman knew he was there, and the glass case was about, and how Hoffman knew he was going in it and etc etc.. the end was a little confusing for me.Hopefully Saw 6 will answer what was in the box Jigsaw gave his ex wife, and hopefully Saw 6 will be the last.. And HOPEFULLY Dr. Gordon will be coming back, and it'll show what happened with his family.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sorry. But I must give this a 1 out of 10 star no matter what reason you throw at me. I can easily shut you up in a debate of how bad this movie is. The movie, SAW V, to sum it up, is simply forced and brainless. Look I knew it'd be bad, I did not bring in high hopes, BUT I NEVER THOUGHT IT WOULD BE THIS BAD!!! Just when I thought the 4th one couldn't get any worst with the randomly forced addition of Hoffman, this one is absolutely HORRENDOUS. Like seriously this movie, SAW V is so bloody CRAP. All I can do is shake my head at the people who keep on saying "this is good because it explains this and explains that from the previous series"... And what can you say? Those people simply have no depth and have no appreciation of a good movie. The script could have easily been writing by anyone in anyway to fill in the gaps. Explaining how the drunken fat man got into the barb wire trap part was just purely retarded, it was totally unnecessary and could have come up with something 10 times better other than "with the help of Hoffman, a strong muscular bulky cop". I don't know where people who say this movie is still intelligent comes from, but this movie is far from it. Don't give me the garbage talking about "OH MY GOD SHOCKING" ending, DO NOT deny the fact that this movie was totally predictable. I also laughed out very hard at the actions taken by Agent Strahm throughout the whole investigation and especially towards the end, there were so many ways he could have escaped the situation, it was just pure stupidity, it just kept on bringing up the question to the audience "why would he do that?", "why would he do this?", and when a movie brings up such questions, it's usually a bad sign. So now lets move onto the 5 losers who were set up by Hoffman. They were pretty much invisible, they were just simply part of a scattered movie with little importance just for the sake of making it more like a SAW movie. And LOL THE TRAPS!!! A final staged cancer old engineer and a stupid detective maybe add another girl to set up all those? Too funny. Too funny. Oh and give me a break, the pendulum trap at the beginning, Hoffman set it up all by himself no? Pfft I don't know what to say anymore. Saw V = Horrendous, easily the worst movie I've seen in 2008.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Saw V" opens where "Saw IV" ended.We learn Jigsaw Killer John Kramer found someone to carry on his work and most of the main story line tells us how the two met and how they got started on all those terrifying games that end in bloodbath.Five people who have abused the advantages they have been given,all of them connected in ways they do not yet know,are put through a series of terrifying tests.With each one,a single victim will be claimed until there is to be only one person left standing.So if you are searching for fresh and original elements in "Saw V" look elsewhere.So-called twist ending is such a disappointing non-event that it can hardly be called a twist at all.There is plenty of gore,but the traps are uninspired and lame."Saw V" is not suspenseful and there is nothing even remotely disturbing in David Hackl's debut.Avoid it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*This review is written under the assumption that the reader has seen the previous Saw films.I saw this on Friday with my friend and my sister and finally built up the courage to accept the movie was horrible and write this review. Needless to say I jumped into the movie expecting another awesome Saw, however I was left displeased. I felt that the film was jumbled, corny, bad acted, and simply not Saw. All the new characters were dull and uninteresting including everyone in the secondary game (known to the ones who haven't seen the film as the neck tie trap) which was also useless and rather stupid. It also seems that everyone in this entry forgot how to act. (Except, of course, Jigsaw.) I'm mainly talking about Strahm when I say this, you all will definitely agree when you see the film.In every Saw, the main character is supposed to learn from their mistakes and in order to do this they have to follow the rules. Of course, there's always an obstacle in their way. It's the same in Saw V with Strahum but this time there's absolutely nothing preventing Strahum from winning his game and you'll notice this within the fist maybe ten minutes of the film! On top of all this, we have NO Jigsaw. He's in maybe two scenes if I remember correctly. The chase between Strahum and Hoffman is boring and takes away from the rest of the story. We all know Hoffman is the new Jigsaw and watching Strahum run around trying to figure out who the new Jigsaw is is kind of funny.The only truly awesome thing about this movie is the traps. I was sort of glad that Hackel decided to deliver even more buckets of gore then the previous Saws and increase the intensity and drama of the traps. Other then that, the film lacked in nearly every other aspect.So, there I was, watching my favorite movie series fall apart on a movie screen with one last thing to hope for. One of those juicy, coveted Saw twists. See, I didn't run in to the movie craving one, but after watching the movie I needed one. I heard the famous Saw music come on to the screen and I clenched my arm chair, a big smile on my face, waiting for that last moment to blow my mind then.. nothing. The movie hardly...even...ended! I looked over at my friends and before the credits could roll said, "Lets go." 3.0/10.0 :(</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I finally got the opportunity to see Saw V tonight and I am happy to say that I was not disappointed by the movie, but more the fans. As I left the theater I noticed and heard a lot of people griping that this was quite possibly the worst ending to a Saw movie. Hello this was not the end no matter what the tag line says. I watched this movie with my girlfriend and unlike most Saw's it did not include as much gore. Something that a Saw fan may not be all that happy with. Overall though the movie made you fiend for Saw VI, doing its usual by making you ask questions and leaving the watcher a little confused as to what exactly happened.Now on to the fans, tsk tsk tsk. How dare you sit and say that this Saw wasn't as awesome as the last 4. This was a much needed Saw because it answered questions, developed characters and over all added to the suspense of the story. If you wanted to see the gore and blood, make your own franchise but besides my own opinion; this story is about development not just the traps that go along with the film. You wouldn't want to go to Burger King for just a Whopper, for a full meal you want the fries and the drink. The same with a good franchise movie you go hoping to see more action, murder and definitely something that you have not seen before but all of that means nothing without a good story line. I pity the Saw fan who went for the traps and did not like the ending but remember this: SAW VI THE FINAL CHAPTER Oct 2009.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You won't believe how it ends.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Forensics expert Hoffman goes on the hunt in order to protect the secret that he is the newest person to carry on Jigsaw's legacy.How should I start this? Although I'm a Saw fan, I was severely disappointed by this movie. Yeah, it's not the worst. That would go to part II, although, ironically, that's the best in the series that can be watched over and over again. This movie was just...pointless, you know? Here's what you can expect: New torture devices and new characters. Of course, that's what all the Saw movies are but to devoted Saw fans, like myself, these movies are made to continue a continuous but convoluted storyline, which is, more or less, the main reason to continue to see these films. After all, part VI will be the last, right? Let's hope so.If you have seen every Saw film so far, you can expect Saw's I-III is a trilogy AND expect Saw's III-V to be another part of a trilogy. That's really, I must say, ingenious, because I like to think the series that way but here's the problem that emerges: This movie is very pointless. If Saw's III-V is a trilogy, which they really are, this movie adds little to nothing on the storyline. Well, that's just my opinion. Many may say the best part of the film are the flashbacks. Well, these flashbacks also do not add a thing to the whole storyline. We can, more or less, assume that happened because we're smart that way. This is why I'm so disappointed about this film. In the whole franchise, this movie contributed the least to the storyline is basically what I'm trying to say.Oh, and you cannot believe how it ends. And I say that as a bad thing because it's basically a set up to the sixth film. Think of Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest's ending because that film also sets up for the third movie. If you take this film away, the whole series would still make sense. Oh, and if you think new directors and writers will at least add some originality to this franchise, they do. In fact, the first 20-30 minutes of the film had me beaming because it was less about the traps and more about the plot. That's until I realized this movie added little to nothing to the plot and the whole movie was back to torturing "unworthy" people that need to be "rehabilitated" going through elaborate torture devices. But, as crazy as this may sound, I found that the best part of the film.The whole plot seemed to bore me. It was all uninteresting. So now, I've created a huge paradox: I wanted the movie to continue the storyline yet the storyline is uninteresting by now and I liked it that they didn't focus on more victims and torture devices for the first twenty minutes yet I found that to be the best part of the remaining of the film. Lots to take in, right? Anyway, I do think this movie were made for the fans and not for average movie goers looking for scares because if you haven't noticed these movies AREN'T scary, you shouldn't be the ones watching it. Overall, I think this film will disappoint many fans and added nothing to the storyline at all. Probably rent it if you're a fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lot of good parts, but a lack of focus leads to an unsatisfying whole</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers ahead...I've been taking film-making classes in college almost as long as I've been following the Saw movies. One thing I've always noticed is how they defy some rules of storytelling. I'll give you an example: I've been taught that, generally, flashbacks are a telltale sign of weak writing- that there are better ways to relay the information. But in the Saw series, they not only define the films' style, but they actually work.With each sequel, they not only they bridge the gap between the movies, making them feel like direct continuations rather than sequels (a rarity in ANY franchise), but the new information changes the way you watch the previous ones. Adam and Dr. Gordon's situation in the first Saw seems hopeless the first time around, but seeing another four movies that only serve to bury them, and knowing what a small part they are of such a big picture, their predicament becomes outright dire.In spite of its virtues, this effect is a double edged sword. It reached a point where, if one of the movies outright sucked, it wasn't some distant, isolated sequel that I could simply not count. So, I had to watch each new installment, lest my life feel incomplete, but I had to enjoy it, otherwise it would take away from the others.Then came Saw IV. They relied less on answering old questions, and more on introducing new characters and traps at breakneck speed. The movie forsook a lot of the series' plausibility, but it created a feeling of chaos so effectively, it was completely forgivable. In fact, the first half of the twist- having it take place during the third movie- was sheer brilliance. But the second- Hoffman being the new Jigsaw- was hard to wrap my brain around. There was no explanation whatsoever. It was a good twist, in the sense that I didn't see it coming, but at first I didn't accept it. But after repeat viewings, it sank in. I came to love the movie like the others, and reasoned that they meant to leave it to be explained in the next one. And lo, a year later, my prayers were answered? more or less.Hoffman is revealed to have had no family, except for his sister. And, at some point, she is killed by her boyfriend Seth, who only serves 5 due to a 'technicality.' Hoffman, a veteran cop, becomes disenfranchised with the justice system. So, he kidnaps Seth and puts him in a lethal pendulum trap, modeling the whole thing after the Jigsaw killer to cover his tracks. Jigsaw finds out, kidnaps Hoffman, and blackmails him into assisting with his work- a very cool scene, by the way. We are then treated to tantalizing glimpses of Hoffman helping kidnap Paul, the man in the razor wire trap from the first film, and setting up the nerve gas house from the second. As all this unfolds, Strahm, embittered by the death of his partner and his discharge from the case, pursues Hoffman.This is all great material, but it's not enough. There has to be a present tense game unfolding, right? Well, there is? kind of. But it's almost a subplot, where it should have been the main focus of the movie. The characters and traps are interesting, but not enough time is spent with them for us to care. And, to make matters worse, they really have no correlation the main plot. No one knows about them, and no one is looking for them. Hoffman's main goal is to cover his tracks, which makes it seem silly that he's playing another game in the first place.As it turns out, this new game only exists for the purpose of implicating Strahm as the other Jigsaw accomplice. If this is supposed to be the twist, it's pretty weak. The seeds for this are planted early on, and by the middle of the movie, Hoffman's intention to do so is rather obvious. And, as much as I like returning characters having a big part, Strahm doesn't really carry the movie's theme like he should. He hasn't done anything "wrong." This causes movie to come across confused. There can't really be a twist if there's no lesson for him to learn.That's the main "biggy" I have regarding the film, but there's no shortage of little things to nitpick. For starters, there is some pretty ridiculous, redundant, and on-the-nose dialogue. A lot of important information is casually conveyed in conversation. Also, the characters' awareness of Jigsaw and his motives takes away from the experience. "Close the door so we can hear the rules." Ugh. And, for all the splendor of the movie's flashbacks, they raise some continuity issues. Hoffman only models his trap after Jigsaw. Jigsaw is not involved. But somehow, Jigsaw's puppet and VOICE are on the tape. Also, if Hoffman is making it look like a Jigsaw killing, that means the Jigsaw killer is already established, right? Well, after Hoffman is recruited, we see him assisting Jigsaw with the razor wire trap. But wait, wasn't that the first one the police found? Traditionally, the Saw movies haven't made mistakes like these. What a disappointment, especially considering how well done the scenes themselves are. It just doesn't add up.Then again, nothing adds up. The movie ends on a "that's it?!?!" note, and the whole thing feels like an epilogue to Saw IV rather than its own self-contained story. The Saw films have traditionally catered to the fans (in the form of flashbacks, cameos by past characters, tying up loose ends, etc.) but this time around, if feels like that's ALL they set out to do- and they didn't even do that 100% right. So, I'd say this one's more miss than hit. Then again, I've only seen it once. Maybe I'll come around, just as I do every time. But I kind of doubt it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Talk about bleeding a film franchise to death!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Saw 5' is one of those films, that after leaving the cinema you eventually recite inevitable phrase of; "why did we go see that?" What once was a guilty pleasure for me, has quickly turned into a tedious and quite boring chore. The story yet again carries on from the previous film as Hoffman continues his 'ingenious' continuation of Jigsaw's work, while a hotshot agent beats the trap and sets out to hunt him and anyone else who maybe a fan of that or-so lovable character Jigsaw.Despite being slightly more coherent than the previous two outings, almost half of 'Saw 5'is told via flashbacks and when there isn't one, we are simply being plied with buckets full of raspberry syrup and mundane traps which Jigsaw himself would laugh at if he ever saw them. That coupled with acting to rival a plank of wood at the 'Woodies', and you've got yourself a pretty idiotic hour and thirty minutes that doesn't shock nor entertain.What made the 'Saw' franchise, most notably the first, most enjoyable for myself was the ingenuity in which Jigsaw operated, however with nothing remotely interesting or enjoyable comes from this film, exact that we can all hope that it finally does now end here!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Was the end somehow different, that I wouldn't have believed how it ended?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here we go again. I was so excited to see Saw V just as I was to see any other sequel of Saw. But in the end every part let me down. I'm starting to wonder where does this excitement come from, especially when at the same time I know I'm already looking for Saw VI to come out. And there's nothing I can do to save me from this obsession. Anyway, I wasn't surprised at all of what I saw yesterday night. We faced this brutal, gory, gruesome performance just like we did in previous 3 movies. What got into them? How can they show this on screen? That's not human anymore. But then again, it never was. The only thing I can't believe is how much blood they shed to record a movie like that. That's really unbelievable. And disgusting. They should forbid putting on screen scenes like that. And the end... Oh, how I feel sorry for every victim that we got to know a little bit more. The sympathy for them just kept rising until they... died. Every one of them. And how we wish they would come back, but they never will.The director David Hackl really messed up things. He didn't convince me that he's sure about the chronology of acts. It sure didn't seem like that. What's done is done, we can't go back. Unfortunately this movie is already made and everybody we care about is dead. When the last person died, I was left numb. And what's shocking is that he died only because he was supposed to die. So every victim was supposed to die? Because none of them is alive. Not anymore.Saw V failed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am extremely disappointed by Saw V. It seemed like up til this point, the saw franchise was getting better and better. I wondered what the twist would be. I wondered if the " you wont believe the ending" was a marketing scheme because they knew they didn't have a masterpiece on their hands. This movie to me is like a cheap TV spin off of it's previous masterpiece(s). I just felt like there wasn't much substance to it. The traps weren't even that great and definitely don't out-do any of the previous. You all have a favorite Saw movie. And you all have a lest favorite too. I guarantee Saw V will be your new least favorite and if you disagree i would love to hear why. I will even go as far as to say they pretty much ruined the series with this one.AS MUCH AS A WANTED TO SEE THIS, THEY SHOULD OF LEFT OFF AT IV</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I've been holding my peace, but this one's a dud and here's why</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>NOTE: The following comment is written under the assumption that readers are familiar with the franchise and its general plot arc.Saw V is a pretty lackluster film, a retread of themes, plots, characters and even specific events from the previous films of the canon. It fails on a lot of levels, but the main one is its insistence on telling us things we already know. The identity of Jigsaw's operative in the police force was revealed at the end of IV (a much better film in every way), and if we even WANTED to know the reasons that this particular cop 'went over to the dark side', we certainly wanted it to be a much more interesting and involving story than the one V gives us. We could, and a lot of us probably already have supposed every generic plot point in this character's origins story. We wouldn't have guessed the specifics, but as usual, the specifics don't matter.Once this recurring flashback tale of transformation has revealed itself to be pretty un-challenging, we're left only with the even blander present-day plot of The Other Cop (excluding the cutaway sequences of an ongoing five-person 'game', which is robbed by its very cutaway nature of any tension and which feels pretty irrelevant throughout). This non-flashback story has nothing to it: the cop who survived the last three films without being Jigsaw's buddy is onto the one who is, and he very stupidly spends all his time walking from dark room to dark room, talking to himself and failing to report his incriminating findings to anyone. Needless to say, things do not end well.And it *is* needless to say this: that's another thing Saw V seems to forget. The film treats its fatalistic and unhappy ending as though it retains the shock that the first film's equally fatalistic and unhappy ending delivered. It doesn't. We are by now very, very wise to the franchise's policy on endings and closure, and we know that the good guys are all doomed. When we get what we know is coming, the natural response is to be quite profoundly unimpressed.I loved the fourth Saw film. I thought it did really new and exciting things with a premise that didn't even originate with the intelligence that was eventually given it. I thought it made really relevant points about ideological warfare and the fundamental horror of terrorism. And I thought it set the series up for some great explorable terrain. What follows is a monumental backslide, a film that does nothing new and doesn't even revert to used material very well (fans who are just after gore are also going to be disappointed - there's not much of it). I came out of the theatre feeling like I was still waiting for the fifth Saw film to get made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*** These comments contain spoilers. Skip ahead to avoid spoilers. *** For the last few weeks, I've been reading people's comments (here and elsewhere) about what they heard would happen in this movie. Even the blurb in this morning's newspaper (which admitted that the reviewer hadn't seen the movie) made claims about what was supposed to happen.Very little, if any, of what I've heard was true. While I'm not one to believe much of what I hear of rumors, I walked into the theater thinking that SOMETHING I've heard must be true.Nope.Contrary to rumor, many die. Contrary to rumor (printed in a major newspaper), we don't learn a darn thing about the Billy puppet. Contrary to rumor...And my back-of-the-head belief that some of the rumors would be true is what allowed me to very much enjoy this one.If you've read any review (from someone that has actually seen it), you know that there is no major plot twist. I figured out how it was going to end when the final scene was being set up (and I'm terrible at figuring out endings).And yet, I still felt surprised by the film.*** Spoilers end here. The following should be fairly spoiler-free, if you've already seen the other 4 films. Skip this if you haven't see them. *** The movie centers around the revelation (Saw IV) that Hoffman is involved with Jigsaw. There are basically two stories: Hoffman working to cover up this information and the story of a bunch of people brought together to play a Saw II-style group "game." The part of the movie that matters most is the Hoffman story. While we learn little new about John Kramer, we learn why Hoffman is involved (the film's only real twist, which doesn't measure up to any of the twists in the prior films, happens relatively early). We get a deeper feeling for John as a man, and this is the first time we see him acting "human" since the miscarriage/cancer. Unfortunately, I felt that giving him this level of humanity comes off the wrong way, making him out to be Jesus (some of the advertising for this movie was based on this notion).The other story, of a group of people brought for a series of Jigsaw games due to a commonality, is weak. Unlike Saw II, which centers around a group of people playing games with various traps while trying to solve an overall mystery, the story here seems to be thrown in only to make this a Saw movie. Without it, the main story line is really like any other police thriller.The overall game being played by the group is a good one, but it's not really explored enough. The individual traps are more similar to those of Saw II, where they appear as potentially deadly games instead of torture devices. The players are asked how to best play the games, not how to hurt themselves or others (kind of).In the end, I enjoyed this significantly more than Saw III (which was just too depressing, particularly because I have children) and Saw IV (which was confusing and was over-the-top in gore). I was happy to see most of the questions coming out of Saw IV answered, although I was disappointed to see that some of my lingering questions from Saw III go without resolution (I fear they never will be). It was pleasing to see how they were able to tie bits from all 4 previous films together, as if Saw V's script had been written prior to the others.There is plenty of blood (it plays a new starring role in one scene) and plenty of crime scene photos. And yet, with the exception of the end of the film's opening scene and one scene at the end, I didn't have to look away at any point. In other words, unlike IV (which grossed me out at times), it made me cringe, but it never went overboard.I walked away feeling satisfied with the ending, despite it not being surprising or a twist. But I also walked away feeling mad that I'd have to wait another year before the next one, just so that I could find out what was in that box. I suspect there's more to Jill than we know. I worry that there are no big secrets left from Saw III.All in all, if you like the series, you'll enjoy this. It's no longer good "torture porn" and the morality play is getting old. But it has all the basic elements you'd want from a Saw movie. And, if nothing else, it gives us a reason to go back to see Saw VI.Which, I hope, is the last one. I look forward (please!) to a wonderful final climax that answers all our questions, but leaves us so shocked that we're upset that there won't be another.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A patchy descent into the banal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Churning out no less than five films onto the Hollywood Halloween Horror frame in the same amount of years the Saw series knows its audience, its largely male, stumbling through adolescence onwards to the thirty something gore fiends looking for the latest offering in the now rapidly declining 'shock horror / torture porn' genre that the first film brought to prominence in 2004.After the events of Saw III shook the franchise with its inventive ending and then, somewhat competently handled the aftermath in the fourth entry, Saw V begs to ask the question: Who's left to slice and dice? Saw V wants to be a reboot in a way, passing the baton from the events in IV and bringing a new fear and era of Jigsaw (in the inevitable Saw VI: The Search For More Money). Problem is, V is so bogged down in its past that the very essence of Saw is lost in its narrative. The set pieces are there; broken souls offered redemption through torturous and painful puzzles (including Julie Benz, who uses her cheap black wig to hide the fact that she's in it for the paycheck, her worst acting effort to date), they still pack a punch, but you can only see so many severed body parts and scorched flesh before it all becomes a bit pass. The roller-coaster only can maintain its pace for some time before you hit some slow corners and V is a sign the ride is coming to an end fast.On one hand the film wants to be a detective thriller, yet is hampered by so many explanatory flashbacks sequences (to understand how the apprentice came to this point) that anyone not familiar with the events of the previous 3 sequels would develop an aneurysm from trying to put it all together. Tobin Bell is relishing fleshing out his Jigsaw/John character more, and he is at his most competent here, while Costas Mandylor's Detective Hoffman is all furrowed brows and menacing glares, a worrying problem when a central character is such a grinding bore that you feel no strong emotion towards either way. On the other hand the essence of Saw remains, pushing the very limit of its rating, the traps are indeed brutal, but seem more like detours into another film. The two stories driving this film do not intersect comfortably, leaving the film feel very disjointed at times, and with so many rapid edits and cuts it leaves the audience detached from the action on screen.The ace up the sleeve since the first inception five years ago was the fantastic twist which flips the story on its head and drives the 'trust no one' themes each film presents, unfortunately Saw V is where the twist is indeed the weakest. The wow factor has truly left the building this time around, and yes, the door is truly left WIDE open for VI.Saw V is the weakest entry in the series, the cleverness that brought the series so much attention over the past five years is lost in the lack of inventiveness and hapless direction. There are only so many ways to shock an audience, and the only true shock is here is how quickly a once genre defining series has become a near parody of itself. The parallels between Saw and other long running horror franchises is becoming more obvious. What's next? Saw VI: Jigsaw in Space? See you next October.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This series has always been about as lowbrow and dirty as a horror franchise could possibly be, and there was little more to these films than thinking of creative, but totally implausible, ways to torture and kill people. None of the films are any good, but there was always an audience for the concept, no matter how derivative and absurd it became.Number V however, is a low budget bore. A lack of creative killing means we have to rely upon story, acting or twists to carry the film, and well there aren't any.It's all stunning dull, poorly lit and flat. It's like all the moments they cut out of the last film so they didn't have to give away the lame twist, made into a new film, with numerous flashbacks, and flashbacks of flashbacks. The script is juvenile and repetitive, the direction is by the numbers, and the acting is as stiff and unconvincing as it possibly could have been. Oh, and the end sucks beyond belief.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw V is clever. It knows what the audience wants, and after four solid films, it still continues to fill in the cracks of minor plot inconsistencies and even manages to link itself all the way back to the first movie. The genius of these films is finding out more about the past that directly links to the events in the future. In this respect, Saw V may just be the best film in the whole series, utilizing plenty of flashbacks, insane traps, and a plethora of returning characters. The fifth film stars series regulars Tobin Bell, Costas Mandylor, and Scott Patterson, as well as newbies Julie Benz, Meagan Good, and Greg Bryk. David Hackl, who served as production designer on Saw II through Saw IV, now takes over the director's chair for Darren Lynn Bousman.This time around, Hoffman, Jigsaw's last remaining apprentice, is trying to tie up all the loose ends, following instructions Jigsaw gave him on his deathbed. Agent Peter Straum is quickly piecing together clues and suspects Hoffman as being tied to Jigsaw. At the same time, five people, Brit, Luba, Mallick, Ashley, and Charles, wake up in a trap and must work together to reach the end. It all builds up to an astounding conclusion that sets the scene for Saw VI in a fantastic fashion.As always, one of the most enthralling things about the Saw films are the traps, and this one doesn't disappoint at all. It doesn't go too over-the-top with the gore, and yet stays intense and absolutely enthralling the entire time. We get explosions aplenty, a water tank, a falling pendulum, a trap involving electrocution, and several others. There is a particular one involving a glass box that was especially disturbing and crazy.The acting in this installment is on-par with Saw II, which is actually saying a lot. It seems as if in all of the films, there is always a weak spot except for Saw II, and now this one (Cary Elwes in Saw, Bahar Soomekh in Saw III, and Justin Louis in Saw IV). Julie Benz is an effective heroine, one that is fun to root for throughout the course of the movie. Likable characters abound, with few even approaching annoyances from this viewer. Scott Patterson was great to watch in his race to piece things together. Costas Mandylor shines in his scenes, and takes over Jigsaw's reign quite well. Tobin Bell is in a league all his own, and in all of the flashback scenes (and there's plenty of 'em), he comes nothing short of an absolute pro. After five films, he has 100% nailed the Jigsaw character.In terms of directing, David Hackl does an excellent job taking over for Darren Lynn Bousman. There is lots of flashy editing and awesome camera angles, and the constant close-up shots that fans of the series have come to love. Hackl's visual style is very similar to that of Bousman's, and that's saying something. Both directors bring an incredible amount of creativity to the screen, and Hackl sprinkles a little flavoring all his own that makes this new Saw flick a feast for the eyes. There's no arguing that's it's well-made, in terms of both acting and directing.The latter half of the movie is super intense, and although the runtime is very short, the length is perfect. It lays out the carpet for the next film in the series with amazing bravado, perfected after five films. It seems like they finally know how to leave us with a cliffhanger at the conclusion. As promised, the ending is stunning and shocking, but don't expect it to be on caliber with the first movie, an ending which will be hard to ever top. Even after five films, Saw has not grown stale, and continues to enthrall and thrill fans of the series. It is probably the best movie series ever in terms of continuity. As much as I thought I knew what was coming, the fifth entry in the Saw series threw out shock after shock and never ceased to surprise me. Once the credits start, you are left craving more, which will make the next and final entry in the Saw series one that this particular fan will very much be looking forward to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saw V</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This time, Saw V juggles three different plot threads, with less time or effort truly dedicated to those who must survive a new game orchestrated this time by Jigsaw's long time accomplice, detective Hoffman(Costas Mandylor) who we thought was supposedly out to catch the cerebral criminal mastermind behind the death traps which have taken the lives of characters from four films. FBI Special Agent Strahm(Scott Patterson), who actually survives a trap set by Hoffman(..a head device where water would suffocate him, Strahm, clever enough to use a pen in his throat to help him breathe), suspects that the decorated cop might be aligned with Jigsaw(Tobin Bell), but is told by his superiors that he no longer is on the case, removed because of those lives lost under his command. Meanwhile, five(..the appropriate number, isn't it?)new people awaken to find themselves playing the Jigsaw game, this time Hoffman will be in charge, and they will need to work together(..of course, it doesn't quite result as it was intended)in order to survive.A series of traps involving keys unlocking collars(..which release them from a machine that will behead them if unable to accomplish it in the appropriate time afforded them), breaking bottles from above in order to secure bolts(.. which open gates to chambers providing shelter from explosives that trigger when time is up), electric shock which will enable the locks on doors to unfasten(..before bottles containing nails are detonated), and "donating" enough pints of blood to release them into freedom are showcased for the Saw faithful.As usual, Jigsaw's philosophy, to transform those who face death into more appreciative, morally whole human beings, is established upon those chosen in this film. The film follows Strahm's journey of discovery regarding Hoffman, and how Hoffman and Jigsaw's unification evolved over time. Despite being dead for over two films now, Jigsaw still remains a vital part of the franchise. I think the main problem is accepting that Hoffman could continue to perform his duties as a detective while also orchestrating such elaborate traps with Jigsaw(..and on his own)..it's just a bit too far fetched even for this franchise. We also follow Hoffman's cunning trap being prepared for Strahm, manipulating FBI agent Erickson(Mark Rolston) who has replaced him on the Jigsaw case. And, last but not least, Jigsaw left his wife(Betsy Russell) a black box..what is in this box? Will we find out in Saw's 6, 7, 8, or 9? There's an ironic twist involving the new "players", who all had a hand in the destruction of a specific building, because of their unwillingness to work as a unit Saw fans might find amusing. Julie Benz(Dexter;who seems to be wearing a black wig)and Greg Bryk(A History of Violence)are two of the five who must play Jigsaw's game. To me, the definite highlight is the pendulum trap set for the killer of Hoffman's sister who must set his hands in vices to be crushed in order to supposedly rescue himself. And, another homage to Poe includes a victim trapped in a room as the walls close in on him, eventually crushing him. The trap where two must place their hands in a spinning saw blade to provide blood is a particularly nasty sequence not for the squeamish. How the screenplay writers continue to concoct these difficultly designed traps and bounce back and forth through the series, are clever and imaginative, if ridiculous and hard to believe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw V as of this moment is the weakest installment in the series, with Saw IV marginally surpassing it. Although V is better made with better directing and a better script, it still lacks the entertainment value that IV had despite it's major flaws. Not to mention, it's completely dependent on the previous films. It feels more like an extended episode of a television show than a complete story onto itself. A non-fan watching the film for the first time would be completely lost.The script is often disjointed, the traps are dull and require no ingenuity, and there's not a lot of structure, with uninteresting flashbacks popping up randomly and grinding the film to a halt.David Hackl's directing failed to impress me. He doesn't have any visual flair beyond the most basic of camera setups, nor any rapport with the actors. He also shoots the film with a smeary, cheap look. I will admit he did a better job than Darren Bousman did with IV, but that's not saying much.There's an overload of bland cardboard characters, most of whom are completely disposable and only exist to react to situations and die. The dialog given to them is as deadly as the traps. When it isn't monotonously explaining what we've already seen, it's mostly of the "Fck you," "What the fck!", "Survival of the fittest, my ass" variety. The acting is terrible beyond belief, with the only saving graces in the acting department being Tobin Bell and Scott Patterson.The 5-1 subplot is nothing more than a pathetic and unimaginative Saw II regurgitation. It's ludicrous, stupid, and above all: just plain pointless. It hardly gels with the rest of the story (having it be in the film to "frame Strahm" isn't a good enough excuse when they easily could of done something as simple as just leaving a object or two of his for FBI agent Erickson to find; that would of gotten the point across equally as well, maybe even better). The blunt and sad truth is that it was only inserted into the film to both fill up the running time AND add in some additional gore and violence to satisfy the simple-minded teenagers in the audience.There's a huge deficiency in suspense, which was one of the many things that once made the series great. Instead, just like in IV, it's replaced by senseless gore that has no substance within the story whatsoever. The ending I was surprised with: it was great and very suspenseful.........it's just a shame that the rest of the film didn't match up to it. If it did, then we'd have something special.Even with these negative aspects though, it isn't terrible. The directing is not as bad as I make it out to be. In fact I liked Hackl's slow pacing, which allowed for a much more relaxed vibe than IV, and also for things to be set up neatly. To add on to this, the cat and mouse game throughout is very interesting, and there are undoubtedly bits of entertaining value to be found here and there(although not nearly enough to make up for all of it's major flaws).Overall, Saw V is a weak and disappointing sequel unable to hold it's own. But it does have it's share of redeeming factors, and for that, it doesn't deserve any lower than a 4.Thank god that it's not as bad as the fifth entries in most other horror franchises (Halloween 5, Hellraiser 5, Nightmare On Elm Street 5, etc.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I kid you not I feel the "Saw" series is being a bit rushed. I felt like Jigsaw/John (Tobin Bell) was dying too fast for my taste. In SAW II he gets an accomplice, Amanda, and that just sucks for the most part. I felt like Jigsaw hadn't played much of a stand-alone role for much screen time... I felt like Amanada could of came in in Saw III and continued the series as such. I just feel the series is missing something. Yeah, John dies in Saw III. But, gosh... I mean I hate his chosen accomplices even though Amanda is dead. It just doesn't seem like they can "MIMIC" Tobin Bell's character, Jigsaw, in any possible attempt. I'm just a bit shocked by this movie as well. Tobin Bell didn't have much screen time, which I hated. The series has created 5 sequels(well, 4, but VI will be in production soon) and they have to stop the nonsense. Soon SAW X will be out and it will be more of a porno or something. Seriously if they're going to do another sequel tie up loose ends with Jigsaw... OR pretend he has a twin brother and bring Tobin Bell back for one more go at some fun... Gosh - stupid nonsense.Other then these minor(ha, minor...NOT) flaws I rate 7/10 for THIS movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has Yet to Run on Fumes, But It's Just About the Last One Not To</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many critics think that the Saw franchise is now running on fumes, but really, not quite yet. Saw VI will have to. But Saw V rejuvenates the philosophical accessibility of the series. Saw IV was a rejuvenation of its suspense even if it went overboard in its effort to reach the novel twist that is now the narrative signature of the franchise, but Saw V recalls the morbid vision of vindication, redemption and earning one's right to live in our overpopulated and sinister human race. None of the four sequels have or will equal the novelty, thrift and true terror of the original film, but this is a series in which we find ourselves looking forward to the successor the next year.Each film must conjure up new situations, which Jigsaw sees as "tests" or "games", where the will of different characters is tested through physical and psychological torture. A good writer can do it, but within the genre target demographic to which it plays, it's a lot easier than churning out the next Jason movie, then remaking it, or churning out the next Michael Myers film, then remaking it. Really, I think the curse of slasher trash can be aborted now. The Saw series having become the top-grossing horror franchise of all time in unadjusted dollars, we see that fans are truly digging the cognitive challenge of mastering Jigsaw's improbably elaborate games.We are not entirely sure what is going on in Saw V until the last half hour. The dispersive narrative, interknitting the unanswered questions, not to mention questions we didn't know needed to be answered, from all four of its predecessors, only converges roughly around this time. And by then, several philosophical koans have been passed through our heads. Owing to the plot of this fifth installment, which is so full of surprises that I can't say a word about it without spoiling at least one, we discern between how others perceive Jigsaw's work and how Jigsaw really works. However, its ending contradicts everything that we previously learn about Jigsaw's intentions. It seems to be there only for tradition's sake, for the consideration of the series' habit of pulling one last grand fast one on us immediately before the end credits.The production values that one attributes to the Gothic, totally obscure but strangely everyday atmosphere have been completely usurped by the passage of the series through the hands of different writers and directors. David Hackl moves the story well enough, its stylistic and tonal aspects are running on fumes, just like all the actors save for Tobin Bell and the ones that are trapped this time around, which is now merely half the action, which is why the original Saw will always be the scariest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>what is wrong with people? why do they keep these movies going by seeing them, giving them money? why should you want to see people getting tortured? well I've never been a fan of snuff films and those of you who are a sick puppies. just because you make someone kill themselves doesn't make you not a murderer, a fact these movies seems to ignore. the stupid "lesson" jigsaw tries to make with all his dumb traps is so trite and annoying you almost want him to have nothing to say and just do it already 'cause no one is buying it. i love how he dies in the 2nd saw but still is somehow in 3 more movies. do the writers of these movies just think all audiences are morons? well i have to say if you are a fan of these movies then you are a moron so i guess they can write pretty much anything and you will pump money into it, no matter how dumb.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the 4th Saw, but still they're relying more on the gore rather than on the story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 5th installment into the Saw series, every year during Halloween, we know what to expect in the theater, the next Saw sequel. I remember seeing the first Saw and how much it freaked me out, the audience reaction, that we had never seen something so intense or gory as well as having a clever twist. Now the main reason why everyone sees these films is because they just wanna see the new torture devices the Jig Saw Killer has come up with, the Saw series has become the poor man's Se7en. I'm not going to lie, hey, I'm American, I do love to see the new devices, it's interesting and fun to watch. I'm just curious when the Jig Saw Killer runs out of criminals if he's going to go after the mediocre criminals, like a kid who steals candy... "Hello, Jack, I want to play a game... you've enjoyed candy your whole life, now are you willing to kill for it?" or something like that, OK, that was silly, but you get what I'm saying.The Jig Saw killer is now dead and we are curious who will take on his legacy since Amanda failed at it as well. But we learn now that he had more inside players than we knew about. That maybe even a detective who has seen so much injustice in the world is finally ready to get his hands dirty. But the detective may wanna think fast since another policeman is on his tail wondering why everyone else who went to investigate the jig saw killer is dead or horribly injured yet he doesn't have one scratch on him. While this is happening, we have 5 individuals who all have a horrible secret in common and they have to go through the next series of nightmarish events, but instead they think too quick and about themselves before others to reveal something even more horrifying.Saw V is a decent installment, it's much better than the 4th in my opinion. But still it's just become more about what next trap will be set next. I just felt so bad for that first blonde girl in the group, it's like she had one line and bam! She's gone. I felt like some of the story was rushed or too slow. But the traps as usual were fun. But I also felt though as if now they're just looking too much for a way to continue the story, I know there is already a Saw VI in the making, but seriously, they should just stop now, because it's becoming more and more silly.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everybody deserves a chance ? Saw V</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, did a Saw film get beat out by a bunch of Disney tweeners for the top spot? Maybe the tide has changed and the blood and gore doesn't quite hold up on the scare factor versus singing and dancing kids ? hey that scares me more too. Saw V has arrived anyways, though, and it continues the intricate storyline very well. While that story ties together nicely, the film itself is not up to par. I believe this is the first of the series that I actually started thinking about the stupidity of some situations on screen. In the past I've just let them go because the plot got me invested completely and I needed to see what would happen. Here, between trying to deflect the moments of disbelief with more blood than any that came before it and our "hero" deciding to speak out loud to describe things we just saw flashbacks of, I had to shake my head because the little things were taking me away from the big picture. It's a shame too, because the script really interweaves the present with the past perfectly, connecting every installment together by shedding light on the behind the scenes goings-on for each one. Once again the writers have found a way to create inside the grey areas, beefing up the mythology and making it all more carefully orchestrated than we had originally thought.Time is played with again, but what else did you expect? It all opens with a murder set-up, however there is one huge difference ? whether the victim follows the rules and beats the game or not, it doesn't seem like he'll be able to save himself. This is so un-Jigsaw-like that maybe our new evil incarnate, (if you haven't seen the past films, you shouldn't be reading this anyways), Detective Hoffman, doesn't quite share the same mentality of rehabilitation as John. Here is the first solo kill from the new serial murderer, or is it? After the film continues on, we are treated to many flashbacks helping to flesh out the relationship between John and Hoffman, how they met, how they connected, and what made this cop turn into an angel of death. Around the halfway mark is where we are finally able to get our feet underneath us, letting us discover exactly when everything we've seen has occurred in relation to the others. And of course, this device allows us to experience more of Tobin Bell's superior psychopath, once again making it almost seem as though what he does is the right thing.It truly all comes together, a fact that intrigues me to think that this may be the final piece to the puzzle. We discover small details including what transgressions the obese man in Saw got him in the barbed wire, how the doctor's penlight ended up at the scene of that crime, why Amanda was placed in action during Saw II, and what got Hoffman involved with the side he was investigating against. The ability to keep adding on and make the background richer with each film is astounding. Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan did a great job picking up where the original writers left off with Saw IV and have continued that job here. Unfortunately it is their handling of the present details that falter. I don't blame them too much because they had a lot on their plates making the backstory connect, leaving something to be desired on the periphery story about five young adults unknowingly involved in an accidental arson murder is understandable.The game these five people must play is very obvious, with its twist blatantly there to be understood, yet milked until the final "test". As a result, I just wanted to be done with them and go back to Hoffman's cat and mouse game with FBI Agent Strahm. It's too bad because I'm a fan of Carlo Rota from his "24" days and Julie Benz was quite interesting too, (when will I find the time to start watching "Dexter"?). Their storyline was just too much of a MacGuffin, one that never asked me to invest time in it, so I never did. Scott Patterson (Strahm) and Costas Mandylor (Hoffman) were too intriguing to pass up on. And that is totally character based, because I will admit, neither are that stellar as actors. They brood well and keep that blank, cold stare to uncomfortable effect. Anyone who can orchestrate a game as good as Jigsaw is worth your time and, as for our hero Strahm, anyone who can give himself a tracheotomy is all kinds of badass.So, if you've been keeping score and haven't lost your stomach yet, do yourself a favor and continue the journey. It's not the best installment, but it builds upon the past nicely. You probably don't have to run to the theatres, giving it a rent in a couple months should suffice. Just be forewarned and don't take too much stock in the "you won't believe how it ends" tagline. The ending is telestrated from the get-go, just one more example of how the standalone story is much weaker than the mythology continuity. And don't forget to pay attention to some innocuous moments with John's ex-wife, Betsy Russell's Jill Tuck. Whatever her involvement is, besides the lie she tells towards the end, may just be a centerpiece to Saw VI, if that tale gets green-lit for production.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Saw V</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems that you can't put a good man down, or in this case, you can't put a stop to a popular franchise, and should milk it for all its worth until the returns cannot justify another box office comeback. Many Halloweens ago, we got floored by something so gory but yet so innovative in its presentation, that it started a slew of torture porn movies capitalizing on the mantra of the bloodier and gorier, the better. There were some hits and misses of course, but for all it's worth, the Saw movies so far have managed to pull off sucker punch after sucker punch in its finale despite the meat of the plot just chugging along with some difficultly in reaching its end point.Production designer on the previous Saw movies, David Hackl, takes over the director's chair to steer this franchise into a new direction. Reportedly the beginning of another set of trilogy films, Saw V has all the trappings and pitfalls in being the seed for that tangent in direction, and also of the dawn of a new Jigsaw, sort of. But the question is what would happen to THE Jigsaw that we have grown fond of, that Tobin Bell had played to perfection, personifying that sick moral judgement in his games to his victims?I suppose Jigsaw has cemented its cinematic pedigree in being one of the most memorable screen villains of today, and undoubtedly without Bell's portrayal, it's anyone's guess how this movie would perform. Granted that we all know what happened to him in Saw IV, this installment still doesn't quite manage to fly on its own without his participation, and relies on a series of flashbacks so that our beloved actor and character could grace the screen one last time. I say last, because if he were to return for the next movie (if it does get made), then truly something is really wrong and it will reek of desperation and the lack of courage to venture forward. Just like how the Terminator franchise is now forging ahead without Schwarzeneggar's participation, though of course having Christian Bale step in is reason enough to believe that the movies should do relatively well (I hope, since I'm counting the chickens before they hatch).Continuing where the previous installment left off, I'm still quite amazed at how the scriptwriters manage to weave in a plot that goes as far back as they could, and still make it work rather well. I won't give away anything here, but suffice to say that it's yet another cop versus cop thing, and about man's stubbornness and obsession to dig at the truth that fuels the bulk of the story, and of course, leading them straight into the ploy of Jigsaw, with its infamous tape players still around to play Tobin Bell's voice, albeit a little too convenient a grand plan to have things fall into place so nicely.Pre-requisite knowledge of the earlier films is a must, so don't go at this blind. As the story develops, it goes back to some of the classic scenes that were featured in the earlier movies, so it becomes somewhat deja-vu, or even cheated in a way to have watch the same execution perform twice, although from different points of view. The only plus point here, and it appeals to purists, completists and fanboys, is to dig at the motivation and rationale, as we have Jigsaw explaining a little bit more on what his diabolical plots want to achieve. Otherwise, it will seem more or less like the second movie, with yet another big group of potential victims put together in seemingly random fashion, to try and survive a series of torture traps to see who can make it out in the end.So is Saw V any good? If you're a fan of the series, then I'm pretty sure you would place your bum in the cinema no matter what anyone tells you, and want to judge for yourself. So for those out there under this category, just remember that this episode probably marks the start of a new direction, leaving behind the old when it's done. For those who have not watched any of the Saw movies to date, then there's only one thing to do, and that's to get your hands on the first, and start from there.</fullReview>

It could of been really fun to watch. They could of developed more relationships between the connected people. It did have a different feel to the movie, since it was mostly about Strahm pursuing Hoffman. I just feel that it would be more fun to watch more "survival" games, since that is what defines the Saw series. After the movie ended, all I had to saw was, wow, that was pretty awesome. If you're a fan of the Saw movies and you don't watch them just to bash them, you'll enjoy Saw V.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rather Decent If You've Seen The Previous Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**FOLLOWING CONTAINS MANY SPOILERS**Now...below is a summary, but personally, I really enjoyed the films. Much better than the fourth one, this fills in many holes in the series and answers many questions as well as adding new ones that opens the story up to a 6th in the series. I personally really like that they did. It was a good continuation to the story and was a lot easier to follow than the previous 2 films. Better than Saw VI and II. Not quite as good as Saw I and III. Right in the middle. See it to say you've seen it, but don't not go and judge it. Everyone has a different opinion...yours may be different than someone that hated it. Now...the Saw Series isn't all about gore. It actually has a good plot with tons of twists and turns that keep you on the edge of your seat. (The gore is just a bonus...) In the latest installment, you learn about why the newest and most recently revealed apprentice, Detective Mark Hoffman, was involved in the whole Jigsaw ordeal. We learn that he was blackmailed for getting revenge and forced to help Jigsaw with his sick games. Now...normally with the other Saw movies, the people that are put into the games where they have to mutilate themselves are drug addicts, murderers, rapists, arsonists, etc. But in this movie, the people were high-class citizens. City planners, journalists, real-estate developers, etc. This made for a very interesting twist. They used their high-class status to advance themselves in life (money and such) and Jigsaw felt like testing them...blah blah blah, you get the idea. The other side of the movie shows a cop, Special Agent Peter Strahm, following Detective Hoffman trying to catch him as the true Jigsaw Accomplice. Meanwhile, Hoffman was setting the scene to make it look like Strahm was the real apprentice throwing the rest of the police off the trail. It really was a tug-of-war battle that ended in bloodshed. Now, I repeat. This movie actually does have a plot and the gore is really a backseat to this film. This movie leaves many holes and loose ends that are going to be tied up in Saw VI next October, but until then, you won't hear me speak the name Saw...(not for a couple months anyway...)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can one say about the fifth instalment of a hugely successful series. Saw V has all the elements of the previous films - has a group story similar to II, has the drama side from IV, and at parts, is incredibly gory, matching the sick Saw III.The big downside? Tobin Bell isn't in it enough, and since Saw IV, we've only seen him in flashbacks, which is good for the story, but bad if you are a fan of Jigsaw.David Hackl doesn't disappoint as a director, keeping close to the 'Saw' feel we've grown accustomed to over the years. From exploding nail bombs to an incredibly neat twist (Although I disagree with the tag line), Saw V is an acceptable entry to the series, despite the fact that nothing can top Saw I...If you've seen the other Saw films, go watch this; and I'm sure if you're a huge fan, next year's Saw VI will be the must see film of 2009.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I could spend all day talking about the ridiculous plot holes in this movie...but if it didn't have any, it wouldn't be a horror movie near Halloween, it would be an Oscar targeted movie. People expecting to see chilling story mixed in with gore, violence, and a life lesson need to stop looking at SAW movies and just re-watch SE7EN. SAW movies are purely for fun...so take them as they are. Do not start to like a character because they will die. Jigsaw's lesson in this movie is to predict the human mind and take out all personal emotion...which is exactly what the audience should do. Grab some popcorn and enjoy it for what it is. As for acting- sub-par. Story-weak. Twist-almost non-existent. But there will be a 6th and with the way this movie flies by there's no doubt i will be watching 5 and 6 back to back every time...pretty much considering 5 doesn't really have an ending. With 2 films left to go, there's not much more back story left to tell and only a few things that could happen now. With the least gore so far in the series, it goes something like this. SAW is the stand alone movie. SAW2 is the good sequel and where the main storyline begins. 3 segways into 4 which is the transitional movie, and if the 6 or 7 movie saga were split SAW 5 would be the SAW to the newer trilogy. Im looking forward to 6 but certainly do not think this movie is on par with 1, 2, or 4.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Traps of Saw 5</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I start, I did enjoy this movie, it's nothing new. I do want to warn you that there are A LOT of SPOILERS below, though I won't spoil some of the big ones. Once past the pendulum trap with Seth, this movie starts basically where Saw 3/4 left off, with Strahm barging into Jigsaw's death-room, killing Jeff, and being locked in by Hoffman. This leads directly to the trap with Strahm's head inside of a glass box which is filling up with water. As he's the one of the main characters, there's no need to tell you he survived, I just won't tell how. Anyway, Hoffman "saves" Jeff's daughter and Strahm is found and taken to the hospital. A press conference is given and it's revealed Jigsaw is dead and Hoffman's given a promotion. Yet Strahm suspects Hoffman and Hoffman knows it, and now it's a race between the two to either kill or arrest the other. Meanwhile, five people are chained together in a room. They have one minute to unlock the collars before they are decapitated. Once they escape (with only four) they're locked in another room which will explode in a minute unless they find the keys that will let three of them hide in side rooms. Then, they must escape another room in three minutes by grounding live wires in a bathtub; unfortunately the wires don't reach and they have to find a way to make them reach. Finally, the last room gives the remaining two 15 minutes to unlock the door by filling a jar with 10 ounces of blood, yet a human can only give 8 before dying. Now, we see Hoffman framing Strahmfor being Jigsaw's accomplice and Strahm deducing how Hoffman became Jigsaw's accomplice (through a series of flashbacks, of course) and finally tracking him to a room with a glass box filled with broken glass. A tape tells him to enter the box and, though he'll be hurt, he will survive. He doesn't, and he tricks Hoffman into entering the box, which Strahm slams shut, locking Hoffman inside. Hoffman looks at him and smiles as the door to the room also locks, trapping them both inside. Yet, something now occurs that makes up the last few minutes, but it is a "major" twist that usually happens, but I won't tell you what does happen. Like I said above, this movie is nothing new. You have an obsessed agent tracking down the killer (Saw I), a bunch of people trapped in a house (Saw II), Jigsaw taking an apprentice and teaching him the Jigsaw ways of saving someone (Saw III), and finally, a convoluted path for someone to have to trust someone else (Saw IV). And I'll say this too, apparently Rigg is dead, though we don't see him; there is once again no mention of Dr. Lawrence, so we don't know if he could still be alive (I doubt it, though). 6/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Leaves you hanging</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If anyone's seen the movies in the SAW franchise, they'll know that these films aren't about mindless gore and blood (though this one comes pretty close to it), these films are more thrillers than anything else. The common theme that strings these films together is everyday people who have no regard for human life, are put into situations which make them appreciate their life and those around them.This film somewhat deviates from this main theme. I won't rehash the plot, but I will say that the film was good. Both the cast and crew managed to do a fantastic job! Visually, the film is stunning and the directing is very crisp.Some of the best scenes were the flashback scenes with Tobin Bell. It was refreshing to see the alternate viewpoints of various scenes from some of the earlier films (the barb wire trap from SAW and the gun in door trap from SAW II).It was really great to see Betsy Russell (Jill) back on screen reprising her role - she looks amazing! It's interesting how the studio and writers have managed to keep the Saw franchise alive and well considering the main character was killed off in Saw III. This newest installment leaves several questions unanswered.For starters, what was in the box? Who set the letter on Hoffman's desk that said, "I know who you are"? Clearly it wasn't Strahm because he doesn't know who Hoffman really is until very late into the film. So who knows who Hoffman really is? There are several more, but you'll have to see the film.And as far as the series is at this point in time, introducing new characters into the game without any character development is simply a mistake. So with zero character development of the new five characters, their game, traps and existence in the film was pretty insignificant. They are merely cattle to be slaughtered in "original, yet meaningless" traps.Now for a film with the tag line, "you won't believe how it ends", the ending of this film is particularly weak. Be that as it may, my qualms rest with the fact that when Hoffman enters into the glass case, he just stares at a panic stricken Strahm. He should have taunted him, blew kisses at him (haha!), flipped him off or even waved at him. Instead, he does nothing except stare at him and then pass out.All things considered, the film is good. It definitely leaves you hanging, so hopefully they'll pick up the slack in the next chapter. 7/10.</fullReview>

Saw is one of few movies to match, if not out-do itself, with the sequel, Saw II.With Saw and Saw II being as good as they were, III and IV seemed weak. Saw V got Lionsgate right back on track. The traps in this movie are in no way inferior to those in Jigsaws earlier kills. The amount of gore is something that keeps a lot of Saw fans interested and I think that this one had just enough gore.

I've been a fan since the original came out and they are all really tremendous movies.You know, it's not about the amount of gore or lack thereof, no; it's about a good storyline which I feel that the entire Saw line possesses.Without revealing anything too in depth about the film (Don't want to ruin it for people who haven't seen it) I can tell you that this Saw does a good job of tying the first two Saws together. We are finding out more and more about Jigsaw and how the traps are done and what went into them.Any Saw fan will love this movie and I for one cannot wait to add it to my DVD collection. If you didn't like Saw 1 or the fact that there is gore then you will not like this movie either. It isn't gore just for gore's sake ... it really contributes to the storyline and if you look deeper and realize why these people are in the traps and why Jigsaw does what he does then you will realize that there really is more to Saw then just blood and gore!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a HUGE Saw fan and have been waiting all year to see the next chapter of this story on opening night. Going into Saw V, I really had high hopes that it would be an amazing movie and luckily my hopes weren't shattered. Although it is not my favourite Saw movie in the franchise, this one does have its moments of wanting to cover your eyes in your boyfriend's/girlfriend's shoulder and plug your ears to prevent hearing some horrific and gruesome sounds.First, as my summary title explains, a lot of this movie is about the story of Hoffman and how he plays and has played a role in Jigsaw's work and most importantly why. This means you have to see the other four Saw movies in order to understand what is going on in the movie or else you will totally be lost and confused. A lot of unanswered questions in the other Saw movies were finally answered such as why the police unit was the target of Jigsaw's games, what happens to the daughter from the third Saw, and who detective Hoffman really is. Although this one didn't have as many gruesome deaths and traps as the other Saw movies, it gave a lot of background information about Jigsaw's work which in my opinion was interesting and showed that Jigsaw really had "meaning behind the madness" with why he set people up in the grisly traps and games that he did. It makes the viewers think of Jigsaw as a good guy and as someone who merely wants justice to be served.I definitely don't want to give away the ending of the movie so I will simply say that you will not be disappointed with how it shockingly ends. The trap is quite ingenious and shows just how incredibly smart Hoffman truly is proving him to be an excellent apprentice of Jigsaw's work. The ending also leaves room for a sequel which I'm definitely looking forward to and introduces Dan Erickson as possibly the next major target of Hoffman's games. For all Saw fans, I definitely recommend seeing it. It's worth the $12 in theaters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a bad movie, but haven't seen the last 4</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>well it was the first time seeing this movie, since i have not seen the last 4 movies so i wasn't expecting much from this movie. It was pretty gory, but has its decent content to freak you out. Well pretty much I need to know what happened in the last four, but i heard they where trying to end the story, but since it will live on i guess. It is a good movie to watch if you have seen the series, and also a good one to bring your girlfriend to watch if she is in to scary horrifying movies. I guess I have to watch the previous ones to try to piece together the "jigsaw" pieces to fit the story together, otherwise it is just an Okay movie. It is a rental for me although i have watched it in the movie theater for the Saw series.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i really enjoyed this one each one has its own style and always a great twist. when saw first came to the cinema i thought it was pretty kool then number 2 came out and i was hooked and then 3 i was blown away After watching saw 4 i was impressed but left unanswered questions and why? well because the series is starting again! the twist was similar to saw 1. "Rise of jigsaw" or "rise of apprentice". and now saw 5 which was pretty darn good! almost liked it as much as 3. i cant wait for saw 6 because if my theory is right there going to have a massive twist! i mean big twist like saw 3. the saw franchise is excellent. i just wish the characters would make good decisions not bad!.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Again, this is the utmost horror franchise. The story remains as dark as it gets and the plot is, as always, well written and surprising! The story is still one among the 5 movies. It's almost like the author/director is making it go on in every movie without the terrible after effects of sequels. I'm really grateful this isn't the end!!! Jigsaw is dead and it is still ruling the game. There are still unexplained factors, what is really good! It means we'll get another movie next year (I hope). I wont tell a thing but I'd like to know what will happen from now on. ;-) There aren't many pendencies left behind after this movie.</fullReview>

I consider myself a pretty big fan of Saw, I loved the first movie and after being impressed, but not overwhelmed by the other sequels, I was actually quite excited about Saw V from all the adverts and fancy pictures on the sides of the buses! Sadly, Saw V lacks a key element that its predecessors had...surprise! It contains all new thrills and spills, an all new collection of helpless victims, but it lacks the 'shock' ending that what makes a Saw film worth watching. Do yourself a favour, if you must see it wait for the DVD release; not worth a cinema trip.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have been a huge Saw fan since I saw the original in the theater. Story lines that mixed well and just enough tension to make you uncomfortable were what I was used to. I just went to see Saw V and was rather disappointed since it was so dull for the first half. With very little excitement in the first half, I found myself looking at my watch quite frequently. Don't get me wrong, I love the fact that there is still a storyline and not just a bunch of gore, but the story completely took over though the use of way too many flashback scenes. The original formula for Saw was one that added so much suspense throughout the movie that by the end, you were blown away. In Saw V however, the story takes over and you have no suspense which made for a less than perfect follow-up. The final scene did make me happy and gave me a glimmer of hope that the 6th installment may bring my faith back!</fullReview>

It is the bloodiest and the most brutal part of SAW.We finally know what happen with Tapp, Perez, Rigg, and others. We know new interesting characters as Erickson.

		<shortDescription>SAW V: "For True Fans Only!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To start with, please do not go see Saw V if you are not brushed up on your Saw 1-4 knowledge. My girlfriend and sister both disliked Saw V because they did not understand it, and echoed much of the exact same words as Saw V's negative reviewers. I suggest watching all four previous films and knowing what the series is really about, as well as knowing well who the following characters are: Hoffman, Jigsaw, Jill Tuck, Agent Strahm, and Amanda Young. There are flashbacks and my sister did not enjoy them because she had only seen 1-4 once apiece and she did not remember hardly anything about them. To fully appreciate and enjoy this movie as I did, you MUST know your Saw trivia.Now onto my review: I thoroughly enjoyed the fifth addition to this legendary mystery/thriller series. One reason is for the title I just gave the franchise: "mystery/thriller." To me Saw 1-5 are not horror movies nearly as much as mystery/thrillers. People wanting gore and slashing should stick to Dimension and Wes Craven type films. Saw V is probably the most dramatic and different of the series. Part of the movie did not have the "classic" Saw feel (maninly the first half of the movie), but the second half really started to feel more like the Saw movies to which we've become accustomed. As most reviewers have mentioned, the violent scenes, while still very graphic and disgusting, are further apart (time spaced) and there are fewer of them. Although one of the traps may have been the most disturbing and painful looking I have ever seen.As far as what previous of the Saw movies it's most comparable, most reviewers say Saw 2, but I don't think it bore resemblance to any of them. Saw V stands alone in the series, and stands well. Saw V DOES rely heavily on a storyline, and fans who crave background info, flashbacks, and tying up loose ends will enjoy the movie most out of everyone. Being a true fan, I believe one thing that bothers so many people about Saw V is that it breaks the "traditional Saw mold." Some have stated that all loose ends were tied up but that's entirely untrue. If anything, Saw V spent little time clearing up questions (even the ones it answered were done briefly and non-chalantly for the most part), and it raised as many new questions as it answered. There was a good bit of nostalgia, just as Saw 3 featured, but I think some were not as excited about 5's nostalgia because it may not have "meant as much to the series and to our questions." Saw V does not move the story along much because the focus now is less on moving forward as it is filling in the gaps and bringing the legacy to a close. So of course the story doesn't progress much. It is not supposed to. Saw V accomplishes it purpose very successfully."Twists/Promoted Themes/Questions Supposed to be Answered": Keeping brief: there were 2 twists. The first is not clearly a twist and up for debate. The second was good but not great or shocking. But it made great sense and went with the premise. "You won't believe how it ends"- some will be disappointed and some will like it, but that phrase is a bit of an oversell. Questions that were said to be answered were only maybe a couple. The FAQ page on IMDb is not very accurate and it seems, after seeing it be wrong time and again, to be telling fans what they wanna hear.All said, the movie was very good, and true saw fans should like it. It is not suggested for casual Saw and/or horror fans. This movie, while it answers some questions and fills in some gaps, really is more of a set-up for a big Saw 6 finale. There are still several unsolved mysteries in the series and with the way the movies leaves us, Saw 6, as far as its storyline, should be the most anticipated yet for the simple fact that there is no way to know what it will be about.Saw fans: Go see this movie! The negative reviewers are either way too negative and have way too high of expectations, don't know much about the series, or are upset because they are TOO obsessed with the series and their blog theories were not explored. Go see it with an open mind!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saw V = Best in Series!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw V had me on the edge of my seat from start to finish. It was so suspenseful and intense and pretty bloody. The films answers some of our lingering questions like how did Hoffman get associated with Jigsaw? How does Strahm get out of the sickroom? What Happens to Corbett? How does Jigsaw's corpse get found? This movie was great, wait beyond great astounding! I had 5 favorite traps The Pendulum, The Neck Tie, The Electricity Trap , The Hand in saw blade, and of course The Grand Finale Trap! The Grand Finale Trap is awesome how Hoffman lowers into the floor with a sinister smile on his face and how the blood splatters on the glass while Strahm gets crushed . The Hand in saw blade was awesome and bloody although Mallick may have died due to excessive blood loss. This is definitely the best in the series easily and is one of my favorite films of all time.</fullReview>

Writers are at it again, piecing every part together in a way you could not have seen coming. What you think you knew before seeing this movie, throw it out the window because it changes everything. The torture scenes in this movie may not be as numerous as once before, but these were well thought out and very intense. Has similarities to the second movie in which a team is forced to work together to survive, but is much much different. 9/10 for great horror, great writing, and just because I love watching the saw movies around Halloween time each year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saw V is a great film for the HARDCORE fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have now seen Saw V 3 times so I am pretty familiar with the plot and specific details others may miss on a first pass. They took this series in a very new and interesting direction, which is EXACTLY what was needed. Some of my few complaints include that they seemed to only be setting us up for Saw VI, which is to be expected. I got chills multiple times throughout the film and I feel like the more you know "Saw" and the more dedicated and knowledgeable you are about the previous 4 installments, the more you will enjoy Saw V. I've heard complaints about the directing of David Hackl, but to me Saw V was VERY well portrayed and executed. Others have said the film was boring, but the real fans surely enjoyed the countless flashbacks and explanations. I still have almost as many questions as I did coming in to the movie, but I am VERY interested in seeing where they go from here. I now rank the Saw films like this: 1. Saw III 2. Saw V 3. Saw I 4. Saw II 5. Saw IVI just know, judging by the events of Saw V, that MANY people will be unsatisfied and turned away with the Saw series, BUT I think this was more of a "catch up" film. The writers tried to catch up a series that was beginning to get ahead of itself. Now we see the events of the previous 4 movies in a totally different light and we can now hopefully move on to the grand finale. The ending WAS unbelievable. It wasn't a series altering twist, but It was truly unbelievable. I do and will forever LOVE Saw V. I put it ahead of Saw I and just behind Saw III. But, as will be the lasting impression for the opinions of Saw V, to each his own.......</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saw V - Where were the Twists!?!!?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Generally the 5th film of a series is awful. Can anyone say Rocky 5 or Halloween 5? Does Saw 5 fall into this pattern as well, well the jury are still out on that one. In my opinion It is better than 4 and still keeps the Saw series at a relatively high standard. However, like saw 4 it is now starting to show signs of ageing and a lack of ideas.I am one of the biggest saw fans your find and am excited for Saw VI, however if saw 4 and 5 are anything to go by that will be the last.The films Main problem which leads to a great deal of disappointment is the ending. For a film which built its whole advertising campaign on the line "You wont believe how it ends" It has not even came close to what it promised. The Twists are so predictable and lazy I had them figured out after 25 minutes! I would of bet my house they were not the twists (due to how obvious they were).Tobin Bell (Jigsaw) having been killed in Saw 3 has given the writers a hard time to find screen time for him, and here lies the problem. I believe Tobin spends about only 5% of the film actually on screen which is a great shame due to the fact he is the Star of the series.On the upside there are some great revelations from previous films and those looking for the classic Saw traps will not be disappointed, however once again I feel the story has moved very little forward and seems like a montage of deleted scenes from previous movies.The film also lacks any real scare moments and I feel some of the performances by the actors involved were no where near the standard of previous films.Taking into account everything I have said Saw V still manages to deliver a worthy addition to the series and is no doubt very enjoyable to watch and die hard saw fans will not be disappointed....That is until the end arrives. I am still trying to figure out where the amazing double twists were that we were promised.Sadly I can only give this film a 7 out of 10. Saw VI is out next year and I hope for the sake of everyone they end the series with the twists and shocks this film never had.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saw V rocks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You won't believe how it ends....or how it beganThe film opens with an EXTREMELY graphic torture scene that involves a pendulum. Seth Baxter plays a very important role to the story. We find out here that he murdered Hoffman's sister. He was sentenced to 20 years, but was let out after 5 due to a technicality prompting Hoffman to create a Jigsaw-like contraption to exact his own brand of justice. This catches the eye of the REAL Jigsaw. We found out in the 4th film that Detective Hoffman (Mandylor) was helping out Jigsaw (Bell) with the murders. Since Jigsaw is now dead, he needed someone to continue his legacy and that is what Mandylor was used for. This time around, Mandylor is now considered a hero because he saves a little girl in the beginning and basically "takes down Jigsaw," even though he is already dead. He becomes the hero but the problem lies in the fact that one of his victims, Agent Strahm (Patterson), makes it out alive, in what I would say is a pretty brutal scene. Strahm makes it is his goal the entire film to piece this together to find out who the accomplice is. He finds out pretty shortly that it has something to do with Hoffman and wants to bring him down. While all of this is occurring, there is a new game being played between five people that are connected. We have Strahm looking for Hoffman, a new jigsaw game and Jigsaw's ex-wife, Jill (Betsy Russell)participating in the fun as well. Throughout the film and we never really figure out her whole deal. Surprisingly, the fifth installment of the series has a nice flow to it and is still able to dish out newly designed horrific torture scenes. It turns out they spit out a very decent torture flick yet again. We meet Brit(Julie Benz),Luba (Meagan Good), Charles (Carlo Rota), Mallick (Greg Byrk), and Ashley (Laura Gordon). They awake to find that they are in neck harnesses and are on a pulley system with sharp blades behind their heads. Jigsaw tells them that they have to work together to get the keys to get loose or they lose their heads and if they can't figure out how to within 5 minutes there are nail bombs also in the corners of the room that will dispose of them if they don't make it out of the room in time. First they argue then do their best to get their keys. The second room displays what looks like a section of an underground sewer. Overhead are jars that hold keys with shapes on them that unlock the drains so that they can get in before the time runs out Again, one doesn't make it. The next room has a tub of water in the center of the room and 5 electrical boxes which the currents need to be stopped in order to open the door in time. The electric cables don't quite reach the tub. With 3 people left by this time, one is sacrificed to get the door open. They were all connected. For someone to get their hands on some property to build upon, they all find out that they had a hand in the deaths of the 8 people that resided in the building and now they are being judged or being given a chance at redemption if you look at it from Jigsaw's point of view. Now, in the last room the last two standing are faced with a new contraption that involves blood and a beaker that has to be filled with 10 pints of blood. This one is SO gruesome that it needs to be seen to be believed! Also they figure out at this time what exactly Jigsaw said back in the first room about working together and they realize that it's too late to turn back now and they perform the last task. Detective Strahm is pursuing Detective Hoffman who he knows is the Jigsaw accomplice. Back in the beginning Strahm finds a tape from Jigsaw basically instructing him NOT to go ahead with his deeper investigation and that if he did that it would be his undoing...which it does. I've noticed quite a few things from these Saw movies....the people being tested NEVER listen or fully comprehend what Jigsaw says until the very end. In this one he instructs the 5 victims to work together to stay alive. In the first room where they wake up in the last 2 figure out that they only needed 1 key to get all of them out because the keys were ALL the same. In the 3rd room with the tub of water and electricity, if they had all worked together to make it to that point they would've gotten a small shock enough to open the door instead of one person taking it all. The last room would have still been brutal, but it would've taken 2 pints from them all to fill up the 10 pint beaker to open the door. Jigsaw gives these people the choice to redeem themselves, but they never quite figure that out...mainly because they end up dead before they do. Jigsaw is DEAD, but his legacy will continue. During the movie we see how Hoffman was trained to take over and we see that he was connected to it all the way back to the first movie. It wasn't the best of the series, but interesting enough to keep any Saw fan intrigued (like me). Just to see the new traps alone is enough to bring me back time and time again. A definite addition to the franchise and a must see for any Saw fan. A gruesome 4 on my "Go See" scale.</fullReview>

I couldn't believe that I wasted 2 hours of my life at this movie. Nothing happens. 2 good gore scenes (1 involving a guy getting cut in half and the other is 2 people have their arms shredded).It did show some insight into how the new jigsaw became himself, but it didn't need more then 10 minutes. It was all just a trailer for Saw 6. I'm waiting for the Saw in Space movie, which should be out by 2012. Maybe a Saw in the Hood movie too.I was a big fan of the first 4, loved how 4 kind of brought them all together, but it kind of ruined this one for me too b/c after watching them all you know what to look out for and the signs of whats going to happen. There was 0 mystery to this, no plot twist, just senseless killing, and if they were going to do that at least kill off a bunch more people in a more gory way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing ending, but good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How much you enjoy Saw 5 really depends on how much you enjoyed the other Saw movies. If, like me, you love the past Saw movies, enjoy their inventive twists, their clever story lines and the great traps, then you will enjoy Saw 5 a great deal (well maybe be a bit disappointed with the ending, more on that later). If you feel sick at the very idea of the traps then Saw 5 is clearly not for you. Saw 5 sticks to a very solid formula. In many ways this is the most original of the Saws. Yes it has the usual amounts of gore, yes Tobin Bell shows up as Jigsaw, despite the fact he is dead. However the movie itself just seems a lot more story focused, seems much more of your average thriller than intent on getting the next person into a violent scenario. This isn't to say the movie is tame, by no means is it tame. Two scenes in the movie are some of the nastiest in the Saw series to date. Two of the traps are very disappointing, nothing really inventive happens with them, but they are still quite clever and never lose your interest. So overall Saw 5 is once again another good entry into a series I really enjoy. However as I said the ending, well it won't impress an awful lot of people. If anything its just a set up for Saw 6, which now has to be made so some answers are given! Cast wise once again this is your typical Saw movie, however this time lead duties have changed hands. No longer is Tobin Bell setting up the traps, instead he is actually dead and relegated to flashbacks. Instead taking reigns as the Jigsaw is Detective Hoffman played by Costas Mandylor. While Mandylor does not have the presence of Bell, he is actually a very good actor. Hoffman is made out to be very multi-layered, and one of his flashback scenes where the pendulum trap takes place, shows what an intriguing character he is. Tobin Bell is amazing once again in his flashback scenes. The scenes he shares with Mandylor are by far the highlights of the movie, especially the scene where Jigsaw converts Hoffman. Scott Patterson gets a lot more screen time this time around, a huge surprise for me who assumed he'd be bumped off in the first five minutes. Patterson's character Strahm is much more interesting this time around, and has a couple of very good sequences. However the rest of the cast are the usual. We get the usually bunch of screamers who just have to die, and the people who enter the traps are as pretty two-dimensional as normal. Hell but I don't care, they die in a nasty fashion, they serve their purpose.Saw 5's storyline is perhaps its highlight, and I know an awful lot of people will disagree. Story wise this is actually quite simple, hence the noticeable lack of any big revelation at the end. Still the storyline sucks you in, much more so than Saw 3 or 4 ever did. In fact for once I found I would have enjoyed the movie to be a bit longer, the storyline just seemed to want to be fleshed out a bit more. Not necessarily with violence, but some more talking, and especially some more Hoffman flashbacks that really interested me. The gore factor is both amped up and lowered a bit with this entry. The opening pendulum trap I have to say is downright nasty to watch. Some of the middle traps, an electricity one especially, do not live up to what they could have been. But the final traps, especially a particularly nasty one with saws, is really inventive yet really nasty as well. Still ending wise I did feel a bit blank, and this is definitely a movie I will have to revisit. The ending itself has a semi-twist, its interesting, and could develop out quite nicely in later films. But in comparison to the legendary twist from the original Saw you do feel a bit disappointed.Overall Saw 5 is probably my middle favourite of the Saw movies. It nowhere near up to the standard of Saw 2 and the original, but it is a lot better than Saw 3, and probably on about the same level as Saw 4. As I've said not everyone will like Saw 5, but I personally found it great entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saw V Review from a Die-Hard Saw Fan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw V is by far the weakest of any of the movies in this series. This movie provides nothing that we as an audience did not already know. A majority of this movie is simply the background of Agent Hoffman's involvement with Jigsaw. Most of the scenes in this movie are completely irrelevant and seem to have been thrown in at the last moment in order to take up one and a half hours. The ultimate game with the 5 people is totally unnecessary. These people are completely unrelated to anything that happened in this movie or any of the previous Saw movies (though I'm sure that in Saw VI they will definitely make up some BS reason that these people were chosen). Also, the relationship of the people chosen is not as strong as that of the people chosen in Saw II. The tagline for this movie is utterly ridiculous because it promises something to us Saw fans, and we do not receive anything from it. A great end to the story? If you call that ending great, you need to be thrown into one of Jigsaws traps (preferrably from the first 4 movies). On that note, I will talk about the "traps". What were these people thinking when they made those traps? They were beyond ridiculous and do not even seem like true Jigsaw traps. Every room included a bomb, for what reason? No one really knows, but they are just there. Agent Strahm's trap was not really cleaver at all, though his escape was. For us true Saw fans, we are also let down yet again about the questions:"Where is Doctor Gordon?" and "What was written in Amanda's letter?". In fact, they decided to add a new question to the mix: "What was in the box?" I wonder if they are just trying to make a pile of questions and then make one movie of simply explaining everything that was unexplained in the previous movies(because Saw V definitely did not answer anything for me.) I cannot believe that these horror geniuses would actually release a movie of such awful magnitudes. I rated Saw V a 2/10 based on the sole reason that it is, in fact, a part of the Saw series.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I totally wasn't in a big hurry, in fact even a bit reluctant, to watch this fifth installment in the already washed-up "Saw" franchise, but here I was lying in my lazy couch with a free borrowed copy and nothing better to do, so what the hell? But actually I'm glad now to have seen it, as number five finally is a reasonably inspired, involving and suspenseful horror movie again. Perhaps the series simply needed a change of director. Darren Lynn Bousman, responsible for films two to four, moved on to directing the fantastic (and I really do mean fantastic) "Repo: the Genetic Opera" whilst newcomer David Hackl provides the "Saw" cycle with a more than welcome breath of fresh air. The film immediately gained a few points extra to personally, as it opens with a wonderfully gruesome homage to Edgar Allen Poe's legendary tale of "The Pit and the Pendulum". This is one of the first genre films to use a pendulum as a sadistic murder weapon since those classic movies from the 60's, so I really appreciated that. The actual story is a lot better as well, since it doesn't exclusively revolve on the character of John "Jigsaw" Kramer anymore. Jigsaw developed from a sick killer into some kind of wise prophet, with his endless speeches about the value of life and remission, but he was really just a pathetic old man who couldn't swallow the fact he was terminally ill and the majority of people he encountered in life were not! He's dead in the fifth film ? really dead ? but continues to appear in flashbacks, as he still had the time and patience to fully train a successor. Officer Mark Hoffman was supposed to be the sole survivor of Jigsaw's last perverted murder game and be the big hero who stopped the killer. Against all odds, however, agent Strahm also managed to save himself and thinks there's something suspicious about the hero status of Hoffman. He begins a private investigation and gradually discovers that John Kramer taught Hoffman how to become a 'redeemer' ever since the latter tried to accuse Jigsaw of a murder that he committed himself. Meanwhile, Jigsaw junior is also in the middle of his first massively staged torture game. Somewhere in a sinister labyrinth, five people that are somehow connected to each other are subjected to some sadistic and inescapable death traps. The character of Hoffman is more plausible and fascinating than that other Jigsaw pupil Amanda (Shawnee Smith) and particularly the sub plots are exciting. The cat and mouse game between Strahm and Hoffman is interwoven with the ordeals from the quintet that is continuously decreasing in number. The gore is great but extreme and definitely not suitable for people with a weak stomach. Director Hackl keeps a strict control over his story lines and characters (unlike in the fourth film, which was a gigantic mess) and even manages to insert some moments of authentic terror. The climax scene, for example, is truly amazing. Perhaps there's still some hope for the "Saw" saga, although it will probably never become my favorite horror franchise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saw 5 the best of the series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's that time of year again for another round of Saw. After leaving SAW 5 I was quite impressed with it. The acting was so good the actors could receive an Oscar. As I was watching the movie I thought the ending might be very predictable. However, in the end I was wrong in figuring it out.If the anyone from the Academy Awards of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is reading this that SAW 5 is not to be unnoticed for Best Picture. Unlike the previous films this one was very well written, very well acted,and very well made. I still don't understand the tagline of the movie.I was reading articles on IMDb.com about the movie and one of them said that the movie series has been losing money since Saw 3. All I have to say is if that's the case then why did last Halloween the Saw series set record for being the first Horror franchise to have three successful sequels according to EW.If Movie doesn't do well this weekend it will most likely be because of High School Musical 3 and some of it will be because of the bad economy. I can't wait to see Saw 6.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just want to know what was in the black box because they never showed or said anything about it. And I wanna know how the heck john is back alive again?? Hopefully they will tell in number 6. i am excited i loved this movie. i own all the others ones too..amazing =] Does anyone know the answer to my question? And i thought it was pretty cool how in 5 they re caped everything. I think you have to watch the others though before you watch this one. I am really glad this movie came out. A lot of my friends doubted that they would be good because there were so many. Well like i said before i am really really excited for number six and i don't know what else they can think of.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A slightly more sharper sequel, but no where near perfect.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whether or not i was just going soft is one thing. Or whether it was because Julie Benz was in it is another. Or it could just be that SAW has gone back to its roots in the fifth installment into the horror series. Whatever it is, Saw V was surprisingly better than expected. Better than the previous 2 installments anyway. While it seemed after the "Saw II" the sequels were getting more average each time, with the amounts of gore also increasing per film, so with that in mind, the likeliness of "Saw V" being worse than the previous ones, seemed more than certain. But like mentioned before, the writers have gone back the roots of the first film, and ditching excessive gore for a richer storyline. Although it's far from perfect, it gives a deeper insight and develops a stronger backbone to the Saw legacy. Even though at times, it does make you question 'how much is left to chance' While having said that, it seems what we had learned from the previous films (in particular Saw 1, 2, 3) quickly become irrelevant when we discover the secret of another apprentice and with that the memories of the psychotic Amanda Young (Shawnee Smith) begin to fade. Tobin Bell returns once again to the roll that has no doubt made him famous. However, his presence isn't quite as strong as it used to be now that Jigsaw is as dead as he'll ever be. As much as 'Saw' tells the story of Jigsaw and his line of work, there's only so many flashbacks you can do, before you begin to ask What else is new?? One of the things The Saw films have been praised for, is its knack for using intelligent and shocking twists to finish off the film, this here is what Saw V lacks also. Thats the problem of making it an "Origin" film, it doesn't leave a whole lot of options to play with. When the twist is unfolding (Helped with iconic "Hello Zepp" by Charlie Couser beginning to play), due to the predictability its sufficient to say- there is hardly a twist at all. While fans may be disappointed with the lack of gore, audiences that would rather enjoy a compelling mystery (much like the first one) will be in for a treat. My only fear is that audience is long gone, with most SAW fans only in it for the gore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I adore this movie, It has everything you need easy to follow, good twists, gore, story line. its What you get with saw and more....You need to see all other saw movies first but why would you go see 5 if not, Traps well thought out, OK yes no-one will learn from jigsaw ever, if you do what he says chances are hey-ho your alive And well who'd go see that? At one point in the movie your thinking where the hell does that fit now because he's dead 5 min later you find out, It has got back flash's like saw 4 but the way there looping the films together is amazing what other film does that? Nightmare on elm street he can keep dying hes in your dream...how many movie did they have 100's Saw has links, i don't understand why this film is getting bad reviews if you've seen all other saws it makes sense if not go back and watch them.I nearly gave in after 2 i think its the worst one but carried on loved 3, 4 was hit and miss 5 is all there faultless!

		<shortDescription>Great game of "cat and mouse"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all my high ratings of all of these films is based more on the fact that I think they are strong installments for the horror/suspense genre as opposed to being fantastic films for their cinematography etc. Second, before you see SAW V it might be a good idea to brush up on your SAW knowledge including SAW IV. I felt that SAW V was not only gory and all that good stuff, but it was a great game of cat and mouse between characters, and really ties the first four movies together. At this point I can not think of any loose ends that are out there for the film makers to explain any further, and we as viewers have been told the whole story. Realisticaly this film rates around a 6.5 for me but for the horror genre it is great. Enjoy, it really wraps the whole series of films together well, you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You are trapped in your seat watching Saw V. You are warned that if you try to escape half your face will be cut by a cleaver. Do you risk it? Yes. By all means, risk it. Tis better to be 'cleved' than to die of boredom.The plug has been pulled on the Saw franchise.Their ads proclaim, "You won't believe how it ends" YES, you will, and not only that but you will see it coming from a mile away. That is the ear-mark of this entry of the Saw franchise, which is lifeless and unengaging.Admist the jump-cut narrative a pool of flashbacks incoherently impeds the story which is frail to begin with. The acting is by far the worst of the lot. Characters Straham and Hoffman are just not engaging enough, nor are the captives/fodder compelling enough -- certainly not without the presences of Jigsaw, himself, dead since part 3.Midway through I asked myself, how can torture porn be tedious? You will see a lot more coming than you think, figuring out the twists with the traps is child's play this time around. The whole film lacks the all too important tension and sadistic pathos we've come to expect and appreciate.The set up for part six is so (yawn). Jill opens a box. I can guess what's in there and who the killer is going to be. So will you.This saw will make you ZZZZzzzzzz!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better but Boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw V (2008) ** (out of 4) This film picks up right after the previous two with Detective Hoffman (Costas Mandylor) being looked at as a hero for finally killing Jigsaw (Tobin Bell). FBI agent Strahm (Scott Patterson) isn't so sure because he feels Jigsaw had a partner and perhaps Hoffman was him. Okay, so this film is certainly better than the previous one but this time out we're left with an incredibly boring movie. I enjoyed the first three, thought the fourth was horrid but this one here falls somewhere in the middle but it might be the one I'd revisit last just because of how tired I got while watching it. We're let in on what's going on early in the film so I'm not sure what surprise or turns this film is meant to be taking during the final forty-five minutes or so. Perhaps I just figured it out too easily but either way this movie left me yawning throughout, which is never a good thing. While the FBI agent tries to figure out what's going on we're introduced to five new characters who will be playing the game put on by Jigsaw. This of course means new ways to torture but all five games were just as boring as the story. The only mildly interesting one was at the start of the film with a pendulum. The rest of the tricks were rather tiresome and not too much thought was put into them as they're basically reworked stuff that we've seen in earlier films. Gore hounds will love the blood and guts being thrown around but for me it's time to give them up and try to build a better story. The performances are about average of what you'd find in this type of film, although I'll give Bell credit for his good turn as Jigsaw in his few scenes. In the end there really isn't too much to say about this film other than I hope the next one brings a little more energy to the series. I put a lot of the blame on the screenplay for going for cheap twists and turns and a director who obviously couldn't put much life into it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another great Saw film but you will need to be a fan of the series to fully get it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw V starts after the events of Saw III (2006) &amp; Saw IV (2007) as the gory &amp; bloody aftermath of Jigsaw's (Tobin Bell) latest games are discovered, detective Mark Hoffman (Costas Mandylor) is one of three survivors &amp; is hailed as a hero although FBI agent Strahm (Scott Patterson) isn't so sure after narrowly avoiding death from one of Jigsaw's games himself. With his partner Perez dead &amp; detective Hoffman surviving with nothing more than a few bruises Strahm becomes suspicious, after some investigation Strahm believes he has proof that Jigsaw had an inside accomplice &amp; sets out to bring that person to justice. Meanwhile five strangers wake up in a dark room wearing collars attached to razor blades, for them this is the start of Jigsaw's latest game of rehabilitation as they try to survive his deadly traps...This Canadian American co-production was directed by David Hackl &amp; was the fifth entry in the popular Saw franchise, I have to say that I am a bit of a fan of this series with it's mix of extreme gore &amp; torture along with some neat twist's &amp; turns that at times transcend across the whole series rather than just a single film so it's no great surprise to say that I really liked Saw V. Like a lot of horror films Saw V is annoyingly available in both an 'R' rated cut &amp; an 'Unrated' director's cut I am not sure which one I saw as I don't know the differences but I wouldn't imagine there's too much difference between the two. The script continues the story started way back in the original Saw (2004) &amp; it's sequels, in fact if you haven't seen any of the other Saw films then Saw V will not make a whole of sense as it follows on directly from Saw III &amp; Saw VI as well as referencing Saw II (2005). Saw V like the other sequels plays around with creating secondary plots around the events of the other films &amp; trying to link &amp; weave them all together, sure it can be confusing if you haven't seen the other films &amp; it's contrived &amp; unlikely but there's plenty going on &amp; I am more than up for the challenge of working it out. I mean I for one will praise a horror franchise you actually have to sit down, consider &amp; think about. Saw V is both a complex thriller with a good if somewhat abrupt twist that has a few other little unresolved sub-plots that will surely be addressed in any further sequels &amp; an often gruesome horror with some nasty set-pieces. The traps are fewer in number than previous films but they are just as memorable, the character's are decent enough &amp; I personally think it does all tie together quite nicely although it's obvious it's a work in progress in need of a further sequel.Like the previous Saw films there's some cool traps &amp; ideas here, I love the opening one with a huge swinging pendulum that literally slices someone in two &amp; is an obviously gory take on a similar scene in the Edgar Allen Poe novel Pit and the Pendulum. In fact this pendulum scene is one of my favourite sequences from the entire series with intestines &amp; blood flying everywhere as a guy is sliced in two. Other memorable gore highlights include a cool decapitation, someone is crushed with arms breaking in two, someones mutilated body is seen after being blown up &amp; an extremely painful &amp; wince inducing part when someone has to put their hands into a band saw &amp; chop their hands up. Just the mere thought of having to do this &amp; how much pain it would cause is enough to get to anyone, it even made me cringe a little bit. As expected the special effects are impressive &amp; the CGI is thankfully kept to a minimum. There is some tension &amp; suspense during the trap scenes but it's not scary as such.With a supposed budget of about $10,800,000 Saw V did great at the box-office taking over $30,000,000 in it's opening Halloween 2008 weekend. Again like the previous films this was shot in Toronto, Ontario in Canada. The production values are high &amp; it looks pretty good throughout which proves you don't need hundred plus million budgets &amp; big name stars to make successful films. The acting is good enough, there are lots of little cameos &amp; references to character's from the previous films if you look &amp; listen out.Saw V continues where Saw III &amp; Saw VI left off, it again tries to weave more story around existing plots &amp; does a good job, there's plenty of torture &amp; gore which is essential in my opinion &amp; while the final twist isn't as elaborate as before it still works a treat &amp; surely it's part of the set-up for the already in production Saw IV (2009)? If you like the series you will like Saw V, if not you won't &amp; it's as simple &amp; straight forward as that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stop making Saw movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was talked into going to see this movie (for free, no way will the Saw franchise get another cent of mine after the first movie). More of the same. Shock. Gore. Blood. Bad acting. Deep scratchy voices. Though, surprisingly, they were actually able to come up at least an ounce of a story.I've only seen the first one, and then the 2nd version of the first one they released a year later. In this one you could really tell that they're cranking these things out at 1 per year. Some of the dialogue and wording was just so bad. It's like they used the very first copy of the script without any further edits before shooting. I feel deeply sorry for anybody that is captivated by the Saw series. Seek cinematic therapy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Necessary Installment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First before anything, I must say that I recommend not seeing this movie until you are completely aware that Saw VI was already green-lit.Saw V will probably leave many fan disappointed, though the film is necessary to the series. Saw (1) could've been a standalone, but since the movie developed into the franchise it is today, many loose ends had to be tied up. IV helped bring many of those loose ends together. This movie does not disappoint in that regard.This installment deviates from the previous formula of many of the Saw movies. Yes, there are traps. But once you see the film, you will see how many could walk out upset. In order, however, to transition on and continue the series as the studio has already indicated, this film had to be made in the manner it was. While it may not be as visually pleasing as you had hoped, the story will become obviously paramount to the franchise come the week before Halloween, 2009, when Saw VI drops.I expect this movie to have little success in comparison to IV because it is not as visually pleasing as one requests when seeing a Saw. But I believe if anyone sees this movie realizing the VI is going to happen, they will understand that Saw V is a good movie, and necessary to keep the franchise moving without leaving major loopholes (though loopholes do allow for further twists...).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Was it good, meh, I'd say so But was it 'saw' good? No.People come to see these movies for pretty much 3 reasons. The twist, the gore, and jigsaw (because he's such a BADA**).The twist, well, there is really only one twist, or at least only one that had the music playing in the background (which usually signifies the big twist). But it wasn't that good, it made sense and was kind of cool I guess, but everything was given to you. I guess I'm not being that descriptive right now, so let me put it this way. You know how it's fun to watch the saw movies again because you get to pick up on things you missed, there aren't many things that are missed.The gore, compared to the other saws, this should have been rated PG. The grossest (and I must say very cool) part was 5 minutes into the movie. The rest of the gore is suggestive, or really quick.Jigsaw, he's not really in this movie, which is a real bummer. And when they do show jigsaw, it's not about jigsaw. Everything he reveals or takes part in is just giving back-up/history to Hoffman. To put it short, they never just have Jigsaw being Jigsaw.Did I like the story line, yeah, The 5 people in a trap fulfilled part of what I was looking for. And the one twist, thought worse than the rest of them, was creative nonetheless.Should you see saw? If you are a fan of the series, then yes, you can't miss it. But if you just want to catch a flick with some friends, I suggest High School Musical 3.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm predicting this movie to be a little above par donating $5 to the $7.50 popcorn bucket on my website. With each sequel that comes out, the relationship with the characters diminishes, and we lose some of the intimacy that we felt in the original film. With these genres, the sequels tend to depend to much on upping the blood and gore, and less on the original story. Come visit at www.PopcornOnline.net. We have officially gone "SAW" all this week offering pictures, articles, and speculation on the upcoming film.

		<fullReview>Honestly this franchise is going beyond the limit. I really liked the twist in the end of the first two saws and they are the main reason why I liked them but the third was a bit disappointing because it was like a recap of the first two and the twist wasn't amazing. The forth wasn't necessary and was the worst out of all of them.I seen Saw 5 because I thought they may change all the mistakes they made but Saw 5 is a lame excuse to make money. The tag-line is "You Won't Believe How It Ends" but I can't believe that this franchise has no end because Saw 5 is now the worst out of all of them. This one takes a new route and goes to nowhere with a new story (if there was a story) and tries really hard to bring the franchise back on its feet (which it failed to do).The traps where O.K but I prefer a good story and I was actually waiting for the ending hoping that the twist may save the poor and boring movie. There where 2 twists and they where both atrocious. Saw 5 doesn't even put the audience in the situation that the victims are in just like Saw 1 &amp; 2, I'm not a Saw fan anyway but the fans may like it and I'm sure that Saw 6 will even be worse than this so I'll just wait for Saw 20 in Halloween 2023 and hope that will be the last one.</fullReview>
