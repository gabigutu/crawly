		<shortDescription>Sand: A metaphor for "usualness" generating "mental inertia."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In early 1966, when the annual Oscar nominations for best director of the year were announced, Teshigahara might have even made a wry smile. What is surprising to me today is not that a Japanese filmmaker almost unknown in the US was nominated, but that the Motion Picture Academy in 1966 had such a keen aesthetic sense as to appreciate his radical work. "Woman in the Dunes" (Suna no onna) was far ahead of its time, radiating Absolute Beauty.An entomologist (Eiji Okada) seeks lodging for the night in the dunes, and is led by the villagers to the bottom of a sandpit where he finds a widow (Kyoko Kishida) living in a shack. Next morning he discovers he can no longer climb out. He is expected to remain there and to live with the woman, who needs a man's help. Because the sand drifts into the shack without cease, shoveling sand away from the sandpit is her primary daily routine. After all attempts to escape the situation fail, he becomes accustomed to it and finds another way of life.It is almost meaningless to try to ascertain any scientific or economic logic beneath the surface of this allegorical story (written by Kobo Abe). Such hairsplitting will only make you lose the merit of this work. The primary subject of the story seems to lie in a certain passive mentality to be called "mental inertia," mental acclimation, conformity, or something like that. "Mental inertia" is caused by "usualness" (or "dailiness"), and comes to dominate the subconscious in due course. Abe and Teshigahara metaphorically depict such "usualness" as the character of sand -- usualness formed in an unusual situation.The woman has a strong mental attachment to the status quo around her; despite the cruel fact that the sand has killed her husband and daughter, she prefers to stay there and not to change her life. This is the "mental inertia" of the work. The entomologist, too. He at first thinks the whole situation surrounding the woman absurd, and tries to escape it. However, he becomes accustomed to the situation day by day, and accepts such absurdity after all. By whom is he forced to do so? The villagers? No. Himself! He chooses to return to the sandpit and stay there even when he becomes free to leave. He becomes a captive in the dunes by "mental inertia" just as he has been in the city.After seeing this work, I came to feel that many variants of "invisible sand," which might dominate our "free will," are drifting and accumulating around us without cease, whether or not we realize it.Pictures are great. The sand is living here, showing various expressions. Surely it "acts" as a main character in several impressive scenes, including an unforgettable love scene where the couple is caked with it.And, music! -- if we may call this incomparable sound work so. It not only enhances each scene fully, but also gives life to things that are not expressed in image alone. From barbaric drum music through sensual sound like the sand's "breathing," Takemistu-sound is full of imagination and magic.A perfect fusion of Image, Sound, and Subject. See "Woman in the Dunes" and die.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This classic film is one of the few to still live up to the name of "perfect film". Everything in the film is perfectly controlled and at the same time so natural. The story involves an amateur entomologist captured in a giant sand pit somewhere on the coast of a small Japanese island. He tries to escape but a mysterious woman and some nasty villagers keep pulling him back in.Despite being made in the early sixties this film still packs a dose of eroticism that most contemporary filmmakers pray to achieve. The black and white cinematography is absolutely haunting (watch out for poor video copies which are way too dark, there is a new DVD out which shows what the original print intended)This is about as close as you can get to a perfect film. There is nothing that could ever be improved upon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An extraordinary movie that you won't EVER forget!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Woman In The Dunes' is a superb film adaptation of a fascinating novel by Kobo Abe. Abe was heavily influenced by Kafka and wrote several very strange and unforgettable books, but this was his masterpiece. He scripted the movie himself, and the director Hiroshi Teshigahara obviously "got" the material, so the film is also a masterpiece. It includes some of the most striking visual imagery I've ever seen, and I would have to say this movie is among the very best I've watched. Yes, it's THAT good. The two leads (Eija Okada and Kyoko Kishida) both give superb performances and there are some genuinely erotic (though not explicit) scenes between them. Okada plays an insect collector on holiday who finds himself stranded overnight in the country. Kishida is a local woman who agrees to lodge him for the night. However she lives in most unusual circumstances - in a shack surrounded by sand dunes which continually invade her home. To say anything more about what happens would be to spoil the extraordinary movie that follows. You can read it as an allegory or take it as a filmed nightmare, it's up to you, but believe me you won't EVER forget 'Woman In The Dunes'!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spellbinding and creepy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd wanted to see this movie for years, and finally got around to it, on DVD. What a treat! I was glad to discover that the erotic element, though important, is not the predominant draw here; typically, some references to the film make it sound as though it were some forbidden erotic romp, or full of perverse sexuality. Instead I found myself wrapped up in a creepy suspense-thriller sci-fi-fantasy carried off with wit, style, and extraordinarily interesting photography (including one scene that, at least on my set, was completely black for a couple of minutes).I voted "nine" for this wonderful film, in part because it left me with a lot to think about, in part just for how well it was made. The music by Toru Takemitsu is absolutely perfect for the task, too.This is just about my favorite kind of film: one that raises important questions about human life, but not at the expense of entertainment. It's as close as I'll probably ever come to having my cake and eating it, too.Update, January 2007: I finally obtained my own DVD of this film, one with much higher quality photographic reproduction. I now marvel even more at the extraordinarily creative photography. Be sure, if you view this on DVD, not to boost your set's brightness: I can assure you the film is very, very dark on purpose. If possible, see it on a high-definition monitor. Today, I'd vote "ten."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zen and the City</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my interpretation this movie is a reflection on Zen philosophy: Just like Zen monks that sweep the courtyards of monasteries and devote themselves to the most humble tasks to find inner harmony, Niki finds inner rest in the daily work of removing the sand, solving water supply problems and living a confined live. The movie suggests the modern lives we live in the big cities isolate us from our needs and ourselves. Just like a Zen garden, that is designed to mirror nature and men, the people in the dunes reflect our daily struggles and confinements. The surreal setting is a necessity to convey the message of the film. There is nothing goofy about the pits and how people behave in there. It is just hard for us western people to see the transcendence there. I watched this movie on a Japanese Film Festival in Berlin in 1993. I can't remember all the details but the movie really mesmerized me. It is a very unique work and I wonder why it doesn't have the cult status of other movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best film analysis of existentionalism.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harsh and beautiful analysis of existentionalism. All the Sartrean trappings along with an element of Camus are presented in this film better than any other I know. The realization that life is absurd leads the main character to venture towards trying to make meaning out of what is essentially meaninglessness. The intersubjective relationship between man and woman is examined both erotically and violently while the villagers play the crucial role of the everpresent Other. Disturbing ending only underlies the overpowering presence of the sand dunes. The sand being the strongest metaphor in the film, illustrating the belief that life is nothing but a giant and endless egg-timer flowing sand down upon us. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.Here is the rare example where knowledge of the filmmaker enhances the enjoyment of the work. At least that is true for this North American.Teshigahara was one of a now large class of intellectuals rooted in Japanese traditions but seriously exploring fusion with `western' ideas -- ideas about abstraction, narrative and perception. That class is large now, but was very small in the early sixties, the superficial intoxication with postwar, promiscuous exploration of western style having by then been abandoned.It borrows heavily from what Teshigahara thought was the Nabokov style: pervasive symbolism, floating perspectives on reality, self-imposed confinement. The notion of `bugs' and collecting is a bow to Nabokov himself who was rather famous in butterfly circles.(The few mazelike drawings in the title sequence almost certainly influenced Greenaway's `A Walk through H' which explores most of the same notions from the same perspective.)I saw this first in 1965 and was awed. This film is anti-Kurosawan -- the philosophy used for the camera eye is opposite from Kurosawa's. Kurosawa's notion revolved around a wholeness. Each shot was composed as a harmonious unit -- the action of a bystander in the background was as important (more!) than that of the foreground. No such differentiation was made between foreground and background. It was all of one whole.Teshigahara's eye is different. He makes a clear distinction between the two characters and the environment. (The villagers are part of the environment.) As much attention is given to the dynamics of each separately. Much is made of the annoyance each causes the other. Transitions between skin (usually the woman's) and the surface of the sand are not to note a symmetry, but a dis-symmetry.This is very much in line with the famous school of icheban (flower arrangement) that Teshigahara's father founded (and which Teshigahara himself later headed). Traditional icheban has always depended on the `missing center,' the implied elements whose absence is as important as those present. This new school makes that more explicit, with radical assymetries among placed elements. What is seen is made more important by what they imply, which is a quite different matter than implication by absence. Inference by presence rather than inference by absence. Radical in that day -- and it fits in a rough way with mature notions of western narrative symbolism, where certain things represent others, especially Nabokov's notion of frangible, constructed symbolism. That means that each symbol's meaning does not come from context and culture (as many would later and popularly claim) but from the mind of the narrator existing in the mind of the reader.Twenty years later Teshigahara made a documentary on the architect Gaudi. Gaudi is the one architect who exploits this same notion of inferred reality. This is worth watching. And Teshigahara is worth learning about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant tale of the changing Japan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I get more and more impressed with the classics of Japanese cinema and this is def a highlight. Mesmerizing and artsy it portrays a etymologist and 'the woman of the dunes' trapped in sand. The trap itself obviously symbolizes the trap a certain desert beetle digs to lie in the midst of it waiting for prey which cannot help but sliding into it. Its the same for him, he cant climb the sand walls, the more he struggles the more the sand runs a little like the woman who in fear of the outside continues her sisyfosan existence.The psychology between the two is excellently depicted. The tension is intensified trough images of sweaty skin and running sand. The cinematographer is a master in filming this. Lots of black. Editing also is sharp and very well done. Sound is minimal and fits the images' bleak and deserted dunes.Much can be said about this movie, it is one for repeated viewings for sure.</fullReview>

While other movies rely on acting, or emotion to capture the audience this movie is very special because how the director, and the screenwriter(kobe abe, also wrote a book by the same title), let the viewers develop their own ideas and perspectives. Having seen this movie with other people and looking at different comment about the movie, each person had a different opinion of the movie. In a complex world full of vice, and danger, it is sometimes the simplest things that can make a man beg for mercy. The everlasting sand, can bring you to love, or to destruction...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is there any meaning in the world? We see a man who has fled from his meaningless job in Tokyo to gather beetles in a remote desert. If he finds a unique beetle, he will get his name in the insect book. This will bring meaning to his life. Instead, he is tricked into spending the night with a woman in a sand pit. She lives in a slave labor village shoveling sand from the bottom of her pit to keep from being submerged in blowing sand. The most memorable scene of the film occurs near the end, after several escape attempts, he finds that the jailers have mistakenly left the rope ladder down into the pit. He climbs out and sees the ocean crashing onto the desert, the same ocean for which he has been begging to see for years. But he looks around, looks at the ocean for a few seconds, and calmly retreats to the pit. Where was he to go? His life in Tokyo was certainly not more fulfilling than that in the pit. He was lost in the desert, and the ocean had lost it's appeal. He had become his own jailer, for his pit was certainly no worse of a jail than the rest of his life had been. After seven years and repeated failed escape attempts, the man accepts his fate. He has brought new meaning to his life by discovering a way to pump water into a barrel from the sand. My friends and I debated for an hour whether his pride in his invention was pitiful or triumphant. Does one take pride in an interesting but mundane achievement in a world without meaning, or does one reject false salvation? After all, he's still stuck doing slave labor in the pit. Watch this movie with friends and you will have endless hours of discussion. A film that reinvents itself in each individual's mind, as great cinema should.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Haunting Parable of Survival Among the Rational and the Primitive Amid Enveloping Sand Dunes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like Robert Bresson's "Au Hasard Balthazar", Hiroshi Teshigahara's 1964 existential allegory can be a challenge to sit through if you are not prepared to be swept away by its elliptical profundities. Written for the screen by Kobo Abe based on his 1962 novel, the surreal, highly symbolic story focuses on an amateur entomologist on what he thinks is a day trip from Tokyo to a seaside area with vast and immense sand dunes. As he looks for a particular beetle that he thinks will bring him fame within scientific circles, he loses track of time and misses the last bus back to the city. Local villagers come upon him and take him to a woman who can provide overnight lodging. As it turns out, she lives in the bottom of a sand pit reachable only by a rope ladder. With the ladder gone the next morning, it dawns on him that he is being held captive by the villagers.From this revelation, Teshigahara and Abe focus on how the man deals with the situation and his evolving feelings toward the woman. In order to survive, she reveals that she shovels sand all night for the local construction company in exchange for weekly rations that are dropped into the pit by a pulley. Meanwhile, the sand takes a life of its own as it encroaches upon their existence in ways most unexpected. Already well known from Alain Resnais' "Hiroshima Mon Amour" (1959) and starring opposite Marlon Brando in 1963's "The Ugly American", Eiji Okada dominates every scene of the movie as the emotionally volatile entomologist evolving from sexist entitlement to humiliating desperation to serene resignation. As a representation of supposedly civilized rational thought amid the primitive surroundings, it's a masterful if sometimes overripe turn where only the sand threatens to upstage him.As the woman, the offbeat-looking Kyôko Kishida initially seems to be playing Friday to Okada's Robinson Crusoe, but her character starts to reveal layers that startle and fill in necessary plot details. Their relationship becomes highly charged with several scenes that move mercurially between violent and erotic, the capper being a harrowing, Lord of the Flies-type of public act in front of the villagers. Hiroshi Segawa's black-and-white cinematography is nothing short of amazing with memorable vivid images such as the abstract patterns of the dunes, the skin textures flecked with sand granules, and the off-kilter shot compositions that amplify the sheer oddness of the circumstance. The film's overall unnerving tone often makes it feel like an extended episode of a "Twilight Zone", and Toru Takemitsu's unsettling music adds to the eerie atmosphere.Made for less than $100K, Teshigahara's film was such an art-house hit that he received an unexpected Oscar nomination for Best Director alongside the mainstream likes of Robert Wise ("The Sound of Music"), David Lean ("Doctor Zhivago") and William Wyler ("The Collector"). Currently available only as part of a box set from the Criterion Collection, "Three Films By Hiroshi Teshigahara", the 2007 DVD contains the full 148-minute director's cut (twenty minutes were cut when initially released for international audiences) and a helpful video essay by film historian James Quandt. Be forewarned that the film will feel overlong for the uninitiated, especially since most of the action takes place between two people in a sand pit, but this is a worthwhile cinematic achievement by any stretch of the imagination.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow pacing, yet intensly gripping!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What is heralded as a classic piece of Japanese cinema and I suppose a rave at Cannes during it's time, Woman In the Dunes is a great film but certainly not to everyones tastes.A man who is searching for a unique insect in a sandy dessert area ends up trapped in a sandpit where a young woman lives. It becomes apparant that while the man can not escape the woman decides this is her future and that there is little she can do but accept it.The film is an old black and white film, and many a times it is hard to see what is going on. The story is slow paced, and there is a lot of confusion through much of the film as to why the characters are in this 'unusual' situation. However, I completely got into it and was absorbed by the man who was felt trapped like an animal, and the woman who was accepting of her fate and somewhat comfortable. Also the shots of the dunes are spectacular, the film feels totaly claustrophobic, and it's one of this films which you keep asking yourself every 5 minutes, "How the heck did the film this!?".But because of its slow nature and somewhat snail pacing and payoff many might not like it. Too bad.Rating 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Parable About Human Existence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hiroshi Teshigahara, adapting a novel by Kôbô Abe, has created a movie that portrays human existence with all the horror, irony and sensitivity that only a great artist can. It is so easy to reduce existence to a mere isolated concept, but few movies like Woman In The Dunes show the many angles from which our lives can and must be read.Before becoming a parable about human existence, however, this movie begins simply with an amateur entomologist looking for insects in sand dunes. He's on a three-day vacation and left Tokyo for a bit of peace in the countryside. Furthermore, he hopes to one day find a unique species of insect and get his name on a field guide. Then a local villager convinces him to spend the night and takes him to a decrepit house inside a sand pit; the entomologist gets there through a rope ladder and enjoys the woman's hospitality, although he finds her strange for shoveling sand into buckets all night. In the next morning he's all ready to leave but the rope ladder is gone and he realizes that he's trapped and doomed to help the woman shovel sand into buckets forever, in return for rations.There's a Greek myth, of King Sysiphus punished to carry a boulder up a slope only for it to fall down every time he was about to reach the top. It was a futile task but Sysiphus never stopped. Surely Kobo Abe got inspiration from this myth to create his story of a couple forever fighting sand dunes that continue to collapse and slide down, always threatening to devour their house and them too. The work is futile but must be done; and can't we say the same about life in general, which is fated to end sooner or later without us ever understand its purpose? Actors Eiji Okada and Kyôko Kishida (the woman in the pit) almost carry this movie alone on their shoulders. When one thinks about it, there isn't much about this movie except for two people talking and doing things. The entomologist is a person of action, decided not to give up and always planning escapes. The woman is resigned and toils because there's nothing else to do, she knows no other life.Their relationship is strange and constantly in flux: there are moments of intimacy (this movie is extremely erotic and shows some of the most beautiful nudity in a movie I've ever seen), there's tension between them, there's violence and tears. One of my favorite scenes, and one of the most disturbing in this or in any other movies, is when the entomologist asks the villagers to let him climb up the pit once in a while to walk. The villagers agree but only if he has sex with the woman in front of them - he thinks for long seconds and then tries to rape her, much to the entertainment of the villagers, looking down as if it were a show. It's a difficult scene that both actors pull off and shows how low the entomologist is able to sink in his loss of humanity.Finally I must speak about the sand. When we think of sand in cinema, we probably think of the deserts in Lawrence of Arabia. In that fine movie the sand is decoration, it's part of the location. But here it's a character in itself - it's alive, it slides, it kills, it's beautiful, it's unpredictable, it's omnipresent. The director spends a lot of time filming sand in all its behaviors. The characters never once forget it, they're always blowing it away or dusting it off their bodies.Woman In The Dunes is one of those movies that one has the chance of discovering from time to time and leaves one in awe at its simplicity of plot but complexity of emotions. It's very much a perfect movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A haunting existentialist parable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hiroshi Teshigahara's "Woman in the Dunes" is truly a unique movie. It's about an entomologist who goes on a holiday, only to find himself trapped in huge sand pit with a woman. The woman has no will to get out of the sand (it's been "broken"--like that of a stable horse--no doubt), but he refuses to live a "meaningless" life in the sand pit (like the woman). He tries to get out, but it's all in vain: the wall of sand is an impenetrable barrier between him and his "freedom." And so the story goes. The sand pit, I guess, is a metaphor for humanity's existentialist plight. Like the mythological Sisyphus, who was condemned for eternity to roll a rock to the top of a hill only to have it roll back down again, the two characters in this film dig sand out of their pit--but the sand keeps coming back....which raises the question: If life is meaningless--as Satre and Camus have said--what will we do? Do we keep digging? Do we opt for suicide instead? Or what? This is one of those films that haunt you after you see it; you'll keep thinking of it during subsequent days and even weeks. It is also distinguished by its luscious and crisp black and white deep focus photography. "The Woman in the Dunes" is (sadly) a far too little-known cinematic treasure that is thought-provoking, beautiful, erotic, and even eerie. Once you see it, you won't soon forget it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unsettling paradox.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is very eerie, disturbing, scary, and gripping. It is made in a style very similar to that of a old Twilight Zone episode. The film is about an entemoligist who takes a vacation to catch bugs in a desert area near the sea. He misses the last bus out so he spends the night in a woman's hut at the bottom of a deep pit. She is part of a slave labor group who must dig to keep the town from being burried by the sand. The next morning, he relizes that he's been trapped there for the rest of life. At first he loathes the woman. He ties her up and refuses to shovel so they will let him go. They then give him some sake, which makes him thristy. The water is all gone and the man almost dies of thirst. The man agrees to start working again. He finds that he loves the woman and actually begins to enjoy being confined. This is haunting, erotic Japanese cinema at is absolute best. Hiroshi Teshigahara is an exellent filmaker, it's almost incredible that filmaking was only a small fad of his and he was mostly interested in flower arranging. This is very much a horror film. The monster is the sand. The sand is portrayed here as an unstoppable force, a sort of Godzilla. The sand also causes strange supernatural occurances. My rating: ***** out of *****.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Teshigahara's masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Woman of the Dunes is the second film of what I like to call Teshigahara's Trilogy of Identity, preceded by Pitfall and succeeded by The Face of Another. The links these films share is that they're collaborations between Teshigahara, novelist Kobo Abe and composer Toru Takemitsu, they're shot in B&amp;W, and they offer interesting takes on one's identity and how its fragility may be manipulated.Woman of the Dunes is the best of the trilogy and one of the greatest accomplishments from the Japanese New Wave. The story follows an entomologist getting tricked by the villagers into living with a mysterious widow, and digging up sand for them, which gets sold illegally. The woman's life is doing nothing but digging sand for them, and the protagonist scoffs at that very idea, however he slowly realizes that the life he left back in the city is just as unfulfilling as the eternal sand-digging Sysiphus-style.He develops Stockholm syndrome and falls in love with the woman. Lots of things happen, and in the end, his personality has completely turned topsy-turvy and is torn to pieces (evidenced via the water ripples in his reflection). He chooses to stay in the dunes, and his name (Jumpei Niki) is revealed through a document appearing on-screen. His opinions on the dullness of city life are apparent in the beginning of the film, where he talks about how in the city the only things that make you a person are certificates, documents, social conventions, papers and more papers. It was evident that nobody in the city cared for him because no one came to search for him later on when he was stuck in the village. Once a prisoner, there were people who acknowledged him, be it the sand woman, or, to a whole different extent, the villagers. Yes, shoveling up sand for days and days only to help his captors is pointless, but the life he left behind gave him even less fulfillment.There is a lot of visual symbolism. The most obvious example is that throughout the film, Jumpei's figure is shown behind slats and bars, thus symbolizing his captivity (this effect is also used extensively by Yoshida and Kobayashi, who made films more or less at the same time). Notice how the opening credits feature various stamps, grotesque drawings of urban images in midst of sporadically spread lines, resembling a dune swallowing up a city, much like the dune life swallows up a city man. And then of course, there's the insect Niki collects, which actually catches its prey the same way the villagers caught Niki. Masks of all kinds are also used throughout the trilogy.The marvelous B&amp;W photography of sand is, of course, the most prominent visual motif and perfectly captures the ubiquitous sand's intruding nature. This expresses itself nicely during the extreme face close- ups, where we see the sand accumulated in Niki's and the woman's pores. In the desert, time means nothing yet Niki, coming from a city, checks his watch all the time as a mean to reflect his technical, control freak-like mind.The performances are marvelous and unforgettable, the locations varied between sandy nothingness and a claustrophobic sand-ridden set, and the most important scenes are slow but they nonetheless stick with you. There's an unique feeling of discomfort felt throughout. It's a wonderful movie, what else to say.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Famed Japanese author Kobo Abe's novel the Woman of the Dunes (Suna No Onna) appeared in 1962, and immediately garnered acclaim in his own country. It was later translated into 20 different languages, and adapted into a Cannes festival award-winning film (it won the 1965 Special Jury Prize, along with two Oscar nominations for Best Director and Best Foreign Film) directed by Hiroshi Teshigahara.The plot of the screenplay was deceptively simple ? an amateur entomologist (Eiji Okada) arrives in a little coastal village during his three-day leave from work as a high-school teacher, with hopes of identifying a type of sand beetle among the vast dune plains adjacent to the sea. After falling asleep there, he wakes to find that he has missed the last bus back to Tokyo. Local villagers advise the man to seek refuge overnight in nearby lodge, owned by a young widow (Kyoko Kishida) who lives there alone. After the accepting the offer, the man is lowered down by rope ladder into a large sandpit where he finds a ramshackle hut.He soon discovers that the woman's sole purpose in life is to spend her entire evenings filling large crates with sand, which constantly pours from the ever-encroaching walls surrounding them, and through the ceiling of her meagre lodgings. The crates are hoisted out of the pit the following morning by the local village union, who then sells illegally to a concrete manufacturer, for cheap. After enjoying basic overnight hospitality, the man discovers upon waking the next morning that the rope ladder is missing, and the relationship between him and woman quickly becomes as fragile as her home itself.After a failed escape attempt leaves the man defeated, he resigns himself as a failure with several months of servitude ahead, battling the ever-present tides of shifting sand. Focusing on the minutiae of the couple's everyday existence, the entomologist's initial determination to escape is gradually replaced with a newfound appreciation of his natural surroundings as a habitant, rather than a visitor. The sophisticated outsider from Tokyo with a desire for his name to be in an encyclopaedia, quickly becomes a curiosity to the woman (he promises to send her a radio on his eventual return to normal life) and a passionate, if somewhat loveless, affair begins.Visually, the screenplay was a wise choice for Hiroshi Teshigahara's second film (his second collaboration with author Kobo Abe after 1961's Pitfall) who along with cinematographer Hiroshi Segawa, decided to use high-contrast monochrome, which helped over-emphasise the use of light and shadow. Many scenes involve large proportion of the frame being plunged into absolute darkness, which helped the feeling of isolation and solitude of the two principal characters, along with unsettling camera angles and close-ups which often amount to clinical abstraction. Natural patterns in the sand are scrutinized in long, static shots - including one which is beautifully segued into a shot of the contours of the naked woman as she tosses and turns in her sleep. The aforementioned sense of the abstract is often replaced with a warm, idyllic feeling of strange contemplation, as images slowly reveal themselves and bleed into one another.The images are paired with a sparse, minimalistic soundtrack provided by Sound Director and Composer, Toru Takemitsu, who uses pounding drums and a stark, alien-sounding string section over the undulating noise of the wind, shifting sand and the scuttle of insects - all of which effectively heighten our senses and remind us the constant threat from the outside.An allegory of the modern 20th Century everyman, detached from a real sense of purpose and incapable of commitment within normalcy, Woman of the Dunes is a powerful piece of work which appeals as a meditative think-piece now just as much as it did forty-six years ago. For all of the entomologist's ambition and yearning for respect and acknowledgement, we soon realise that like he, we must spend a lifetime of servitude and become prisoners to our own desires and vices.In an increasingly hurried world, often dictated by lifestyle choice and freedoms, Teshigahara's film depicts a world without self-imposed ideals, personal ambition, (above others) and the yearning for expression and acceptance in modern society. This serves as a (still-relatable) critique of mid-1960's Japan during a time of great social and ideological change, and asks us to reflect on our own need for validation and self-purpose in the 21st Century. So what of a quiet working life - is this to be likened to a pinned insect, (as part of the central character's prized collection) waiting to expire and become trivial? Or perhaps only living by the bare essentials and free of desire and ego can we, like the entomologist, begin to discover potential in the most trivial of things - by merely existing could a person potentially discover ultimate freedom?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow but gripping, illogical but deeply through provoking, starkly bleak but uniquely visual ? definitely worth seeing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jumpei Niki has an unfulfilling job that is pointless and is not giving his life meaning. To make his mark in life he changes professions to become an entomologist with the aim of being well known in this new field. While out in the desert searching for rare specimens he seeks shelter from a storm in a house with only a woman living in it. Awaking to leave the next morning, Niki finds that he is trapped in a pit that the sand forms around the house.Unable to get out he finds himself forced to be part of a community constantly digging away the sand to prevent the desert taking the village away.It is possible to destroy this film by nitpicking. Even the simple premise screams out its lack of logic and sense, and that's before you even get into the detail of the situation. If you do that you find yourself wondering what the rest of the village are doing; why their only plan is to dig it out rather than build a defense; why those who walk freely do not leave and why the characters act the way they do. However if you find yourself doing this nitpicking to the degree where you are distracted from the film then you might as well just turn it off because you are missing the actual attraction of the film which, for me, worked on a couple of levels.First of all the film may lack logic but it is a fascinating premise that works well as a thriller (albeit a very slow paced thriller!). Another reviewer has compared it to the twilight zone and I think that, in essence of that comparison, he is spot on. The mood is weird; it is very tense and very unusual ? just like the strange but compulsive stories that Twilight Zone would occasionally throw up on its day. In the same I found myself gripped (but not in an 'edge of seat' way) by Niki's plight all the way until the finish. On top of this element the film is deeply interesting in what it could possibly mean (assuming it does have a deeper meaning). In some ways the giving up of individualism to protect the community is an interesting concept but there is plenty more food for thought here too. For example is Niki's life any less meaningful in the pit than it was in his unfulfilling life in Tokyo? Was he 'free' in Tokyo any other way than just physically? These were things that stayed with me after the film ended but they are easy questions to answer if you think logically (freer in a city in a bad job or a hole of sand? Hmmm, let me see!) but the point is that they are interesting elements to the film. The behaviour of the characters is also an interesting side of the script ? Niki in particular changes in ways that are pretty well written and interesting ? also backing up some of the other elements well.The film is also surprisingly sexual (for the period and the country) and this element adds to the beauty of a film that is sparsely directed but great to look at. The black and white is more effective than full colour would have been because it makes it feel so very bleak (yellow and blues would not have done the story justice). The camera focuses very close on hands, backs, sand etc at points and, while I will not pretend to understand the significance of some of Teshigahara's shots, it did make the film feel that little bit more mystic (that is the wrong word but I can't think of one that fits my meaning ? sounds a bit pretentious too!). Suffice to say the 'look' of the film matches the 'feel' and the material. The very strange score is also haunting and again really helps establish the 'otherworldly' feel to the film. The cast do well too although it is obviously Okada's film and he does very well with a difficult character. Kishida is also good but I (as the audience) never really got into her character because I was so focused on Okada.The films main theme of a meaningful life is hammered home well by the abrupt conclusion but, if you have not been thinking above the basic 'trapped in hole of sand' plot then it might frustrate you ? but if you are only watching the film on this level then the whole thing might annoy you and you'll be missing lots. Overall this is not for everyone and it is not a brilliant film (a bit too illogical, bit too slow) but, outside of minor quibbles, it is very good and has so many things that make it worth seeing. Worth buying if that is the only way to see it ? long after the 'what will happen to Jumpei?' question has passed from your mind you'll still be picking over the deeper questions that the film asks you about life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Films Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You need to see WOMAN IN THE DUNES as soon as you can.Hiroshi Teshigahara's masterpiece works in so many ways that it's hard to determine where to begin. You can see this movie as a really cool, extra-long episode of The Twilight Zone. You can see this movie as a parable of the human experience. You can see it as an anticapitalist illustration of the plight of the working man. There's so much here: the pressures of society, the sexual politics of courtship and marriage, the tension between our animal and intellectual selves, the brutal leveling of Japanese society. And that's just the first pass on the story. The camera-work, the lighting, the music, the willingness to exaggerate points of view and ideas in light and sound, the achingly erotic and the terror of nightmare ? it's all here.Told in outline, the story seems to cry out for a Rod Serling introduction: "Imagine, if you will, a man. He carries a driver's license, a library card, cash ? the things he uses to reassure the world that he is who is. He's out for a walk in the dunes, followed by an afternoon nap. But when he awakens, he'll find himself ? in The Twilight Zone." He learns that he's missed the last bus. A passing local offers to guide him to a home where someone will take him in for the night. The home is in a deep pit in the sand, and he climbs down by rope ladder. There's a woman there, and she happily cooks him dinner and fans him while he eats. Later that night, he awakens and sees her shoveling sand outside. He goes back to sleep. When he awakens that morning, he sees her again. She's sleeping on her tatami mat, her nude body dusted with sand and glittering in the morning light.The rope ladder is gone.I've given you the teaser. Now, I'm heading into spoiler territory. If you're intrigued but don't want to know too much, now's the time to click away and put this film at the top of your queue.You've been warned.OK, back to it. It's too hard for a woman alone down at the bottom of that pit. She can't keep up with the shoveling and she needs a husband. He's it, and there's no way out. The villagers sell the sand and lower rations down to those who produce, so welcome to your life's work. At one point, he asks, "Do we shovel sand to live, or do we live to shovel sand?" Well that's just it, isn't it? If you aren't fully invested in what you do, if your job is just a job, if you're trapped, well, then what? Are you doomed to labor so someone else can profit from your misery? Does the whole point of your existence become the continuation of your existence? And what if you buy into the trap? What do you do if you get a chance to escape? There's a Japanese saying which roughly translates to, "The tallest nail gets the hammer." Do you put your head down and fit in? Do you keep shoveling? Do you have a choice? This is the kind of movie you wish you could have seen in college, when you had all night to stay up and talk through its ramifications. You know, however, that you couldn't have gotten it, not really, while you were still in college. You could have related to vision of the woman (or, later in the narrative, the man) with the light dusting of sand. But the role of the individual in the family and the family in society, the web of responsibilities among all the players? These are just ideas to you. You need to live them for at least a decade or so for them to sink in.I haven't even gotten into the technical aspects of the film, the way it creates a living world in the sand, the way it photographs sand as a metaphor for responsibility or uses its dissonant music to jar the audience while reinforcing the narrative. Here's a film that understands points of view so clearly that it shows us not only what its characters are seeing, but what they're focusing on and what they're feeling and what they're thinking about. The camera isn't just a clever audience surrogate here: the camera reflects and directs, it's organic to the proceedings, a part of what's going on. You've heard of the God's Eye View? In this film, the camera sees what God sees. Oh, and the lighting. Wait until you see the light on the sand on the body ? one of the most memorable images put to film. Watch shadows play across faces and flashlight beams glare down brutal humanity in its cruelty and hope for redemption. I would pay real money to see this movie broken down shot by shot.So if you're young, see WOMAN IN THE DUNES and marvel at the photography and the music and the construction and the story and the ideas. If you're older, see this film and marvel at the photography and the music and the construction and the story and the ideas and the truths and hopes and perceptions and vitality of the cycle of life. See WOMAN IN THE DUNES and marvel. See WOMAN IN THE DUNES and never be the same.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surreal sensual drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Tokyo schoolteacher Niki Jumpei (Eiji Okada) and part time entomologist travels to a remote area in the hope of studying a rare species of beetle, his aim is to find it and have it named after himself. His first morning there he spends collecting specimens in jars from the sand, he is approached by a rather suspicious local, who questions him as to his motives for being there, Niki dispels the locals suspicions that he is some authoritative figure snooping and goes on his way. Resting briefly in an old boat, he ponders humanity's dependence on paper qualifications to prove our credentials to others, passports, driving licences, university certificates, medical certificates etc and what a suspicious world it would be without them. Niki ( incidentally a name we only find out a the end of the film) falls asleep with the hazy sun beating down on him, he is awakened by the same local, who asks him, how he is going to get home, as he has missed his last bus. Somewhat bewildered Niki says he'll have to walk, the local man says he might be able to help and offers to help find him a bed for the night in the nearby village. Niki is led through the treacherous dunes until they come across a large pit, at the bottom of which lives a woman, it is here that Niki will spend the night.Niki immediately questions the woman, as to why she would live in such a desolate place, in a ramshackle house where the sand is constantly flowing through holes in the roof and he is amazed to find that her nightly Sisyphean task involves filling baskets with sand that has blown into the pit and having it hoisted up by the locals. After feeding him, the woman tells him he doesn't have to help on his first night here, he finds this a curious statement as he is only staying one night? The truth behind the pit is soon revealed as Niki finds that there is no way out of the pit, the rope ladder having been removed by the locals.Teshigahara is perhaps best known for his surreal and existential works, Woman in the Dunes fits right into this category. The setting of the sand dunes with the blinding sun gives the film an otherworldly dreamlike quality, with continuing rivers of sand also adding to this quality. The revelation that he is being kept captive is also a rather scary and intriguing, the film traces Niki's mixed emotions of anger and aggression, his denial of his captors, his change of heart and the fact he would stop at nothing to get the merest of rewards from them. His transformation is complete as he himself turns into a captor, of the woman that he now shares his life with.The film is an epic at almost 2 ? hours, its pace is incredibly slow but strangely it still doesn't feel that long, this viewer being drawn in to the complexities of the film. There's also a very sensual and sexual subtext, with the burning heat and little to do during the day and with the woman's recommendation that they sleep naked because the sand will chaff them, it is inevitable that sexual liaisons will happen and they do, sometimes it rough and ready and they wrestle each other, sometimes its sensuous as they provocatively wash the sand from each other in some very intimate moments.Woman of the Dunes I have heard is full of subtext and hidden meanings, some are contradictory to the writer and directors visions so its hard to tell exactly on this my first viewing, exactly what they are so I will not even try to do so, I'll just sit back and let the film wash through my mind again and maybe it will all fall into place. The ending is controversial I would say, I can imagine it causes divide amongst those who have seen it, but in the context of the surreal setting and qualities of the film, I think it suits it fine, if nothing else it will get you talking about it, I think it's a film ripe for over analysis, so again I won't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extraordinary work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Strange people living in a remote coastal region imprison a school teacher (Eiji Okada) with a sad, sensual woman (Kyoko Kishida). The woman lives in a shack surrounded by sand dunes. The dunes constantly threaten to bury her home, so she is forced to shovel sand and send it away in cases. The man has no option but to help her, and as the months pass, he questions the meaning of his existence. The film's premise allows for much philosophical exploration. The burning question becomes: Do you live to work or work to live? Novelist Kobo Abe and director Hiroshi Teshigahara blended like milk and coffee to create this masterwork of weirdness. Similar in tone to an old "Twilight Zone" episode, it is handsomely shot, stunningly scored, and performed with rare conviction. It is not realistic in its depiction of the circumstances our hero finds himself in because it is more concerned with investigating the psychological consequences of his dilemma. There is a steaming erotic edge to the drama and a doomed atmosphere of resolve that enriches the conflict. It is an extraordinary work that requires viewer patience. Its rewards are many.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An excellent and gripping depiction of the human condition trapped in roles. Even sexually explicit roles serve to define us closer into the various greater and lesser societal roles that keep us from ever having a clear definition of ourselves in the universe. The best that the hero can come up with is a buddistic resignation that he is on a round trip ticket that he can cancel at any time;this is a better piece of make believe than what is usually served up to dull us to the total lack of meaning in our existence outside of God. The photography, music and drama accentuate the message. Anyone familiar with Earnest Becker's "The Denial of Death", will see that the writer and director came to the same insights as Becker. Most deeply thoughtful movie I've seen in the last two years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A teacher carrying out research on a remote beach finds himself caught in a trap engineered by local hicks. The teacher is an intellectual: he feels sure his wits will enable him to manufacture an escape. But release gets ever further away, and his surroundings draw him in more and more...In film school, a teacher told me a story about narrative. A man, obsessed with crossing a hole full of water, works feverishly at the undertaking. He has no success, until one days he wakes and finds the scorching sun has evaporated the water. The man goes to the tap and re-fills the hole. Woman in the Dunes is that premise on a grander canvas.Jumpei is a sophisticate who, while grateful for the hospitality afforded him by the locals, also takes that gift as his social right. The woman who is his host has no such airs and graces, but her self-awareness and social awareness are far more refined than Jumpei's.The world the film creates is both uncanny and all too familiar. Sand has never seemed so complex, so seductive, so intimidating. Jumpei and the woman are forced to shovel sand to survive. Aren't we all? Jumpei and the woman come together as a couple because of limited options. Many couples will sympathise. Given the chance to fundamentally change his life, Jumpei opts for the status quo. The choice is momentous and banal, and universally understood.Eiji Okada as Jumpei is outstanding, all bombast and outrage, and then quietly confounded. Kyôko Kishida as the Woman is simply mesmerising, comely and beguiling in the mode of the English milkmaid in British Victorian novels, but with a more aquatic air (the proximity of the sea is deliciously hinted at in this arid world of sand). The story is incredibly simple, almost a parable, but inhabited with authentic characters who give it three dimensions.We all, at some point, settle. We all compromise. We all give in. This film takes that bleak reality and presents it to us wrapped in cinematic beauty.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's funny that before I saw this film I was thinking of moving to a different country. After seeing Suna no onna I changed my mind because (in my opinion) the transition to another culture and mentality can bring new things, good and bad in your life, whether you like it or not and the risk can bring consequences that are against you.The stunning cinematography reminds me of Antonioni's L'Avventura that made me feel like I was on another world. The script is brilliant and the direction is that of the work of a genius. I think it refers to the fact that there are very thew things needed to survive, even in a harsh environment. To accept this simple life style, of which it's basic component is a home filled with love is a difficult task if you come from a city in which you only think of your career and reputation. To see a character slowly transform and to erase everything that defined his identity, under the influence of a new world in which he has been sucked into fascinated me. You can feel that this new 'medium" is like a character that participates in the transformation.This is a 'must see" for anybody that is interested in Japanese cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Woman in the dunes is a great step in Japanese cinematography because Teshigahara, the movie's director, was the first Japanese director to be nominated for an Oscar - and it is truly amazing that, back in 1964, the members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences were able to realize the greatness of this movie.It all starts with the entomologist Niki Jumpei (Eiji Okada), alone, walking in the desert, looking for insects. No dialogue, just beautiful cinematography and games of light and shadow. He is invited by the local villagers to spend the night in the home of a widow (Kyôko Kishida), at the bottom of a sandpit, since he has missed the last bus to the city. This does not upset him, he's interested in their way of life, therefore he accepts. But the next morning he discovers the villagers trapped him - just like he traps his beloved insects - and expect him to live with the woman and help her collect the sand daily, receiving food and water in return. So he tries to escape this claustrophobic environment.Where should I begin? This movie has "masterpiece" written all over it. The two main (and almost only) characters are at the same time opposite and similar - opposite in their reaction to the imprisonment, similar in their loneliness and pointlessness of lives that they cherish nonetheless. Okada and Kishida put up amazing performances which make you forget they're just acting. But perhaps the true protagonist is the sand: the dangerous, devastating force that brings purpose to those who have learned to handle and make good use of it. A lot of scenes in the movie show it moving, changing, and always remaining the same, and they are never out of place. It dictates the lives of the people, and one is forced to love it in a perverted, Stockholm syndrome-sque kind of way, just like the widow does even after the sand has killed her husband and daughter. To make the movie fit its gloomy story even better, it was filmed in natural light; also, a lot of important things happen at night (for example, an attempt to escape) and even though you can hardly see anything, you know exactly what's going on. This creepy atmosphere is perfected by what's probably one of the best soundtracks of all time (composed by Toru Takemitsu), since it suits the picture incredibly well, making you feel uncomfortable and scared from the first minutes. And, as a conclusion, there is a sentence, said by the entomologist towards the end of the movie, which, in my opinion, sums up its message: We're pigs anyway. Simple yet powerful, just like everything else in Woman in the dunes.Rating: 9/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Haunting Metaphysical Story with Cinematic Vision</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dark and hypnotic, minimalist and absurd, transcendental and meditative are the first words which come to my mind when describing Hiroshi Teshigahara's masterpiece Woman in the Dunes. It is a metaphysical story about being, freedom and the human mind, characterized by psycho-sexual associations, studying existence and the vanity of life. By using music, sounds and extreme close-ups in an innovative manner, Teshigahara succeeds to truly touch us. His reflection of an incredibly distressing reality achieves to create an enduring and haunting experience of unforgettable images and cinematic bliss which will not be forgotten.The story begins when an entomologist travels from Tokyo to the sand dunes of Japan to study the life of certain insects. However, his three-day long journey takes a turn when the local community traps him into a domicile at the bottom of a vast sand pit. There, living with a lonely woman, he must try to survive as he goes through an unending and useless battle against the infinite nature.As the film unfolds on the screen, it begins to get even surrealistic features and grows out to be a story about an individual fighting for survival in a hostile environment. Furthermore, it includes an extraordinary sexual tension and an odd emotion of yearn and melancholy within. On one level, it depicts the Japanese mental landscape but could also be seen as a comment on the sudden affluence of Japan in the postwar era. In fact, the film drills down to the social themes of alienation and loneliness quite well while it offers a perverse picture of pathological mankind where the power game between the rulers and the oppressed continues.However, more important than the social aspect is the film's visual aesthetics and its relation with the themes. The vast and endless dunes almost resemble expressionistic art where distorted picture of reality reflects an inner vision. In the middle of Antonionian landscapes, people feel lost and trapped. Teshigara has tapped into this situation perfectly with regards to the poetics of space as the surrounding dunes and quicksand create a prison of mind where there is no way out. Thus, the visuals beautifully indicate the existential experience and agony of man.I think it is fair to say that Teshigara's zen-aesthetics is partly Bressonian -- drama stripped to essentials -- where only the most integral part of the image is shown. The close-ups of wet and dry skin, sand and water are really almost erotic. In fact, the inertia felt in the middle of brutal nature is associated with sexuality, which is another intriguing theme in the film. As the relationship of the man and the woman evolves, the sexual tension tightens and the yearning of touch becomes more vivid and concrete. In this process, the protagonist is stripped down both physically and morally when his conception of humanity is put to test in the chaotic wilderness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this surreal avant-garde film the sand runs through mind and soul like an endless flood.Middle-aged teacher and entomologist Junpei Niki is out collecting insects by the coast, near a pore village, one hot summer day. While he passionately explores the dunes living organisms he forgets the time and after a while he is sought out by local inhabitants who tell him that he has lost the last bus that would have brought him back to his home. As nice and hospitable as they are, they offer him to spend the night with their aunt, a lonely widow who lives in a house placed in a dune. Junpei happily accepts the offer, but the next day he realizes to his great astonishment that there is no way out of the widows house and that he has been the victim of a thought-out conspiracy.Hiroshi Teshigara's metaphorical character drama is an adaptation of a Kôbô Abe novel from 1962 and takes place exclusively inside and outside a worn house that's been built in a dune. The film opens, as most movies do, with the main character being faced with a problem, but oppose to most movies, the point-of-no-return occurs at the same time as the dilemma."Woman in the Dunes" is a minimalistic work driven by three characters. One is a man, the other is a woman and the third character is the sand. With chronological narrative this claustrophobic and somewhat allegorical fable about two strangers enforced interaction is told. The quiet buildup in this brilliantly photographed black and white movie is escalated by the instrumental music, where the effect of drums and percussion instruments really serves their purpose, and lifts the films persistent, ominous moods. With long takes, erotic undertones, captivating perspectives, engaging performances and a camera that paints pieces of art in sand, Heroshi Teshigahara creates a mysterious fable about imprisonment, human communication and survival.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An absolutely mesmerizing and gripping masterpiece, one of Japan's greatest films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Women of the Dunes", which has just been released onto DVD by the great Criterion Collection, is simply put a masterpiece. The story itself may be rather unbelievable in some aspects, but that hardly matters because its gripping all the same. The film is long and very slowly paced, but its works entirely in favor of the film, just like "2001" and "The Seventh Seal". Those comparisons aren't taking it too far either, this film is really on the level of either Kubrick or Bergman. Like those films, it takes a cinematic familiar setting and fashions something entirely surreal and unique from it. The film truly is one of the greatest to ever come from Japan, or any country for that matter.The direction by Hiroshi Teshigahara is exquisite, and the cinematography and music score work with it to fashion this. The constant shots of the sand is hypnotizing and never becomes erroneous. The music is an avant-garde selection that reminds one of the opening to "2001" with its tonal sounds. The screenplay was written by Kobe Abe, who also wrote the novel on which this film is based. While I haven't read the book (even though I really want to), I'm assuming its an accurate adaptation. The two main protagonists remain sympathetic throughout, and the film has a complexity rarely found. It'll lend itself to repeat viewings just so the audience can attempt to decipher just what its really about. I can't praised "Women of the Dunes" enough, its truly mind blowing. (10/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this last night for the first time and was completely mesmerized - a haunting experience that i will never forget i think. Great visual style, acting, soundtrack... i cant find a fault with it literally.I've never seen sand filmed so beautifully either but the whole film is a feast for the eyes and ears. If you want a movie thats miles away from what you might typically expect from a Japanese movie, then watch this. Japan of course has a fine cinematic tradition with many great directors, but Kurosawa seems to get all the plaudits in the western world. He WAS great but, there's more to Japanese cinema and this, for my money, is better than anything i've seen by him.One problem - the version i watched was VERY dark and reading the other posts here i see there is a better one available. i'm off now to find it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Adaptation of Japanese Novel Is Engrossing:Two-Character Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Woman in the Dunes" proved to be a strongly allegorical, strangely engrossing film. Based on a novel by Kobo Abé called "Woman in the Dunes" (also the title of the picture), it is a long, leaden, grueling account of the arguing and quarreling and lovemaking of a man and a woman trapped in a shack at the bottom af a sand pit amid some remote and desolate dunes. Despite its drabness and some tedium, it grips and agitates the mind. It begins with the man, an entomologist collecting beetles on the dunes, being directed to the shack by anonymous people from whom he has sought shelter for the night. They lower him into the sand pit with a crude block-and-fall, and there he finds the shabby woman who willingly provides him with bed and board. But when he is ready to leave the next morning, he finds he cannot get out without having a rope lowered to him by the people above. And they are either absent or are scornful and unwilling to help. Then the woman tells him that they are eternally caught ? or, at least, must remain there at the will of the people above, who send them water and food. She explains, too, that she is resigned to existence under these circumstances. "Last year," she says, "a storm swallowed up my husband and child." Further, she shows him the necessity of working hard every day to shovel out the sand that has fallen into the shack during the night. Of course, the man is indignant. He rages and refuses to help. But slowly he makes his adjustment to this frustrating fate. As the picture progresses, he, too, becomes used to the pit, and at the end he does not want to leave it when he has a chance. This is the barest outline of the plot of this more than two-hour film, which is crowded with harsh and subtle details of the personal relations of the two. But it is in the projection of these details, which have strong emotional and psychological significances, that the director, Hiroshi Teshigahara, has packed a bewitching poetry and power. In describing, for instance, the manner in which the man becomes seduced by the physical presence of the woman, he works such subtle pictorial change that the bare body of the drab widow has a warm and attractive glow; and the physical act is suggested with such closeups of faces and limbs that a strong emanation of passion surges from the screen. He also draws from his performers, Eiji Okada as the man (he played the lover in "Hiroshima, Mon Amour") and Kyoko Kishida as the woman, some sharp and devastating glints of anger sadness, compassion, gratefulness and despair. In a starkly atmospheric setting and with an eerie musical score, this drama develops an engulfing sense of spiritual discouragement and decay. Obviously, it is intended to symbolize the absorption of man and the alienation of his spirit by all the demands and oppressions of his environment. The soul of the individual is clearly challenged in this existentialist realm, and it is reduced to resignation and surrender. Not a happy but a hypnotic film. "Woman in the Dunes" took the Special Jury Prize at the Cannes festival at the time of its release.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Haunting but Dragging Parable of the Senselessness of Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A brusque schoolteacher takes a trip out to the dunes to get away from it all by indulging his entomological hobby, hoping to get his name in the books for the discovery of a rare insect. Instead, he is entrapped by a woman who lives endlessly shoveling out the sand from her house in a pit in the dunes. Her husband has died and she needs a man to help with the work and relieve her loneliness. To the man, the life in the dunes is insufferable and absurd, and he does everything possible to escape. To the woman, the life in the dunes is all she knows and she sees little point in venturing beyond, to a wider world where she will have no significance.The film is visually arrested in its shots of drifting dunes, struggling insects, the protagonists, sometimes covered with sand. The two main protagonists are examined in an unsentimental style, empathetically, and yet without any glamorization. We question whether they have any more hope to transcend their situation, than the insects that the man captures. The sand is a metaphor for the routine and pointless nature of the tasks of life. In the end, we are left with the question of which protagonist is closer to correct. We root for the man to escape his criminal imprisonment, feeling the ridiculousness of the situation, but at the same time it's made clear that in his real life in Tokyo, he has little more significant to await him, and that he might just as well learn to love this as anywhere else.On the negative side, the film is long at over two hours, given the extremely spare plot and low-key approach, and grows boring. It's a film that's more fun to think about afterward than watch. In addition, on rewatching the film, the artificiality of the set up begins to wear. It is somewhat of a "one note" movie, with a didactic, Twilight Zone kind of air, where you know the sand stands for one thing, the house for another, it's all a metaphor for life, etc.Overall, a film worth watching, but not perfect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While there is sex involved there is no eros, whatsoever. Desperation, yes, but no eros. Then there is an odd critical claim that Niki has a wife, portrayed by Hiroko Ito. But this is simply not true. Yes, there are several shots of a second woman's body and face seen in the sand, but in no way does Niki nor the film indicate that this is a wife of his. Perhaps this is an imbuement because the character in the book mentions a wife, but, nonetheless, there is no such correlation in the film. Yet another mis-take on the film occurs when Niki almost succumbs to the taunts of the villagers to rape the widow, as they voyeur them. Some critics have claimed that this scene represents Niki's passage into the demented world of the villagers, almost like the scenes near the end of Tod Browning's Freaks, wherein the freaks claim new members by chanting, 'One of us.' But, there is no truth to this, as Niki is repulsed by his degradation. And the fact that they do not treat him any differently, after the fact, is proof that this claim is wrong. It is just a perverse sense of torture. Nothing more, nothing less. The villagers may, indeed represent Japanese society, humanity, or a variety of individual groups who are under the film's scrutiny, but this scene does nothing but show them in a horrid, fascistic light. Their perversity, however, clearly influenced scenes in Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut.And this reality connects the film to that masterpiece of another medium, one which aired just a few years later, the British television drama, starring Patrick McGoohan: The Prisoner. Parallels between the plights of the two male protagonists abound. Both are trapped in circumstances, held by unknown forces in a 'village,' forced to go along with the villagers' perverse mind games, thwarted in their increasingly desperate ploys to regain control of their lives and bodies, etc. The difference is that, in the end, Niki submits to his tormentors, who are external in nature. By contrast, No. 6 defeats his foes, and we learn that they are, and always have been, internal.The DVD package, from The Criterion Collection, Three Films By Hiroshi Teshigahara, comes with a fourth disk of supplements, the main feature of which is a documentary about Teshigahara and his Kobo Abe's lives and collaborations. There are also four short early documentaries by Teshigahara, none of which presage his fictive films. They are: Hokusai, Ikebana, Tokyo 1958, and Ako. The actual disk with Pitfall on it contains the theatrical trailer and a video essay by film critic James Quandt on it. One of the more interesting nuggets gleaned from it is that the bulk of the film was shot in sand dunes close to Mount Fuji. This is quite interesting since the dunes clearly look Saharan, as opposed to other desert's sand formations. Overall, it is a solid video package- with a few early blemishes, shown in a 1.37:1 aspect ratio, although the lack of an English language dubbed track would have been a great help because the white subtitles blanche out against many of the ultra-white shots of the film. The booklet features a career overview by Peter Grilli, an interview with the director, and essays on the films.Woman In The Dunes is not only the best of the three films in this DVD set (oddly, a fact most critics agree upon), but also the most Absurdist. Yet, I do not think there is a causal connection between those facts, for there is a good deal of realism, as well. This is shown in many of the scenes where Niki is trying to devise escape plans. In his scientific zeal to catalog his experience, his sense of inventiveness mirrors that of the titular character in another 1964 film, Robinson Crusoe On Mars. It also continues the theme of the corruption of big business and unionism that was at the material core of Teshigahara's own Pitfall. It is the work of a master artist at the height of his powers, despite the minor contrivances the film takes on and asks its viewers to forgive. And viewers should forgive it, for that is its only 'flaw,' if one can call it such. And, for that solecism one gets a hefty reward of emotional and intellectual satisfaction from this almost two and a half hour long film that, despite its simple setup and spare cast list, barely feels like it runs for an hour. That's how engrossing its conception and execution is. That sort of service to the film going public deserves- no, demands, reciprocation. Go. Do it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is a mix of symbols, but like all masterpieces it has a plot continuity that, if one accepts, becomes an awakening. The sand, the trap of the house, the imprisonment, the forced labor to keep digging the sand and removing it to save the village from the dune movement, the escape attempts, and the eventual acceptance of one's fate is pieced together seamlessly. We all have an inner soul; this movie took me there. Even though it is stark and harsh, it is a mystical place, similar to where I sat on the edge of a cliff and listened to the wind passing through the rocks; or where I listened in the dark of night to the oaks talking to each other. It is one step past reality, one step past the flesh of the world. If you need to go there, watch this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Viewed on DVD. This film immediately presents the viewer with two basic problems. First, how to navigate the DVD menu to turn on/off the subtitles (Criterion label DVD menu designers seem to delight in making this a game on release after release). Second, trying to figure out what this movie is really about. Is it a protest against modern society in general and Tokyo life styles in particular? Is it an anti-capitalist tome? An anti-labor union allegory? How the conventional wisdom of not digging deeper when in a hole is untrue (especially for sand)? An anti-prison movie? A free-the-sand-dune-bugs protest film? All of the above? None of the above? For sure, it is a spider-and-the-web fantasy tale, and a pretty scary one at that. There are also elements of magic scattered about. Only two characters and essentially a single set manage to hold the viewer's attention for two hours and change. This is made possible by A-list actor Eiji Okada and actress Kyoko Kishida. It's Kishida's low keyed, but riveting performance that particularly maintains the viewer's attention. The film was shot in a narrow-screen format and in black and white at a time when this type of packaging had long been abandoned by almost everyone except art-house film directors. Camera work uses a lot of deep focus; tracking/panning is occasionally jerky. Score is sometimes grating; at other times it substantially adds to the sense of terror. Subtitles are fine and essentially indispensable when marginal characters speak with Western Japan accents. Restoration is outstanding. Just sit back, relax, and let the allegories begin!

		<shortDescription>A great visual experience ..... but not sure what it all means .....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dear Hiroshi Teshigahara, Woman in the Dunes was awash with this uniquely hypnotic and claustrophobic aura. The film can be enjoyed for the visual experience alone. The first few scenes with the man walking across the desert was enough to hook me in completely. Toru Takemitsu's dissonant score is used throughout the film to create this paranoid and horrifying atmosphere. I wish you had used a more traditional score. The main narrative is interwoven with visuals of sand trickling down and mountains crumbling which creates a really eerie effect. The interactions between the man and the woman inside the closed space of the hut reminded me of this quote by Christopher Isherwood from his novel The Single Man: "Think of two people, living together day after day, year after year, in this small space, standing elbow to elbow cooking at the same small stove, squeezing past each other on the narrow stairs, shaving in front of the same small bathroom mirror, constantly jogging, jostling, bumping against each other's bodies by mistake or on purpose, sensually, aggressively, awkwardly, impatiently, in rage or in love ? think what deep though invisible tracks they must leave, everywhere, behind them!"The close ups of their bodies and the shots from behind the naked body of the woman were used to emphasize the intimate and erotic nature of their relationship. The outdoor scenes, especially the ones in the pitch dark of the night were haunting. Some writers of noir flicks could conjure up some interesting ideas based on those visuals. Best Regards, Pimpin.

		<shortDescription>Woman of the Dunes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Japanese film was featured in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, it was rated five stars out of five by critics, I may bot have known anything about it prior to reading about it, but I was prepared to see why it was put in the pages of the book. Basically Tokyo based schoolteacher and amateur entomologist Junpei Niki (Eiji Okada) is on an expedition collecting insects that inhabit sand dunes, following this he misses the last bus, so the villagers suggest he stay the night, guiding him down a rope ladder to a house in a sand quarry. There a young woman widow (Kyôko Kishida) lives alone, she is employed to dig sand for the villagers to sell and to save the house from burial in the advancing sand. Junpei trying to leave the next morning finds that the ladder has been removed, the villagers inform him he must help the widow endlessly digging sand, he tries to escape climbing the crumbling sand walls but fails, he takes the widow captive to bargain with the villagers, but releases her to receive water from them. Slowly Junpei finds himself falling for the widow, until they become lovers, but he is still desperate to leave, and tries time and time again to escape, while also forcing himself to do what the villagers tell him. One morning however he manages to escape the sand dune, he starts running and is chased by the villagers, but he is not familiar with the geography of the area, and he ends up trapped in quicksand, the villagers rescue him and return him to the widow. Junpei eventually accepts his fate, but through persistent effort he traps a crow as a messenger, he discovers a way to draw water from the damp sand at night, thus he becomes absorbed in perfecting he technology and adapts to his "trapped" life, over time you see him and the widow coping with the oppression of their situation and the power of their attraction, where in spite or because of their situation. In the end Junpei gets the chance to escape, but he cannot bring himself to leave the widow behind, so he chooses to stay in the dune, and meanwhile it has been seven years since his disappearance, his missing poster has been hanging from a wall, written by the police and signed by his mother Shino. Also starring Hiroko Itô as Entomologist's wife (in flashbacks), Kôji Mitsui and Sen Yano. The story of an ordinary explorer of sorts and educator becoming trapped and falling for a woman who is a social outcast is interesting, the location trapped in the sand pit creates a little bit of claustrophobia which adds to the state of the relationship, and there are many good visuals, a rather intriguing drama film. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Foreign Language Film and Best Director for Hiroshi Teshigahara. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Suna no onna is a splendidly profound minimalistic odyssey, a spiralling journey towards the core of oneself, towards an inner paradise, the ultimate Eden-oasis (suggested by the discovery of a new water source, and implicitly a new life, in the depths of the dunes); the ending is not a capitulation, it is finding the right balance and a path to be at peace and free, freedom that comes from within; the constraints, first those of the urbanistic web with its bureaucratic chains from which Niki Jumpei tries to escape through surrogate passions (entomology, photography) and then the natural ones, with the dunes acting like a hungry ghost's mouth wanting to devour its inhabitants, haunt our Ulysses on his inner sea peregrination, luring him with the woman, like a siren with her spectral body floating between the wavy dunes, and finally force him to face himself and ultimately to make a choice and gain a meaning of his life, paradoxically, beyond any pressure and coercion; the score is gorgeous and abrasive as the sand of the desert, working in perfect harmony with the both dreamy and sharp geometry of the images</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An entomologist from Tokyo visits a remote sea facing village looking for insects. He gets trapped by the local villagers in a house with a young woman. The woman works tirelessly on one thing - prevent her house from being buried by drifting sand dunes. The villagers supply her with food and other things that are dropped in the pit every day. The villagers do this due to the fear of the sand dunes engulfing the rest of the village. Initially the man refuses to accept the hopeless situation which makes him to toil in shifting the sand that fills the house constantly. The lady desperately tries all that she can do to convince him of the situation since he is her only solace against the loneliness, hard work and her want for a companion. He slowly accepts the fact and starts working and along the way he develops a relationship with the lady in the house.Although the story premise is rather weak, script and haunting visuals are the two main tenets on which the movie triumphs. The lead character sets himself on a path of realization which is full of metaphors such as the sand which is presented as a devil by itself. The slow and erotic display of their relationship emphasizes the human tendency to adapt and accept even the harshest conditions. By the end of the film one starts believing that even strong beliefs can change under circumstances.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a fan of horror films, but very few movies I've seen are as sinister and disturbing as Hiroshi Teshigahara's adaptation of Kobo Abe's novel "Woman in the Dunes". Something like a perverse, poetic, surreal re-mix of "A Man Escaped" with a more troubled ending, Teshigahara's movie is as ephemeral and as heavy as quicksilver--the sands shift and put weight on the character through the story and on the audience through the cinematography at a slow death-hold. Those who mean to see this movie but suffer from claustrophobia might want to pass.A teacher who collects insects is out in the dunes one day when he comes across a mysterious stranger who asks if he's an auditor. The teacher convinces the stranger to the contrary, takes a nap in a displaced canoe, and then wakes up to find he's missed the last train. The stranger invites the teacher to stay in a local hut located deep in a hole among the dunes, and the teacher graciously accepts. From there, there is no escape.The teacher isn't alone. A woman lives there, too, and after initial pleasantries turn sour it's clear that the teacher is to be made her new husband, and that the two are doomed to shovel sand every night. He resists, and the movie propels forward through horror and psychological break-down. Is the woman desperate and lonely, or is she as perverse as the townspeople who laughingly supply their rations? Is anybody looking for the teacher? Is the teacher's hope deeply held and the sand a mere physical obstacle, or is he psychologically embroiled into this strange peasant culture? And do these people really love their homeland, or are we in some strange Deliverance-like situation where they're so removed from the outside world that they know nothing else? The sand is both held close and dear, and deeply feared for its destructive powers. Its slow movement is as assured as it's power to subsume everything in its path. Teshigahara pulls no stops here, putting in direct character drama, abstract editing, a chilling midnight pursuit, and a shrieking violin score.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Adjust for 1960's pacing, and you will find one of Japans best pieces of cinema. The story is one simple enough to not really require subtitles, at least at first, a young professor studying insects gets trapped in a sandstorm and finds shelter amidst a strange house in the middle of the desert with a "mysteious woman', after the storm clears the man realizes he is at the bottom of a huge sand pit, with only a quaint house built in it's center. The professor soon comes to realize that he cannot leave, neither the crumbling sand walls, nor the enigmatic villagers who bring supplies, will let him. He learns that he is not the first and is not expected to be the last to "work the pit". He then begins in a relationship with the mystery woman which is strained by his perpetual need to escape and her fear of abandonment and the outside world. The story is simple and complex, the cinematography beautiful and up to modern standards, the sand is made to move, ebb, and resemble water at numerous times, giving what could otherwise be a barren wasteland a kind of heat induced feverish tangibility and character. The biggest drawback is this films pace which at times seems bleakly endless at other times vivid and powerful. There is some sensuality in the film, but it doesn't really seem to be the film's cornerstone, what sex there is, seems more about contrasting flesh with the grainy roughness of sand, the harshness of isolation with the pleasures of coming together. Anyway if you've enjoyed Kurusawa, and older Japanese films in the past and have the necessary patience, it's really excellent film, that is much more tightly constructed than it's surreal erotica tag lines might lead you believe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director: Teshigahara Hiroshi Duration: 123 minutes I was first exposed to the literary works of Abe Kobo back in 2002 when I picked up and read a tattered copy of his novel _Woman of the Dunes_. I enjoyed the novel, but at the time my brain was so pickled in the works of Murakami Haruki and Yoshimoto Banana that I did fully appreciate Abe's words. During the spring semester of 2003 I took a class called Visual Culture in Modern Japan and _Woman of the Dunes_ was the final novel that we read. After discussing the book, our teacher had us watch the film adaptation of Abe's novel, and by seeing what the character Junpei experiences, I was able to sympathize with him greater than I had when I read the novel.In order to escape his mundane life in Tokyo, the salary-man Niki Junpei travels to a small seaside village to collect insects. Engrossed in his hobby Niki accidentally misses the last bus. In order to aid their visitor, the villagers suggest that Niki stay the night in one of their homes. Liking the idea of staying in a local's home and tasting the local cuisine, Junpei readily agrees to the proposal. Junpei is taken to house situated in a sandpit and there he meets a woman who dutifully prepares him dinner. Her home lacks not only electricity and water, but it is also quite ramshackle as well. The woman informs Junpei that the sand causes the wood to rot because of its moisture. Junpei scoffs at the woman, stating that sand is dry not moist. To Junpei's befuddlement, the woman goes outside to shovel sand which is then taken away by the villagers. After asking her how often she performs this work, she informs him that she does it every night.When Junpei awakens in the morning, he is startled to see the slumbering naked figure of the woman nearby. The woman is completely naked with only some cloth covering her face. Sand clings to the rest of her body. Not wanting to wake her, Junpei tries to leave quietly, but the rope ladder is gone. He is stuck there with the woman inside that sandy hole._Woman of the Dunes_ is a fascinating film and is considered to be Teshigahara Hiroshi's finest work. One can feel Junpei's desperation when he struggles to find a way to escape the sandpit's crumbling sides. Also, _Woman of the Dunes_ is a good example of a film that can be very erotic without showing naughty bits. There are a couple of scenes within the film that are quite stirring. One depicting Junpei washing sand from the woman's back and another in which the woman bathes Junpei.The duration of the of the film on the American cut DVD is 123 minutes, but the Japanese DVD runs for 147 minutes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1964, Japan. Sand and love. Sand and drama. Sand and horror. I saw this movie recently and I won't forget some scenes in really long time. It's just haunting, and has changed my perception about desert and sand...and on top of it you add some erotic scenes that are pure perfection without showing too much nude skin, so at the end you get a very provocative movie. The director is a real artist in creating an atmosphere that's just perfect for the story he tells. Rarely I have seen a better manipulation of light, sound and filming techniques. Many times before I have wondered what a director has in mind when creates a movie so powerful like this one, is he really conscientious about all the final effect on the viewer, or is he expecting everybody to have his own opinion about it? In this case I think the director left too little to your own imagination, but that's not too bad, as the movie DOES manage to transmit, what I think it was, the original message of the director (I'll let you watch the movie, and figure out for yourself that message..). I gave the movie 8/10 , just because sometimes the sound was not that great, and some scenes had some technical faults(like too dark, or the contrast on the film of bit off). Anyhow, I strongly recommend this movie to any serious lover of art films, and to anyone who wants to rediscover maybe, some feelings no so well expressed in today's cinema.</fullReview>

It's one of those completely unexpected experiences that you don't forget because it seems so simple. Try and see it in a movie theater like I did because you will get a tremendous effect. The stunning black and white photography captures the sand dunes in an eerie way. This is a very hard movie to describe. Yes, it has a philosophical "bent" but you can enjoy it as a different kind of adventure or a character study. Either way, I'm glad so many others have seen it and feel the same way about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an excellent movie. If you haven't read a plot summary, don't. It is impossible to summarize without including some kind of spoiler. With the exception of a scene involving quicksand, no one ever seems to be in mortal danger in this film, but I found parts of it as viscerally scary as The Blair Witch Project. The mood of the film stuck with me long after, much as I experienced after watching The Godfather. If I gave out stars, this would get all of them. This is an excellent movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The sand keeps raining in... but how much time does our hero have?A Brilliant film... A claustrophobic's nightmare...The poor bug collector... He picked the wrong day to go hunting only to end up the hunted. The director like some cruel child torturing a helpless insect tosses us into the sand pit and forces us to experience the sensory deprivation of the protagonist.This simple film becomes a complex study of human nature. This is a great analysis of the power of psychological terror. The breaking down of the human will and self imposed morality brought about by our fight against our evolutionary roots. The sand slowly, methodically and endlessly strips and beats away our hero's layers of humanity and reveals the animal under the clothing of civilized man. One of top 20 favorite films of all time.

		<fullReview>This film is a masterpiece. It deals with the most profound feeling of mankind: freedom. It is not the common spoken freedom, but the interior one. How can a man surpass such a misery of being kidnapped, thrown into a pit with a strange and forced to work without rest with no expectation to be released? The unredeemable destiny. First the desperation, then malcontent acceptance, and finally the triumph of knowledge. The jail though physically present, is gone. Useless to hold him anymore, he will not go. He has the key to free all of his capturers, water! They need him now more than he has needed them before, and also there is his son and his beloved woman. All other problems are diminished and he is free to choose accordingly his conscience, that is the uttermost freedom anyone can have.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best "Twilight Zone" Serling Never Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had always been curious about this film and how Teshigahara managed to wrangle an Best Director Oscar nomination among the likes of William Wyler, John Schlesinger and David Lean. Then as now, you can always count on the Academy's Directors Branch to throw an annual monkey wrench into the serene, meatheaded commercialism of the rest of the nominees."WITD" may be thought of as an incredible "Twilight Zone" episode. The simplicity with which the scientist has been captured is quite stunning, yet his ultimate acceptance -- even embrace -- of his predicament comes as no surprise: he wanted a simpler life, away from the demands of the "certificates" he groans about as the film commences, and he gets it! "Be careful what you wish for..."Actually, I half expected the scientist to discover that he'd been trapped in a glass, corked jar not unlike the insects he has captured himself; it's one of the film's marvelous metaphors for the meaningless/fulness of human existence, for and against the nature that prevails over us all. And it's yet another reason to lament the persistent commercial dreck Hollywood releases with such distressing regularity. (Seen "Payback" yet? No thanks!) But then as now, it's the commercial dreck that prevails: Teshigahara, as did the three directors previously mentioned, lost the Oscar to Robert Wise for (yeesh!) "The Sound of Music." The vast multitude of film viewers may never, ever see this film and yet insist that they "truly love movies." If you see this film and truly enjoy it, you'll understand just how wrong the multitude is... </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Devastating allegory</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An amateur entomologist scouring remote dunes is press-ganged by villagers desperate to keep the sand from subsuming their homes. He is placed in a pit with a widow who he is to help bail out sand.There are some clear moments of eroticism between the pair reminiscent of the sensuality present in a contemporary film, 'Onibaba', by Kaneto Shindo. However I think this part of the film is overemphasised by reviewers/marketers. It's clearly very secondary.The storyline is a little troubling for me, I was not sure whether Teshigahara was trying to film an escape thriller in the mould of Papillon or an allegory about the human condition after Kafka (perhaps the film is deliberately made at two levels?). Regardless of this what truly marks 'Woman In The Dunes' out as a classic is its decadent and nihilistic camera-work, shooting the film full of breathtaking austerity. The montage at the beginning where the camera jumps out from a single grain of sand to an entire dune system is one of the best I've seen from cinema history. The pictures of sand flowing are truly gobsmacking. The way that the cinematographer finds abstraction in nature reminded me of an early piece of experimental cinema, H2O (1929 ? Ralph Steiner). Eiji Okada as the teacher/entomologist Niki Jumpei paints a portrait of a self-immolating man. Along with a devastating lack of spirituality that leaves him entirely unable to cope with his predicament ? mirroring perhaps the position of the secular consumer in modern society ? we see a man without connections who nobody searches for, who's perverse ambition it seems is to appear as a footnote in an obscure entomology textbook. We see that he is totally unable to connect to the woman he is imprisoned with (played by Kyôko Kishida). Indeed he is happy when she has to be taken from the pit for medical attention because it leaves him alone to get on with what he wants to do uninterrupted. His growing monomania with the geology of the pit is in marked contrast to her pathetic need for his companionship. There is much in this depiction that would alarm the feminist film historian. I found it hard to explain the role of his wife/widow(?) who appeared in flashbacks/visions at junctures in the movie, she seems not to be part of Jumpei's motivation to escape. Her memory appears to be more of a trinket than something alive. An important part of this movie is the soundtrack by Tôru Takemitsu, whose nihilism I find entrancing. Almost as good as Takemitsu's soundtrack to Shinoda's 'Ansatsu', another great Japanese movie from 1964.This film is a portrait of modern human egocentricity that staggers with its depth of despair, the only film I can truly compare it too in this respect is Bergman's 'The Silence', though 'Woman In The Dunes' is even more palpable. I wouldn't recommend viewings of this to the suicidal. The point where Jumpei escapes from the pit a second time, and then returns of his own accord for me was deeply traumatic. The duality of the movie switches from allegorical to philosophical at this point, which can be a bit confusing. It is a terrifying thing to give up on life, to become institutionalized so to speak, possibly we all might recognize this in ourselves. For me this film filled me with a lingering horror of immense proportions, you have been warned!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Allegory of men and women at war amid the inexorable march of time.A nameless man is fooled and trapped into a relationship with a woman. She feeds and bathes him. He makes love to her and longs to flee. Social mores interfere and force him to stay put and accept his lot, which is infused with an uncomfortable sense of life's being damned unfair.This man has illusions of grandeur within his field and dreams of one day getting his name in a book. (He'd like to think he's more significant than one of the bugs he studies.) He had been an educator and a researcher and is none too keen about having to work for a living. Yet without breaking a sweat, he begrudgingly realizes, he'll die.A never-ending lust for escape eats at the man's soul -- "my blood is going to rot!" -- while his mate harbors a fear of being alone. He is so fixated on himself that he will humiliate and shame his partner, if necessary, to get what he seeks.At first it seems as if the wider community serves to uphold the social contract. Only later do we learn that the town fathers are really a bunch of bored-out-of-their-gourds sadists.In the end, existence isn't very meaningful in this universe. The woman is carried away to some unknown and uncertain surgery, while the man, finally freed from his flight compulsion, finds succor in the minutia of a project.It's all so very senseless.This depressing and nihilistic film is stunning in parts, but also overly long and repetitious. I'm glad I saw it, but I wouldn't want to sit through it again. And that, the writer and director would probably agree, is exactly the point.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The 30 Greatest Films Ever Made, Continued</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(part of 30 essays I am writing on the "30 greatest movies". They are written in no particular order) For a "30 Best" Films list, this is a bit of an unusual choice, but I would have it no other way. Long after seeing this, the lonely shots of sand, water and wind remain in my memory. This is a haunting film that refuses to be forgotten.The film grabs us in as soon as it begins. An entomologist (that's bug collector to you) is wandering some lonely sand dunes near the ocean. Already anyone who has appreciated films like "2001" and the Terrence Malick films for their stunning visual beauty will already be interested in this film. Hiroshi Segawa's cinematography beautifully captures the dunes in somewhat fuzzy black and white photography. Am I ranting? Maybe. This film probably deserves a bit of a rant.That night he is offered a place to stay by some local villagers, who have him stay with a somewhat strange woman...I'd rather not tell you more of the plot, and encourage you to avoid reading a synopsis of it. Because this is a movie, something happens that is not great news to out entomologist. Its more fun if you let the events play out in front of you however, so I'll leave it there....which also means I'll have to keep this review more or less pretty short. One of the most haunting images in this film involves the entomologist in ragged clothing, stumbling away in the desert, not quite sure where he's going or if he wants to get there.Behind the camera, the entomologist is played by Eiji Okada (Hiroshima, Mon Amour), and the title role is filled by the wonderful Kyôko Kishida. The film was directed by Hiroshi Teshigahara, who, in a rare and great Oscar surprise, was nominated for Best Director.I hope this film isn't too hard to find for you. However long the search, its worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of the weirdest Japanese movies I have ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a good movie but it is so strange and different from any other film that it is hard to rate it for IMDb. The plot is just so strange! An entomologist is out collecting specimens in a dessert region when he falls into a deep pit in the sand. At the bottom, is a house and a woman who has apparently lived there for many years. When he tries to leave, he finds there is no way out--as the more you shovel at the sand, the more sand pours in to take its place. Only later does he learn that the woman is also trapped and they were deliberately placed there for very selfish reasons, indeed! The good performances and captivating nature of the film are enough for me to recommend it. However, if you rarely, if ever, see foreign films, I'd try another (less weird) one first--maybe a Kurasawa flick. Then, give this one a try.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How can I explain - without spoiling the premise - what makes this one of the most utterly engrossing films I've ever seen?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kobo Abe's "The Woman in the Dunes" feels like it should already be part of the popular consciousness - like it was required reading in high school or something - part of everyone's shared cultural iconographic understanding. But what a delight it is to discover it unexpectedly, a little later in life when I can fully appreciate it! Humans' ability to adapt - like an insect - in harsh environments, one's gradual acceptance of one's circumstances and comfort in a routine which stifles ambition... These ideas get under the skin, the setting seeps into the unconscious mind like sand - sand which I can never look at the same again!Teshigahara's film adaptation - in which Abe was directly involved - is faultless; it has to be the most successful realization of a seemingly unfilmable book ever made. That they managed to bring this location to life, and make it absolutely believable and real, is an astounding feat. With perfect cinematography, a perfect score by the legendary Tôru Takemitsu, and fantastic performances, this is one of the greatest films of all time.I first watched the film four years ago, and I was blown away. I was absolutely glued to the screen; I'd never seen anything like it before. Now I've recently finished reading the novel and subsequently watching the beautiful new blu-ray version of the film. And I am further convinced: there is absolutely nothing like "The Woman in the Dunes". The novel or the film.The film moves briskly through the events of Part I &amp; II of the novel (which is about 200 pages), spending more time on covering the crucial Part III (which is only 30 pages); it inevitably misses a lot of the psychological side of the book, as well as the sense of how much time is passing. So I highly recommend both, novel and film. I won't go so far as to recommend starting with one or the other, but in either case I do suggest you try to go in knowing as little as possible.I've done what I can to avoid giving away the plot in this review. Let it surprise you, and you may be as blown away as I was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb adaptation of a brilliant book. And don't worry, it's Japanese.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd like to emphasize one thing about this masterpiece that "critics" here seem to forget; it's the fact that this is one of the three or four movies in history that was adapted from the book in a way you can only dream of - fully consistent with the written story and with use of crucial dialogs same as in the book (not changing a word in most cases). I've read the book first and it obviously awe me. Then I went to see if there was a movie made - it seemed impossible for me to transfer this Kafka sand-driven story into film. And funny enough, after initial shock that the film has actually been made, I saw that it was a Japanese director who adapted a Japanese book and my expectations about the picture suddenly raised (thinking "well if a Japanese filmmaker who understands Japanese and world culture far better than the rest of the world does, film might be watchable.") Then I saw the movie. And than I watched it again. But this is not the main reason why I decided to post my comment; other comments will tell you all you need to know about this glorifying piece of cinema. I just want to stress out how good this superb adaptation of a book is with a following question: How many times you've read a book, picture the story in your head, then watched the movie being made after the book, and found out that the scenes in your head perfectly match with the scenes in the movie? Most answers would probably be: never.If you only watched the movie, dig up this superior Kobo Abe book, and see for yourself - in reverse direction - what director has really achieved here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>With and against the sands of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Early on in Hiroshi Teshigahara's "Woman in the Dunes" we see entomologist Niki Jumpei lying in a broken boat which is entirely covered by sand. He looks forlorn there in the desert, lost on his search for new specimens of beetles that would bring him forward in life, or so he hopes. But what's for sure is only that he'll miss the last bus home. Niki looks stranded, physically and metaphorically. And yet, among the dunes, he has visions of the past - of a woman, of a relationship that went awry, now covered by the sands of time. Maybe nobody tried to uncover what has always been there between these two, maybe it's in the nature of things that everything will eventually be covered by dust and just has to be accepted the way it is. Later in the film we would see Niki dream of the sea, symbol of his freedom, of escape, of leaving the dunes behind forever. Ah, how he would long for the sea! But will he ever reach it? Because the time has come for a haunting reevaluation of life and the relationship with a woman - in a prison made of sand...Teshigahara's film, based on Kôbô Abe's novel and screenplay, is a realistic story, however parable and philosophical exposition of the human condition at the same time. It's rare that a picture can be read multiple ways without losing its power when seen from different angles, but Teshigahara's film meets this criterion with ease. As minimalistic as its basic idea might sound, it literally entraps its viewer in its claustrophobic environment, consisting of just two people, and sand, sand, sand, the puzzle of human existence buried with it, hopelessness written all over it. In his philosophical essay "Le Mythe de Sisyphe" existentialist Albert Camus concludes that one must imagine Sisyphus to be happy. Sisyphus, the man condemned by the Gods to roll up a rock on top of a mountain, watch it roll down again and start over, again and again. Sisyphus, a happy man? A contradiction? Not really. Man needs to find reasons to justify his own existence in the absurdity that surrounds him, Camus would argue. One of the reasons might be found in Teshigahara's masterpiece: There's someone who shares Sisyphus' predicament: the one suffering on his side, also known as "The Woman in the Dunes".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice movie, although long and sometimes very frustrating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am rating this movie high because it is an old movie and both the atmosphere and the script are original. But, damn, this was a frustrating movie. That guy wouldn't think straight for a second.Short story long, a guy is trapped by some weird villagers and forced to excavate sand every day. He stays together with a woman, also trapped, but born and raised there and calling the old ruined house her home. Slowly, a relationship develops between them and the guy remains there, even when given the chance to leave. It's like a Japanese Wicker Man, without the killings.There are a lot of metaphors that might be interesting. The Kafkian analogy of men and insects; the pervading idea that life in the city like an automaton is nothing less than slavery, so you might just as well exchange it with some other form of slavery, it remains the same thing; the title that explicitly points to the woman, making her the reason for both the story and the man's behaviour.However, the film lasts for a little more than two hours and it's black and white. The soundtrack creates a truly eerie feeling, but gets bothersome after a while. And the way the guy accepts his captivity like a trained dog offends me.Bottom line, since I haven't read the book to compare it with, the movie is interesting both visually and ideatically, but you must have the time and mood to see it. If you like Japanese movies, you should definitely watch it, if you are not sure, better leave it for when you are.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie aimed at the subconscious.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie was very long. Obviously meant to be an allegory and full of symbolism. Not all of it was lost on me, though why it had to drag on for 2 hours and 28 minutes was. Overall it was a good movie. I thought that the camera work was very good, the costumes excellent (though it did occur to me that poverty suggested in the movie wasn't reflected in some of the kimonos shown).The interplay between water and sand was interesting. The movie was understated, moved slowly and had very little action between action sequences. The action sequences in the movie were predicated on inaction - it was the nothing before that made the squeak seem like a roar.Definitely a movie that works on the subconscious level. I'll have to see how it sticks with me. In the mean time, Thumbs up; but I wouldn't want to see it again. If you read the plot synopsis that follows, you'll see why.Plot synopsis: The main character, a school teacher with a profound interest in bugs in out in the desert looking around for specimens. He lies down to take rest, and misses the bus back to the city - Tokyo or some such.Some men come along and offer to help him find shelter for the night. They take him to a pit at the bottom of which is a hut and woman who lives there. She welcomes him to her home, makes him food and offers him drink. There are ominous allusions to the fate that awaits him in the rest of the movie.She is digging sand, placing it into a dumbwaiter/pulley system that first night. The next day he is expected to do the same. There is no way out of the pit. The rope ladder is gone. He tries to escape. Fails. He continues to struggle against his fate. Food and water rations run out. Sexual tension grows between him and the woman. Wrestling, washing and sex ensue. We are enticed by the images. He succumbs to his fate, to the extent that more rations are granted. He continues to search for a way to escape.He escapes. Encounters quicksand, is rescued by his tormenters (the villagers), and taken back to the pit. There he is building a trap for crows. A bucket buried in the sand. It fills with water, due to osmosis/pump action; its a freaking desert, and earlier in the movie much is made about how every thing rusts and rots there. This pump action explains it.The villagers want to see the two of them have sex; if they do, his request to see the sea for an hour a day will be granted. He tries to rape her, but is too ashamed/human to follow through. It definitely relates to the sexy imagery we saw earlier in the movie - begging one to reexamine the response it first generated.She gets pregnant, and there is a life threatening complication. She is removed from the pit, and the ladder is accidentally left in place. He goes out and looks about at the sea, and then climbs back into the pit. He wants to stay there, so that he can tell someone about the neato discovery he made with the water gathering device, and perhaps there are other reasons for his staying. They are left to the imagination.The final shot gives a time frame of at least 7 years that the man has been left for missing by the authorities.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Niki Jumpei is an entomologist out searching for insects in the sandy desert. He misses the last bus home and winds up being the "guest" of a woman living at the bottom of a large excavation some twenty feet in the sand below the desert. When Niki goes to leave, the rope ladder he came down on has been removed. So, he is stuck down there and spends a good part of this two and a half hour movie trying to get out of the hole. If that setup does not appeal to you, then you might give this a pass. This movie produced such a sense of claustrophobia in me, that I had to pause it about half way through to go out for a walk.The relationship that develops between Niki and his host (not always platonic) provides some interest, but the real heart of the story centers on the changes in outlook that Niki experiences after being in the pit for several years. I greatly appreciate a story that is believable but also works as allegory, like Camus' "The Plague," but here we have an unbelievable story that is bent to support an allegoric interpretation. We are exhorted to discover that we can find meaning in a restricted sphere of experience. This is not a novel idea and I find it ironic that the artists who advance this theme usually are leading full, rich lives. The black and white cinematography is a plus. The opening scene focuses on a grain of sand at a microscopic level and then the camera draws out in a sequence of shots that finally wind up with a desert shot. A goal throughout the movie must have been to photograph sand in as many creative ways as possible. The sparse score by Tôru Takemitsu is notable.I felt sorry for the actors who had to spend so much time in the sand. They must have welcomed a good shower after a day of shooting.I think that the reason that this film gets consistently high marks is because that someone who is familiar with the plot and still chooses to watch it is someone who would be inclined to like it. I thought that that would be the case for me, but it wasn't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A fine film with beautiful images, mounting intensity and some effective semi-stylized dramatic moments - all on my favourite theme: the human condition.Unfortunately, my personal 'neuroses' prevent me finding it great: - It is too long at 147 minutes when 85 would have been more than enough. Sure, at the end we feel like we've been dragged through the sand, but I already felt like that after ten minutes.- Supernatural elements (the shaking of the house) only compromise the meaning of the film. I suppose the Japanese just found it necessary.- It is all too derivative of my hero Samuel Beckett and replaces his irony by the overearnestness of the horror genre. The story follows the book by Koko Abe (a shameless Beckett imitator) written the year after Beckett's Happy Days (in which a woman spent the whole time slowly sinking into a mound of sand). Coincidence? I think not.- It is a one-idea film. The basic idea is presented in the opening scenes and persists until the end without any surprising philosophical development (Beckett lovers may find the end facile and predictable).An example of superb film-making compromised by lack of originality of ideas and some editorial over-indulgence. Still, it does what it set out to do very well indeed. A superior film - I just wish it were great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suna no Onna should be translated as "The Sand's Woman."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't think "Woman of the Dunes" is a good translation of the movie's Japanese title. Translated directly it should read, "The Sand's Woman." This more accurately describes what the movie is about. The hyper-realism and psycho-sexual imagery in this movie were well done. But the story didn't interest me that much perhaps because I couldn't believe that the characters would really behave that way. And of course loose sand can't maintain walls as steep as the sides of the pit in the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just a bit over rated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Made in 1964 "Woman in the Dunes" was nominated for the best foreign language film at the 1965 Academy Awards which it lost to "Ieri, oggi, domain" (Italy) with Sophia Loren and in the 1966 Academy Awards it was nominated for Best Director which it lost to Robert Wise for "The Sound of Music".In Japan it is known as "Suna no onna".The first thing about the movie I noticed was on the DVD cover it had some quotes from some pretty impressive sources, such as Time Magazine, The New York Times, and Daily News. Given that it certainly warranted a viewing.The plot of the movie is strong for the first thirty minutes but really loses steam as it goes on. I was under the impression it was a horror "style" film but I would have to consider it more a cross between drama and adventure?stronger on the drama. I don't want to say it was a bad movie because it really wasn't but it just didn't hold on to me after that first thirty minutes.Perhaps a student of film or one who has an adventures taste in movies might find "Woman in the Dunes" worthwhile or even a masterpiece, but I'm afraid it wont be very impressive to the vast majority of movie goers.I viewed "Woman of the Dunes" on the "Milestone Collection" DVD and wasn't to impressed with the picture quality itself. Much of this has to do with the movie which it seems about half of which was at night and the visibility or clarity was terrible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Review is a REALITY CHECK</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is not good for most people, and, in fact is not good by almost any measure (acting, scripting, story telling, costumes, sets, etc), except one.The one place where this movie shines is the unequaled monochrome cinematography, which is perhaps the best ever. So, if that is something that interests you, or, if you are a student of film then by all means watch and enjoy. Otherwise, be prepared for boredom and silliness.Finally, I have to mention that the most offensive element of this movie is the premise. It is ridiculous by any measure and has no place in a serious work. Every time I've described the greatness of the cinematography to others, their interest in seeing it falls to zero as soon as they learn about the plot. Enough said.</fullReview>
