		<shortDescription>Some uncomfortable moments with this one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is incredibly cruel and unrelenting. It plays as a single feature divided into three sections: "Dumplings", directed by Fruit Chan of Hong Kong, "Cut" directed by Park Chan-Wook of Korea and "Box" directed by Miike Takashi of Japan. Each section is like a dissertation in horror, although "Dumplings" could also be classified as an exploitation film.All of them are beautifully produced and directed, and I especially found "Box" to be quite lavish in sets, costumes and atmosphere. They each show a lot about the culture of the respective countries they were made in and also provide new takes on the terrifying and the appalling. They are each original in their own right, although "Cut" could be compared to the "Saw" or Hannibal Lecter franchises in that there's a psycho who's trying to get a message across by way of murder and mayhem.I don't want to give details on the plots of any of them because I think that viewers need to experience them for themselves with no preconceptions going in, but what I can say is that "Dumplings" has the most plot and is probably the one with the highest "squeam" factor, "Cut" covers a rather familiar premise but with lots of fun moments (you'll see) and "Box" is more of an artistic endeavour with not much of a plot, but for some reason I was enthralled and couldn't look away; it's the one I liked the most.A solid 8 out of 10 for the efforts of these genius Asian directors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, just went to go see these three shorts last night, which are about 45 mins a piece. I agree that "Cut" was one of the most enjoyable horror experiences I have had since High Tension. Takeshi Miike is probably the biggest name in the Asian horror biz, but I have to say that I miss the style of his earlier work, like Audition and Happiness of the Katakuri's. "Box" was very strange but it leaves little explanation for what has actually occurred, and I wish it delved a little deeper. And oh my! Mr. Fruit Chan, I have never heard of you before last night. "Dumplings" was by far one of the most deranged things I have ever watched. And the sound that was used in this short was was of the most intense, stomach curdling noises that are still sticking with me today. This was a very fun watch, and I am glad I got to see it before it left the theater. My recommendation....don't eat a big meal before you start!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic ... simply fantastic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The idea of having Chan-wook Park, Takashi Miike and Fruit Chan as part of the same DVD set is enough to warrant a purchase. This was the sole reason I watched these three shorts.While Miike's offering was very enjoyable, and had some interesting scenery and Chan's Dumplngs was also very entertaining, Chan-wook Park stole the show in my opinion.I now wonder if CUT isn't what SAW should have been.......?Unfortunately I can't speak on the film too much as I could ruin the story, but if you are a fan of either OLDBOY or Sympathy for Mr Vengeance this short IS A MUST. Chan-wook Park continues to impress me with his creativity, and the camera work in this film was GREAT. There are two directors that I currently find to be very interesting, and I will watch anything they produce. Micheal Haneke is one, Chan-wook Park is another. I have heard rumours of Sympathy for Ms Vengeance, and I can only hope they are confirmed.This was an easy purchase.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disturbingly good movie!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an excellent blend of three horror films that characterize the ideal representation of Asian cinema. Each story is presented with ordinary people displaying qualities of evil and depravity. These directors use powerful cinematic storytelling elements in exploring their genres. This is not an ordinary horror film with a ghost or a slasher/killer with a knife but a combination of people who are capable of psychotic behavior. While all of the films are not perfect and contain some mildly dull aspects, watching all three will leave you intrigued with the art and approach of the horror genre utilized in various countries Asia. If you can hold your stomach through the first film "Dumplings", you will certainly enjoy one of these stories and won't be disappointed. A disturbingly good movie!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Anthology, Must See</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>watched "Three... Extremes" last night, and it was insanely good. All three stories I thought were very thought provoking, and again a little frustrating. Here's a short review...Box-Takashi Miike (Japanese Language) This is a nightmarish tale of a woman's horrifying dreams becoming reality, but then again, maybe not. That's the difficulty with this story, there is so much surrealism, that it's hard to tell. I liked the story, some of which was very frightening. The ending however is completely totally bizarre, and it totally left me clueless as to what Miike intended for the viewer to take away from this, if anything. This is the weakest of the three stories, but still very interesting and definitely requires multiple viewings.Dumplings-Fruit Chan (Chinese Language) This little story is my favorite of the bunch and also very very disturbing and pretty gruesome. Not because of gore or anything like that, but because of the subject matter. It's no secret or spoiler that this movie is about vanity and a women's need to enhance her physical appearance to try and win her husband back from his whoring around. It concerns as most of you know, the grisly meat a former lady abortionist uses to treat her rich clients vanity needs. This movie made me squirm on more than one occasion as the woman chomps down on the dumplings with a wicked crunching sound of tiny bones. This story has a lot of humor but it is very dark and totally black humor. Some may call it totally sick humor, and all would apply in my opinion. The ending is very confusing for me, especially one particular scene and I hope somebody explains it to me. I'm not talking about the grand finale, where the leading lady commits the ultimate gross-out, but the scene with all the blood where some guy has been attacked by a women. This appears to happen at the apartment of Aunt Mei, and then it shows her packing up and leaving. What was that all about? Who was the woman covered in blood, and the guy that was attacked? Anyway, the grand finale as Ching looks directly into the camera and commits what must be THE ultimate sin is flat out creepy as hell. Excellent short story, and now I'm thinking whether I need to see the extended version.Cut-Chan-wook Park (Korean Language) Now this is one gruesome story, which revolves around a movie director (Lee) and a former extra of his that's gone completely insane and terrorizes the director and his wife at their home. Park's short story touches on adultery, relationships, regret, fame and childhood memories - as well as featuring amputation, torture, child abuse, and a crazy set - as Lee and his kidnapper spar until the shocking (but not altogether satisfying) end. In fact, the ending is the only bad part about this otherwise intriguing story. This is the most graphic of the three stories, and the most brutal. But the twists and turns that happen towards the end, tend to confuse the whole story. Nevertheless, this is a great little horror movie, and now I'm very hyped to watching my new DVD of Park's "Oldboy".Summary This is one of the most entertaining dvds in the horror genre to come out of Asian for a long time. With three short movies totally over two hours, it makes a great evening of demented entertainment by three exotic filmmakers. The second disc which contains a text portion which explains the plot of each story, and then a "Making Of" extra for all three stories is very good. It's always interesting to see how these directors work and the interviews with the actors is excellent. The other thing I found interesting with this package, is that each movie is in a different language which intrigues me. Since I'm watching so many Asian movies recently, I find the languages of the Chinese, Korean, and Japanese to be so different, but then again similar. This is especially true with "Cut" which has the psycho maniac speaking in a totally different Korean dialect which is almost funny to me being a Westerner, and the other actors speaking in the standard Korean language. Not sure why they did that, but the interview with the actor playing the psycho said he had a very hard time learning and speaking that interesting dialect. I had to watch several parts of each movie over again after I finished the first viewing, because it's pretty hard to figure out what the hell's going on with one viewing. I'll never forget those chilling eyes of Ching in the closing scenes of "Dumplings" and that crunching sound as she enjoys her latest and most extreme serving of dumplings. yum yum........</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Three short films that are plenty extreme</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three short films that are plenty extreme and if the endings of all three leave us wondering maybe that is good. I did however find the end of Cut more than a little baffling. There again 'unsatisfactory' endings of Eastern films as judged by Westerners is nothing new. All three are beautifully shot with great camera-work and excellent use of colour. I found Miiki's the most perfect if not as much like his usual output as many would like. Park's Cut is a little pedestrian at times but so gloriously over the top and bewildering at others. Dumplings is a little predictable and I am surprised that it is said to still work at 90 minutes as it seems very much a single idea film. It's a good idea though and not without social interest and it has to be said the grossest of the three. The sound of tiny bones being crunched - aagh!! I watched all three on separate occasions, fearing that otherwise they might blur into one another - no fear of that though so I'll watch them again soon, all together. Good effort by all concerned</fullReview>

		<fullReview>3 extremes were 3 short stories about extreme situations. Each story has very different qualities and gave the viewer something to enjoy. Not American style, scream queen, psychobabble laden horror films. More intellectual and artistic as the characters are made to look good rather than deviant. Shorts were you can turn off the subtitles and still understand the plot are hard to come by, but these fit the bill. I wish I could speak the languages of the films because the English translation detracted from the emotional content and context. If you like slasher movies and jump out of your seat scary, pass on these. If you like more artistic, intelligent, and subtle horror films, then these shorts are for you. Some blood and minor amounts of gore. A job well done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbing and Intense Trio of Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This compilation movie of three horror stories is dark and disturbing. The first story concerns a woman's greed for beauty and the bizarre path she takes to get it. The second story centers on a director who gets held captive by a film extra with an agenda. This leads to torture and a strange game of cat and mouse. The final story regards a writer with a twisted past. This part is surreal and at times awkward in storytelling and direction. I enjoyed this film as a fan of the horror genre. The elements of surrealism and paranormal activity were effective in each story. While the movie did have a relatively slow pace, the intensity of each stories climax made for a fulfilling watch. Recommended for fans of Tales from the Darkside, Tales from the Crypt, The Twilight Zone and admirers of Takashi Miike and Chan-wook Park.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>more a drama than a horror movie, dumplings is so wonderfully acted that his strange subject have become believable and disturbing . The picture is astonishing ,the color perfectly fit the backgrounds so that it creates a special atmosphere. for the fans of gore don't't suspect a lot of goo. But still, a couple of scenes will disturb you.. Very intelligent, this movie provides a lot of thinking; incest, abortion, cannibalism and the search for youth are the topics approached. Those taboos will make you see horrible things that happens in everyday's life around the globe. The use of the incredible music is done with professionalism so it helps a lot on the spooky mood of certain scenes. The end pour vrai l?.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Three Short Films By Three Talented Asian Directors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A short synopsis and vote on each of the 3 films in THREE...EXTREMES:BOX (Takashi Miike) - Kyoko is haunted by the accidental death of her sister. She has severe nightmares and has a hard time differentiating between her nightmares and reality. How much of what Kyoko envisions is dream, and how much is reality... 7 out of 10 DUMPLINGS (Fruit Chan) - centers around a woman who uses a sickening "special ingredient" for her dumplings, which causes age-reversing effects in those that eat them... 8.5 out of 10 CUT (Park Chan-Wook) - A film director who apparently lives the "ideal" life, is thrown into a hellish nightmare when he is confronted by one of his previous employees... 8.5 out of 10I enjoyed THREE...EXTREMES for the most part. Each film had a unique style and vision, and all were good in their own way. I preferred BOX the least because it was the most slow and plodding, and it was the one I could make the least sense of. In fact all 3 films have strange, abstract endings that leave a lot open to individual interpretations. I have read many peoples ideas on the endings of each of these films, and many reviewers have some decent insights - but I still think it's up to the individual to take what they will from these films. Also, BOX has the "creepiest" atmosphere, but the least actual violence. DUMPLINGS had a very sickly humorous, almost exploitative feel to it. In fact, the whole time I was watching it, I was thinking "This would have made a great premise for one of the mid-90's Hong Kong Cat III films"- it just had that sort of feel to it. DUMPLINGS, in my opinion, had the most "squirm-inducing" scenes, although they were not extremely graphic and mostly implied, and were apparent due to the subject matter of the film. CUT had a good story and a decent amount of gore (though nothing "too" out-there...)and really just needs to be viewed to be "understood".All the films in THREE...EXTREMES have some decent things going on, although as much as I like a lot of Miike's work, BOX just didn't do a whole lot for me - but DUMPLINGS and CUT were definitely worth the price of admission for these films. 8/10 overall - definitely recommended</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Third One Matters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wonder what is behind projects like this. I suppose because it is easy to attract talented filmmakers to do a 45 minute project. Such a thing is usually under our expectations of "long form" meaning that the cinematic effect can be direct and uncomplicated.I thought "Eros" was extremely interesting in the freedom it gave its directors. Three men usually obsessed with elaboration were freed from that expectation and could give a poem rather than a novel. The results here are mixed though. That's because Asian horror is often never long form at all. Its one scene extended for a long time and surrounded by explanation. The disk that came to me had "Dumplings" by Chan first, then "Cut"and "Box" last.Dumplings was for me the most fascinating. I'm challenged when I see multiple versions of something and among the most interesting of these is two versions of the same film by the same filmmaker. I had seen the extended "Dumplings" which I assume was filmed at the same time and simply edited differently. It had a completely different feel to it in the long version. The unsettling thing about that was that it was more real. The sound effects of the eating and the copulation were identical, a remarkable effect. In this version, its more otherworldly, and there is one special effect at the end that underscores this and for me took all the horror out of what the woman was doing at the time. Its still Chan and why I watched the disk.Second up was something from Korean Chan-wook Park I know only his "Old Boy" which is a remarkable mix of junk and genius. The setup here is mostly on the junk side. You can skip it if you watch movies the way I do.The amazing surprise for me was Takashi Miike's "Box." I was very impressed with "Audition," but for some reason haven't followed up. He's amazingly prolific and it seems that he doesn't think things through before he starts. But this little thing is nearly perfect.Its a Japanese ghost story with a twist that makes it even more sharp. Its cinematic at its center. You can literally watch it with no voice. Its beautiful, and I will include a few of its scenes in my list of films that handle fabric architecturally. (In this case that includes plastic sheets.)Its folded in the way I study. It involves three persons, a family. Performers. It involves them performing for audiences and each other, connected by performance, sex, kinship. We have performances of all these types, dreams, visions, hallucinations all neatly nested within each other. Physically, you will see that "in a box" will have several meanings, along the lines of groundhog day (so as not to spoil it), body, enclosing space and spiritual being.It really is perfect and lovely and haunting. You will watch it over and over.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching. &nbsp;</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sick fun with artistic style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Box..Takashi Miike Miike's entry in this Asian horror anthology was the most visually inspired, I thought. Very surreal imagery punctuates this tale of a young woman, Kyoko, who placed her twin sister, Shoko, in a box as a youngster which led to the girl's death and eventual haunting of the adult Kyoko.I had no idea what Box was saving itself up to be until halfway through and I was pleasantly surprised--up until that point where it all clicked, I thought it was just some J-horror ghost story. I should've known better with Miike. The goodness of this short paved the way for the loveliness that followed it. 8/10.Dumplings..Fruit Chan Aunt Mei cooks up some sumptuous vittles to please the stomachs of her aging clientele and keep their snappers snappin'. This delightful showcase of Asian delicacies had me clamoring for the phone to order wonton soup and fried pork dumplings from the Chinese store at 10:30 PM last night. Oh man, was this a good 'un.I loved this segment from start to finish. It was too gross and wrong not to love, really. I'm hungry again just thinking' 'bout it. 10/10.Cut..Chan-wook Park Korea's contribution to this anthology is a giallo-flavored charmer peppered with sweet set-pieces and sick, sadistic twists. This segment is about a director who is toyed with by a low-life extra from his movies who begrudges the rich man his fame, money, and his easy entry into heaven.This one had a little bit of comedy to it that worked with the outrageous violence and shocks. Beyond that, I can't say too much--it was all money. 8.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbing and effective, but also rather simple omnibus</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Known as Three... Monsters in Korea, where I bought the DVD, Three... Extremes is an omnibus horror film like Twilight Zone: The Movie and similar omnibus horror films, containing multiple shorts, often unrelated, with separate casts and actors.In this case, we have three notable directors from east Asia: Japanese director Takashi Miike, Hong Kong director Fruit Chan, and South Korean director Chan-wook Park. Each presents their own short visions of horror, although perhaps it's more appropriate to say that although these are horror movies, they are more disturbing than outright frightening.The first short, entitled Box, by Takashi Miike, relates the story of a young writer who is having some difficulty distinguishing between her dreams and reality. It's the most supernaturally oriented of the three films and the most ambiguous. There are no particularly outright scare moments, but the ambiguity of the story and the elements of the story are why the short can be a little disturbing. Primarily contemplative in nature, it's ambiguity also serves as its foil, as it's hard to draw anything more from the short than simple emotion and a sense of confusion.The second short, entitled Dumplings, by Fruit Chan, is undoubtedly the most disturbing of the three. The film actually deals with some particularly relevant issues, particularly the things that we do to be considered attractive and to return to former glory, but the means by which the film makes such a commentary is very unpleasant. I'd have to say that it's a pretty effective film, but certainly not enjoyable. I've discovered that a longer 90+ minute version of this film exists as well and it'd be interesting to do a study comparing the two--if I could ever handle watching it again.The final short, entitled Cut, by Chan-wook Park, is the the most lively and comical of the works. Wrapped in a maniacal revenge story is a comment about the nature of evil, in particular, the reasons for which evil is committed. It's certainly the most glossy of the films, utilizing CGI effects, an elaborate set and dynamic camera-work. The short is weakened by the ending, which doesn't appear to be prompted or meaningful, and we can only guess at the reasons for which the ending occurred the way it did.All in all, the three shorts are fairly effective works and compose a whole by their disturbing nature. There is nothing particularly compelling, also Dumplings does make a particularly strong effort and Cut is particularly vibrant, if a little shallow. Either way, if you're looking to see three notable east Asian directors give their disturbing short takes on horror, this is almost as good a place as any to see it. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mixed bag that ultimately disappoints</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This intriguing showcase of three short films from Asia's primary horror directors is, in most, a hit-and-miss affair ranging from the downright shocking to the disappointing. The series, when watched on the R4 DVD, begins with the Hong Kong segment by maverick Fruit Chan. In classic Cat III form, we are dealt intense subject matter and some scenes of extreme perversity in Chan's 33 minute DUMPLINGS, which revolves around a backyard abortionist who has found an elixir of life in the form of eating fetuses. Some of the set pieces in DUMPLINGS are pretty extreme - the abortion scene is one of the sickest scenes to come out of Asia in 2000s and certainly one of the most perverse set pieces to be commercially released for the Western world. Of lesser extremity is South Korea's segment CUT. Directed by Chan Wook Park of OLDBOY fame, this sees a crazed extra hold a director and his wife hostage, simply because the filmmaker is 'too nice' and makes him look bad. CUT is the most conventional of the three and, save for some quintessentially Asian horror moments, plays out like a slick Hollywood thriller with some Hostelesque torture sequences. Finally there is BOX, the segment I was most looking forward to by famed Japanese horror and yakuza director Takashi Miike, renowned for his overly violent genre pieces. The convoluted plot of BOX circulates an author who has been living as a recluse all her life after the untimely death of her sister. This segment is truly terrible and lets the whole trilogy down. It is so boring, so mind numbingly sublime that it makes the final forty minutes spoil the culminated two hours. Not only do the segments play out from most extreme to least but also from best to worst: DUMPLINGS is the most accomplished and is truly disturbing stuff. If you can find this and Park's episodes individually, jump at the chance, for lovers of Asian horror will not be disappointed. But avoid Miike's BOX at all costs because, for me, it spoiled the whole film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best of the best of Japanese horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Title: Three...Extremes Directors: Takashi Miike, Chan Wook Park, Fruit Chan Review: As of late Japanese horror directors are hot as hell. American horror directors have known this for some time and some have even gone as far as trying to add Japanese sensibilities to their films. First guy to come to mind is Eli Roth with his "Hostel". Sadly Roth couldn't really get it right. Hostel turned out to be a bad imitation of a J-horror film mixing Japanese style gore with frat boy mentality. It doesn't work, because for the most part these J-horror films aren't so much about gore or violence. Yes, they have the gore, but its not ONLY about that. They have more of a psychological thing going for them and not only that but they have something to say about society. Something a bit different then just having your average day killer going around killing teenagers, though I don't mind a dose of that every now and again. "J-horror" keeps blowing away anything that's being made in American horror films of today. I know that's a very common statement being made these days, but it is very very true. Sadly most American horror films are commercial throw aways that nobody will give a crap about after a few months have passed by. But that's not the case with some of the horror directors emerging from Asian cinema today.Case in point the film Three Extremes which unites three of the best Japanese horror directors working today. Takashi Miike whos name is practically a house hold name amongst horror film fans. He is the man responsible for such great horror films as Audition, Ichi the Killer and Gozu among a gazillion others. Then we have Chan Wook Park who shot straight to stardom with his incredibly unforgettable Oldboy. Which by the way is a film I strongly urge anyone who hasn't see it yet to do themselves a favor and go and rent it right now. And last but not least Fruit Chan, the least know of the three, at least to me anyway. The film is divided into three equal parts each part directed by a different director, an anthology film if you will.The first story is Fruit Chan's "Dumplings". A story about an aging actress who is searching for a way to stay young. When she comes across a rumor about a lady who makes these special dumplings that help you maintain a young appearance she quickly jumps at the opportunity. Whats in the dumplings? And are their any side effects to taking them? That's what shes about to find out. This story is a great way to start the film. Its funny cause at a glance the story appears to be a "light" and somewhat comedic little story, yet before you know it, the story ventures into dark dark territory. Stick through to the end for this one and you will be shocked. I promise.The second story in the film is Chan Wook Parks tale entitled "CUT". This story is about a young horror movie director who is making a vampire film. The story opens with one of the scenes from his movie and let me tell you, I know it's a movie within a movie type of thing, but that movie that the director is making looked freakin awesome. It's almost as if director Chan Wook wanted to say "I don't make commercial horror films, but if I did this what it would be like!" Those first opening minutes are awesome! After that we follow the director as he closes down the set and encounters a truly screwed up extra that has appeared in all of his films. What follows is a story filled with some great social commentary on the frustrations of an every man who's life didn't turn up as grand as he expected. This story blew me away with its visual style but I expected nothing less coming from the director of Oldboy and Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance.The third story is Takashi Miikes tale simply called "Box". A story about two twin sisters who live in a circus with their dad. One of the sisters is a tad jealous of the other and goes to extremes to quiet down her jealousy. This story is visually stunning, but then again, it appears that this was a pre-requisite to make this film since all three short stories are equally good looking. Of course this story goes into freaky territory with an incestuous sub plot, but coming from Miike, that sort of thing is to be expected. Still, I think that this story was mild with its violence and gore coming from a guy know for his relentless and extreme use of blood and gore. I guess Miike was going for a more psychological, elegant and slick style. He really was shooting for something more artistic this time around.All in all, this is a fine anthology film. It united some truly amazing talent and the result is nothing less then one of the best horror films of the decade. I highly recommend this film to anyone who is tired of watching horror films marketed for little kids. If you are searching for something artistic, horrifying and with something to say, then by all means indulge yourself in "Three Extremes" a fine example of how Japanese Horror is kicking American Horror firmly in its ass.Rating: 5 out of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding Top Quality Horror Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one very slick and glossy horror film that will challenge many Western viewers, particularly the more provincial-minded. It should shatter some prejudices and put a serious dent in some chauvinistic preconceptions.Overall it is very artfully sexy. The actresses are beautiful; the actors are movie star handsome. The costumes, sets and photography are lush and sensual. The production values are as high as you can get in any movie, let alone a horror film. The final episode rivals Fellini's Amarcord for the sheer beauty of some of its imagery.The first of the three stories relies heavily on irony, with its most powerful images as subtle as they are disturbing. The second one is more bombastic, and caters to the "Saw" crowd with its sadistic bent and convoluted story. The final story meanders and is perhaps a bit perverse, depending on how far you let your imagination roam to fill in the gaps.I would caution that this is not a film for 12-year-olds having a sleepover. Not that it's too disturbing, since it's softer than most. But other than the second segment, it's probably too subtle. It's more likely to please sophisticated adults with a worldly view, looking for a sumptuously hedonistic slice of dark drama.

		<shortDescription>Three unique visions of horror.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three...Extremes is an anthology of three horror films by three respected Asian directors.&nbsp;"Dumplings" - Directed by Fruit Chan In Dumplings, an actress who has entered middle age and begun to lose the attention of her husband to an affair with a younger woman visits Aunt Mei, an old woman who still has the looks of her youth. Aunt Mei has a secret recipe that makes anyone look years younger, but such an unnatural benefit comes from a truly abominable source. I found Dumplings to be absolutely stomach-churning. A horror movie that doesn't even attempt to scare you, but actually tries (and succeeds, in my case) to horrifying you. Not for the squeamish. Even the sound effects eventually became almost more than I could bear. Disturbing and entertaining. - 8/10"Cut" - Directed by Chan-wook Park A talented director and his wife are taken captive by a murderous, utterly insane movie extra. Cut is darkly comedic, utterly absurd, and far more meta than the other movies in this collection. It took me a while to figure out whether I liked it or not, but by the end of the segment, I was won over. Like Dumplings, Cut isn't frightening in the conventional sense. Instead, it's flat-out zany (in a good way). - 7/10"Box" - Directed by Takashi Miike The most haunting of the three segments. Box is about a jealousy-fueled tragic accident involving two young sisters. The surviving sibling suffers from suffocating (literally) dreams and disturbing visions of her deceased sibling, even years later as an adult. Box is probably the creepiest of the three, and it has a psycho-sexual aspect to it that makes the whole thing even more unsettling. Definitely more of an atmospheric, "mood" movie than the other two. - 8/10I liked all three segments, as well as the movie as a whole. I found Dumplings to be the most effective/entertaining, but I recommend the entire anthology. The three short films are not only memorable and very different from one another, but they're also fairly unique among the other horror movies that I've seen.&nbsp;Overall - 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When three famous Asian directors work together to make a three part horror film you know you're in for a good ride. Written by Fruit Chan, Chan ?Wook Park and Takashi Miike they each have their own 45 minute slot to make you cringe with fear yet cannot turn away, three films entitled 'Dumplings', 'Cut' and 'Box'. The first film of the three is 'Dumplings', staring one of People Magazine's "50 Most Beautiful People in the World 1998", Bai Ling and Miriam Chin-Wah Yeung. We follow the story of Qing a retired actress trying desperately to win her husbands love back with various anti ageing solutions. When she hears about Aunt Mei's Dumplings are the best things to regain your youthful looks, she knocks on the flat door of the unusually young looking Aunt. After consuming a number of Aunt Mei's dumplings for a couple of weeks she starts to develop some unusual side affects. Because of the great success of this film, the director went on to make a feature length version of 'Dumplings' with a run time of 91 minutes. The next instalment of the three is 'Cut' directed by Chan-Wook Park (famous for his Vengeance Trilogy) and stars Byung-hun Lee and Won-hie Lim. One way to describe this section of the film is the Asian version of 'Saw'. It tells the story of a director on the set of his latest film, but he's not to do work. he has been kidnapped by a jealous extra in his films and put into a life threatening situation, hands bound and a rope around his waist he is set a task, on one side of the room is an abducted girl and on the other his pianist wife, both of them securely tide up. The director must decide to either strangle the little girl, or his wife gets a finger chopped off every five minutes. I had a lot of problems with this story, first of all there were a collection of open flamed candles behind the director, I'm sure he could have used those to burn through the ribbon joining his hands together, and also there was a number of times were the extra came so close to the director that he could have easily swung for him, instead he just listened to him talk. After I put both of those things aside I really enjoyed this short film, it had some very tense parts as well as some strong horror, 15 minutes through you get sucked in and wish it also had a separate feature length. The third and final part is by Takashi Miike (most famous for Audition and Ichi the Killer) his film is called 'Box' this story contains a woman's worst nightmares as they become reality. Staring Kyoko Hasegawa as struggling writer Kyoko, the story mostly focuses on the flashbacks of her childhood when she ran a sideshow act with her sister and father. The shows success is great until the attention comes away from 10 year old Kyoko and onto her sister Shoko; her jealousy causes her to play a nasty trick on her sister that goes horribly wrong. I looked forward to this the most of the three and was the most disappointed, there was hardly any dialogue so most of the film was purely based on assumptions, and it also got quite boring watching the same flashbacks over and over again. On the other hand people that I watched this with found it to be their favourite; I guess it's a love-hate kind of thing.Over all I give this film 7 out of 10, manly because of the first two films, they each got you involved with the characters and had a great ending, the third made me drop the score by a couple of marks, if they had 'Dumplings' as there final piece I would have enjoyed this film a lot more, a good thing about the films is the length of them, as some of the times you may not have the time to watch a two hour feature you can choose to just watch one of the stories and turn it off afterwards. I do recommend this film to fans of horror or Asian cinema, if not then try something new, this films a good catch and worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Saam gaang yi", a.k.a. "3 Extremes", is composed of three segments(1) "Dumplings", by Fruit Chan, is the best segment. I saw the complete film ("Jiao Zi") on 25 August 2007 on DVD released in Brazil with the title "Escravas da Vaidade" ("Slaves of the Vanity"). The gruesome tale tells the story of an aging actress that seeks out a mysterious woman that cooks dumplings with a special ingredient that rejuvenates those who eat them. My review is available in http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0472458/reviews-21(2) "Cut", by Chan-wook Park, is a tale of cruelty and insanity. An insane stranger breaks in the house of a film director and ties him up with his wife and a boy in the room. The strange tries to force the director to kill the boy, otherwise he will cut the fingers of his wife that is a pianist.This segment is very cruel and insane, and has a surprising conclusion.(3) "Box", by Takashi Miike, is a confused tale. The twenty-five-year- old writer Kyoko has nightmares with a box and also with her sister Shoko. One day, she receives an invitation to visit the place where she saw her sister for the last time.This segment is messy and predictable, with a disappointing conclusion. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): Not Available</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Three?Extremes (2004) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Three Asian directors were brought together for this horror anthology, which makes recent American films look like the work of Ed Wood and Jerry Warren. The first story is Box from director Takashi Miike, which is the story of an adult woman who's haunted b her dead sister. The second film, Dumplings, from director Fruit Chan, centers on an aging movie star who starts to eat secret dumplings so that she can regain her youth. I won't mention what these magical dumplings are made of. The final film, Cut, from director Chan Wook Parks, has a crazed extra kidnapping a horror director and making him choose between killing a child or having his own wife tortured. The weakest film for me was the first one from Miike, not because it's a bad movie but because the last two are simply brilliant works that are damn near masterpieces. The Miike story has some very creepy moments and his direction is right on the mark by building up some wonderful atmosphere. The film dealing with the dumplings was just downright disturbing, gross and in some ways very shocking. I wonder how many people have stopped or walked out of the film at the point when the secret is revealed? The third film is one people should compare to the similar Saw. Everything wrong with that film and its sequel are fixed in Cut. I viewed the Asian cut of this film from a Hong Kong DVD, which features the stories in the order I mentioned. I believe the American cut is in a different order.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Three extremely great films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's almost impossible to talk about Three Extremes without going through each one individually, because thee short films do not link in any way and are all brilliant stand-alone works. But it's also important to judge it on an overall experience. Although each film is different, I couldn't imagine watching one without the other. They some how all feel similar in tone and style, without them feeling all the same too, which is exactly what's needed for an anthology film. All three films are of such a high standard and it brilliantly showcases the Asian talent on horror.Dumplings sets the tone for the rest of the series perfectly. It's not as distinctive in its directing or style as the other two (I'd never heard of Fruit Chan) but nevertheless it tells a rather brilliant story that goes places many film makers wouldn't dare to go! There are some seriously sick moments that will stay with you for quite a while afterwards and it makes you wonder what sort of sick mind would think this up! Nevertheless it is highly original and very disturbing, which is what good horror is supposed to do. There are some strikingly creepy moments such as when the actress stares at you straight into the eyes. It's brilliant story-telling. 8/10 Cut could very be my favourite out of the bunch, but I'm really not too sure. It captures Park's visual flair and style brilliantly with some exhilarating camera shots. I also liked how Cut managed to get a lot done despite it being set mostly in one room. Again it features some striking imagery and some sick decisions in the vein of Saw. Cut was also really quite funny at times and for me I think that the mixture of humour and horror did work in a weird way. The ending however is quite mind-boggling but that's not to say it's bad. Let's not forget the first brilliant 35 minutes or so! It's incredibly tense and easy on the eyes. I enjoyed Cut a lot!9/10 Now I can't work out whether I liked Box even more? Box is definitely the most visually striking of the three and is even more extraordinary as it features very little dialogue. There's some beautiful scenery such as the beautiful snowy locations and the dark circus tent. Box is also definitely the most confusing of the three. The narrative plays out almost like a puzzle which you must piece together and interpret in your own way. Nevertheless the scenes it does provide are highly atmospheric and sometimes played out in complete silence making them very eerie indeed. I think that you'd get the most out of Box when watching the trilogy again, because you'll be able to think of things and piece things together that you didn't before. It's a beautiful piece of work and is more like art really with its striking surrealism. 9/10Overall I could very happily watch feature length versions of all three short films and I know that a feature length version of Dumplings is out there! It could be a great introduction to Asian horror for an Asian horror virgin as it shows the great care and quality that goes into their films. They're all original pieces of work and I'd happily watch them again. This is probably the finest anthology work I've ever seen, although some people may find them too bizarre and confusing!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw this with the wife. Interestingly, she was grossed out, but enjoyed it. ****Possible spoilers ahead***Think of this as "Creepshow", but more disturbing on a mental level. "Dumplings"--the HK extreme-- will definitely gross out the average viewer, but can be seen as an allegory to the trends of beauty today. "Cut"--the Korean extreme--brings some of Park Chanwook's themes of the "Vengeance" trilogy into a 40 minute segment. Very nerve-racking. "Box"--the Japanese experience--pretty standard Miike a la Gozu. But extremely entertaining.While nowhere as disturbing as "Audition", these three would pack a wallop in any American theatre.

		<shortDescription>Three Directors, Three Stories, Three Visions, Three Extremes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three...Extremes is a film with three different stories being told. Dumplings, Cut and Box. All of which have a horrific tale routed in it's story.Three extremes take two talented directors and one unknown (from my perspective anyway) and let them carve their own original piece of a puzzle that fits together in Three...Extremes. While I'm still impartial to Miike, he does have talent. He has beautiful imagery in his films, it's just that they also tend to have some story lacking. With his short, BOX, Miike gets you to think about what the outcome is going to be. His films are always twisted in some kind of way and asks the audience to look deeper into what they just saw. With BOX, he ultimately disappoints with the ending. Cut, the second short directed by Park has an uncanny resemblance to "SAW", as some might say. It deals with the psycho kidnapping someone and getting them to play a game, or someone dies.CUT was my favourite segment out of the three and throws the viewer a curve ball at the conclusion. Which leads you to believe one of two things. Do you believe the events that you just saw and take them as face value, or is there some mind tricks at play. Finally, the first short actually, is Dumplings from Fruit Chan. A name I never heard of but would like to hear more of. Dumplings doesn't have the edge that CUT has, or the beautiful images that BOX has, but it does have the disturbing factor. Which lands Dumplings in the good books.CUT is my favourite segment and Park did a great job at hinting that the film is not EXACTLY what it seems and it has the "oh so cool" factor that this film needed. BOX, being the second film that I've seen from Miike still leaves me in the grey with him. I want to seek out more of his work, but am hesitant because it hasn't impressed all that much. BOX isn't all that bad, it's just not all that good and the viewer feels cheated by the end. Some might feel the same with CUT and be left very confused with the actions of some characters, but it worked out it's in favour for some strange feeling.I'm going to let the cat out of the bag and tell you what Dumplings is about...eating aborted fetuses. Gross? Yes. Disturbing? Yes. Why did I like such a thing? Fruit handled it very well, I have yet to see the full cut of the short but it leaves me wanting to know more. The ending...again with these endings, left me very confused. What was with the tongue? It didn't flow with the rest of the film? Is she human?Finally, if you're a fan of Asian cinema, give this a little taste test. It's three for the price of one, and you'll get some sort of enjoyment out of at least two of them. If you're the type that is uneasy hearing the crunching sounds of a women eating an aborted fetus, you might want to skip these and look for Bambi.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rather underwhelming Anthology effort</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three stories told by emerging Asian directors.The Good Stor(ies)-Dumplings-Finally fearing the advances of age, a middle-aged housewife seeks the advice of a local chef renowned for her curative and seemingly magical dumplings. When the strange dish starts to work, the two begin spending an increasing amount of time together which finally lets her in on the gruesome secret to it's spicy flavor. Overall this was easily the best of the three and really the only one with any kind of merit. The main part of this one is based on the concept of her appearance against the stereotype, which manages to get some great work out of the burgeoning mystery of what she uses to prepare the dish. Once this is finally unveiled and there's the whole truth revealed, it manages to utilize this quite well with the actual revelation sequence coming off as a wholly intense and disturbing sequence that really feels like it gets away with a lot as it's quite a dark and chilling explanation. While the rest of this isn't all that great, especially all the adultery angles throughout here which aren't all that interesting by taking up a large portion of time to get to a mild-mannered resolution, this is still the best part about this whole effort.The Bad Stor(ies)-Cut-Returning home from a movie shoot, a big-time director finds himself and his wife kidnapped and held hostage on the movie set by a deranged extra. Forcing him into a series of extremely brutal games, he gradually begins to uncover the real reason behind the encounter. This one was just lame and completely unworthwhile as the biggest factor against this is the main plot for it. It's simply not scary as the rationale is so inherently stupid it's a wonder it made it through to the final approval, the purpose of performing the capture and torture just don't make sense and the whole thing could've been ended on numerous occasions without any harm done had there been more interest in removing himself from the situation without regard for his captors' well-being. Still more flawed is the fact that this one then spends an indefinite amount of time recounting a series of grievances against each other doesn't tend to make this move along at the briskest of paces. Likewise, the fact that this is billed as having him torture them for their behavior and position in society then skimps out on the torture leaving only the impact of their final retribution against him as the only gory bit in the whole story just seems completely infallible. All in all, this was a truly terrible segment.Box-Tormented by strange dreams, a woman begins to feel as though her twin sister has come back from the dead to haunt her. Trying to find the confidence to shake off the experience, she finds her closer than she initially expected. Once again, this is another just truly outright terrible segment as the main focus here is again completely removed from horror. The only real interesting part of this is the back-story explanation for their situation as the two sisters performing a ballerina routine succumb to jealousy from misappropriated preference towards their father and the resulting encounter one day unleashing an accident that consumes one in a hellish blaze, but beyond that this is just so slow that it's agonizing to get through yet is the quickest one running time. The long sections of wordless moments that pass by are just dull and lifeless, and there's even less to like about once this tries to become interesting as what happens isn't really horror anyway. This is a curious and questionable inclusion that really lowers this considerably.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Language, Brief Nudity, a mild sex scene, strong themes of incest and pre-natal mutilation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Outstanding Asian Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Three Extremes" is a collection of three short horror stories. Rather than repeating the same review three times, all three segments of this film can be summarized similarly: These three tales are all masterfully produced, seamlessly cast, and flawlessly produced. The acting is superb and directing is first class. What struck me most about these films was the beauty of the cinematography. The colors and textures were exhilarating; each film was almost a hand painted work of art in motion. Such emotion... Such clarity... It was stunning to see such intelligent brilliance on the screen. And remember, this is for all three films.... "Three Extremes" is intelligent horror that would more justly be classified as disturbing and bizarre than any form of scare fest. But it's this disturbing psychological horror that makes these films so unique and interesting to watch. The first story is "Dumplings" by Lilian Lee. "Dumplings" is the tale of a beautiful woman that starts to age and attempts to regain her youthful looks by consuming very special dumplings. Not only are these dumplings expensive, they are made of a very rare ingredient considered taboo to consume in almost all societies. While she does start to regain her youth, the secret ingredient proves to have very strange side effects.The second story is "Cut" by Chan-wook Park. "Cut" explores the anger of a movie extra whose life has been a miserable existence since birth. The movie extra decides to take his lifetime frustration to the attention of a renowned director that he has worked for on several occasions. The failures of the movie extra's life has caused him to spiral into to a deranged rampage of anger, and he chooses the renowned director and the director's wife to share his pain and anger with. The third and final film is "Box" by Takashi Miike. "Box" is definitely the most abstract of the three films. The story is premised around a mysterious writer that experiences recurring nightmares about a tragic accident that befell her family in a mystical magic act. The death of a family member during the accident haunts the writer, not allowing her to rest peace. "Three Extremes" is another example of outstanding Asian horror which seems to have taken the lead in producing the most outstanding of modern horror films. What has happened to American horror production anyway? Very few horror films released and made in the US since 1995 can compare to what has been coming out of Asia recently. "Three Extremes" in made up three very intelligent and unique horror films. I couldn't find anything to complain about with any of the three and would highly recommend this film to those US horror film goers that are as fed up as I am with US based horror cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>East-Asian Sensibilities of Dread and Unease...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Note that these shorts are not "extreme" horror films in the American sense. The film that comes closest to contemporary American sensibilities in this vein is the South Korean one, "Cut."Namely, if you're a strict fan of recent American "scare-core" movies and you don't particularly go for foreign films, you should probably steer clear of these. Otherwise you'll probably yawn and feel gypped because they don't scare you out of your skin. (But please take note that they don't intend to.)These films are more unsettling and eerie than horrifying in the way that American audiences have come to expect in the horror genre. With the possible exception of "Cut," they are not mini "popcorn films" and should be watched with silence and an open mind."Dumplings" is very strong; it immerses you in the unique (and close) ambiance of its setting. The pacing of the plot is also good. "Dumplings" seeks to make the audience feel vaguely sick and recoil rather than scream or skip a heartbeat. It has a very sly, dark sense of humor running through its core."Cut" also has moments of levity and twisted creativity and is entertaining. There's something almost baroque about the visuals and it's got a denser, more packed plot than the other two shorts. Ultimately, I found it less effective than the other two pieces, which opt for the understated instead of overt "extremes." I liked the very beginning of "Cut" the best, with its strange and alluring female specter; I found myself wishing the filmmakers had developed this scene as a narrative instead of the main story."Box" is more similar to "Dumplings" in feel, being dreamy and surreal; however, you are invited to inhabit the main character more. The film is a psychological drama and relies heavily on its use of wintry imagery and symbolism, which makes it an engrossing experience. Ambiguity and the audience's projections on the story are crucial; especially toward the end. You might recognize some visual motifs from other Japanese works such as the original versions of "Dark Water" and "The Ring" ("Ringu.") None of these is a "popcorn" flick, with the possible exception of "Cut." I recommend "Three ... Extremes" for fans of East Asian cinema and also aficionados of foreign films in general.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well first off i would like to say that this film was a beautiful display of genres. They way all three Asian directors captured light shadow and color was like looking at visual poetry. I felt all directors had their own take on how horror or drama and comedy should be portrayed and they brought it out very well. The biggest surprise in this movie to me is that the most violent and gruesome of directors Takashi Miike didn't display ultra images of violence, he didn't go over the top to try and gross the audience out he just stuck to the twist and turns of the story and he created a pretty usual short of his nightmarish ballad. The other two Fruit Chan and Chan-wook Park made there short highly grotesque with images of bloody infants and disturbing dissections of body parts. Therefore this film only went extremes with two directors not all three. In conclusion i felt it deserved an eight because of its acting, Cinematography, Direction and the conceptual aspects. Go see this film its amazing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Three...Extremes is an Asian shock-cinema sampler that might leave the uninitiated wondering what all the fuss is about. This compendium of short works by an all-star team of Oriental directors - Hong Kong's Fruit Chan, Korea's Chanwook Park (or Park Chanwook if you prefer), Japan's Takashi Miike - gives barely a taste of what these filmmakers have to offer, a nibble of the frenzied energies, the sadism, the existential nuttiness that makes extreme Asian film so perversely amusing to those who are into that sort of thing.The first short, Dumplings, is by the least well-known of the directors, Fruit Chan, but is probably the most successful in pure storytelling terms. It's about a fading TV star who, in search of a youth-potion, something to make her alluring again to her Anderson Cooper-looking husband, becomes a customer of the pretty but devilish Aunt Mei (played with a measure of restraint by exhibitionist wacko Bai Ling), who offers magic dumplings (they look like fleshy objects made from vagina-molds) stuffed with chopped-up aborted fetuses as a cure for being over-the-hill. This idea, the witch who serves children in her dumplings, has a dark fairy tale quality, which Fruit Chan has the good sense to not play up in literalistic fashion; he attacks his unnerving, repugnant story the only way it can be attacked, head-on, playing chicken with good taste, the audience's gag-reflex, etc., The story's real subject is narcissism, the vanity of the TV star with her feminine-but-business-like outfits, her red designer hand-bag, how she's willing to do anything to stay young, what this says about the mania for youth and sustained sexual drive in today's culture. The real "magic" of the fetus-dumplings is that, in eating them, one goes so far past any recognizable limit that it then becomes a breeze to be assertive in bed, no longer sweat small stuff like not being as attractive as you used to. There's a Cronenbergian dimension to this fable, the horror of the body in a state of violation, the fetus as a kind of parasite. It's determinedly repulsive.The second episode, Chanwook Park's Cut, begins with one of the crazier images around: a man stands motionless in the middle of a big, sparsely decorated apartment, his neck being nibbled by a pale, garishly attired vampiress; the camera circles the two figures until we realize the man is, literally, frozen solid, a human popsicle. This audacious opening is probably the best thing in all of Three...Extremes; the story it leads into, the travails of a movie director who's kidnapped by a psychotic extra and forced to watch as his wife has her fingers lopped off one-by-one, alas does not live up to it. Dumplings may be a fairy tale, but Cut is more of a sick joke, a little in the tradition of Park's Oldboy (the director must spend half his life dreaming up outlandishly elaborate revenge scenarios) but not as staggering in its elegant disjointedness. Given Park's talent for manipulating space and time, it's a tad disappointing that he chooses to restrict himself mainly to this Chamber Drama set-up, one room and a few actors, the opportunity to compose a few bizarre tableaux along the way (a guy restrained by a super-sized rubber-band, a girl at a piano with her fingers held in place by wires like the victim of a giant arachnid). Park goes after his favorite theme of ensnarement, how people are driven to act by forces beyond their control; the room becomes a microcosm of Park's world, one where people become each other's puppet-masters, fueled by class anger, envy, the thirst for retribution. After the feast of Oldboy, Cut feels like lukewarm left-overs.And speaking of leftovers, that's about all that remains by the time we get to the third segment, Takashi Miike's Box, some tripe about an ex-circus performer (the delicately beautiful Kyoko Hasegawa) beset by ghosts from her past, some horrible guilt about murdering her sister, circus imagery made slightly more interesting by its Japanese flavor but still feeling like Jodorowski on sedatives thanks to Miike's deliberate pacing, his utter indifference to story, sense, audience patience. The guy who gave us the chick drowning in a kiddie pool filled with her own excrement, the chick who fell in love with a guy's penis so much she kept it with her after he was dead, and the dude who slashed his own cheeks so he could open his mouth wider and swallow people's heads whole might've been expected to provide the piece de resistance, but offers instead the dud finale. Maybe it's the old story of the showy actor who underplays to get attention; Miike has such a reputation for outrageousness that he figured the only cool thing would be to play against type, not splash blood all over the place, show people torturing each other in outlandish ways, have main characters sprout weapons in place of their appendages in lieu of a proper ending. Three...Extremes, as one might have predicted, is uneven, only spottily satisfying as a shock-cinema experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stuff like this makes me question if it's possible it could ever be made in America. Sure, we have David Lynch, Guy Maddin, even David Cronenberg, adding to our wonderful world of extremely disturbing for the sake of disturbing film-making, but could they go to this level? Or am I being unfair to say that this is a different level? It could be the same intent with a different approach...We have three segments, each "extreme" in their own way. The first, a shockingly gross-out horror film involving foetophagia (pardon me my neologism if there happens to be a real word for said consumption out there), is about all the wonder in blood and gross biological matter you can possibly compress into gut-churning madness. Too bad it doesn't really have much more to it than that, because honestly once you get over the initial "gut" reaction, there's not much more to care about... no spectacular cinematography, nothing really amazing in performances... no real reason to be a movie as opposed to a photograph, a written story, a bad tale told over candlelight. I'll just pretend it's all symbolic of the current issue over stem-cell research and leave it at that.The second segment, by the wonderful Park Chan-Wook of Oldboy fame, gets a little better. Our little friend Park has an eye for torture, I see, as now it involves a movie director and his wife tied to his own house-like set, a disturbed extra putting him through physical and emotional turmoil. This one has no long-winded development of psychological torture-by-hypnotism, this is straight out lose-if-you-do, lose-if-you-don't. The focus on the stage lighting and the levels of truth and deceit make it an interestingly post-modern look at spectatorship, as now these characters are forced to look at each other take up and remove their costumes in a twisted dynamic. Too bad that theme isn't really developed much more than just being there, because again, this film has a little bit less in terms of cinema. It has some neat tricks here and there, just nothing to write home about.The third segment, and my favorite, is from my man the amazing Takashi Miike of Ichi the Killer fame. A much more atmospheric and involving film, indeed, this is the story of a woman who dreams fitfully about her accidental murder of her twin sister at the age of ten, with a slightly more complex plot involving a circus performer and pedophilia. Mostly films that turn out to be "just a dream" are kind of disappointing, but this has something fresh to add to the group. It also has the most to offer cinematically, with real care put into editing, production design, imagery, juxtaposition, and whatever possible to embellish mood. Of all the segments, this is the most artsy and lovely, and really a good end to round up the features we've been subjected to.Overall, don't expect to eat comfortably after viewing this film. Not gonna work out well. I wouldn't expect the most amazing stuff awaiting you, but on the other hand if you're the type to be absolutely fascinated by the places the human mind will go, see how you handle this. The Marquis de Sade would be proud.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Austin Movie Show review (sick...in the best way possible)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three directors from three different countries made three separate films (around 40 minutes each) and put them together to create one hellacious and twisted film that continues to shock and disgust, shock and disgust, shock and disgust, over and over. These are the three films that collectively make Three?Extremes: The first film is Hong Kong director Fruit Chan's Dumplings. A woman who feels old and ugly because of her adulterous husband will pay anything and do anything to look younger. She'll even knowingly eat dumplings filled with aborted fetuses. Oh, it's heinous! You see the abortions, the fetuses, and you hear all the slurping, chewing, and crunching. It's nauseating and twisted, but also says a lot about China's over-population and the resulting abortion culture. Fascinating. Definitely my favorite of the three films.Next is Korean director Chan-wook Park's film Cut. A professional movie extra kidnaps his director and holds him and his wife hostage on the director's current movie set. His wife is tied to a piano and the kidnapper forces him to kill an innocent child, or else he'll chop off his wife's fingers. Fingers are blended in a blender, people are strangled, and necks are bitten off. If you love human flesh mutilation, you will love Cut.Box, by Japan's Takashi Miike is the most psychologically haunting of the three films. A quiet, soft-spoken girl has a recurring nightmare about being buried alive in a box in the snow. But why, oh why, would she have such a wacky nightmare? Did something horrific happen to her when she was a child? Something involving boxes and dying? I don't know. You're going to have to see it to find out for yourself.All in all, Three?Extremes is disturbing, disgusting, brilliant, and chilling. If American movies are just too wussy for your taste, try an Asian film. Or better yet, try three films in one. It's sick?in the best way possible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mixed Reviews, But Makes an Impression Nonetheless ? 6, 8, 7</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this Asian trilogy of terror a couple days ago with my buds, the Oscillator and Mr. VMU. The Oscillator was impressed by the Japanese one. Mr. VMU liked the Chinese one. My favorite was the Korean one. That makes three viewers, each liking a different segment of the trilogy. As a litmus test, it just goes to show that different people are always coming from different perspectives. Without a doubt, THREE EXTREMES will elicit three distinct reactions from your tripartite gut. What else would you expect from a trilogy where each short film comes from a different country?First of all, I thoroughly enjoyed the juxtaposition of Chinese, Korean, and Japanese cultures, and I hope to see more in the future. What would I recommend for future CKJ trilogy releases? Horror might be the genre to stick with, maybe something set in medieval Asia, warlord style. Maybe something with Genghis Khan and Francis Ford Coppola vampires. But before I get carried away, I had better check whether THREE EXTREMES made money at the box office. I'm supposing that it did not.Dumplings (6.0) Fruit Chan, director of Public ToiletBoth the Oscillator and Mr. VMU were impressed by the shock value in the first installment. I agree, some of the scenes strike the nerve like cold lightning, but I wanted more shock. There seemed to be a lot voodoo floating around, what with the cursed fetus and all, but it pretty much went over my head. I have to admit, I'm not up to speed on my Chinese voodoo. Unlike the latter two short films, Dumplings features select scenes taken from a longer full-length movie. I think watching the whole movie would fill in some of the holes where I was plain lost. What are these dumplings supposed to do? Why don't they work? Who are these people?Cut (8.0) Chan-Wook Park, director of OldboyThe Korean installment features some lengthy sermons. The villain goes off ranting about the nature of society, so on and so forth, as the bound Byung-Hun Lee listens helplessly. I got kind of bored by the speeches myself, but after THREE EXTREMES was over, I realized that I liked Cut the best out of the three. It reminded me of the existential plays that Tom Stoppard used to write. The symmetrical film has four characters, two of which are bound and gagged. The weird, absurd situation produces a cozy environment where we can explore both the humor and terror behind psychosis. As Sartre said himself, hell is other people.Box (7.0) Takashi Miike, director of Iishi the Killer, Audition, Visitor QI have a feeling that Miike is the main reason most people come to watch THREE EXTREMES. Besides, who really prefers Chinese or Korean movies over Japanese film anyway? Box is slow and quiet. That's all well and good, but during the whole installment I was waiting with breathless anticipation for needle-point shock. I'm sad to say that, there is no shock. Most of the terror comes from hidden uneasiness as opposed to in-your-face grotesqueness. I really wanted to see the bag monster from Audition. Thus "Box" gets a lot more interpretive than I had hoped for, and that means it gets boring. I am also not a fan of Atsuro Watabe, the male lead. His acting is annoying, and more often than not gets on my nerves more than the coat-hanger does.JYJimboduck-dot-com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THREE...EXTREMES is a horror anthology featuring produce from Hong Kong, South Korea, and Japan. I was pretty exciting about watching this, as I'd seen THREE EXTREMES 2 previously (although that 'sequel' was actually made first) and enjoyed it. Plus, Takashi Miike and Park Chan-wook contribute two of the instalments, so how could this be bad? Well, it's not, but it is a little disappointing because it's not brilliant. It's just average. As the title would suggest, the emphasis is on icky stuff rather than genuine bone-chilling horror, and what plays out is rather predictable and has more than a few problems.The first segment of the film is DUMPLINGS, in which Bai Ling's back street abortionist serves up special ingredients in her food, food which has the power to restore youth to those who eat it. This segment was also released as a full length film which I've already seen, and the full version is much better, fleshing out the characters and plot quite considerably. If you like this, I'd recommend getting the real thing as this is merely a taster.The second story is Park Chan-wook's CUT and is the one I found particularly disappointing. It's a single location thriller in which Lee Byung-hun (A BITTERSWEET LIFE) and his wife are trapped in a room by a maniac with murder and torture in mind. Chan-wook creates a visually arresting story but the script is pretty silly and feels way too artificial with little connection to real life. You can almost feel him trying to work out how to include more and more bizarre and surreal visual stuff into his tale but it's at the expense of a proper story.The last story is the Japanese BOX and my favourite of all. Too much is made of a rather familiar twist ending, but the central tale is a ghostly one with a great back story. Two sisters are circus performers and contortionists, fitting their slender bodies into tiny little boxes, until one fateful night when tragedy hits. There are some very spooky scenes here, like with the box lid opening, and as a whole this is a great addition to the J-horror genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Three Extremes" is an interesting experiment in horror. Although over the years we've seen quite a few Asian fright films brought to North America, mostly in the form of remakes like "The Grudge", "The Ring" or even, *gulp* "One Missed Call" but this anthology is something new. There are some truly unique concepts here and fans of American horror films will leave thinking "why can't we get stories as frightening as these?" I thought the first two stories "Dumplings" and "Cut" were so good and so original that I feel compelled to show this film to anyone that has even a passing interest in the genre. The downside is that they show off all too clearly the flaws in the third short, "Box". I wouldn't have such a problem with the final story... if I could actually understand what the heck is going on. It's either too subtle, or badly put together by Takashi Miike because I listened to the commentary and still can't really make heads or tails of it. Ordinarily, a weak conclusion would demand this get at least a star get knocked off, but even with that final tale, there are still plenty of good moments and since you can easily watch these out of order (I'd say third, second, then first works best) or skip the last one altogether this film, which genuinely made my skin crawl more than once earns itself a perfect score.

Here is not a joker in a Halloween mask, scaring screaming teenagers, but adults whose needs and weaknesses turn on them with savage, relentless logic. I imagine "Three... Extremes" will attract some customers who thought they wanted to see a horror movie but find they're getting more than they bargained for." All in all, this is a fine anthology film.

		<fullReview>#1 - Good story - you can't cheat fate - but the ending was confused. Looks like it ran out of time (turned in to a full movie afterward on), and a scene was included at the end with an early character that totally confused me. And the very final scene suggested a huge chunk of the story had been left out. The reverse-aging of the retired actress was convincing because her neck folds disappeared. Loved the witch, played brilliantly by a foxy actress. 7/10.#2 - Clever post-modern story that didn't really make sense to me in the end. Reminded me of a downmarket Sleuth, so a bit dated except with mild gore. Not bad, but worst of the bunch. 5/10.#3 - Best of the lot. Great atmosphere, uncovering a child killing from years ago. So serene, but with good chopped-up story telling, and almost perfect ending. I think they missed a trick in not going full horror on the box reveal before the final twist - the eye peeking out was a bit daft. And it would have been super creepy if the heroine had been stuffed into the box, as if it were bottomless. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good trilogy of short films, Miike's offering is on top!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching the likes of "V/H/S", I was intrigued in looking out for better horror themed anthology movies. Considering I am a fan of Japanese &amp; Asian Movies, particularly horror, "Three... Extremes (Saam Gaang Yi)" seemed just what I was looking for. A trilogy of short films from Asia's acclaimed horror directors, China's Fruit Chan with "Dumplings", Korea's Chan-Wook Park with "Cut" &amp; Japan's Takashi Miike with "Box". They were a very good combination &amp; do fit the theme of extreme, just not quite what I was expecting in a way. It's more extreme in the subjects within each segment, as opposed to extreme horror. I watched this with no expectations, while I did enjoy the movie, so to speak, I was expecting to be more scared, as opposed to creeped out &amp; disturbed.The first segment, "Dumplings", is a very peculiar story about a woman's need to feel and look youthful, for her husbands attention. She seeks out a chef whose dumplings may hold the key to youth, but little does she know what disturbing ingredients are required for these dumplings. The short had an interesting story, but if anything, did feel a little light. I guess this has been fleshed out a little in the extended feature of "Dumplings" (Which I have yet to watch). "Dumplings" certainly finds its extreme in the subjects the short tackles, rather than any traditional horror shocks."Cut", The second feature of three, is completely different, if not close to traditional horror movies, in it's gruesome scenes, but with Park's own confusing spin on the short. Think "Saw" mixed with Park's own "Oldboy" this story revolves around a movie director, who clearly has a good life, confront the realities of his life, thanks to an extra from one of his movies creating a tortuous "game" with his life. Its quite a bizarre movie, with rather grotesque torture &amp; horror elements, mixed in with some dark &amp; comedic moments, all topped off with a shocking ending, that is open to many interpretations. Again, this movie does tackle some dark subjects, but not quite as dark as the other two shorts. This short is more about visual &amp; confusion elements, something it delivers well.Last, but certainly not the least was Takashi Miike's "Box", my favourite of the three. This is the story of a female writer, and her coming to terms with a strange &amp; significant box from her past and the dreams she has associated with it. I thought the cinematography was excellent in this short, simple things like the jerkiness of the camera to add tension during one scene, to the way music &amp; sound was and also wasn't used in key scenes, really added to the surreal feel of the film. It simply captivated me throughout, with it's atmosphere, grand sets, symbolism and the unnerving feel it gave you whilst watching. Add to this is Miike's trait for leaving his movies open to many interpretations &amp; you have a great end that can be taken in so many ways, with each persons view being different! As much as Its strange to say, I did enjoy this movie, it did achieve what it had set out to do, just not quite like what I had expected. One thing I will say is that if your easily offended or disturbed by taboo subjects, This isn't for you. For those that aren't, then sit back &amp; prepare yourself for three very different short films from Asia's best bizarre horror directors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is actually 3 unique stories released as one film. Each story represents a different "idea" so to speak. Without going into detail per story, each is crafted extremely well in all aspects of true film. Granted, this is a foreign movie, so it is subtitled (the version I saw) but this does not distract to the acting in the slightest. The acting in "Cut" stood out most to me as the crazy slowly fell apart throughout his hostage taking ordeal. "Box" was a cinematography 101 class of how to show style, scenery, and environment to hold the attention to an otherwise fairly bland plot. The startling subject matter of "Dumplings" not only may revolt some viewers, but is also the best of the three to draw you into the story and round it out with quality acting that is very subtle. I suggest you go in blind to this one, as I did, the payoff is quite good. Enjoy. 6.3/10 (original title Saam Gaang Yi)</fullReview>

Let it affect you without prejudice.Phew, this one was a really unique experience. It was a bit like reading short stories in a horror anthology as the stories unfold quite slowly and the whole thing is getting under your skin without noticing it and horror movies hardly ever give this impression. The three stories presented are refreshingly original, very well-written and brilliantly executed with a fine quintessence of Asian horror skills, their atmosphere is extremely disturbing just like the topics they picked. A really positive aspect is that besides being without a doubt horror stories, they all had a thought-provoking message.The bottom line is: very impressive, recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Three Extremes is a trilogy of horror films by a Chinese, a South Korean, and a Japanese director. The first and darkest one is Dumplings, where an aging actress will go to any lengths to restore her youth. Her search for the fountain of beauty leads her to a lady who makes dumplings containing a special ingredient for their magical powers. Trust me, colonel Sanders has nothing to do with the recipe. A very strong stomach is required for this segment.Cut is the second blood fest, and here is a film maker who is kidnapped by a guy who works as an extra who is resentful of his victim's success and so he ties up the couple and plays a sadistic game which does not reward prizes but instead penalizes the contestant with amputations; another happy theme. The third and least offensive is Box, a quiet young woman has a recurring dream in which she is buried in a box in the snow. Her search leads her to memories of a missing sister and provides clues as to the reasons for the nightmares. An o.k. entry with a decent ending.Overall, I thought the anthology was well made but a bit sadistic at times, and so avoid it if you are easily offended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Three extremes clearly shows what makes a horror film good. For me, two out of three films are actually pretty good while one is only an average film for me. My ratings: Dumplings- 7/10(average) Cut-9/10 Box-8.5/10Box I am a big fan of Takashi Miike and this film didn't disappoint me at all. This film is about two girls fighting for a man(the ringmaster) in a circus. The winter scenery was just so beautiful in this film. There are some really creative scares in this film. One being the Twisting of the dolls body (that was awesome!) The ending was probably one of the best unexpected endings in any horror movie. It was just awesome! The atmosphere of this movie was good and the storyline really shows a love triangle between 3 people and it stands strong.The only flaw for this film is its unoriginal storyline. Although the storyline of this film is very unoriginal it is still very entertaining to watch. This film will keep you glued to the screen. Highly recommended! Dumplings This is only an average film for me. I did not like the storyline at all for this film. I had a lot of difficulty piecing the pieces of jigsaw puzzle towards the end of this film. This film is about a woman who wanted to gain her youth but ended up not being able to give birth. I was expecting something like her vomiting blood or worms and die or become very old after eating the dumplings. But it did not turn out to be as good as what I expected. Many questions just come to my mind towards the end of the film? Why did one of the neighbours end up killing her husband? Why did she pierce her vagina in the end? Its confusing. The cinematography of this film is nice. The sound effects are so good and real. The dumplings looked so real and gross with the red meat inside. I jumped every time that lady eats a dumpling. Cut This is probably my favourite film out of the three partially due to the originality of the film and the message this film gives to me. This film has got lots of dark humour in it and is really entertaining to watch. The storyline is quite interesting to me and the cutting of the fingers is just so gross. The unexpected ending contributes greatly to the film. I loved the ending. However, the only problem with this film is that the characters looked quite silly and this film isn't scary at all. Other than that this film is highly recommended Three extremes, three good pieces, a fun watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is basically a film of three stories in one movie, each of them being creepy and bizarre and each of them being around 45 min. The first segment is my least favorite and yet the most messed up one out of the three about some women that eats dumplings, except the ingredients are from dead infants. But for the most part it was boring, there is a longer whole movie version from this segment with a different ending from what I heard. That I didn't check out yet, but probably better than the shortened version. The second segment is my favorite out of the three, everything about it was intense and interesting. Especially the mind games the director and the stranger play against each other, it was a great horror experience. Some may compare this to "Saw" movies, but this short segment is much better than most "Saw" movies, and Park Chan-wook Park did a great job with this. Some complain because the characters were not likable, but it just shows that everyone makes mistakes and I personally didn't dislike the characters from a few mistakes they made in the past, except the stranger. The segment the "Box" is my second favorite although it doesn't really explain what is going on deeply and leaves it up for the audience to decide. It is also the strangest segment out of the three and subtle. Now that I think about it I actually kinda liked how it left things unsure, like a dream and left it up for the audience to decide. I like one more than the other, but liked each segment individually and is pretty darn good as a package.7.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An opinion on the masters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I guess I should start watching Asian romances too,if they are half as good as the horrors,they will do fine.Let me discuss the films one at a time. Dumplings:This movie deals with the 'age old concept' of eating fetuses to regain youth,portraying a subtle message about abortions too.The crunching sounds make up the horror factor,but to me the glorifying point is the degeneration of the supposed protagonist,from being abhorred by the concept first and later yielding to it fully.I guess many themes underly,including the lust for power(over her husband) and the scepter to signify it(her youth).I would forgo the twisted tongue part,for it detracts the movie.9/10 Cut:A great movie in its own right.I guess though the theme shares with Oldboy and Lady Vengeance,this one has much to offer on its own.Firstly,unlike Saw,the psychopath here has really little motive.He justifies that being an extra he gets little attention,and seemingly wants his own limelight at least once. Starting of with an overly colorful vampire scene,its a marvel to shoot the film in a single set with a variety of colors and over the top make up.Also the strings signify a puppet of the protagonist who ultimately has his strings removed and comes to life with a devilish twist.Also the disarray present in all perfection is an inherent motif.As for the sadism only Audition did it better(kiri kiri kiri)...8.5/10 Box:My favorite of the three.It required a 2nd viewing since after the first two films I was too dazed to actually get through such a surreal picture.I guess it dealt with the nightmares of the girl in a different way.She was a conjoined twin so she had always waned to be separated,to be loved alone,not as a part.Her desires led to her having a guilt complex and her subsequent nightmares.So while she wished for the death of her sister,she could not consciously desire it.The imagery is beautiful,and you could appreciate the film with no sound as well.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think that 'Dumplings' takes it all. Well cut from the full length version so that audiences still get the main point. By far, my favorite of the three. Interesting, delightfully sickening, and great performances from all the actors. 'Cut' was a disappointment. Sure, it was gruesome, made one twitch here and there, however, it was pretty much a let down. Attempting to mix comedy and this type of drama was a disaster. 'Box'was very intriguing...until the end is reached. The audience is left thinking, 'All that for THIS?!' But all in all, the good outweighs the bad, and 8 very enthusiastic thumbs up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Trilogy of Terror -- Asian Style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's almost redundant for me to say that Asian horror is at the forefront of what we perceive as disgusting and repellent (in a good way). There's a little extra edge to the way they approach the subject matter. Where American horror has veered out into some pretty bland arenas and have all but killed the (horror) genre, relying on shock value and the cheap scares to induce some semblance of fear, Asians delve much deeper. The approach is not Val Lewton, but a skewered distortion of reality that burrows deep into the psyche and festers there long after the credits have rolled and the movie has officially ended.So. Here we have a trilogy, and you would say, what of it? It's been done before, many times, most famously in TRILOGY OF TERROR and the CREEPSHOW movies. True. However, these aren't the usual possessed doll/woman facing a curse/evil without a name typical of comic-book horror. The first segment, "Dumplings", released on its own as a full feature length movie, has the most ties to the Western world and 1950s horror: the fear of old age and ultimate mortality. An aging actress, played by Lillian Lee, comes across a woman who has a special brand of dumplings which can restore her youth. Of course, right at the start, nothing happens. However, imperceptibly but surely, the actress' beauty resumes itself, and an unlikely co-dependence develops between she and the woman who cooks the special dumplings. Until she finds out what the special ingredient within the dumplings are really about.The second story, "Cut", also straight-forward, might be the weaker of the three even though it has some very tense moments: a director finds himself hostage to a situation with an actor who was little more than an extra, his wife attached to a piano like a puppet, and a child strapped against a sofa. Unless he strangles the child on the sofa, the disgruntled extra will slice off his wife's fingers. This portion moves with exquisite tension until events threaten to give in, and of course, there are surprises in store.The third and final installment of the three is "Box", directed by Takashi Miike of ODISHON, and it plays with the unease that characterizes some of David Lynch's own forays into inter-dimensions. Here, a young woman is tormented by dreams of the twin sister who perished in a fire when they both were circus performers (and her father seemed to prefer the dead sister). Art directed almost to ridiculous levels, it presents a situation that seems to be heading one way, or in fact, might very well be non-existent -- something within the young woman's head. The fact that her editor looks like the father who died in the fire when she was a girl doesn't help in clarifying anything, and the story's own ambiguity lends light into its own world.Of the three short films my favorite is "Dumplings". It presents a fear that we all know: the fear not only of growing old, but becoming undesirable -- a specter of our former selves. That Mrs. Li, knowing the horror she is being privy to, continues on her pursuit of youth, not altogether knowing what she will be really giving up, is part of the visceral horror that in other hands would have become just another remake of THE LEECH WOMAN (and its imitators). That final shot of Mrs. Li, as she looks on, serene, and licks the blood off her lips, a tongue that has become grotesque, cutting to the sound of her chewing those little dumplings is classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Three tales from the Far East that lets the dark side of their imaginations loose</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three Extremes takes three highly talented Far East directors (one from Honk Kong, one Japanese and one Korean), and lets the dark side of their imaginations loose for thirty minutes each. The film is actually a trilogy of separate and unconnected horror tales, each one out to blur the boundaries between horror and art, and to produce something that is more than just to throwaway.First tale is "Dumplings", a shortened version of the full length movie of the same name, a satire about contemporary vanity and the desire and desperation of some people to feed it. I loved the full movie, and the shortened version doesn't disappoint but the ending is different but just as deliciously dark. Fine performances and directing make this a stellar show for anyone.The second tale is called "Cut" and surprisingly is the poorest of the three. A Korean short movie about one "nice guy" director and his wife held hostage by an extra from his movies who terrorises them both, trying to bring out the dark side of the director. Revelations and tension wrap this short up, but the violence is excessive at times and the story does seem to tail off very quickly. It starts off so well with some stellar camera work and movement, and the arty feel of this horror piece is quite intriguing, but the bulk of this piece turns stale and falls flat as violence overtakes all else. If you have seen an Austrian movie called "Funny Games" then you can see where this film likely got its influence from.The final part of the three is "The Box". If you have seen anything by Miike Takishi before then this is quite tame in comparison to much of his other work (if you haven't then don't ask as you'll either love it or hate it and it's a conversation for another day). The film is a menagerie of dreams, memories and images of a girl's past life in a circus act with her twin and mentor which is tinged with tragedy (surprise surprise). The most artistic of the three, this is incredibly beautiful and dark, haunting and frightening, and also intriguing and thought provoking. This episode will be the one of the three you are most likely will be pondering about at the end.I enjoyed this trilogy, although I had already seen the full "Dumplings" film which took out most of the surprise element, but even with the disappointment of "Cut" this is still a very worthwhile viewing for anyone into artistic horror. Each is different to another, and will offer something to everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A decidedly mixed bag, but worth your time if you want something different</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought "Ichi The Killer" and "Oldboy" were interestingly weird films, so I rented "Three...Extremes" on the basis of what I knew about Miike and Park. I figured that if Fruit Chan was notorious enough to be included in an anthology with those two directors, his contribution would more than hold its own.Well...the results were worth seeing once. "Dumplings" was both the most revolting and the most socially savvy of the stories; "Box" displayed the deepest emotions in a tale of loneliness and despair disguised as a ghost story; and "Cut" was the most overtly gruesome and had the most gimmicky and contrived plot.Since I am unfamiliar with Chan's work, I can't say whether he stretched himself or tried anything new, but I do think that the acting and direction here were the most subtle and complex in the trilogy. Park's stuff seemed very much of a piece with his previous tales of violence and Hitchcockian entrapment that drive the protagonist to despair. But Miike surprised me, since "Box" was entirely different in tone and structure from his famous film "Ichi", and I wasn't expecting anything like this from him. "Box" is more of a waking dream such as Lynch would do in "Lost Highway" or "Mulholland Drive" and I thought some of the dialog and photography were most impressive. Good for you, Miike, you're even smarter than I thought! As anthology films go, this was pretty good, although nothing that anyone will remember in a decade. Worth getting or at least renting if you are a fan of any of the directors,or if you want to see something relatively fresh from cultures whose clichs and conventions haven't worn out their welcome in the Occident.At least not yet.Note about the DVD edition I saw: The 2nd disc in the package offers a "feature length" version of the Chan story "Dumplings". The additional footage is very well integrated into the original and this long version gives the "Aunt Mei" character and the philandering husband more screen time and adds an extra sex scene. But it doesn't change the real thrust of the original story enough to make it a "must see" unless you really dug Aunt Mei. If the only DVD you can find is a bare bones edition without the feature length version, don't worry that you've missed anything vital.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better Than The Average Anthology Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three...Extremes is better than I expected. I usually don't care for anthology films, but I'm attracted to the credentials. Of course I saw Four Rooms because of the directors involved. It didn't stop it from sucking. Even the Tarantino segment isn't very good. Eros was fair, but to me, it was only because of the Soderbergh segment. With Three...Extremes, I was very attracted to the creds, so I saw it.Dumplings, Fruit Chan's segment, is good and well-made, but it's definitely my least favorite of the three segments. It has its shocks, and it has its fairly emotional moments, but in comparison to the following two installments, I would put it at the bottom. I'd never before seen a Fruit Chan film. I've seen many by Miike and enough of Chanwook to know that he's fantastic, but this was my first Chan film. Perhaps I need to become familiar with him so that I can see him the way I see the other two directors.Cut, Park Chanwook's segment, is by far the best. There is never a dull moment in this shocking, evil, voyeuristic, yet incredibly elegant little film. It's incredibly engaging, because every character and every detail takes the sharpest hairpin turn in its development and surprises you phenomenally.Box, Takashi Miike's segment, starts by capturing the perfect quiet winter atmosphere. It's dark and cozy enough to be creepy and quiet and docile enough to be even creepier. Its plot is quite interesting, founding itself upon the concept of just about the worst possible death you could imagine. What detracts ever so slightly from Box is Miike's rehashing of a twist that he's used already in one of his most popular films. It's not aggravating in the least, but it makes it clear that his installment in Three...Extremes is all style and no substance. But that's fine. It's possibly one of his most well-directed efforts to date.Three...Extremes is definitely worth a look if you're a horror and thriller fan. It packs a triple- punch, and it's not a let-down like other anthology films almost always are.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Three...Extremes falls from the new Asian Movie craze. This new wave of Asian movies has had a big impact on Hollywood, bringing on fresh ideas to a stagnant one genre Hollywood.But Three...Extremes is a unique movie offering three shorts form 3 Masterful directors Fruit Chan(China), Chan-wook Park(Korea), and Takashi Miike(Japan).These three directors offer 3 different perspectives on horror. in Fruit Chan's Dumplings the central topic is all too real which is to be expected from his movies. Dumplings is the masterpiece of Three...Extemes; offering a disturbing view of China's problems as well as another more universal message, the need for beauty is a plight to women-kind. Dumplings takes you on a roller-coater ride of suspense drama and most of all sympathy. I have never seen any like Dumplings in my entire life. Chan-wook Park's Cut is another extreme view on the world of Korea and Park's never ending thesis of revenge has continued in Cut, but in a more "extreme" way. The political implications of this movie go way beyond Korea, but touches on the relation ship between the impoverished and the wealthy of the worldTakashi Miike's Box is a cinematographic wonder. using very few words the short displays a sort of subtle horror which grows and grows until it explodes in a loom of surprises. Takashi Miike's psychological direction takes full helm of this short. I have never been so focused on one detail of a movie in utter silence.All three of these directors were able to conjure up something Hollywood has been trying to do for years and that is SUBSTANCE. They have brought meaning to their movies, rather than bringing cheap shocks and short thrills. They bring up deep disturbing views into the near future that will haunt you every time you wrong someone, eat a dumpling, or dream. The masters of horror have died in Hollywood and have resurrected in Asia...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rented Three...Extremes on a suggestion from a close friend. I am very glad that I took his advice on it. The short film "Dumplings" by Fruit Chan was by far one of the most disturbing films that I have ever seen. It has been the only film that made my stomach turn in disgust and horror. The next film "Cut" by Chan-Wook Park had almost the same type of feel that "Oldboy" had. The camera angles and comedic nature was very similar to "Oldboy". It wasn't really disturbing but I can understand why some people would be freaked out by it. Takashi Miike's "Box" was my least favorite of the three films. It wasn't scary or disturbing; I would best describe it as odd and slightly boring. Even though only two of the three, so-called "extremes", were worth watching it was still overall a good movie which is why I gave "Three...Extremes" a vote of 8.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All three of these short films are well directed, with gorgeous cinematography and believable performances. If that's enough for you, watch away.However if you're a "normal" movie viewer who demands something other than atmosphere and pretty shots... ehhhhhhhh.The first film "Dumplings" is the best. It's manages to be quirky and memorable but still focused and coherent. No small feat. It's also ridiculously disturbing. Some viewers will probably have trouble watching it, but this is not shock-shlock -- "Dumplings" is sickening in an honest, socially relevant way.The second film "Cut" is terrible. If the post-Ring American horror industry is guilty of mimicking/poaching J-horror, and mostly getting it wrong, then this film is guilty of mimicking American torture-horror (see: Saw) while ineptly poaching Tarantino, and getting it totally wrong. The result is boring and unpleasant, and the obnoxious ending made me want to fast-forward.The third film "Box" is right in the middle. It's very pretty and very spooky. So pretty and so spooky that you will almost certainly forgive the nonsense-plot and the ultra-super-nonsense ending. I found it unsettling and creepy and entertaining, despite being totally incomprehensible.Despite the obvious art-house appeal of "Three Extremes," the whole experience is only OK.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first segment from Chinese director Fruit Chan, written by Lilian Lee features the incredibly beautiful and talented Bai Ling. She makes the best dumplings; in addition, we get to see two incredible dumplings while she is chopping. Her dumplings constitute a fountain of youth.Her ingredients are the secret and they are something that would be unimaginable to those who haven't seen this film. When Mrs Lee (Miriam Yeung Chin Wah) finds out what she is being fed; oh, my! But, she returns for more treatments.The result is amazing and her husband, the multi-talented Tony Leung Ka Fai is all over her. She even gets pregnant, although told she never could.But there is always a price to pay for what we want.The art direction and cinematography for this film is brilliant.Oldboy director Chan-wook Park from Korea gives us the next segment "Cut." This is really a strange movie about an "extra" that is upset that the director is such a "good" man along with being rich, and wants to change him.He starts by cutting of his wife's fingers. She is a concert pianist, and then asks him to kill someone to let his wife go.It was really fascinating and sometimes funny while being gory. Won-hie Lim was dynamite! And then, Takashi Miike's "Box" to finish the selections.It was just strange.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dumplings: 8/10; Cut: 10/10; Box: 9/10; overall a very nifty, varied set of Asian horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While not one of the three films in the collection of shorts put under the name "Three Extremes" will ever shock to the point of no return, they represent some of the sharpest wit, guts (literally and figuratively), and psychological insight into what really creeps out, entertains and sticks with us as viewers. The first is Fruit Chan's Dumplings. This one had me intrigued on the outset because I had never seen a work of Chan's before- he's won many awards but is not as well-known a cult director as the his other contemporaries here- and by film's end he had me for quite a loop. It's surely the most depraved and intentionally "oh-my-God" type of short horror films one's likely to see in the years to come, mainly because it takes on a very basic and over-done topic, vanity, and is cooked up (no pun intended) with human beings' attachment to new life. Mainly because, as Bai Ling's character demonstrates, it's so useful a old-age-prevention to eat aborted fetuses in dumpling form, as the main character, a former TV star who's worried about being appealing to her husband. This probably has the least depth, emotionally and psychologically, of the three films, mainly because Chan is far more interested in getting the audience repulsed by what's going on. It will certainly set the alarms going off for pro-lifers, but just about anyone will wonder how it can end like it does, with a twist that is just meant to add one more devilishly wretched twist on top of the baby-plate.Next up is Cut, a film by South Korea's newest sensation Park Chanwook. While overall his film is the most wholly satisfying and entertaining, it's not without a heap of 'hip' shots, like the one that pulls back (via computers of course, though very cleverly) across the set of a movie being shot, or in some of those angles that one saw as being one-of-a-kind in Park's Oldboy. This time a similar thread emerges: a true-blue psychopath, an extra with a grudge, makes psychological mind-games with a director with maybe too much humility to him, as his wife is tied up intricately with her fingers getting chopped off one by one. There's a lot of real guilty-pleasure type laughs to be had here, with the black comedy reaching higher points than one would've expected even from Oldboy territory, where conscience gets thrown out the window and all that's left are raw human emotions and the dark side of circumstance. It helps that the extra, played by Won Hie Lim, is great at the part because there's no real sense of humor to him, but he still ends up being funny, like when he dances to that song from one of the Director's films. The final five minutes of the short ratchets up the terror that's been building up, and those looking for the same knock-out violent climax won't be disappointed. But it's the little moments too that Park gets right, as character, primarily the Director's, is never a very certain thing.Takashi Miike's Box is definitely, for my money, the best directed of the lot, or at least with the most measured for the characters in the story. This time the outrageousness of the previous shorts is replaced by a grim horror of complexes going back to childhood, of entrapment in the mind to memories that are too horrible to contemplate. An author seems to be revisiting things that happened as a child- the death of her sister by her own very strange accidental hands- and how a box figures its way into it all, on top of a very sick man- the girls' father- with a half-white face. Atmosphere this time trumps perversity, though it still applies that Miike's film is a work that will be probably more haunting because of the complexities to how Kyoko faces what's happened to her sister Soko. I won't reveal what the final twist is, which is pure classic Miike, but the rest of the Box, which has very little dialog and many shots that linger longer than one might expect, is haunting and deliberately gut-wrenching. A circus atmosphere, of the sort here anyway, is no more or less realistic than the other scenarios portrayed in Three Extremes, but Box also has the upper-hand of reality blending with nightmares, and what nightmarish qualities always come up from them. What does the box mean? It's not necessarily a MacGuffin, put it that way.So, if you make sure not to eat anything during the proceedings, and maybe have someone's arm to clutch during some of the bloodier and gleefully sick moments, Three Extremes should make for a cool night of viewing. The directors on hand are in their A-game forms, and it has an appeal that might reach the more hard-bitten veterans of Asian cult films due to the ingenuity of key moments as well as newcomers to Asian horror that might draw them in ever more than before.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There can be no argument, really, that Three Extremes is quite horrifying. At least, if your type of horror is of the disgusting kind, Dumplings will "kill" your appetite, if not cause you to toss your cookies. To that end, I guess the film accomplishes its mission.Admittedly, I am biased here, because I don't much care for "go-for-the-gross-out" shock horror. I think it's like punching below the belt in a boxing match. I figure anyone can go for the easy "hit em with bizarre sick", but few, however, can truly frighten to the point of fearing the darkness of your own room.Personally, I believe this is one film that people should know going in what they are about to expose themselves to. "The Box" and "Cut", I thought were interesting short-films. I did enjoy the latter most, which puts me in the minority. Dumplings, though, was, in my opinion (and please do excuse the pun), in very poor taste. But then, pushing the envelope and breaking all perceived taboos seems to be how you make money these days...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm always very cautious when people refer to the genuine brilliance of Asian horror productions (as I've been let down one too many times), but in the case of "Three?Extremes" every single word of praise is more than justified! This movie is bound to make an everlasting impression on you, and most likely that impression will either be fear, disturbance or just plain repulsion?(but the 'good' kind of repulsion). The format of a horror anthology isn't very common in Asian cinema, at least not that I'm aware of, but these three directors approach the format with the exact right attitude. There's no silly and overlong wraparound, the stories just follow each other without necessarily featuring common themes or characters. This results in three versatile stories, covering completely different horror styles. The first story by Fruit Chan aims at pure controversial shocks, with its plot about an ageing actress who desperately wants to maintain her good looks and young skin and therefore consults the mysterious "Aunt Mei". Her secret of eternal youth involves serving her customers dumpling-dishes made of ? hold on to your socks for this ? aborted human fetuses! Mrs. Li is very pleased with the results at first, but then gets sick after finishing a 'meal' made of the leftovers of an incest baby. Fruit Chan is the least famous director of the bunch, but his is definitely a name to remember and keep an eye on. The style of "Dumplings" is extremely brutal and nihilistic. People talk about the abortion of living creatures like it's the most normal thing in the world and the camera regularly zooms in on how aunt Mai professionally grinds the baby-flesh. Admittedly, you require a strong stomach to endure the make-up effects in this first episode, but even more disturbing is Chan's use of freaky sounds. The music is downright nightmarish and particularly the chewing-noises, made when Mrs. Lee eats the dumplings, sent cold shivers down my spine. Chan-Wook Park is responsible for the second tale and if you've seen any of the entries in his Vengeance-Trilogy ("Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance", "Oldboy", "Lady Vengeance"), you already more or less know what to expect. Namely a cruel and relentless tale of violence that brings out the absolute darkest side of the human mind. Chan-Wook Park is a genius when it comes to the drawing of his characters and he once more demonstrates that here, with his story about the home jacking of a famous director and his vain wife by a severely frustrated walk-on actor. The wife is imaginatively tied between the walls and her piano and the perpetrator threatens to cut off her fingers, unless the director has the courage to strangle a little girl the stranger kidnapped as well. The seemly honest and friendly couple gradually turn into selfish and aggressive monsters the more their lives become endangered. "Cut" is probably my favorite segment of all three! The tension is almost unbearable and you just know Chan-Wook Park isn't going to come up with a happy ending! People are crazy, evil bastards that only look after themselves and that's the ONLY message to communicate here. His segment also contains the most violent and gory images, as the house's artsy floor is literally flooded with blood near the end of the story. "Cut" is a harrowing piece of cult cinema that only confirms that Chan-Wook Park is a brilliant director. Die-hard fans of Takashi Miike that are expecting a short movie similar to "Itchi the Killer" or "F?doh" will be quite amazed that his contribution to "Three?Extremes" is the most atmospheric and suggestive one! "Box" is a complex little mind-bender that is low on graphic violence and shocks, but nevertheless very intense and petrifying. The tale centers on a young woman experiencing nightmares about her childhood life as a circus artist. The competitive relationship with her twin-sister eventually led to unwanted murder and now the unfortunate girl comes back to haunt her. In all honesty I must admit I enjoyed "Box" the least, mainly because the complete change in tone and filming style came too unexpectedly. Miike puts a whole lot of haunting images in his film, but the plot is too abstract and raises too many questions for which there are no answers. Great ending, though. My guess is that Miike was merely using this omnibus job to experiment with horror styles and elements that are new for him. "Three?Extremes" is a tremendously marvelous film that every horror fanatic has to see for him/herself! ?And that recommendation comes from someone who totally disliked the so-called Asian horror masterpieces "Ringu", "Ju-On The Grudge" and "The Eye".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is good fun. The type of movie that's good to throw on at a party as a distraction if everyone is really drunk and you don't want to think too much but need some visual stimulation. The first segment "Dumplings" is definitely my favorite (thanks in no small part to Christopher Doyle's lending of his talents behind the camera). The feature-length version of this segment is even better, and is fortunately included on the second disc of the region 1 DVD.Chan-Wook Park's "Cut" is fun but also another sign that he might not have all that much going for him after "Oldboy" found the right balance of style and genuine intelligence (after the disappointment of "Lady Vengeance"). He lays on the gratuitous flashy camera-work a bit too thick and the plot tries hard but really doesn't carry that much weight. His oddball humor that worked so well when kept in check within the context of "Oldboy" and "Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance" fails him again here, coming off as incongruously goofy, and here also the ending inexplicably dives into complete incomprehensibility.Incomprehensibility isn't something Takashi Miike has to worry about too much in his segment "Box", as the short shows him at his most incomprehensible and Lynchian all the way through. It's actually a surprisingly subdued and technically assured piece of film-making from him considering the increasing sloppiness of his feature work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dumplings - 4/10 Cut - 8/10 The Box - 6/10Three... Extremes is an east Asian compilation horror film made of one extremely good film and two extremely mediocre ones. There ain't no way I'll ever love more than a third of it, but one out of three ain't bad.The first film on the disk, Dumplings, from Chinese director Fruit Chan, is easily the weakest of the lot. In plot it is predictable and plodding, and the subtextual commentary on women's beautification and abortion is stale, clumsy, and obvious. When it tries to be shocking, it ends up mildly unpleasant more than anything else. Sure the characters are believable, but they are entirely unlikeable. Unlikeable characters aren't necessarily bad, of course - the enduring success and literary appreciation of Wuthering Heights is testament to that - but Dumplings' characters aren't just horrible people; they're horribly boring too. A vain ageing woman, obsessed with beauty, a shallow husband who sleeps around, and a mysterious immoral witch: these are the three main characters, and each is as vacuous as the next. Wuthering Heights' characters are as enduring as they are because mixed there is passion and soul entwined with their cruelty and brutality, but the cast of Dumplings just seem empty, even soulless. Perhaps that was the point, but it doesn't make a difference.The final film is called The Box, and it's empty in a different way. Making heavy use of symbolism, it moves at a slow pace, and the beautiful cinematography and pervasive suspenseful atmosphere isn't enough to make up for the boring plot and empty characters. I don't have much more to say about it, because the film really doesn't have very much substance to it at all, especially after the twist ending. It often goes that the best twists are those make you view the rest of the film in a different light, that connect all the dots but do it an unexpected and inventive way to come to a different conclusion than the one you expected. The worst twists, then, are those that render the rest of the film meaningless, and make you wonder what was the point in showing it at all. Suffice to say, the twist to The Box is of the latter type. It's a "They're really doing that? Ugh, OK" sort of twist through and through.The second piece though, Chan-Wook Park's Cut, is a great short film. While its premise might seem familiar - a disgruntled extra kidnaps a hyper-successful director and torments him and his wife - it tackles the idea with such a staggering amount of wit and energy that it still feels like you're seeing something new. There are an array of pitfalls a film like this could have fallen into, and it deftly avoids them all: it's deep without being too dry, and dark without being too grim. Its intricate blend suspense, madness, gore - used relatively sparingly, to great effect - and psychological and social commentary, infused throughout with pitch-black comedy and constant little subversive twists, subtly combine into a miniature masterwork of film.I have just two criticisms: it was too short (why couldn't this get a feature length extended cut instead of frigging Dumplings?), and the ending was a little bit lame. It almost seems to be building up to another twist to turn the whole thing on its head, but it never quite comes. But those minor faults are tiny chips in the varnish of an otherwise thoroughly polished bit of filmmaking, and however good the other films in the compilation were they would have a hard time matching Cut for tension, wit, or subversive creativity. It's just a shame that they don't even come close.</fullReview>

So, there is definitely room for interpretation and some of these images will certainly linger.Most perplexing for me was the second selection, "Cut." Actually, I have done a search all over the web and I have found no one else mentioning the significance of a female passenger who, in a single shot, is riding with the director on his way home from the studio, only to disappear as he arrives home and never to be brought up again. I mention this because it would suggest that the entire sequence is either a dream, or hallucinatory. I keep looking back at the sequence and wondering if it is his wife...and if she is dead. It is very hard to tell. But someone is definitely there. The final scene setting is actually too contrived to be real (having the blender both at home and on the set, and the way the wife and characters are suspended, for example). I do not see how an extra would have the craft and expertise to set up the studio a la "Saw." It certainly is gruesome.Sorry, but episode 1, "DUmplings," was just plain revolting. I had won ton soup for dinner tonight, and fortunately the won tons did not crunch. I will say this, the concept of cannibalism has never been made to look so tasty. I mean, the food preparation scenes reminded me a bit of "Eat Drink, Man, Woman," until you learn that is what is being served. That is perverse enough in its own rite.I liked the last segment, "Box," the best and the end would have been more satisfying if the present-day scenes before it would have been more honest. While the twist was nice, nothing would lead one to believe that there was a true sister act at play all through the movie. Still, I did love the atmosphere of the piece.Normally, I would rate this trilogy higher, as it is certainly well-made. But, as I wrote, they all seemed flawed. More like ideas-in-progress than finished pieces. Then again, maybe that was the point.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the third story: an explanation why it's so boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>what a great movie! how original horror set pieces! the first story is disgusting when you understand what's going on and the second story is very entertaining and suspenseful when you understand what's happening, but the third story is really boring. we should ask ourselves: why is the third storyline a boring one? well, my thoughts about the set-up: first you realize what you see is really bad, but the second story shows us you can still enjoy something that's disgusting to watch. so story one and two are brilliantly set-up. but why the third story so boring??? maybe to show us that the disgusting factor we loved so much is really just a movie, and by that, that something like this in real life is terrible. terrible, boring, ... it's practically the same. that's why miike had to direct something that's boring, to end our experience of this horror movies with a message, that can be understood as an insider's joke.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Failing to live up to its title, I instead found myself experiencing the following rather mundane afternoon: Dumplings: After figuring out what they were made of after a minute of viewing, I found myself oddly hungry and decided to snack.Cut: A post-prandial malaise soon set in as I sat and picked my teeth while trying to figure out which film ripped off the other first -- Cut, or Saw.Box: Cranky and in need of a nap, I began to doze off as this final segment's brooding stasis functioned as a wonderful soma, gently easing me away.One....extremely boring movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good - OK - Awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Asian extreme cinema is little more than a marketing ploy as this episodic film clearly shows. The episodes have little in common and vary wildly in quality. To start with the best, "Dumplings" is more a black comedy than anything else. It's theme is ultra-misogynistic - women will do anything to stay young (the male director may have been better advised to look at the steps men take to retain their potency but hatred of women sells better) - and what is happening will be obvious to anyone with a few brain cells very quickly. It is though quite well made and passes it's time painlessly enough. The full length version is to be avoided as it is stretched out to tedium. Overall an OK film but I would recommend grisly French shocker "Inside" over it any day of the week. Park-Chan Wook's segment "Cut" is more palatable than his full length films - shortness helps enormously. It contains the bad acting that all of his films have but a tighter plot helps. The whole thing is very similar to "Saw" (almost certainly a coincidence) but fails to provoke or entertain as that film did. As a piece of cinema it's no better than average, compared to Park's other films it seems like a masterpiece. Last, and very much least, is Takashi Miike's segment "Box". This is the only segment that qualifies as extreme in any sense, in that it is extremely boring. Miike seems to have started believing the press saying that he is a cinematic genius - that is the only excuse I can think of for the farrago he presents here (at his best he was a maker of good off-kilter genre pieces - a man to rank with Dario Argento rather than a true cinematic master). All in all this film's most important legacy is in uncovering the stupid hype that has surrounded Asian cinema in recent years, of course good films were made (ignored by most they always have been), but just like Hollywood mediocrity has usually prevailed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Three... Extremes? More like three nose picks. This movie was not worth the time. It would have been more productive to tweeze my eyebrows than watch this. I only got through the first story &amp; about a minute of the second, &amp; I just had to turn it off. The first story was full of times where I covered my eyes in abhorrence. There was a couple of disturbing scenes, I'll give it that, but seriously, the most intriguing part of the movie was the one chick's choice in trousers. &amp; the second story? The chick's acting of an upset stomach made my stomach upset just the same. I'm thinking this would have been better if I was drinking vodka straight out of the bottle... Maybe everyone else was when they wrote such great reviews.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Over-rated and Ultimately Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a disappointment. All three shorts were beautifully shot, but in the end, the trio fell short.Though "Dumplings" was a cinch to figure out, right from the beginning, the story was still solid and intriguing, up till the end. The third seemed to be hastily fitted together and lacked punch."Cut" was also intriguing, as well as tense. It was a nail biter for sure - until the end. The end of the third act became silly and was completely lackluster.The best of the bunch, which was saved for last, was Takashi Miike's "The Box". Another disturbing venture into the darkside of family, we get a sordid tale both somber and beguiling. Even so, this could not save "Three Extremes".Maybe people played it up too much, but I was truly disgruntled and wondered why I wasted my time. Don't waste yours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2 out of 3 ain't bad (Contains Minor Spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sequel to the award winning anthology Three, Three... Extremes is another collection of 3 short horror films, this time from Japan, Hong Kong, and Korea. I won't spend much time comparing this to the first offering, except to say that on the whole, the short films are definitely more 'extreme' in both what they show and imply.The first segment is "Box", from Japanese director Takashi Miike. Easily the most subjective of all three films, Miike once again shows that he knows how to craft a mind-bender of a film, relying on very little dialog and absolutely breathtaking imagery to tell a heart-breaking story of jealousy and murder between two child acrobats, both of whom are desperate to impress their father-in-law and teacher (Atsuro Watabe). Don't expect the typical J-Horror motifs as this one goes beyond the typical jump scenes, instead forcing you to examine what goes on in every scene before being confronted with the shocker of an ending.The second segment is "Dumplings", from Hong Kong director Fruit Chan. One of the most exciting filmmakers in Hong Kong, Chan has created a wickedly twisted and satirical film about the desire for eternal youth. Adapted from a story by Lillian Lee, Dumplings sees Bai Ling (taking a welcome break from her absolutely awful Hollywood films) as Aunt Mei, a woman famous for dumplings that give back to a woman her youth and sexuality. Her client is retired TV star Ching (played by Miriam Yeung, in her most unusual and possibly best performance), who wants to regain the affection of her husband (Tony Leung Ka-fai) and the beauty she once had. Once you learn and explicitly see what the dumplings contain (which the film shows you right from the start), you will get a sense of the level of criticism this film is striving for and achieves. Even cut down to 40 minutes, Dumplings is easily the best film of the three with its brilliant narrative and superb performances from Bai Ling and Miriam Yeung, however, you really need to see the extended version of the film to get the full effect of the story and the performances. Disgusting? No doubt. Brilliant? Absolutely. Will you ever eat dumplings again? Well, you'll definitely think twice about it. Before you condemn the film for its material, think of it as a rather extreme hypothetical example and condemnation of the the human quest for eternal youth.The last segment is "Cut", from Korean director Park Chan-Wook. This is the weakest segment of the film and should have been placed in the middle so as to be supported by the superior "Box" and "Dumplings". Park is a brilliant director, no question about that, but this particular film seems remarkably similar to equally inferior films such as "Phone Booth" and "Saw", both of which see a deranged killer teaching more fortunate and ignorant people humility and the meaning of life. The imagery, to an extent, is wonderfully evocative, yet the impact of the film resonates like a small, dying rat. The characters are impossible to sympathize with and the performances themselves are more laughable than anything else. Simply put, this is a bad film made worse by the fact that the 'extreme-ness' of the film (i.e. the violence) serves no purpose other than to shock viewers, and because of that it comes off as unintentionally humorous and downright silly. Compared to the psychologically engaging "Box" and the subtle (perhaps its most brilliant aspect), yet resounding impact of "Dumplings", "Cut", with its over-the-top silliness and ridiculous ending, is sorely out of place.Despite the skip-worthy last segment, "Three... Extremes" is well worth watching for "Box" and "Dumplings", both brilliant offerings from two of the most visceral filmmakers working today. They may not keep you up at night, but they will definitely resonate with you long after you watch them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK, not great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I want to first say, thank goodness this is not one contiguous movie! If it were, I be running for the NoDoz! The first story exposes the twist about dumplings in 2 minutes and then it's really boring beyond belief. Photography is great, but man is this movie slow on exposition. and that's because it's a one trick pony. It's 35 minute length felt like a full 2 hour feature!Number two starts as a blood sucking film which in reality is a film within a film. A director comes home, passes out and wakes up in a horror movie all his own. Again. Looks good, but sort of boring. It's kind of been done before. And again, it goes on and on with little point.Number 3 is Box. Woman plays a music box and sees her dead sister. Sound compelling?I honestly think people reading this are too bust reading the subtitles to get that it's really not that great a compilation. Even if this were a TV movie, it wouldn't be that good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen the 90 minutes version of "Dumpling", it's much better. And I think it will tell you more than what you saw on screen. I never think it ended too abruptly. The director had already passed on the message he wants to tell. And PLEASE, NEVER suggest a Hollywood remake! Hollywood only rapes Asian horror flicks with screwed-up remakes!! Look at The Ring, look at The Grudge and Dark Water. My goodness!! There are always some flaws in movies, Hollywood ain't perfect! They made so many stupid movies every year. So do you suggest Asia to remake all of them? What I would say is, Asians have more heart in making movies, rather than Hollywood. Even a lot of European movies are much better!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>besides being possibly a contender for the goriest/gross-out movie of the century (i saw Saw 2 the next day - wish i had done the reverse), something about this post-shock treatment of basic horror myths just bothered me...was it that chris doyle, plainly nostalgic for his In the mood for love days, used his segment as an overboard outlet for cinematographic monopoly (props to doyle for being one of the rare 'known' cinematographers today, but direction should never defer to cinematography)? that's part of it. the subject matter is clearly abjection, so why stylize so much (to the point of romanticizing)? there's something disingenuous here. the second segment is more ridiculous (save for a device mirroring the beginning the film nicely with the end). it's pure commentary, collage, simulated exhibition. why is this mode of film-making rehashed again and again (see Audition for another, prior example)? it's purely ideological - the more it tries, the more obvious it becomes that there's nothing 'shocking' or 'novel' here. as john waters would say, this is bad bad taste. the third segment is OK, albeit - again - somewhat tired and unoriginal. but it's the most bearable of the three.i'm mostly mad though about the fact that i will never be able to go to dim sum again after this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent directing and editing but little shallow on the story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw an early DVD screening at the Dallas Comic Con. I was looking forward to this movie because Park directed "Old Boy" and I've seen Miike's work in Audition and Ichi the Killer.Anyways, here's what I thought of all three parts:1)"Dumplings"I like the premise of this segment. Without give away the secret ingredient, let's just say it's very disturbing. My only complaint about this segment that it ended a bit abruptly. I liked where it was going and I wish it went a little further. Hopelly, Hollywood would try to remake it and go all the way with the story.Please note that after going home, I checked on the web and I learned that there's a 90 minuted extended version of it. You can check LoveHKFilm.com for a review. I'd like to see how that turned out.2)"Cut"This segment was pretty amusing. I especially liked the twists and turns towards the end.My only complaint is that the plot wasn't very original. I mean, come on. How many times have you seen a guy tied up and some crazed maniac puts him through hell with mind games. Can you say "Phone Booth"? "Saw?". Also, it's again one of those stories where if the main character did something smart, it would have been over already.Overall, I enjoyed it very much (especially the end). Good acting and dark humor, but unfortunately it seemed like something I saw on TV already.3)"Box"I really loved this (not surprising since I like a lot of Miike's previous works). You're left guessing as to whether it's a dream or reality. What's really going on here?I especially enjoyed climatic moments where it's all silent and your eyes are focused on the activity on screen.If I had any complaints, it's the ending. Was that supposed to be a twisting and shocking ending? Because if it was, I wasn't impressed. I was left in confusion. I remember one lady who walked out with me after the movie and said "Huh?" when talking about the ending.Overall it was a good movie. It was well directed, well edited, sounded great, and looks fantastic. Some of the stories (especially the first part) really need an American remake. Unfortunately, it was the script that needed some work. The first ended too abruptly, the second seemed like something you've seen before, and the third had a confusing ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely....gross, weird, freakish. (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American horror films are absolute garbage, the same recycled stories and the desperate need to conform to a general teen market, but only with a willingness for cheap shocks rather than touching anything extreme (as the threshold of shock value has been raised). Asian horror filmmakers, on the other hand, have become masters of their genre, something evident by the growing array of Asian blockbuster and indie horror that has amassed the shelves of even major video chains in America). They are especially crafty with creepy visuals and even creepier sounds and composition. Although, unfortunately, even this product is starting to become standardized simply because of the sheer volumes of these types of films that have been produced in in the last five years or so.'Three Extremes' is great, mostly original entertainment in its fable-esquire storytelling, but is guaranteed to gross you out, weird you out, or certainly freak you out to the point that claims about the amount of violence and gore in Tarrantino's films make him look like a lightweight by comparison. The three films are: Dumplings (Hong Kong), The Cut (Korea), and The Box (Japan).I was ready to walk out of the theater after watching, with unnecessary detail, the fetus-eating dumpling of youth short entitled 'Dumplings,' but sat still long enough to at least be entertained (though still somewhat with squirms and in the end, confusion) by the Cut (an extra takes a film director hostage and then punishes him for being a 'nice guy') or the Box (a young woman appears to revisit her past in which she murdered her sister). The last two, oddly enough, seem like material that, if aired in America and botched by the usuals, would be episodes of Tales from the Crypt. Nonetheless, they're good and weird if that's what you're in the mood for.My other criticism about this movie is that everyone moves around talks at such a painstakingly slow pace during most of the shorts. This is especially true in The Dumpling, where filmmakers found it absolutely essential that we hear every bit of water trickling or throat gurgling or whatever else acute sensibilities deemed necessary (for what, I don't know).Although my friend and I left the theater with a disturbing awkwardness and a dire need to recoup our sense of normalcy by not discussing the movie and in fact, trying to repress the memories, even if only slightly, I will say, that at least the last two shorts--The Cut and The Box--are quite strange, but probably interesting horror shorts to try out. I'd say skip Dumplings. I sure saw no point in trying to outdo the weirdness factor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've just seen "Dumplings" and it is one of the worst movies I have seen in the last months. The plot is slow and boring, the sound effects are bad and placed inappropriately and many scenes are shown far too long to keep the audience interested.The ad text for this movie contains this line: "these cutting-edge directors penetrate the dark heart of desire, examining the ghastly urges that transform ordinary people into monsters". But instead of depicting these "ghastly urges", instead of exploring the dark sides of the characters and identifying what made them become the beings they are (which would make them realistic characters), the director uses them as simple static objects to encompass his disgusting euphemistic fetus-cannibalism show. Yes, thats what the movie really is. After the first boring 5 minutes of the movie where we only see two women in a kitchen talking, the plot focuses on eating fetuses. The more of these wasted minutes of your life pass by, the more graphic the pictures of the procedure of preparing the unborn and eating them become.In the background runs the story of a woman wanting to become younger to win back her husband, but considering the distribution of time on a) character&amp;story development and b) man-eating scenes, it is obvious that this background-story does only establish the setting for the director's cannibalism party.I do not see any aspect of -art- or any special director's skill in this movie, nor can I recommend this movie to anyone (splatter fans shouldn't be interested either, there is not much gore or slashing). Don't waste your time!</fullReview>
