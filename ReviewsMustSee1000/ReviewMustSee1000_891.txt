		<shortDescription>This one WILL scare you</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, if you're a horror fan, see it. You will enjoy this film. Period.Know this - I've seen a billion horror flicks from all around the world... This one gave me the creeps. First 20-30 minutes you still have time to relax from scare to scare, but from then on it's just plain scary shiyet.This movie gets you in the right atmosphere right from the start, and it has almost every type of scene a horror fan can ask for (You'll know what I mean when you see it). I don't really care much about originality, but the story is original and interesting. The best thing about it, though, is the girl who portrays the ghost. I don't know where they found this freaky girl, but she's PERFECT for this role, and by far the scariest character I've seen in Asian horror films.I hope the 2 fellows who made this film, make another horror flick, because, although they're young, it's obvious they know what they're doing. NICE ONE.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie for the first time 2 weeks ago at the Bangkok International Film Fest and it is amazing!! Not only is it scary as hell ( I've never screamed so much in a movie before and I'm an avid horror movie fan), it has a wonderful and original plot line. Throughout the entire movie, i thought i was going to have a heart attack i was so scared. I give a lot of credit to the 2 young directors of this movie. They are only in their early 20's and concocted a unique and entertaining film. Yesterday I just bought it on DVD and I cannot wait to watch it with my friends at home; they'll love it! This is a definite must see for all horror/thriller fans!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh wow, oh jeez, this is the scariest freakin' movie since The Eye!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shutter is a new horror film from Thailand, in the tradition of recent Asian horror films like Ringu and The Eye, and it scared the bejeevery-jeezes out of me! The directors are called Banjong Pisanthanakun and Parkpoom Wongpoom (it rhymes!) and this is their first feature, and looking at the movie, it's hard to believe so. It looks very professional and slick, and it excels in every aspect: from shot design to sound use to pacing. The atmosphere is bowl-clenchingly tight, the tension is almost never relieved, and the movie contains quite a lot of scares; they come in all shapes and sizes in this one, folks. This film has its share of boo moments, slow build-ups, genuine horror, and psychological scares following some very creepy and disturbing revelations. I won't spoil anything, but if you like horror do yourself a favor and watch it. I give this gem a 10 on my horrormeter. And I think I'll leave the light on tonight.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly a horror masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Asian horror film starts off with a young couple (Tun and Jane) driving back from a get-together late one night and hitting a girl that suddenly appears on the road. This may sound very cliché to seasoned horror fans, but what ensues in the film is anything but. Tun (Ananda Everingham) is a professional photographer. He starts noticing some strange flaws in his pictures. This is the beginning of the best ghost story I've ever seen, with truly amazing special effects (so good they make you feel that they're really happening and not just concocted for the movie), excellent acting, lavish production, a creative plot with some great surprises, and just enough blood to justify an R rating (oh, and. Ananda is not only a great actor; he's eye candy!) If you're not put off by having to read subtitles, you'll absolutely love this movie. If you are, I recommend that you try to muddle through them because, believe me, it'll be worth your while.A true gem and a DVD that I am proud to have in my horror collection. Perfection!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Shutter" begins when Thun,a young photographer and his girlfriend Jane accidentally run down a young woman on their drive home.They decide to leave the dead victim and drive away.Later Thun discovers something strange when he finds a mysterious shadow that appears on his photo.He thinks that's just a bad picture,but then he realizes that there is something much more sinister behind the shadow-both Tun and Jane are plagued with extremely unsettling dreams.Unable to cope,they start investigating the phenomenon of ghost/spirit photography,which leads to a discovery about Tun's past,and a possible clue to the identity of their ghostly nemesis."Shutter" was a horror hit in Thailand and it's easy to notice why.It certainly offers some truly eerie moments and it has its share of 'boo' scares too.The final image will make you scream.The acting is surprisingly good and the film is fascinating to watch.9 out of 10.Give it a look.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being a fan of Asian films, I must purchase up to ten films a week. The majority are foreign. I don't want to go into too much detail about the film, but say that this film is buy far one the best horror films I have seen. And I have seen a lot.....and it is Thai! The Ring has paved the way for films like this. there is no doubt in that, but unlike the Ring, and Dark Water, the etc, this film is consistent. It's pace is fantastic.You never get bored, and the scares themselves, while maybe not as disturbing as something like A Tale Of Two sisters, they literally make you jump out of your seat. It's only "fault" (if you want to call it that) is that the score gives you a clue something is coming, but I personally thought they had done excellent job which overall adds to the aura of the film.great stuff!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You Cannot Escape Your Past</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>with a slew of Japanese horror films being released its a surprise to see one as good as Shutter comes not from Japan but Thailand.Shutter focuses on Tun. A recent high school graduate who has a keen interest in photography. While driving late one night with his girlfriend Jane something or someone in the dark causes them to swerve off-road. whoever they hit, if they lived through it, if they didn't they're unsure. They flee the scene but nothing is the same anymore. Nightmares happen for both Tun and Jane as well as strange occurrences in Tuns photographs. Some of Tuns close friends are told to have mysteriously killed themselves. As they go to find out what could have caused this haunting spirit, they find out a lot more about their forgotten past. The car accident wasn't the only mistake that could have caused the series of events, the truth is much worse.In comparison to other recent horror movies like JuOn and Ringu its easy to say the film was highly influenced. Its also notable to point out certain scenes (hair effects seen in JuOn, crawling ghouls as in Ringu) borrow from them as well. Had Shutter been released before them it would be visa versa of course but giving credit to Shutter, it could be said it can stand on its own as a really good horror movie. Most of the scare effect are things not seen in any movies and will really get a jump reaction. The storyline also has some really good twists that just make the movie even more creepier.Acting is also done really well in this movie. Admittingly there aren't many Thaiwanese films that have got a lot of attention but its as good if not better than any other horror movie. It actually stays as a serious horror and doesn't go into the cornball "scary movie" genre (save for a single scene) which is rare. Special effects are kept low in this but there really isn't a need for overdone scariness anyway.Sound by far was one of the best things in Shutter. The extremely loud -Shriek!- or a bang and clatter here and there really adds to the shock effect. Lighting and overall pacing of the film is also constant. There's not a moment to rest, it kept coming with small unexpected moments. There can't be much said for music as there isn't much but it has its few melodic moods to set the tone.Shutter deserves more attention. Perhaps a US re-release such as Grudge and The Ring with a few more scare moments. It really does well as its own horror movie in Thailand and should definitely not be missed by fans of Japanese Horror and horror in general. It will scare you and leave you scared of the dark nights after. Shutter should not be missed by anyone wanting a really good scare.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big Treat for Adrenalin Junkie . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shutter starts with using the ghost appearance phenomena on photograph as the main theme, but as far as the movie goes, it reveals the plot regarding to long-lost love and bitter past life of the main character. i didn't expect too much from Shutter cause i thought it'd be another regular horror movie. (and it's from Thailand, which has produced some bad quality movie of this genre) At the end, i liked it. OK, it contains Asian-horror cliché, but the plot, the story and the puzzle are well-connected. not to mentioned the shocking sound effects and the superb conclusion. it's a big treat for Asian horror fans. very recommended (8/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>probably the best Asian horror after the ring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not that i've seen every Asian horror movie out there of course. i've seen most of the biggies though - ring, ring 2, ju-on, dark water, cure, plus some others i can't remember the names of, and this is up there with the best.Style-wise its not very original and borrows heavily from the Ring in its presentation, but whats wrong with that? Especially when its done as well as this. It's also scarier than the ring in terms of jump-out- of-the-seat moments, though it doesn't have any scenes quite on a par with the ring's freaky crawl out the telly scene, but then that's probably the best horror scene ever so I can forgive it for that! As well as the scares you've got good acting, good well structured plot and a really great ending - I didn't see it coming at all.In conclusion, if you liked the ring you will love this. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A horror movie that doesn't let go from the moment it begins</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's no big news that the horror industry has been in decline for the last 10 or so years. Western horror movies have all been dry-ed up and Hollywood is desperately remaking any Asian horror that has a 5 plus rating on IMDb. Because there people are still making good horror and of course Hollywood has to cash in on that. One such movie that will probably be remade in the next two years is "Shutter". Coming straight from Thailand this is not just good, it's fantastic, probably the most terrifying ride I had since I saw "In The Mouth Of Madness" a few years back. Grabs you by the hand from the first minute and never let's go until the end. The way horror is supposed to be."Shutter" follows a pretty standard formula in terms of plot. A photographer is haunted by the ghost of a woman and as the story unfolds we understand the reason why. Not the most original work, but it's solid in terms of writing and dialogue. The final conclusion is a very ironic yet satisfying experience, in touch with the atmosphere and tension build up to this point. Characters are likable enough so it get's very nerve-wrecking when they find themselves in danger. In fact it's safe to say that the entire movie is nerve-wrecking, psychologically painful and outright scary. This is all done with no small thanks to directors Pisanthanakun and Wongpoom through great camera-work, intimidating make-up effects and careful use of digital effects to enhance the horror elements. It is this careful balance that makes "Shutter" brilliant, it didn't allow itself to be dominated by CGI instead it used a combination of classic horror effects with modern computer generated ones. The atmosphere created is so wonderfully scary and that is no small feat to accomplish considering what is spewed from the U.S. these. Stuff like "Hostel" or "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" (remake) that just pour down gore and think it creates horror. It does not, "Shutter" shows that you must have a certain amount of skill, understanding of the human psyche, what makes us tick, what makes us afraid and then exploit that. Bombarding us with only gore won't do the trick. Hopefully someone will learn that lesson once and for all. Another aspect that is worth noting is the score, once again brilliant stuff composed with a low key piano piece that greatly boosts the atmosphere.Somewhere out there in Hollywood the cash-filled minds of screenwriters are "preparing" "Shutter" for remaking . They will try to make it "better" by casting some A-list overrated pop-idol celebrity. They will dumb it down to a PG-13 rating so that kids would go and see it. They will butcher the story entirely and in the end it will be turned into a shallow, tasteless film devoid of any sort of merit. Hopefully through that remake somewhere, someone will be able to discover the true "Shutter" a horror movie made with more love and devotion than all of those remakes combined.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie in a theater in Bangkok. This is the seventh Thai movie I have ever seen, and by far the best of them all.I heard a lot about the movie at the time and just had to check it out. I'm not going to spoil the story, although I must say that it is quite smart, with the exception of a few scenes. The ending is somewhat of a puzzle and the road to solving it was very enjoyable indeed. I think everyone who likes movies like "The Ring" and "Ju-on" should check this one out, actually, if you like horror movies that should be enough to check this one out.I heard that it has a DVD-release and I encourage everyone who likes horror to check it out! I also must warn people. Before I saw it I heard a lot about how amazingly scary and horrifying it is. It wasn't the most scary thing I ever saw, i must say. But it's still a good movie.My grade is 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy and Very, But Really Very Scary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Bangkok, after celebrating a drinking party with his closest friends, the photographer Tun (Ananda Everingham) and his girlfriend Jane (Natthaweeranuch Thongmee) have a car accident on the road, with Jane hitting a girl. Tun does not allow her to help the girl and they ran away leaving the girl lying on the road. When Tun reveals his latest pictures, he finds some mysterious shadows, while the couple is systematically haunted by the ghost of the girl. Tun investigates and finds that the victim was his former shy and weird girlfriend Natre (Achita Sikamana), who studied with him in the college. Later Jane discloses deep and hidden secrets about the relationship of Natre, Tun and his friends."Shutter" is a creepy and a very, but really very scary horror movie. The story is very well developed, in an excellent pace, with a twist to an unexpected direction and with a great and consistent conclusion. The cinematography intensely explores the red and some black and white very well and the effects are simple but stunning. There is an interesting Message Board, where an IMDb User brilliantly asked: "What is your scariest moment?" It is amazing to read the number of different scenes selected by the users. My favorite scene is when Tun is in the black room revealing a photo, Jane arrives and the phone rings. These samples show that the film offers many frightening moments. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Espíritos, A Morte Está Ao Seu Lado" ("Spirit, Death is At Your Side")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>''Shutter'' is a thai horror film and one of the scariest movies I already watched from the Asian terror, as long as ''The Eye'' and ''Ju-On''. The story of the movie is very well developed and now, every time my neck aches, I will be very worried.The plot is around a young photographer named Thun and his girlfriend Jane, that in one night, after celebrating with their friends, accidentally have a car accident on the road, hitting a young woman. After this accident, many strange and bizarre things starts to happen to Jane and specially to Thun, who we later discover, was the ex boyfriend of the young woman who was hit, called Natre.This movie is an excellent choice for everybody who enjoys horror movies and I really hope that the American studios do not decide to do a remake of it.Ps:The end of this movie, is the scariest moment in my opinion, when Thun realizes that he's carrying the girl on his shoulders.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THERE ARE A FEW SPOILERS IN HERE SO Don't READ UNLESS YOU REALLY WANT TO!!!! First of all, i don't usually comment any movies on here unless they're either really bad or really good. Fortunately for everyone, this movie is the latter...I haven't really watched too many foreign horror movies, so when my friend told me i had to check this one out, i was like "sure, why not?" not really knowing what i was getting into. my friend told me beforehand that the movie had scared every one of the other people he had watched it with and i doubted him since i haven't really been truly scared of a movie since the first night of the living dead. boy was i wrong... first of all, this movie is not for the faint of heart....it really is scary as crap....the actors are quite good too. some are really creepy which makes the movie even creepier. First of all there's Tun the lead character who does an excellent job expressing his feelings in the movie whether it be his depression, fear, or confusion... then there's his girlfriend Jane whos kinda just really annoying most of the time.... and then there's the ghost Natre who i must say has the creepiest makeup I've ever seen...the scenes where shes on the car and when shes freaking Tun out when hes taking pictures and when shes sitting at the edge of his bed pulling the covers off....oh god i couldn't sleep that night i watched it after that scene....all in all this movie is highly recommended for anyone looking for a good scare or just anyone wanting to watch a good mystery... so unless you cant watch movies and read subtitles or just cant stand horror flicks watch this movie...the twist at the end is quite interesting and thought provoking yet weird and disturbing....just remember that Tun has neck pains..........10 out of 10</fullReview>

I am quite a fan of Asian horrors, but objectively, this is such a great movie, everybody will love it. It has suspense, it reveals details step by step, the acting is really great and the ending is something simply amazing! I will not reveal anything else because everyone should watch it without knowing too much. All you need to know is that, if you will buy it, rent it or download it, you will never regret it!

		<fullReview>Having read many of the reviews of this movie by other users, I have come to realise that there is a common theme among the more horror-hardened of them. This movie is unoriginal in it's relentless scares but executes them superbly. Being a novice to horror movies (especially JHorror) i cannot comment on this. However what i can say is that this is by far the scariest movie i have ever seen. Even if this eclectic flick teeters on banal for some, it is definitely worth a watch for most.SPOILERS BELOW What makes Shutter unique is that the objects of the ghosts loathing are neither innocent nor overtly damnable. It retains the tone of foreboding from the ring and applies it to an age old superstition (cameras reproduce reality better than our eyes do, granted with a time delay). If real horror lies in what you don't see, something about showing us what we didn't leaves the audience feeling uneasily vulnerable. Though the ending becomes apparent before actually seeing it, there is no way to brace yourself for the shock. The reflection on the swinging double door is the coolest shot i have ever seen.Bewarned: If you were comfortable in front of a camera before, you will never be again!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Shutter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When this movie was released in Singapore in late 2004, friends raved continuously on how it managed to spook their wits out. I recall the marketing campaign too, with their in cinema posters having put up photographs circled with strange willowy figures, the subjects being oblivious to the special presence of the spectral "friends' from the nether world.And yes it indeed took me so long to finally get to watch this, because like I admit I'm still chicken (you laugh) in watching horror movies that send genuine chills. Actually if you noticed I've ventured into watching and review movies from the horror genre as well, and most of them released these days are laughable stuff. But for those whom friends (who are regular horror shock jocks) have cautioned against, I decided to tread safely and watch this when the sun is still up. And I thought that if I didn't, then I could have well get my fair share of nightmares starting from tonight.You see, like The Ring, this movie had taken an occasional phenomenon, in this case, those that photographers face in the form of expired film, double exposures and the likes, and gave them some ghostly reason to exist. While today's cameras have mostly gone digital, I have gone through the era of film, and have some photographs developed on film as well, so I do have some of those pictures with some of those effects as shown in the movie. It's nothing spooky, but you can't help it if your imagination chooses to run wild. I had to review and watch this because writer-directors Banjong Pisanthanakun and Parkpoom Wongpoom cut their cinematic debut with this movie, and I will have the opportunity to watch their next movie Alone, and sit through a panel discussion with them. Doing my homework is a must.I thought Shutter managed to carve some new horror rules for the Asian horror genre, such as having the story center around a male protagonist (which current horror movies seem to give allowance to as well). And unlike many run of the mill horror movies which do things for the sake of doing them, and rely heavily technically in delivering shock tactics, Shutter had an incredibly believable, and strong storyline at its core. Story matters, and the filmmakers never seem to forget that. In providing a reason for the spook to haunt our protagonists, they have carefully developed characters, scenes, and provided enough plot development in the unravelling of its mystery, giving it a refreshing narrative presentation which still has not aged. Its revelatory scenes is one of the best ever, coupled with the best possible ending which chills, thrills and provide the spills, and it's no wonder why Hollywood came knocking in its season of movie-adaptation hunting.Shutter tells the story of Tun (heartthrob Ananda Everingham), a freelance photographer, and his girlfriend Jane (Natthaweeranuch Thongmee), who after a night out celebrating a friend's wedding, get involved in a hit-and-run episode. Things start to go awry for our couple, staring with the photographs that Tun takes for a living exhibiting strange wispy white shadows, some of which Jane's imagination start to think it was the girl whom they have knocked down. Talk about the consciousness feeling guilty. But investigations into the identity of the woman prove to be more than meets the eye, and cuts closer to home that they both can ever imagine, involving a girl from the past, Natre (Achita Sikarmana)Never relying on cheap tricks, which I thought was a major plus, the production values are top notch, doesn't look cheap for one bit, and that itself lent some gravitas to the credibility of the movie and story - you just don't need quick cuts or jumpy Boo moments to scare - just a carefully developed scene which sends chilling reactions. For that matter, there was a scene that didn't even need to show the actor's face; the strength of the story and for that scene alone, was worth it.At its core, there's a pair of sad love stories cementing the narrative, which if you remove the supernatural elements, might seem to reek of cliché romantic drama series. But in this story of doctored pictures, double exposures, and the lack of focus, it allows reason enough for some reinforcement of the popular thought that our spectral friends usually return to settle their unfinished business, to exact their vengeance, a view that I share because I don't believe all ghosts are as good natured as Casper.All in, this is a horror movie that I'd recommend because it doesn't try too hard, and has a decent story at its core. If you're someone who believes that the camera can capture souls (even from living beings), then Shutter would be right up your alley. Certainly a more satisfying Asian horror movie to come out in recent years, and definitely trumps over many half-baked ideas for the genre that get churned out from Korean to Japan to Thailand.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A superb horror movie! Probably the scariest I ever watched.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>---may contain spoilers--- If you somehow decide to play tough and watch this movie in the dark, just make sure you have your heart medication on standby. Or be prepared to sleep with your lights on for the next few days (me? 4 days).I don't get spooked by horror movies easily. I didn't flinch watching Ringu, I shrieked a little watching Ju-On, and got totally lost and confused watching The Eye. Having said that, I was a bit skeptic upon hearing about Shutter. I thought it would be another chop fest, crawling woman in white sleeping gown-fest, or pointless-like ghost fest.Well, I was kind of right about the crawling-thingy. Only ten times creepier.All horror movies should be like this. It has a fine plot, enough clues to keep you guessing what really happened, characters that the audience like (and hope not to die), and a ghost that is creepier than ever.Of course lots of credit has to be given to all the actors, directors, and screenwriters. I also want to give an extra thumbs up for the casting people. Where the hell did they found that creepy-looking girl??? To me, she is the creepiest girl I've ever seen, both alive and dead! Just a thought, if those Hollywood people DO decide to remake Shutter, they will have a lot of trouble finding a girl as creepy as Natre! I can't imagine a Caucasian/western or even any other female human being looking as creepy as her!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a dark, depressing and intelligent horror movie!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I admit I saw this movie after a long time of its release date....before watching this movie I was under the impression that Asian horror flicks are more about the graphic and visual and less about story line up....well I have no shame to say that I was proved wrong!! this movie on one hand scared me to the core of my spine ...on the other hand..changed the impression of Asian movies which kept me from watching them uptil now.This movie is aboutan Asian guy and his girlfriend.The guy is a photographer.The startingis quite slow..but the movie builds up afterward.He captures some unexplained light and apparitions in his photos..after he accidentally hits agirl who came in the way when he along with his girlfriend(Jane) were travelling at night.Jane asks him to get down and check on her ..but he ignores.They try their level best tocome across a scientific reason for the photographs but to no avail.Jane however is more than keen to find the truth behind the 'what appears to be a girl's apparition' in one of the photograph and ends upin a biology lab where she makes the first contact with the ghost of the girl.In the lab, she also finds a college photo of a groupof friends in which there was a girl who bears a strong resemblance with the girl whowas haunting them. She also spots her boyfriend standing right next to her in the photograph.Jane confronts him and finds outs about a college secret which he hid from her all this time. After that what happens was .....Go watch it!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spooky and effective....had me gasping out of shock in some scenes....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was halfway through watching the American version when I had to sleep for work next day. Then I started watching the original version shortly after, and I have to say, I was not scared one bit in the American version, which is a pity because it tries so hard to scare you.The Thai original achieves what the American one, I could probably say, can only hide in its shadow. There is something about the way Asian horror that seems so much more effective. I think it has to do with the fact that they don't seem to sensationalise everything whereas the remakes are simply putting a sign to the audience saying 'Something Scary: Please be scared'.Shutter is a story about a photographer and his girlfriend, whom the girlfriend accidentally runs into a girl who mysteriously appears on the road one night. Soon after, photos that are taken by the photographer show more to the photos than just the nice scenery and people who are in it, but a mysterious figure who just might be after more than just a shot in a photo that was taken with her not in it.....What makes this effective is that during the scary scenes, you are obviously expecting the scary part to happen, but what surprised me is that it came without me sort of expecting it at that moment or in that way. It actually made me gasp outloud. I think the story does follow a simple formula in which the characters go on a discovery journey to discover the past of this mysterious figure, who is a girl, and that was done in the Ring and the Eye, but it is still effective nevertheless. The camera shots are quite eerie, and the two main actors are pretty good in their performances.What is good about this movie is that they don't reveal so obviously who this mysterious haunting girl is, whereas in the American version, you see her face fully in the first five minutes! I think this is what made it less appealing in the remake. The fact that subtle means the viewer has time to think about what is happening and discover it for yourself instead of thinking we are really stupid and need to have everything thrown at us all at once.Recommended for fans of the horror genre, in particular the Asian horror genre. Forget the remake, this is the one you want to see!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know you have a winner when Hollywood remakes your film with some WB starlets. Shutter will be coming out in March and, like the Japanese remakes will not likely be anywhere as good as the original.This was great horror. The suspense is taut throughout and you don't see the ending coming. In fact, I thought it had ended twice before it actually ended.You want creepy? Achita Sikamana in her first film is really creepy. Her character will give you chills and creep you out like you won't believe.You want good acting? Ananda Everingham and Natthaweeranuch Thongmee certainly provide that.This film ranks up there with Gin gwai and Ringu for superb horror/thriller entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At first I thought this was going to be another disappointment and it was slow going, though watchable, but it picked up nicely near the end making up for the beginning to middle. Near the conclusion there is a scene that was very well done and scary, I even jumped and it gave me a good shiver. This was how horror scenes should be done! Excellent tension and special effects with a big wallop of a surprise. Yes, this has the typical elements of Japanese horror but it's well shot and generates good suspense and thrills especially near the end. The two main actors were very competent and played their roles well. The special effects were quite good and believable. I can see Hollywood remaking this and it will probably be TERRIBLE. This is one foreign horror where the original will be the one to see. This is a good one for all you horror buffs, lately I haven't seen anything good in the horror genre but this was an exception.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clichéd, but well-done and truly creepy, with one of the greatest endings in Asian-Horror history!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first started watching Asian Horror everything was so fresh and new. I was constantly shocked and disturbed (in a good way) by what would unfold in front of me. Two years later, as I've gotten further into the genre, It's lost some of it's effect on me. I mean, how many times can you watch a ghost story with a vengeful long-haired spirit until you get tired of it? So when I got my hands on Tartan's new Asian Horror Film, I was skeptical. Although I had heard good things about the film, I was afraid it was just going to be a re-tread of the same territory staked out by films like Ju-on and Ringu. Luckily, I was wrong. Shutter is the most inventive and genuinely scary horror flick I've seen in a while.Shutter tells the story of Tun and Jane, two photography students, who after a night of partying at a wedding reception, decide to drive home. On there way there they accidentally run over a young girl. Intoxicated and frightened they decide to drive off and leave the girl laying in the road. All seems OK, until Tun develops his next roll of film, where he sees a cloudy apparition that looks a lot like the girl they hit in their car.Sounds like a typical horror movie plot, because it is. It does contain many Asian-Horror cliché's but doesn't suffer from a weak story or bad direction. In fact, Shutter is a very well made Thai horror flick in terms of plot, acting, direction, score, and of course the scares, which Shutter has more than an adequate amount. It's not perfect, but it's a lot better than some of the Asian-Horror I've been watching lately.The main reason I really liked this film, was the premise of camera's capturing mysterious cloudy figures, is a true phenomenon, which makes for some truly creepy scenes. And, of course, this film features one of the best ever endings I've seen in Asian-Horror. It's not over-complicated or anti-climactic look so many of the genre are. I won't give it away but it's sure to give you a decent case of the willies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary, but nothing more.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very Minor Spoilers Despite being a Thai film, "Shutter" will inevitably be compared to Japanese horror of recent years in order to see whether or not it surpasses the genre films it arguably has its roots firmly set in.In this regard I have to say that "Shutter" has more scares than most of the frankly unimpressive Japanese "New Wave" put together. Having heard great things about it, I sat down to watch it with the same dread I had when I saw "Ring" for the first time. Thankfully though, "Shutter" wasn't a complete walk in the park unlike so many of its counterparts unfortunately are.However, where "Shutter" fails is in how much it relies on cheap shocks rather than mood building or suspense. There are a few inspired moments: Tun standing in his dark room, not realising the female figure next to him isn't his girlfriend at all, and Jane flicking through photographs to see the ghostly figure moving across her floor. However these moments, that try to build dread rather than just trying to give the audience a heart attack, are few and far between. Whenever the film "gets going", it's all quick cuts to ghostly figures and women screaming.So, "Shutter" isn't exactly "Suspiria", however it does manage to scare, albeit with childish tactics, which is more than can be said for many of Japan's efforts of late. If scares is all you want, then "Shutter" does not disappoint at all, however you only need to look at Korea and films like "R-Point" to see how much more effective recent Asian horror can be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shutter, The Best Horror Movie after The Ring! A Must See Thriller!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow! This Thailand movie is awesome! It is excellent in story, atmosphere, acting, and of course - the surprising ending you will never forget! I did not see much Thailand movie before, but this movie reached one hundred million in Thailand box office in three days! Then I started to notice this movie. It is shame that the company did not pay much attention to advertise this great thriller, or this movie will be more than that - certainly will be adapted and remake by Hollywood. This movie uses camera and its pictures to create extraordinary atmosphere. The acting is great, and the story is extremely scary - especially the ending - just like another great "the sixth sense" (you will never forget when the ending comes) At the beginning till the end, the score is great and creepy. Even it is obvious that the budget is quite low, but the story is very clever and the directors (two directors) are intellectual and they know how to tell a scary story without going to the boring formula. This clever movie not only wants to scare its audiences, but also tell something to make people think (especially for male audiences - if you have seen this movie, you know what I mean~ha~ha) Basically, in the first part of this movie, the directors put some elements to imply the final ending and create suspicious atmosphere. They do not need to use blood and gore to make the audiences uneasy and scary. Instead, they use ordinary stuffs to scare people (and all the setting is located in ordinary places) This makes people feel much more frightened because the scary story is happening in the places where people live in daily life. Wow! This movie is really good. It becomes one of my favorite scary movies since "The Ring". (I prefer the Japanese version) Rent it from the video stores if they have. You will not disappoint!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great ending covers for a lot of holes in the first hour.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the original Thai version, not the US remake that I have heard is rubbish, as most remakes are. The Ring being the most notable example.In an unprecedented first for OGR I did a few clicks research to find that the original Shutter was rated a paltry 40%, but the US remake was universally loathed with a 7% grade. Before this I hadn't seen either but as a rule of thumb where I have the chance I'll check the original first.Now 40 minutes in I thought I was watching a remake anyway, that of an amalgamation of The Ring and The Grudge. There were repeated occasions where the scares seemed directly ripped from either of those pretty good flicks, and even the ghost (when in ghost-mode) looked exactly like the pale chick from Ju-on (The Grudge). Even though Shutter partially redeems itself in the last 15 minutes I was a little disappointed by these scenes that blurred the line between homage and copying.The first scene is pointless, unless you are a fan of what appears to be bad acting by a guy with a Thai Jerry Lewis voice (it's hard to pick bad acting when you don't understand the language). However on the way home from the drinking session the central couple Jane and Tun are sorta chatting in the car when a girl appears out of nowhere on the road and is promptly bowled over. After realising what has happened and making sure they are both OK Tun urges Jane to drive off without checking on the victim, and as she is in a state of panic she agrees.In the ensuing days Jane starts regretting her indecisiveness, and the next 20 minutes are straight Ring-lite. It turns out that Tun is a photographer and after completing a job he finds all of his exposures are blurry and in one particular shot it appears there is a "mystery" guest. The Ghost appears at various spots, each time with a personal "BOO" soundtrack jolt and many times with the old misdirection trick of the guy looking one way, then turning back to be face-to-face with their would be assailant.A better title at this point in the film would have been "Ghost Camera", lousy title but reflective of what had transpired to that point. Upon visiting a tabloid magazine it turns out that the best way to get a true, tamper proof picture using a polaroid camera is the go, as it only shows what it sees.Then things gradually take a turn for the better, Jerry Lewis shows at Tun's pad pleading for the "photos" before abruptly disappearing. Then Tun discovers that Jerry and the other two faceless amigos from the opening scene in the movie have all topped themselves, Tun understandably gets even more concerned, and Jane says she'll stand by him. Cut to a baffling scene in the public loos, only a 2 minute scene but worthwhile nonetheless, as without spoilers it is pretty funny.Even though the first hour and a bit should owe royalties to The Grudge and The Ring, the movie is redeemed and worth watching for the last 15 minutes alone. There are a couple of scenes that provide real chills and the payoff is actually cool and original.Turns out that the ghost has a name, as many movie ghosts do - Natre. Can't say much more about the plot without giving things away so I'll wind up with a few questions that this movie raises:- Why haven't Thai car manufacturers gotten better worldwide recognition? In one scene Tun is driving at 120 km/h and is able to veer off the road and stop before leaving the bitumen, that's 120 km/h to 0 km/h within the width of two lanes!- If you own your own darkroom in your house why would you get your holiday happy snaps developed at the local photo shop.- If you have anything that you would rather no-one else saw, why would you leave it lying around the house?Final Rating - 7 / 10. Pretty sure it isn't worth a 7 overall, but a good ending will help you ignore many of the faults and flaws in the first hour.If you liked this (or even if you didn't) try oneguyrambling.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching this movie for the second time in two days I've realized how nicely executed it is overall. There are so many memorable scenes that just left me in awe of how cool they were pulled off. Everything that can be associated with cameras - red rooms, flashes, loading sounds - are all used with plenty of creepy impact.Where this movie really sets itself apart from anything I've seen in a long time is the last 30-45 minutes. When the story starts to come together, the movie goes to a different level, all to be capped off by an incredibly shocking ending...and chilling final scene. This is a case where an ending means so much to the film - it was extremely effective.The only problems I have with this movie are very little and don't have much impact on it as a whole. If you are a fan of horror, you have to check this one out - unless you hate subtitles, in which case you can wait until this movie gets "Americanized" like so many foreign horrors before it and stars Charlie Conway.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every once in awhile, a film maker who wants to do something new with the horror film can get hold of a budget and produce something that generates some genuine chills. SHUTTER, directed by Thai directors Parkpoom Wingpoom and Banjong Pisanthanakun, is that kind of effort. Not a splash of gore more than what's needed, not one more ghost jumping out of the scenery then is absolutely necessary, and just enough psychological twist to keep the viewer hooked.Tun and Jane are coming home from a drunken party when they appear to have hit a pedestrian on the dark road. Tun persuades Jane that they should flee the scene, and from there, the good times roll. Tun is a photography major, and in short time, spectral images begin to appear in his finished photographs. Jane is the first of the pair to encounter a vengeful spirit named Natre in Tun's studio one afternoon, and it takes a good deal of probing Tun's less than savory past that brings the whole story of what is happening to the surface. The closing images of the film, which explain a troublesome crick Tun has developed in his neck, are some of the more haunting efforts I've come across in the last few rounds of cinematic terror I've looked into. This is a very tidy work, the creative team on the movie knew what they wanted to do from start to finish.There are a few predictable moments in the story, but nothing that weakens the pace or atmosphere with this production crew worked so hard to create. SHUTTER is a very fine piece of work.</fullReview>

The suspense and tension are present from the very beginning to the terrifying end.On the other hand, the thing that really bothered me was its lack of originality. I mean...

		<fullReview>The Grudge, A Tale of Two Sisters, The Eye, Pulse, Spiral, Dark Water: ever since Sadako crawled from her well in Hideo Nakata's Ringu, horror fans have been inundated with Asian ghost movies featuring vengeful long-haired spooks and creepy kids.Shutter, another such film from Thailand, tells the tale of a young couple who are haunted by the restless spirit of a schoolgirl, and delivers the usual array of predictable ghostly goings-on to be found in such fare. But even though it rarely explores new ground, this film manages to be a very enjoyable example of the sub-genre thanks to superb handling of the material by Banjong Pisanthanakun and Parkpoom Wongpoom.Despite this being their debuts as directors, these guys really know what they're doing when it comes to freaking out an audience, delivering lots of atmosphere, plenty of effective shocks, and loads of supremely creepy scenes guaranteed to have viewers regularly checking over their shoulders for pasty-faced dead girls.If your idea of sheer terror is looking down to the end of your bed only to see a lank-haired, white-eyed corpse staring back at you, then Shutter is one film guaranteed to give you sleepless nights.

		<fullReview>Okay, this movie suffered majorly under the 'hype'. If my expectations wouldn't have been SO high, I wouldn't be a tad disappointed. What bothers me most is that every Asian horror movie I've ever seen (would be about 4 now) all have this 'grudge' creature. Essentially...it isn't a flaw. It's a style, a typical element and not a cliché. But still...my top 10 horror movies consists of 10 very different (innovative) horror styles. What actually bothers me a lot more is the fact that the back story plays always more or less the same. And not only in horror movies, Oldboy (which was fabricated in Korea, not Thailand I know that :-)) has pretty much the same tale. Battle Royale qualifies as a rare exception...which is why I hold that flick in high esteem.There were some scenes that made me jump (high!). Most notably the scenes where the ghost girl turns her head in the picture and where the blanket starts being pulled away (wow). And also the end is quite haunting. I would've given it an 8 or so but there are some glaring faults like the girlfriend character being pretty pointless and one dimensional. She's only good for the revelation in the third act. And also the lack of focus on the suicides of all the friends. 6.66/10 (very appropriate)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To those who are reading these comments to decide whether to watch or not, my advice is WATCH and judge later. I watched this movie on the big screen 4 years ago, subsequently bought the DVD and still very impressed with it. The news of a Hollywood remake is what prompted me to write this comment to urge would- be-viewers to watch the original instead. The story is well told and acted with enough suspense and twists to keep you interested throughout the movie. It is important to keep an open mind and allow the directors to reveal the plot accordingly. There would be no fun if you try to be 'logical' because the beauty and hence, logic, of this movie lies in how the plot unfolds. Perhaps the best tip is to watch without any expectations of it being a very scary movie. Too much anticipation and hype will usually fall flat even with the best horror movie. I would personally rank this as one of the most disturbing and scary movie I have watched to date, together with 'The Ring' (Japanese original) and 'The Exorcist'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a terrifying film! "Shutter", a horror film from Thailand, in Asia, were apparently you can find world's best cinema, is one of those movies were you get scared'but you don't jump off your seat; you get an incredible amount of goosebumps in your body and you you want to look somewhere else than the screen.It's the kind of movie where you know when something's coming but it gets you anyway. So professionally crafted, rehearsed, performed and executed, is a horror film that no one should miss. It tells the story of Tun (Ananda Everingham) and Jane (Natthaweeranuch Thongmee) a normal couple that receives a visit from the abnormal.Who this supernatural being is and why he or she decides to visit, I will keep for myself. It's fair to say, however, that even when the movie has many characters, the camera only cares for the main couple and what they go through.This is something you may not forgive in a normal film, but when the crowd disappears and there's an empty hallway and only one character walking it, you don't question reality. Maybe it's because you want to be scared by horror, as Michael Caine said that "you want to be fooled" by magic, in "The Prestige".Whether you're a fan of the genre or not, this images are going to stay with you long after "Shutter" is over. Directors and writers Banjong Pisanthanakun and Parkpoom Wongpoom have created something that, and this has to be understood, is purely horror. Character development, technical details...These are not the main things here; they shouldn't be taken into account. "This is the scariest film I've seen in my life", some friends told me. It might be true after all.</fullReview>

Even the comedic moments were perfectly timed and excellent relief from a build-up of suspense.It is also worth noting that the actors in this movie were superb!

Even better than some of the best of the recent Asian films like the Grudge, Dark Water etc. This film is as chilling as the best of the 1970s movies. The reasoning behind the scares makes great sense--a plot, indeed. Don't be put off by the fact that it is subtitled or by the different sound of the language. The music is a great part of it and, frankly, I scarcely noticed the subtitles once I was hooked. No doubt, Hollywood will discover this film and do a terrible remake. One can only hope that they dub it instead.I was delighted to discover this, will watch it again, and highly recommend it to those viewers who desire true scares and not just gore. This is the most frightening film I have seen in years and I have been searching for just this kind of satisfaction for too long.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is in my opinion the best Asian ghost flick from all the bunch. Forget about "Ringu" or "Gin gwai"."Shutter" has a dramatic plot that involves passion, betrayal, cruelty, and revenge from the grave. I dug the concept about ghosts and photographs. This movie somehow makes a critic against "ghosts captured in photographs" ; a subject that is very popular and commercialized on the internet. Heck, I even identified some "famous" pictures that have been circulating on the net for years in this movie.The movie is fast paced and goes directly to the point immediately after it starts. I really feel that giving away the basic plot would be like giving away the shocking sub-plot involving a ghost so I will leave it for you to watch it.All I can say is that this movie will stick in your mind for some time because it truly deals with a justified passionate revenge from the grave. I truly felt sadness for the ghost female character and her background. The ending will leave you cold in fear.My only problem with this good movie is that sometimes the CGI was uncalled for. The scene where the female ghost is chasing Tun outside the building looks very cheap; CGI cheap. But overall this movie is really good and has excellent f/x, music, acting, and superb direction. Also, expect some decent scares scenes and "jump out of your seat" chilling sounds.A really nice surprise from Thailand. From now on I will surely check out Horror movies from this industrialized country that my family has had the chance to visit.</fullReview>

Looks good, with immaculate framing and editing, sounds good (too good sometimes, sounded like someone was creeping through my back door at times!) with the unusual music also helping to maintain the mood. Unusually, perhaps for far eastern movies the dialogue (or more accurately the translation) is very good too. This movie has you unnerved from the beginning and after a short pause while the basis for the film is set up the thing just relentlessly hurtles towards its grand finale. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best Horror Movies I have ever seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The following story is about Tun, Jane and Natre. When Tun and Jane were returning home they hit a girl who suddenly appeared on the road. Without helping the girl they ran away. After that Tun discovered some shadow like marks on his photographs. After so many research Jane came to know that the girl they hit that night was Tun's former girlfriend. From this starts a very horrifying and very beautiful movie. The story also gives us a very tactful message about love and betrayal. The direction of the movie is top class. The cinematography of the movie is very professional. It didn't seem to be a amateur movie. Go and watch the movie SHUTTER. You won't be disappointed. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Asian horror that makes sense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been a fan of Asian horror ever since the buzz surrounding Ringu. I've sought out as many as I can find, only to be disappointed by the repetition and unoriginality of most of the titles.The first few scenes of Shutter seemed to follow this trend -- a young girl as the central villain, with hair and water and all the common elements.But as simple ghost-revenge type movie, this is the best I've seen. Excellent effects, really tense scenes and a couple of cheap frights that work better than they should all combine to create a solid and engaging horror flick.But the best thing about Shutter is that it makes perfect sense. The story, characters and events are all well-motivated and it doesn't rely on confusion (as does a film like Ju-On) to create fear.All in all, this Thai entry into the Asian horror genre is an excellent film and comes highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly the best horror I've ever seen in a long time, by far...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not being a particular fan of its genre, I started out watching this film with small expectations. But it became clear from the start that I was in for a treat.The story revolves around the well known theme 'revenge from beyond the grave' but its carried out in a truly original way. I believe what really makes the story great is that it requires little to no suspensions of disbelief. That is, if u believe in ghosts. And if you don't believe in 'm , you certainly will after having seen this flick.I can hardly think of anything about this film that deserves complaining; truly remarkable directing from two men for whom this film was their first major feature. Incredibly great cinematography and superb acting throughout. Not to mention some really good scares.Most of all I praise the way the story is delivered; we only get to understand at the end of it what is truly going on and there are quite a few revelations during the development of the plot. Furthermore, the story is neatly rounded up which gives it the closure that so many other movies in this genre lack. Don't hesitate to see this one! 9/10!</fullReview>

Its not very scary after you've seen it like a hundred times (cause thats what I did) I think there's a few lessons in this film such as don't be a follower when you hang out with bad friends like Tun and don't be a bad person because it will come back and get you...karma.Two years later, in Thailand, I bought the limited edition DVD with lots of extra features....I went to Thailand just to find Shutter.10/10 for me one of my favorite horror movies next to The Sixth Sense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Horror Flick!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shutter is one of the best scary/ horror films I've seen. It's might look like a typical horror Asian flicks such as The Ring, The Grudge because it has a spooky, long-hair girl as a ghost in the movie, but the story-line and shocking ending of this movie definitely set itself apart from the other movies. The movie starts when a young couple that lives in Bangkok is on their way home from friends' wedding and they see a girl walks right in front of their car and they believe that that run over her. The young photographer, Tor, which is the driver panics and decides to leave the scene when his girlfriend, Jane, wants him go back and check if the girl gets hurt or not.After the night of the incident, they decide to go to the police station and hospitals to check if somebody died or got hurt on that day. There's no record of death or injury at that location. They start having nightmares about the girl and the pictures that the Tor take show some strange white shadows which are the clue to help Jane know who the girl is and what happens between the mysterious girl and her boyfriend, Tor. The ending was one of the most twisted endings ever created in a horror flick. I do not want to give out to much of the storyline. The movie will definitely give you goose bumps. A must see for scary movie fan. You are guaranteed to jump at least twice or three times during the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, so as far as Asian flicks go, this may be just another 'knock off', with reminiscence of Ring, One Missed Call, Ju On, whatever. But despite it's slight unoriginal plot line, the film on its own is very well made.The film's effects (visual, and none visual) make the film. The slick sounds, and the general plot of it are fantastic, because unlike a lot of Asian horror, it actually focuses on something other than general jumps and scares (which, I must say, it provides nicely - not over done, but it still gives you a fright now and then), but it provides a massive tension which stretches throughout the film.I have one criticism (among a few minor others, but lets not go into them). Although the music is very good at setting an atmosphere, it also tends to build you up for fake intentions, so beware.Aside from that, the sound, music, and visuals make up for it's usual 'vengeful ghostie' trick, and the plot that unfolds throughout the film takes your mind away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best foreign horror flicks I've seen in a while</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From beginning to end, the story is very suspenseful. Tun (Ananda Everingham) is a young photographer, who along with his girlfriend Jane (I'm not even going to write her real name) discover eerie and unusual shadows on their photos after they've hit an innocent bystander with their car, and Tun seems to be familiar with the bystander. From there on, the movie gets even more suspenseful and then it's all "in your face" from middle to end. This is the horror movie of today's decade that I've been waiting for, unlike the likes of 'The Grudge' and 'The Ring' movies and other horror movies out today. This movie alone, knocks out almost any Japanese horror flick on the shelf of a video store. Never have I seen an Asian horror movie so entertaining and so damn scary since Takashi Miike's Ôdishon ('Audition'). I do have a feeling that there will be an American version of this as soon as they discover it, since Hollywood has already ran out of ideas of their own. Strongly recommended. -- (9/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For the most part an original tale which captured my intrigue within the first five minutes of watching. The movie took me through a journey of mystery, suspense and surprising (yet plausible) twists which held my interest and kept me guessing right through to the end.A definite recipe for success for me! I find some horrors either to be excessively gratuitous in the gore sector, or that they try too hard to be 'a scary movie' which often leads to a clichéd and predictable movie. I'm glad to say that Shutter was neither.Minimal gore (which I personally prefer), but quite chilling at times, not to mention an air of mounting paranoia as the movie proceeds. Even after watching Shutter more than a couple of times, my enjoyment of it doesn't lessen.Its interesting storyline and convincing acting by Ananda Everingham will surely keep any watcher's interested piqued.Definitely worth a watch. Even more-so now I hear a rumour that there's to be a Hollywood remake!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's hard to find a good horror movie nowadays. Most of them don't really scary you, they just make you jump off your seats because of the sound. Besides, a movie about a ghost of a girl that haunts people who did something bad to her, is not that original, is it? Movies like The Ring, Dark Water, The Eye, The Grudge (all Asiatic movies with American remakes) have almost the same plot. And Shutter is not different.This movie tells the story of a young Thai couple who kill a girl. After that, the ghost of the girl starts haunting them by appearing in photos (they're photographers). The point is, the movie is great because the main couple aren't dumb as the other main characters in every other horror movie. No, they're actually very smart! They're search for intelligent answers. Yes, this movie has scary parts and funny parts as every other, yes they make you scream only by raising the sound at the exact moment the ghost shows up. But it's an intelligent movie with a slightly different plot (the reason why the main character has his neck hurt is just great!) Okay, I won't say anything else because I don't want to spoil it.Just watch it. 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've had my fair share of horror flicks and the Shutter is, by far, in my top 5 list of the scariest horror movies of all time. I won't bore you with another synopsis, just that this movie is a must-see for all horror fans.Here in Thailand, all Asian horror flicks hit the screen. I've seen most of them. I wouldn't say it borrows too much, if at all, from the Ring/Ju-on. Original the Ring is so-so and the Hollywood remakes are passable. Ju-on is, for lack of a better word, pathetic. The first time a dead woman comes crawling down the stairs is spooky. Twice after in the same movie, it becomes hilarious. I remember turning to my brother during yet another crawling-down-the-stairs scene, saying if there was a baseball bat nearby, I'd probably pick it up and hit the bitch repeatedly while, oh yes, laughing in her battered face. It just gets old. And don't get me started on the boy-ghost. Puh-lease.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A REAL Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a fan of recent horrors as, well, none of them are really horrors. If you put on say, the evil dead at 12 midnight, chances are you'll leave the light on while you sleep. But if you put on say, the ring, chances are you'll dream of candies and lollipops. Basically anything that doesn't fit any of the other categories is horror, or so you'd think, the way horrors are being produced nowadays. Shutter however brings the macabre genre back to where it should be. I am not easily scared, and to say that the last time I got scared was when I was five, would be the complete truth. That is, until A couple of minutes ago when a creepy looking girl popped out of nowhere. Oh yes, you will get your fill of jumps from this movie, guaranteed. I am proud to give this movie a 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A picture speaks a thousand words. It can also scare the hell out of you! For those that slept, this isn't a wannabe RING or KAIRO. This is one spooky trek. Almost devoid of humor, Shutter shows the wrath of an unrested soul. Instead of relying on BOO tactics or typical horror plots, Shutter progressively draws you the audience into terror as well as the film's characters. It's tricky to tell what happens next which, I feel, adds to the movie; your attention stays glued to the screen almost as if Sadako was climbing out of it. I liked those creepy pics! I've never watched Thailand horror, but if these guys direct another one, count me in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Shutter reminded me very much of Leslie Cheung's last movie, Inner Senses without the happy ending.Shutter was more jump scares then anything else while retaining the emotion evocative of The Eye.The directing was really good, and I liked how they incorporated the most well known spirit photos into the storyline to help build the plot.The scares were very cliché, pulling motifs from all over the Asian horror genre, from The Ring, The Eye, Inner Senses, and Ju-On, this movie is meant to make you jump, and it does.A lesson that you cannot run from the past, you must embrace it and make amends where we have wronged or hurt those whose trust we have betrayed.The plot is complete, which is a rare thing in horror movies. It creates substantial tension, backs off beautifully, then when you think it's over it takes you deeper."Sometimes spirits long for their loved ones." This movie may be about longing, but it is also about absolution, loss and regret.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really don't like Thai movies as I saw lousy films like "Bangkok Haunted", and "Diecovery", until I saw "Shutter". Shutter is a film about ghosts who appeared in Pictures. A young photographer found some strange figures on his photographs. Looks like another "Ringu" and "Ju-on" revenge movie will happen again right? NO. Your definitely wrong. Shutter is a unique Asian horror film, and even as a huge horror movie fan, I never think on that kind of story. I never think that "Ghosts on Photographs" can be so scary. The acting quality stands outs, specially the girl who played Natre, probably the next best ghost performer since Takako Fuji who played Kayako in Ju-On. The scary moments are so effective. The "pick a boo" since are really scary, it made me jump actually. The scary moments worked together, making a solid film. The mystery is interesting, as if you will crave to know the ending quickly. Shutter is a very scary and very exciting horror film from Thailand.Kudos for Thailand, The cast, the crew and the makers of this brilliant film!*****/***** starsAlso, check out "The Unborn" and "The Sisters", another great horror movies from Thailand.</fullReview>

But it's another story about restless soul that looks for a way for finding rest and punishment for those who made them hurt. There have been a movie about tape, about phone (and maybe something else) and this one is about photography. But this one is really spooky.

		<fullReview>Having watched plenty of Asian horror movies, I came to conclusion that our two cultures generally get scared by somewhat different things. For example, the Japanese Ringu was not even remotely as scary as its American remake for me with my Western upbringing, yet my Asian friends were terrified. However The Shutter proved this assumption totally wrong. Not only this was probably the scariest movie I've seen since The Exorcist, but it also manages to combine its frights with an amazing atmosphere and keeps viewer on the edge until the end. Every scene is filled with suspense and is shot from a perfect angle. Reinforced by a very good musical score and not so cheap special effects, The Shutter came up to the top on my horror movie list. The only two problems that the movie suffered from are a somewhat predictable and cheesy overall plot, along with a somewhat shallow acting, but everything else in it is simply brilliant. Two thumbs up!</fullReview>

Comparisons to The Ring and Ju-On are fair but Shutter does stand in a class of it's own with interesting character development and original storytelling. Be prepared to jump and be intrigued by the plot as it winds to a horrifying conclusion. Shutter is definitely one of the better horror movies made in a while. If any complaint exists for many Asian horror movies, it's that the special effects surrounding the make-up on the ghost never quite seem to come out believable. It's clear the directors relied less on makeup and more on mood and atmosphere to lay claim to many "jump out of your seat" moments. See it, this one's a guaranteed shocker! Maddis 8/10</fullReview>

Western horror films are now too predictable and formulaic which means that the mainstream 'horror' films hold no surprise and (let's face it) don't scare you. Whilst watching Shutter i actually had tingles going up my spine because i was really being creeped out...i can't remember a film ever doing that. As for scares, YES you will jump.Excellent script acted out by two fine young actor's (they themselves looked scared), good direction and a story that remained interesting and sensible without drifting off in to 'cliche' land. As for the ending...brilliant.If you are a fan of this genre (or not) this film should be watched because you will be judging any horror films you see after by this. It sets standards.</fullReview>

And I do not have scares during movies and on two occasions I actually jumped and yelled out. Like I said,that is something I just do not do watching movies.

		<fullReview>Being an avid horror fan I thought I'd seen it all, until "Shutter". This movie has a scare formula that works effectively throughout the entire movie. The music and editing create the atmosphere that the set design did not, while the sound aided repeatedly for the many great startling scares. Combine this with a thrilling mystery, unnatural visual imagery and make up, and you get one of the creepiest ghost stories ever told. The pace was wonderful as the biggest scares came every 15 minutes throughout this fright fest, with some thrown at you machine gun style. Watch this in the dark, with the sound cranked up, and if you dare...alone. It made my hair stand up at least 4 times and my goosebumps had goosebumps. Enjoy this tasty morsel of horror!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The idea of the monster in the west is very different than that in the east. Here, it is informed by Christian sensibilities and local lore. American monsters deal with fears brought up in our culture. They reinforce our values and deal with our own mythology. The Horatio Alger myth and the American ideal of rugged individualism are all prized. But concepts like a linear flow of time with a definite beginning and end are not universal. Thus, western horror films have their own set of conventions and eastern films seem completely separate, even as both use the same basic tools.In the Jungian sense, there aren't that many types of monsters to begin with. The same types are used over and over because it allows for shorthand in the storytelling. There are unspoken agreements and understandings between the audience and the filmmakers. Stories show up and are repeated in genre's because of constraints and tenants of the genre.Some of the main examples of monsters are: A: Ghosts B:Bigfoot/Sasquatch/abominable snowman/werewolf C: Ghoul D:Vampire/zombie/undead E: Witches/Wizard/Banshee/Succubus/Incubus E:Alien F: Mythological beast* (this includes dragons, king kong, giant bug movies.) G: Demons/evil Gods** *Note that aliens are often included in this section too. The Xenomorph in Alien and the Predator in Predator would both be mythological beasts. However, the speaking intelligent alien creatures found in some films are sufficiently different as to demand their own category. Of course, these aliens would probably be closer to the Greek Gods and thus be mythological anyway.**Demons are of course mythological too, but they are treated differently in Christian countries.Each of these types of creatures shows up in all western societies. Karl Jung had a theory about stories like these, that they were programmed into our brains as part of a mass consciousness. Even if they aren't, we have been trained to recognize these ideas and creatures in movies. This is good it lets movies move faster without explaining what a ghost is in every time.Horror films are basically an extension of children's stories. Most all children's stories exist to impart morals to the next generation and to reinforce the idea of order in the world. A guide will show up in many children's stories to explain the rules of the universe to the main character (a modern example being the Faun in Pans Labyrinth) who must then follow these rules. When a rule is broken, the protagonist is punished. When a rule is followed, the protagonist is rewarded. This teaches children to function within a society.The horror film takes this premise and applies these rules to the monster. It is important that the audience knows what the monster is so that they can follow the rules. It's why you can tell who will die immediately when a slasher film starts. Those are the social norms and morals you have been taught by these films.The west intrinsically understands the what and why of Jason and Freddy. But, the meanings of most of the eastern films are obscured to us. The seemingly omnipresent dark haired female ghost found in many films, (Ringu, The Grudge, Dark Water) is a cultural presence in the eastern world. Unless a western remake sufficiently alters the original as to localize this creature, (like The Ring) the meanings are lost and the underlying message is muddled as can be seen with the recent crop of American imitations of eastern horror (The Messengers, Dead Silence, FearDotCom).The soaking wet, raven haired adolescent ghost found in eastern horror is a representation of the cultural values found there. She is, to some extent, an extension of the "Ying/Yang." Men are seen as more physically strong, while women are seen as more mentally inclined, including a propensity toward psychic power. The girl is not actually a ghost, but rather an amalgamation of a banshee, a ghost and a witch. Genre mashing like this is fine. It is done all the time, but when categories are blurred, an explanation of the creature becomes necessary. There must be unity and internal logic to the piece. Weird stuff can't just happen. If it does, the movie will be rejected by the mass populace.And that's why you should see "Shutter" in its unmolested Tai form. Even if you don't understand the cultural through lines, there is a logical unity to the piece which allows for greater emotional investment on the part of the viewer. When things start to go wrong, as bizarre as the course of events are, they never feel haphazard. And things get weird, and very, very scary."Shutter" tells the story of a young photographer couple who accidentally hit a young woman while driving home from a party. They leave her to die, but have second thoughts and go to inspect the crime scene, only to discover that no one has any idea what they are talking about. Then, mysterious anomalies begin to show up in their photos.I jumped 3 or 4 times during "Shutter." It's a damn scary movie. Within 2 years, American audiences will see the remake hit screens. But, you should see this version first. It's terrifying, even without resorting to cheap "Boo!" scares. There is a general sense of malaise to the whole affair. And far from being derivative of Ringu as the cover art would seem to imply, the film is actually vastly superior to that work. Few movies have ever made me as uncomfortable as some of the scenes in Shutter and though some of the twists do feel slightly reminiscent of Oldboy, there is so much to treasure in this veritable horror masterpiece.Post Script. Don't watch the trailers, they give away many of the best moments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's not original but it kept me fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a cliché in Asian horror movies that it is the appearance of ghosts.Shutter tells that story,so it is not original.But the movie kept me fun.Usually,Asian movies have a slow development which makes them boring,for example,A missing call.But Shutter has not got a slow development.The script shows intelligence on some parts and there are good scary moments.Shutter is not an original movie and it is far away from the best horror movies made in Asia(by my point of view,the best ones are The eye and Ju-on),but it kept me very fun and it is way better than commercial horror movies made in Hollywood(like The fog or When a stranger calls).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My 2 friends came over and one of them brought a horror movie that we could watch because we were bored. The movie happened to be The Shutter, and at first I thought it was a pointless scary movie that had no plot line or something. But after watching the movie, it gave me the same feeling that I have watching say... a good action movie.The way the movie was put together was phenomenal, and the storyline gets you hooked and it never lets you go. There were scary scenes, obviously being a horror movie, that gave me goosebumps and jump around scared crapless.I recommend this movie to anyone that likes mystery/horror movies, it's also an excellent movie to watch with females, you'll probably see what I mean after watching it.You'll just have to see why it has a bit like Hero (IMO that is), but I think I might give to much away to explain it. Basically this movie was put together smartly, the people that made it are geniuses. Quit reading and go grab the movie =)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Shudder of Shutter!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you like a good scare, this film is not to be missed! While it borrows a bit from the Ringu cycle, the film makers have added enough originality to make the film stand on its own. It is all done with a great deal of talent and packs quite a horrific blow! I had the pleasure of viewing this film on DVD and was surprised by all of the clever editing tricks employed by the filmmakers. Some of this editing is so sneaky it happens before your eyes can catch it! I suspect that, because belief in ghosts is more acceptable in eastern culture --- the emphasis on why and what is scary differs from what we western viewers are used to seeing in a horror film. Very often, in western horror film, half the scare is that there is a ghost at all. In eastern horror films the existence of ghosts seem to be more taken from granted so the root of the horror in these film is unique to western viewers. There are several scenes in this film that left me feeling fairly "shaken" and disturbed. This one will most definitely stay with you! A must see for fans of the horror genre. It is also exciting to see another great film come from Thailand! The two lead actors are particularly effective in their roles! 10+++++ One quick word of guidance, I would not suggest this film for viewing by children. This is an adult horror film.</fullReview>

The fact that it had all of the basic characteristics of a horror film, plus the added psychological twist, made this movie a must-see.By the end, you'll find yourself sympathizing with the ghost as well as with the main characters.Well done.Definitely scarier than THE RING and THE GRUDGE. Maybe the American release will tone it down a bit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A young couple inflict a fatal hit-and-run, and become the object of ghostly revenge.Simple story that develops complications as layers of deception are peeled away. I did find this a bit ho-hum as it went through its paces, but at about 75 mins it hit the after burners and turned out a satisfying horror. The concept is very good, and there is plenty of skill in the story telling, but there was too much emphasis on the couple in slowly edited scenes while the curious fate of the other characters was pretty much dumped in as a fait accompli and the victim was only "fleshed out" in cliché flashbacks. But once that awkwardness is put behind us the true chills set in.The performances are OK, probably too much dialogue. One toilet scene was amusing, but should have been ditched - kill your babies. Photography was ordinary, which is disappointing given the theme of the story and the bit of philosophy about photos and reality injected early on. Plenty of Ringu style menace, but the swinging door image at the end gives the story a unique poignancy.Music was effective, and there is one good, simple jump scare in a bedroom scene.Overall: Well directed climax makes up for medium paced build up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Enjoyable Asian Supernatural Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shutter - another Asian supernatural horror and one that can be ranked up alongside others like Ringu and Ju-on....maybe even surpassing both. To say that it was fantastic would be taking it a bit far, but it is definitely one of the better Asian horror films that I've seen and also one of the creepier ones too. The story doesn't really grip you at first, but as it develops &amp; unravels it draws you in more, and actually ends up developing really nicely with plenty of twists and turns, with one of the best being at the end. It really is a well scripted story.The story is of a young couple, Tun and Jane, who get into a car accident knocking over a young girl. Panicking, the two drive away leaving the girl in the road. Not that long after the incident Tun starts to see what looks to be a feint figure in any photograph that he takes. The images and sightings start to become a lot more frequent, and after some investigating Jane finds out who the girl is...and what she had to do with Tun years before.Like a lot of Asian horrors, this isn't heavily reliant on special effects or visuals and while there are obviously some, it's not on a huge scale. That may sound like a complaint but it's not because the the scare effects in Shutter are done really well....with actors and not CGI. It kind of gives it more of a real feeling, and the scares that are in the movie are good. There's definitely a few that will creep you out and make you jump a wee bit. It's these scares that help carry the story along nicely, and you can tell that they are not used to just try and help a weak story line....they make a good story line better.The acting is also much better in this movie than in some Asian horror films that I have seen which also obviously helps the movie. If you don't have actors that can do a good job in selling the story then what hope is there? If you enjoy Asian horror films, then Shutter has to be on your list of ones to see.Definitely one to recommend.</fullReview>

The story is very interesting to watched from beginning to the end of film. The story line in this film is constructed well and clear. The mystery between the character, Tun, Jane, friends, Natre and ghost also quite difficult to predict and could make curios the audience. The twist when the film almost over also added more points for this movie. Simplicity is the attraction of Shutter. There is not a lot of visual effects used in this film, but some scenes that seems trivial even more scary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An entertaining movie with a good storyline</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie, Shutter really has a very good storyline with many unique scares. This movie is very well paced and the more scary moments comes toward the end. This movie is unique because the ghosts attacks the photos. There are many interesting scenes in this movie. The dark humour (about the toilet scene) in this movie contributes a whole lot to this movie. The ending of this movie was similar to ringu 2 but was done far better than that show. That was lots of character development and the acting of this film was just great. The staircase scene in which the main character keeps on being on the fourth floor was interesting. The scene where the main character's wife vomits blood is terrifying and entertaining(This is not a common scene in other horror movies) Everything in this movie was clear and explained very well. The ghost, Natre who walks on the ceiling was well done and terrifying. However, I still do have one major complain about this movie. I thought the part where the main character tries to escape by climbling the ladder out of the window was just too ridiculous. The ghost climbing out of the window chasing him makes things even less scary and really ridiculous. A ghost that climbs out of a window just doesn't seem scary, its ridiculous. Furthermore, it was raining, hence the scary atmosphere was drained off by the rain. A horror movie would not be scary anymore if it was raining. One particular reason why I find this movie more effective than Ringu is because most of the scariest scenes take place at night, in a very dark atmosphere(the best scene being the blanket scene).However, the scary scenes in ringu are shown during the day, hence there is a lack of this dark, nighttime atmosphere. I thought the blanket scene was far better than the one in A tale of two sisters. This movie is awesome. Though terror and fear are not distributed evenly throughout the entire movie for me. This movie has an extremely clear and stable storyline with some twists here and there. This movie has got many terrifying scenes. The last few scenes towards the end of the movie are not very scary but extremely entertaining. I found this movie to be more effective than ringu. Other than that, this movie is still scary, terrifying and electrifying and highly recommended. Score: 9.1/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's all in the Photograph</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Shutter' starts off with a group of friends celebrating graduation. Young photographer Tun (Ananda Everingham) and his pretty girlfriend Jane (Natthaweeranuch Thongmee) have been drinking and while driving their way home, they accidentally run over a young woman (Achita Sikamana) who seemed to have appeared out of nowhere. Shocked and terrified, they flee the crime scene and from then on are haunted by guilt except that guilt isn't the only one haunting them. Now one may be expecting a more sophisticated and refined Thai version of 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' but comparing 'Shutter' to trash like that goes beyond mere insult. Now there are plenty of jump moments that may give the impression that it's your typical East Asian horror movie but just hang on and let the layers of the story slowly unravel for there is far more depth than what it initially appeared to be. Nothing is as it appeared to be. The writing is clever and Pisanthanakun and Wongpoom's direction is brilliant. The camera-work, light effects, cinematography, special effects and score are first rate. The scare 'jumps' may have been a tad overdone and perhaps toning it down a little would have helped. The intense atmosphere is well maintained. Everingham and Thongmee are great and Sikamana is impressive in a small role. Overall, 'Shutter' is an cleverly layered film and those looking for something more than mere momentary fright ought to see this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good Thai horror movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I picked up this movie because I like Asian horror movies, and this one turned out to be quite a surprisingly nice one. Lots of interesting horror movies make it out of Asia, but they rarely get the publicity in Western countries that would do them justice.The story of "Shutter" is exciting and captivating. You will get wrapped up in the story and the suspense. The movie will grasp you firmly and not let you go before the credits start scrolling over the screen.I don't find Asian ghosts to be scary, but my wife (whom is Asian) does, and she was terrified with this movie.The story is not predictable and it have some really nice twists to throw you entirely off the hook. The public restroom scene was amazing, builds up lots of suspense and then leaves you laughing hard. I love that scene, it was so funny.If you are to watch an Asian horror movie, your money will not be wasted if you pick this one. It is thrilling from start till end. And it is one of those movies that you will pick up at a later point and watch it again.Now the bad thing about Asian horror movies is that Hollywood have some sick compulsive urge to "Americanize" them into remakes that usually end up being an insult to the official Asian version. "Shutter" spawned an American remake also, which wasn't overly impressive. Not that it should be held against the Asian versions, but it is just a shame that Hollywood need to milk Asian horror for all their worth in pointless American versions.A word of advice, if you ever find yourself standing with an Asian version of a horror movie and an American remake of the Asian movie, always go for the Asian one!But back to "Shutter"... The movie have good characters, and the actors perform well. The dialogue is good and the scenery is great. There is a good, gloomy feel to the entire movie. It always keeps you on the edge of the seat, begging for more - and the movie will deliver!</fullReview>

I'm not usually a fan of Asian or Eastern films because they are slower paced than what I am used to but wow, this was very good. The pace of it didn't bother me in the least. It kept my attention the whole movie, my attention span has definitely been destroyed by years of American television. I really loved the twist and story. Also I don't like watching subtitles. I pretty much hate it. I feel like subtitles take too much of my attention away from the film itself but this movie was not ruined by the fact that I had to read subtitles. To me that's saying a lot!

		<fullReview>Clearly a happy couple that has a traumatic accident one evening can't remain happy afterwords. But as Jane and Tun try to continue on with their lives, the lingering thoughts of that night begin to haunt them. Tun is played by the very sexy Ananda Everingham. He is the good looking hero that seems as mystified after the accident as his girlfriend Jane does. But while he is more willing to push aside his fear and try to ignore the photos that have evidence of a haunting spirit, Jane is not. Jane, played by Natthaweeranuch Thongmee, is wanting to face the truth head on no matter what the outcome. In doing so, she may find out more than she wants to know. While this movie seems predictable as many haunting movies are, there are still some surprises in store for the watchers. This movie has been compared to Ringu, but other than a vindictive spirit of a woman wronged, there is no comparison. Shutter can stand on it's own as a good thriller. And Ananda Everingham stands out as a leading man to watch. He not only seems very natural in front of the camera, but his boyish good looks won't hurt his career at all! (Wink) I enjoyed this movie and have added it to my Asian Horror collection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>INTRODUCTION I am a newbie when it comes to Asian cinema, but with the release of such re-make films like "The Ring" and "The Grudge," i seemed to fall in the middle of hundreds of folk, all saying "its not as good as the original!" So at these comments i set to find out for myself. Upon watching these movies i did genuinely get a chill factor (unlike there over-acted American counterparts!) which is what lead me onto this movie.Shutter is one those films that you have to watch alone for the full effect, turn out the lights, turn up the volume and have the toilet paper on stand by! SYNOPSIS OF THE FIRST 20 MINS The story tells of a young photographer and his graduating girlfriend, upon their drive home after a drunken party, they accidentally plough over a young girl, scared, shaken and inebriated they submissively decide to drive away from the scene. The following day is the girls graduation, the young photographer is taking photos of the occaision. When he develops them, all the pictures of his partner have a shine on them, almost a lens flare, but more disturbingly, on the picture of the whole year, there is a ghostly image to the left of his partner, is it the face of the girl they hit?THE REVIEW When watching his film, you notice there are some ideas that may be considered "borrowed" from other films, ie The blurred pictures of individuals (the ring) the use of modern technology for apparitions to show themselves (also, the ring) the ghostly image of a plain girl stalking the main characters (er, and again, the ring and also the grudge)From a directorial point of view, this film is wonderfully made, with fantastic use of the red light exposure room, and also the use of genuine "spirit photos" that most of us may have seen in our day-to-day lives, it connects to the viewer on a personal level and seems to feed on a genuine chill you may have received once in your life.For anyone watching this film, I would advise to keep watching, just when you think the film is over, there is one more almighty twist that you will have to watch yourself to find out. If your one of those people who just isn't interested in reading subtitles, then let this be the first one you dedicate yourself to. You will find the whole experience much scarier, as your eyes are concentrating on the subs, you don't see anything coming, cue the toilet paper!SUMMARY Its incredibly depressing to learn that the Americans are to be doing a westernised version of this film, i would guarantee (following the ring and the grudge) that this film is destined for the bargain bucket.By the end of this film, your heart should be racing, also, you will be promising yourself to never have another photograph taken. Filled with jumps and twists that will turn you cold, Shutter delivers on a massive level and is definitely not for sissies. Rent or Buy, shutter is available now.Mike Gibson - jungleboyuk@hotmail.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very creepy Thai horror film with an excellent twist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shutter is an effectively chilling and well-made ghost story and has an ending I never would have seen coming. Although it isn't entirely original I can forgive that because the story is interesting, the scares are genuinely scary and it moves at a smooth pace. This isn't a film with non-stop scares, there are bits in between that help develop the story and characters slowly but convincingly.Shutter starts off with Tun, a photographer, and his girlfriend Jane hitting a women while driving (drunk) home. After this mysterious shadows and ghostly images start appearing in Tun's photos. As Tun and Jane start to unravel the mystery behind the images they uncover a part of Tun's past he never wanted to remember and he soon learns that you "cannot escape your past." This film is littered with many different types of scares ranging from your fairly common "boo" scares, psychological horror and your slow build ups. These scares all worked for me and left me unsettled and creeped out to the max. The acting was excellent, the score was chilling and both directors did an excellent job considering it was their first film. If your into Asian horror and ghost stories I highly recommend this engaging and frightening film.4?/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now, that is a scary horror movie!It's all about the sense of dread and death that permeates the whole picture. Shutter surely hadn't a big budget, nor it relied on special effects or CGI to get its point across. Shutter is the typical case of an outstanding picture done old fashioned way that brings memories of some classics like The Exorcist, The Changelling and Ringu, where the plot actually matters. Tun is a thirty-something photographer in Bankgok, a nice, handsome average Joe who lives the good life with his girlfriend and is always hanging out with his school buddies.Things take a change for the worse when Tun and girlfriend, back home after a party night with the buddies, run over a mysterious girl passing by. Tun doesn't stop to help, afraid of the consequences.Suddenly after the incident, the photos he snaps(he is a professional photographer) turn out to reveal a weird face of someone who seems like a girl. Of course, things escalate and Shutter becomes a roller-coaster ride of frights where not everything is what it seems. Shutter is wonderfully photographed and its blueish visuals are strikingly atmospheric.The movie builds momentum and delivers a scary ride by its third act. The revelation regarding the causes of the ghost girl appearing on the snapshots and tormenting Tun and the buddies surprised me, it was a nicely-done twist!The script was tightly written and takes its time to explain and develop the plot, without rushing into the scary parts. The thing about Shutter is that it's as scary and delicious as hear and tell ghosts stories at the night around the fire.I strongly recommend it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good scare AND a good laugh! - SPOILERS!-</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I won't repeat what everybody else has already said here: OK, yes, cliché after cliché but still a good scare.What I just HAVE to write about is the bit with the toilet paper... Half-way through the film, I was already nice and scared, really tense and all that, expecting the ghost's next horrible appearance... And then somehow Tun finds himself in this nasty gas-station bathroom, sitting on the toilet, having a smoke... O-K... Just then he hears "someone" in the next stall, which everybody in the audience just KNOWS is the dead girl. And what does he do? Run for his life? Scream for help? NO! HE ASKS FOR TOILET PAPER! And the worse part: this creepy hand with long red nails comes out from underneath the division, and HANDS HIM THE ROLL!! :oD What a preposterous moment.The music and the general atmosphere indicates this is supposed to be a scary moment in the film, but I just burst into laughter. I couldn't help but picture the ghost going to the bathroom in the next stall...I mean, in every horror film there has to be a young girl getting attacked by either a lunatic or a supernatural entity while she showers, but this flick is the first I've ever seen with a GUY getting terrorised while he does #2. I hope it doesn't become a trend!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark frightening horror tale about a vengeful spirit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shutter is a Thai film about a couple (Tun and Jane) who are spooked out after being the culprits in a hit and run case, but are then haunted by what they believe is the spirit of the woman they knocked down. As ever, things aren't all that they seem and the past catches up with them. Add in Tun's photography work and some drunk friends, and you get a story that twists and turns.This film comes after what appears to be a hiatus in the line of good Asian horror movies. To no surprise it takes on standard clichés of the genre: vengeful spirit is of a girl with long hair, school/college/academic settings etc. However, what it may lack in originality it makes up in other ways. The story is well done, and changes direction at points so keeping the attention of the audience. Important to watch to the end, so that it all makes sense and pull together.The direction is great, whilst the scares are definitely there in abundance and will catch out even the hardened. Add in some well used music, and you have a very well made horror movie.This film breathes some life into the genre, just when many of us thought that it was being flogged to death. A very good film for horror buffs. Won't let you down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now this is what I call horror!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I picked up Shutter in our local video rental shop because I've always been fascinated by "ghost photos" and thought it might be an interesting film to watch. I presumed it would just be similar to films in the mold of Ringu and Ju-On where the so-called "ghosts" were more laughable than scary. I'm glad I was wrong.For quite a long time I've been looking for a film that would really scare me. I've been a fanatic of the horror genre since I was a kid and I've seen only a handful of films that managed to genuinely put the scare into me. I'm happy to say Shutter did just that.This film had a good premise, a few splashes of humor here and there, a good number of scenes that would make you jump and give you goosebumps and a great twist of an ending to boot.While this may be considered "mainstream" horror by some people, Shutter definitely ranks up there among the best horror films that have come out in quite some time.I'm giving this ****/**** stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>~Spoiler~ With a new Asian horror flick being released on US shores every Tuesday, I've become very selective about the ones I choose to see. Shutter has such a legacy that I could not ignore it. People all over talk about this movie. Could this be in the same league as Ju-on/Ringu et al? It's certainly in the same mold. Shutter falls into the same trappings as the aforementioned films, but it's definitely not a bad thing. The vengeful ghost with the long, black hair makes for one creepy viewing experience. This particular ghost is seeking retribution for a hit-and-run accident. Or does it go deeper than that? The young photographer who is being haunted keeps seeing the girl in the photos he takes. While his friends are dying around him, can he make amends to the spirit? Or is there another secret so dark it's unforgivable? There are many moments in the film designed to make you jump out of your skin. They work too. So, even if Shutter is a bit derivative of its predecessors, it's still recommended viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great J-horror with some good scares.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just finished watching Shutter last night and I was very pleased with what I saw. I haven't jumped from a horror movie in a while, and this movie made me jump three times, a first.First off, Shutter is about a vengeful spirit, much to the likes of The Ju-On series(i remember watching it and saying to myself "wow, this is a lot like Ju-On" after a subtitle had the word "grudge" in it). In this movie, Tun(the lead character) is riding with his girlfriend when they hit a girl. He quickly tells his girlfriend to speed away, and she does. From that point on, Tun begins to see "spirits" in his pictures and must find out how to stop the spirit before something happens to him or his loved ones.Everything about this movie impressed me. The evil girl is very creepy and shows up at exactly the right time. Even though this movie was predictable at times, it still managed to scare me and keep me on the edge of my seat. The music(or lack thereof, in some scenes) creates a creepy atmosphere and gives the viewer a sense of dread and foreboding.Overall, for anyone who likes the traditional, J-horror, vengeful spirit flicks, this is a definite recommendations. I even recommend this movie to casual horror fans as it is surprisingly scary and has an outstanding ending(no spoilers here).10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love horror films. I love Asian films. I remember watching Halloween and Friday the 13th when I was about four years old. It's very difficult to find a horror film that satisfy me a hundred percent. I have just seen it all and nothing surprise me anymore. SHUTTER DID! Finally a flick that satisfy a hardcore horror fan. Shutter follows the nowadays overused Asian horror theme. A female ghost crawling on the floors. Long hair, pale face. Shutter does it differently though. Just when you think what's gonna happen the directors choose to go another direction, still following the same pattern, just not the timing. The style of the film is different too. It's dark. It's supernatural but still realistic enough. The lead characters doesn't pretend to know what's happening. They have no idea. Which is cool 'cause the ghost has actually something to do with one of the lead characters. It's a personal haunting. A personal vendetta. The acting is great. The direction, superb. The script is well written and clever. The photography, lightning and special effects, outstanding. Ju-On and Ringu are good horror films. Shutter is ten times better. DON'T MISS IT. For the name of God, don't miss it! An American remake is on the way. Let's hope Hollywood doesn't take credit for this film with a bad remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is exceptionally scary. Despite the fact that the story is a bit clichéd, it provides audiences with an interesting plot.The movie began with a couple who accidentally hit somebody when they were driving home from a wedding party. A day later they tried to find out what happened to that person. Even so, they were not able to find out whether the victim was alive or dead.At the same time, both of them kept seeing something odd in the photographs(the couple are photographers). Also many spooky incidents happened to the couple since the accident. This led the female protoganist to find out what was going on with them and why there were so many peculiar things in the pictures they had taken.I will not tell you any more since I do not want to spoil the fun, excitement and spookiness that you will enjoy from watching this film.Check your photos. Maybe you will see something different each time.</fullReview>

The ghost kills the peoples for a clear reason 'revenge',Unlike the Japanese horror movies(Ring,one missing call or The Grudge),they kill a hell lot of innocence for no reasonable reason. Some movies scare you with horrible costume,screen cut or makeup,this movie give you a bonus of a rememberable horror tale. Scare you every 3~5 minutes, no boring inside, do not hesitate to rent or buy the DVD if you can. Finally, seeing this movie alone is not a good idea,bring the one you sick of with you and have a good nightmare.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yeat another creepy Asian horror ghost story... and a good one!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before seeing this, I had doubts. Serious doubts. It's not humanly possible to squeeze anything fresh from this formula, right? Since "6th sense" (1998) we've seen a dozen variations of the same stuff: ghost(s) give some poor guy a puzzle and if he doesn't solve it in time, the ghosts will kill him, or something like that. And the ending is always a twist the lead character (and the viewer) didn't expect. The Hollywood versions have been going downhill: "Ring" =&gt; "Grudge" =&gt; "Ring 2","Dark Water", and lately also the (original) Asians have been running out of good ideas - for example "One missed call": few good ideas, but it just tries too hard. But it's only natural. You can milk the same cow only so much. BUT, here we have "The Shutter"... Without spoiling too much, I'll just say 3 things: 1) See it. It's among the best (and creepiest) 3 movies of this genre I've ever seen. 2) "Shutter" is to Asian ghost movies what "Scream" was to splatters. It makes fun at the clichés (and also a few American horror movies...), but without losing its grip. This ain't a parody. 3) The amount of story there usually is in these movies, is covered in the first half hour. But after that... it just keeps on building up! In terms of storytelling this is a masterpiece. Do yourself a favor. See it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>standard Asia horror flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once you've seen a few Asian horror films you begin to notice patterns emerging, most galling is that often the main horror element is a placid-looking girl in a white dress with long straight black hair, who lost her life in some unjust way but has come back to haunt either randoms or somehow-related peoples.The Ring, The Grudge, Tale of Two Sisters, a few more I've now forgotten about, and add Shutter to this list too.I was still happy to go with it if the pic was well-made, with some good scares and uneasy moments, but to be honest the scares are very standard predictable jump fare: increase in tense music -&gt; protagonist looking uneasy -&gt; loud bang accompanying a brief flash of zombiefied Asian girl (in a white dress).The narrative jumps about quite randomly in ways that only make sense at the end of the film, and it's the end which saves this from being a poor experience. It's not quite on the high-end dread level as the climax of an otherwise quite dull Ringu (6/10) but it's spooky enough to be satisfying. On the other hand the ending reveal also made me chuckle a little, so not exactly scary.The two main female actors are also very average, with the male character being an utterly pathetic figure: it's not quite clear how he was written, but I just wanted to punch him in the face.Generally there's nothing memorable on offer here, tho' there could've been: the idea of polaroids showing us apparitions is a potentially fantastic concept, covered effectively by the Fatal Frame (Project Zero) series of games on the Playstation 2 console, which was very likely the source of inspiration for Shutter (tho' the game I believe used Camera Obscura). Speaking of Fatal Frame, a film was made last year, but seems very obscure: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3684484/ Back to Shutter: to be fair there is one nice scene which stands out: the photo-flip series showing the apparition moving towards something. Again it could've been so much more: if you've seen Paranormal Activity 4 and always thought they didn't maximise the potential of those X-Box Kinect lighting scenes, then you'll be thinking similar here.Regarding the language: as ever, you should watch a film with its original audio as long as subs are available. The beginning is almost impossible to keep up with the quick-fire banter, but shortly afterwards it's fine. Thai sometimes has Korean-ish inflections, but mostly reminds you (if you, like me, have never heard Thai before) of Vietnamese.Worth a watch if you're addicted to typical Asian horror and are interested in how Thailand does it.Not worth your time if you're a horror fan looking for unique scares or original story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film does not reinvent the wheel, but if you are a film buff you know this does not necessarily need to happen in order to deliver an effective film. While Shutter uses some techniques we have often seen in other horror films (such as jump scenes etc) directors Pisanthanakun and Wongpoom manage to do it well enough to deliver some creepy scenes that will leave you glancing around your house after the film is over.The film starts out like a Thai version of I Know What You Did Last Summer with the films progressing to something more sinister. A young photographer named Thun and his girlfriend Jane run over a woman in the street but keep going. After that, Jane and Thun discover sinister images in the photographs that they take. They begin to investigate the phenomena of spirit photography only to discover that they are not alone when they think they are.This film is in subtitles but if you can get past that you will be discovering an excellent foreign horror film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This horror movie really made my pulse go up - and that is a true mark of a good horror flick, of course! The ending was very good - one of the most surprising, original, and scary endings I have ever seen in a horror movie! So far so good.Still, as with almost all non-American and non-English movies, it felt just A LITTLE amateurish... It is not only a question of the budget - although this one was obviously low-budget as well. But there is something with the timing, the pacing, the acting, the make-up, the setting, and so on - that is not fully as perfect and professional as in most contemporary American and English movies. But I believe the Asians are learning..! :-) Despite from these short-comings, I enjoy watching movies from foreign - I mean far-away and non-Western - countries, now and then. Because they give you an insight into another culture, religion, way of life... I.e.: you become a little more educated at the same time as you are enjoying yourself..! :-)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not a Chinese or Japanese horror film, but it is Thai, so why was I even surprised that I yet again watched yet another dead Asian girl with long hair crawling around and spooking the main characters? Plot-wise, the Asian horror genre seems to be stuck in a rut. The films are either about a dead girl with long hair or a dead woman with long hair, not much else. Guys, it's time to come up with something new! However, I don't know why, but again they got away with it. In spite of the fact that this idea has been milked dry (and then some), I found this film fun. It wasn't dull, the acting was solid, and there were some well-devised scenes. I particularly liked the idea of the main male protagonist carrying the dead girl on his back, especially the last scene - in the lunatic asylum ? is clever. But will someone explain to me how this guy could have survived not one but TWO falls off a building? You've got to give Asian horror films credit. They take a cliché idea and make it work yet again. This is in stark contrast to US horror films which tend to be incredibly dull when they deal with overused themes, like ghosts and vampires.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Effective horror, but not the perfect 10 everyone suggests.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Point blank, Shutter is worth any horror-fan's time. It's a taut, suspenseful and at times harrowing film that feels fresh and interesting throughout. Still, it had some major problems for me. I really liked the initial plot setup, playing on the 'ghost-photo' phenomenon, but feel that it focuses too much on the one instance of it that's plaguing main character Tun.This wouldn't necessarily be a problem, but see, Tun and his mates actually deserve to get messed up by vengeful ghosts. I won't spoil the twist (and jeez, it's big, but I saw it coming quite early) but Tun and his friends are totally repellent, and if it wasn't for the unnerving nature of the key ghost (more on that later), I'd have had NO problem whatsoever, cheering her on Jason Voorhees style, in fact by the end, I was anyway. As a for instance, early on in the film, Tun and his kind, caring girlfriend (who's the only likable character in the film, ghost notwithstanding) hit someone by accident, probably killing them. On being asked, 'do you think she's okay?' Tun's response is 'DRIVE DRIVE DRIVE! RUN AWAY!'. I don't know if hit &amp; run is viewed differently in Thailand, but I doubt it, and this introduction hardly warms one to the guy. Add to this the fact that all through the film he continues to refuse to own up to his reprehensible actions (or lack of actions), and Tun is a whimpering, unpleasant jackass.Still, I think in a way, these Asian horror flicks all relate to things coming full circle karmically speaking. Bad man do bad, bad ghost appear, do bad to bad man, bad man gone seems to be the course of action, and this one is no different, and highly effective in it's execution. It maybe slightly generic in it's scare tactics, but it doesn't really matter in Shutter, as it has scares by the bucketload. It isn't disturbing in the same nihilistic way as Pulse, or as intelligent and restrained as Phone, but damn if Shutter doesn't compensate in make-up and volume of thrills. Not only is head-ghost Natre really really freaky looking, she scares the crap out of you on a regular basis. By the end of the movie I couldn't help but cheer her on, but damn is she one mad, freaky disturbing ghost-girl. Full marks to the make-up and direction departments.Regardless of it's inability to give you much of a lead to root for, Shutter is well made, believably acted and, most important for a horror movie, scarier than being on your own in the house when the power cuts off. With no torch. It's full of memorable shocks, it has an incredibly dark story, and effectively works in the 'haunted item' angle without overdoing it. It's just a shame that the characters are so repellent, as you really do find yourself cheering the ghost on, and I'm sure that's not what the director meant to happen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a movie that borrows from recent Asian horror movies (Ringu for example) and ends in relative predictability. I mean, there is a spirit there, what can it possibly do? Haunt haunt haunt! The start of the movie doesn't have any significance, since all the events thereafter have no connection to the initial accident. Or maybe I didn't get it.The atmosphere is OK, the language sounds to me as a cross between duck and cat, which maybe chips from the horror feeling, or maybe because there weren't many deaths and scary haunt scenes, I didn't quite get in the mood for this movie. I am all alone in the house, It's 3AM in the morning, pitch black, dead silence, and I am not scared after seeing this movie. Or maybe it's because I have seen so many movies these past few days and my standards are polluted. Funny thing, I recognized a girl in the movie. How bad can it get? I start knowing Thai actors.Anyway, if you are in the mood for an Asian horror flick, go to this one, although to me it felt like a cross between The Ring and Scream.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie seems to rely heavily on other Asian horror movies. Some things even seem like they are just copied from Ju-On or The Ring, like the car crash, and the way the ghouls look and move. Or maybe these are common occult/spirit elements from Asian culture that i'm oblivious to, i don't know. But anyway, there are enough new twists to make this movie worthwhile.I think the best thing about Shutter, when compared to Dark Water or Ju-On etc, is the story. While some movies kind of leave things up in the air, "Shutter" tells a complete and rounded story. The characters are interesting and believable and there are some original plot twists to keep it interesting right up until the end.All in all a good addition to the recent series of horror/mystery movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, i cannot believe that after reading 70% of the reviews for this film, not ONE PERSON criticises what is probably the dumbest ending to a potentially great film i've ever seen. I really couldn't believe that they (and everyone else who's commented on this movie - who i can only assume are all teenagers) thought this was a good idea, and a fitting way to end a really creepy film! I'm about to tell you the ending, so look away if you haven't seen it...So basically we are supposed to believe that this ghost has been riding around on the main character's shoulders for the duration of the movie? (But not the duration of his life since he royally screwed her over...why do ghosts wait years before taking revenge?)A GHOST RIDING ON A CHARACTER'S SHOULDERS WITHOUT HIM REALISING.Let that sink in for a minute and then tell me again that you give this movie 10 out of 10. He has neck pain throughout the film. Because she's sat on his shoulders. Wouldn't he have major cramp in his legs also? Wouldn't she keep banging into stuff when he walked around? Wouldn't his balance be f'ed? And why does she wait to reveal this to him right at the end using a photo when he can see her repeatedly throughout the rest of the movie? It's really quite brilliantly nonsensical, which is a real disappointment because other than that the film is REALLY RATHER GREAT.The direction, Foley work and acting are all very well executed, the action is creepy (if not in any way original), and it would have been a classic had it arrived before Ringu and Ju-on. And had the ending not been so bloody silly.If you're a 14-year-old girl then this may well be the best horror film you've ever seen; but if, like me, you are an adult...it really lets itself down. I'm giving it 8 because in spite of it's inane plotting i like it - and because i think others, who are less demanding than me, will love it. However, if you demand logic in your films BE WARNED.

I enjoyed it when they talked to the ghost picture editor and the other stuff relating to the camera aspect of the film this too becomes less relevant as the film progresses. Why, I don't know seeing as how the film is titled "Shutter". So the basic plot, couple are driving home after a bit of drinking and hanging with friends when they hit a person, guy and girl panic a bit, guy panics more and makes girl drive away from the scene. So is this the catalyst for the terror that is to come? Well let me say it would be rather simple, to simple even if that were all there is to it. Of course at this point the guy who seems to be a photographer ends up getting strange distortions in his photos to the point where one looks like a well defined ghost...well this sets things off as friends die and the haunting of the photographer get worse and worse as he and his girlfriend must try to find the cause of it all. Well he pretty much should know why he is being haunted while it really is the girl who makes the grim discoveries. Though I figured out what was going to be the cause of it all before she did...I think I prefer the vague Asian horror movies to these that spell it all out for you. Still it is somewhat interesting and the cast is good...and there is a rather humorous scene involving a bathroom spook.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK, but nothing too special</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Shutter" is a seemingly mediocre ghost film that really could've been much better.**SPOILERS**Following their wedding, newlyweds Tun, (Ananda Everingham) and Jane, (Natthaweeranuch Thongmee) accidentally run over a young woman on a road, and decide to just ignore the situation. Shortly thereafter, he notices that all of the pictures he takes for work are being returned with a series of strange smudges on them, which everyone attributes to a faulty camera part. Thinking otherwise, she goes investigating the matter and finds that he was involved with a group of friends in a tragic accident with Natre, (Achita Sikamana) who ended up mysteriously disappearing right before they got married, and who she believes is the source of the recent haunting activity. Discovering the truth about what happened, they race to stop the murderous ghost before it completes it's murderous quest.The Good News: There was some good stuff here when it really counted. One of the best parts is the fact that there's some really good ghost action in here, as is usual in these kinds of films. From the opening car crash, which occurs just out of nowhere after a conversation that's not even focused on the road, and before any warning, switches over to the impact, scoring nicely with a perfect jump. Another rather fun sequence, where a victim manages to start vomiting blood in front of the unsuspecting viewer in a gigantic studio is a big shock. The rest of the ghost action is just as good, from the bedroom resurrection that manages to be entirely creepy without anything happening, as the sheets are pulled back before the hands emerge from the foot of the bed to the ghost itself fully revealed sliding sinisterly up the bed before the jolting finish, as well as the sequence at the doctor's office where we finally understand the slow build-up of medical problems all along in a great shock, offer this one a big series of scenes that works so well. The main plus to the ghost scenes, though, is the fact that there's a lot of good stuff inside the photo-developing room, as there's three big scenes that occur there. The first one, where the photos being to come alive and reach out to him from within the pictures, is a fantastic effort that really gets it going early on, and a later scene where the photo does a fantastic trick to the viewer, despite being obvious, does work exceptionally well and manages to get a shock jump. The other big scene, and the highlight of the film, is the last sequence there, where the ghost attacks in-between a series of flashing camera affects that really get quite thrilling due to the extreme visuals during the sequence. There's also a quite chilling moment that works where a victim manages to walk through an abandoned building taking photographs of the wall, and the eventual realization that they're not alone is confirmed in the creepiest portion of the room, amidst a stack of hospital jars so it manages to work extremely well. The finale, where the ghost gets it's revenge with the photography trick coming back into play in a fantastic sense here with some great action to compliment it all. The last plus is the real fun time spent at the magazine, which is creepy and quite chilling. These here are the film's good parts.The Bad News: There was a couple of problems to this one that really manage to hold it down somewhat. One of the main ones is the fact that there's a couple of scenes that are supposed to be played off as being terrifying or scary but instead really don't in the slightest. The first one, where the victim receives a phone call from the woman he thinks is there with him in the apartment, revealing through the conversation to not be there, is such a telegraphed scare that it loses it's impact considerably by going for the suspected route all along, not throwing a twist into the proceedings to throw us off and it really hurts itself. Another is the encounter at the pharmacist window, which isn't scary at all but is played as it is. Not being able to accurately hear directions isn't a scary idea, it just makes him look like he has hearing problems. The other big one that really should've been one of the highlights but isn't is the flying-ghost-alongside-the-car sequence late in the film, which started off awesomely but instead is a missed opportunity with it's shortness. These here are incredibly frustrating and are a big part of what's wrong with the film. The other flaw to this one is the fact that this one has a big scene that is just utterly not impacting at all on the film, the meeting with the friend at the apartment building. This just drags on forever with no real point or scares to it, the fact that it mentions all the friends are dead at this point rather than seeing them play out is immensely frustrating, and it ends so anti-climatically with the suicide doesn't really do a whole lot either way. These here are what really lower the film overall.The Final Verdict: While not all that bad, there was some problems with this one that does manage to hold it down and it overall appears as decent. It's still good enough for those that enjoy the Asian ghost genre or interested in this one, while those that appear turned off by the flaws should heed caution.Rated R: Violence, Language and a Rape scene</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like the above poster I also couldn't believe how much this movie was hyped. Most scary movie ever and more frightening than the Ring. Etc... I was so scared that I wasn't sure if I had the guts to watch it.Can we say predictable? I had the end of the movie figured about 30 mins in and even joked about it.With the exception of a few creepy moments, this movie is quite tame. I don't know how anyone could see some of the best Asian horror out there and claim that this is the best.Well I think it's worth just to watch, I think it would be dead last on my list of scary movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A restless spirit is haunting a photographer whose hiding a secret which might hold the answer as to why this female ghost will not leave him be.Tun(Ananda Everingham)is out celebrating his wild school chum, Tonn's(Unnop Chanpaibool) pre-marriage festivities, with girl friend Jane(Natthaweeranuch Thongmee)by his side. The other two male friends also there, along with Tonn(..who would return distraught to Tun's apartment, looking for specific pictures)are later found dead, supposedly leaping from balconies committing suicide. Tun and Jane find mysterious images of a young woman, with flashes of white across various photos taken at a graduation party. As they pursue the truth behind the images, Tun is awakened to the fact that this restless spirit is an old flame from school, an often ridiculed(..particularly by Tun's friends, the very ones who would mysteriously commit suicide)quietly aloof girl named Natre(Achita Sikamana). Natre and Tun begin a secret relationship with her falling in love with him. Ashamed of the relationship and how it would effect the friendships with his male friends..and reputation..Tun calls it off with Natre with tragic consequences that ensue. But, Jane will uncover, thanks to Natre's assistance, dark truths regarding Tun and a certain event he's buried since his youth.Derivative Thai ghost film is given stylish treatment thanks to the directors, but the material is way too familiar and I couldn't help but say to myself, "Been there, done that," as the film continues. Nothing ever quite feels fresh and I'm afraid that the Asian horror market has flooded us with so many films regarding ghosts, with issues(..or a bone to pick with someone who wronged them, leading to a death leaving unresolved matters needed tending to), that most of them fail to surprise or shock. Even the main twist, which reveals a horrifying occurrence which happens to Natre, as the man she loves does nothing to help her(..even making things worse with certain actions of his own), doesn't really impact as it should. I can't really say the leads aren't good, because I found the performances effective, but these characters have been in similar Asian horror films before(..talented artists, reporters, photographers, actors, directors)suffering from similar situations regarding restless spirits returning from beyond seeking retribution for what ultimately ended their life. So, in other words, I thought the film looked good(..solid production values and nice camera-work, with great use of Tun's red room which he often used for printing photos..or blowing up negatives..which reveal eerie images),and the cast performed well, but the material itself didn't blow me away. I will say that the creepiest aspect to me wasn't the corpse of Natre making her appearances here and there, but the ghost images on photos showing spirits looking on at their loved ones.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well, yeah, hm, okay</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Shutter" is Asian cinema as you would expect it. There's a ghost in it. One with long black hair and a white face. One that comes crawling out of watery vessels and pops up in your bed or on your windshield. A ghost that wants vengeance for something that has been done to her. Have you heard that before? I know I have.Still "Shutter" is one of the more successful Asian horror movies. The reason for that is its fast pacing. This movie just isn't as slow as so many other Asian flicks are. There are still some annoying plot holes and the whole story isn't earthshattering, either. Most of the scares are cheap and obvious, but it's still an entertaining little ghost movie with a great score.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The most powerful forces known to man are not nuclear weapons,nor natural disasters .But the thoughts and ideas of the mind.The best thing and probably the only thing this film is going to bring to you is what i call 'the negative effect of fear'on your mind.And the irony of fearful thoughts and ideas is something cannot be handled or controlled by common sense or even physical sense.For example many of us are afraid for quite irrational things ,like dark or spiders.As fear is based on something that you think may happen in the future,it's a projection of the mind.And it has strong physically and psychological effects on us.In religions fear is always considered as a form of torment and suffering.Ask yourself a question ,would you like to be discriminated by your colleagues? Be bullied at school ?or be wrongly accused by authority? period .with maybe controlled risks</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why is this rated so highly?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm rating this 1 just to even the score up. This film is nothing but a cash-in on the Ju-on/Grudge films, and the worst I've seen in a long time. The direction and timing is awful, the acting is bad, and none of the intended scares have any effect at all - well at least not to me. With the lack of fear-factor it's really nothing more than a boring drama about a couple unearthing some of the less finer moments of their past, to terrible, but very boring, consequences. It has the overall effect of a made for TV film. It's basically just a Dawson's Creek special in Japan with added ghosts. This film has been a waste of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't believe the hype!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I should explain that as far as this trend goes for ripping off Asian horror movies, this Shutter is a head above The Grudge, and Dark Water, while still not achieving the same amount of atmospheric creepiness that The Ring establishes.Still though movies, like life, don't exist in a vacuum and are therefore up for comparison to other suspense/thriller/horror movies. Honestly, I'm not writing a lengthy synopsis here and will say that this movie attempts to rely on music induced "startle" scares rather than atmosphere and the "ghost" itself really isn't that remarkable. The plot is pretty basic and predictable and isn't anything to write home about either. While there are a few suspenseful scenes that border on creatively scary, most of the movie is pretty vanilla. If you enjoyed The Grudge and it's ilk then you might enjoy this.Grade: C-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an obsessive horror love story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i have been watching horror movies for quite some time now and i m not easily impressed and i have to admit i was not impressed by this one. it reminded me of a character like Sadako in love and the fact that she was so present in the film made it not scary at all. Sure there was a plot twist...only one though! and if you were sane enough to watch this film carefully (even though it may be a mind-numbing experience) you would guess the story of the ghost...To be honest the lead actor is too preppy to play in a horror film. Unfortunately thats the way it goes for actors who have played in series like Dawson's Creek...nonetheless thumbs up for originality - it was the first bitch fight i have ever seen between a girl and a ghost! I would only recommend this film if you are too bored and just want to fall asleep...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i have seen many Japanese horrorfilms and i have to say that some of them are really interesting but they are all pretty much the same. this one is no exception. the ghost is a black haired girl, that scares it's victims by doing nothing else than walk and look dead.. the difference is just the motive for the haunting. the rest is the same as every time: black haired girl, strange things happening with some media (photos), creepy acting. while watching this flick i constantly found myself asking why i was wasting my time watching stuff that someone else has done so much better before. some scenes where quite nice though, i'll give it 3 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is it me or are all Asian horror movies the same?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know, but the movie was just too similar to other movies I've seen. The Ring, The Eye, Dark Water, they're all the same to me. Don't get me wrong, it's beautifully made, lovely camera work, great graphics, but that story is just too.. too common. In the end, it's the score that makes the suspense, you know: the screams, rumbles. The characters in the movie are also not reacting very naturally, moving very slowly, surprised by anything they see. I know some people that love this kind of film, and if you do, being a well made movie, I guess it doesn't hurt to watch it. But if you've seen the movie I've mentioned above and didn't like them, then I'd suggest you don't bother.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of my co-workers recommended this one, implying that it was one of the most frightening movies she ever watched. I checked it out together with my girlfriend and we gave up after 50 minutes or so.Yesterday, I had a long talk with my co-worker (we're still friends!).This movie is as original as the latest film starring Steven Seagal. It brings absolutely nothing original to the table. The spooky parts have been done thousand of times before.The biggest fault however is the painfully slow pace of this movie. The periods between the scares are completely wasted with meaningless dialog and a lot of.. nothing..1 of 10 Molotov cocktails</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I absolutely positively can't believe my fellow IMDb reviewers. All the praise about how "original" this movie is, it's like they've never seen "Ring" or the million of imitations that's come out in the 10 years since that movie. And some of them claim to be horror movie buffs! I think not! "Shutter" is okay. Average, I'd say. I give it 5 out of 10, but there's just no way it's original and great and "the most frightening thing I've ever seen" as one reviewer said. Puh-leeeze, people. This one is plain. It's predictable.I swear, if I see another ghost movie where the hero traces the past of the ghost in order to find out why she's so mad and after them, I'm going to scream."Original"? Give me a break. You people need to get out more. Or at least stop calling yourselves "horror movie fans".</fullReview>
