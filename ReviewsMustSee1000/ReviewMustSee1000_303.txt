		<shortDescription>Another reason that the summer of '99 is the Season of Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I laughed so hard I spit out half the bucket-o-pop I was drinking, and finally had to stop sipping from its fine nectar, because so many times I was hooting and bending over in joy.There are some slower moments to let you catch your breath and allow for moments of sincerity, but only for a minute. The scenes in the previews (the ones you think will ruin the movie for you) are expounded on ten-fold, so there are plenty of surprises.During the movie I kept saying, "This is me and my friends when we were in high school!" They were almost the same conversations about life, sex and girls; just not as frequently, but it's only a two-hour film. Any guy will appreciate American Pie full tilt, and girls will realize just what hoops guys jump through in order to get their attention, let alone in their pants.What added to American Pie is that I liked every character, because the filmmakers didn't feel the urge to give us prototypical teen characters. Their personalities are distinctive, and their situations are all different, which leads to a hilarious finale where we see just how their pact plays out on prom night.As I mentioned before, there are genuine moments on the screen where the guys and gals have revelations of sincerity. It adds a needed depth to a film like this, where it's not just raw, raunchy comedy, but important to the lives of the characters who know more than sex is at stake. Which is another reason to like Pie, there are several slices, and sexual conquest is only one of them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has got to be the best teen sex flick. Not only is it realistic so teenagers can relate to some of the situations ,its also hilarious ,so your guaranteed to laugh your head off.I do every time I watch it.I would recommend this movie to any person that enjoyed Fast Times at Ridgemont High which was also a great movie. Not only did I love the storyline and plot but the actors fit the characters so well, they made them all seem so realistic.Go see this movie if you haven't and also rent the sequel while your at it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The director and the writer, Paul Weitz and Adam Herz respectively, will do anything for a laugh -- that's good, as it turns out, because this movie has a great many laughs in it. There's not much of that restricting, suffocating "logic" stuff around, but "American Pie" is immensely enjoyable. I mean, almost none of the things that happen in this film would ever, ever come to pass in real life, but it doesn't matter.For starters, the characters aren't all one-dimensional. Thankfully, they're two-dimensional, so right away it has an edge on 60-70% of all the movies ever made.Moreover, it's heart is in the right place. Most high school movies these days are all about cruelty and malice, especially towards (and among) the women. Not the case here. This is the first conventional high school movie I've ever seen that made me smile so much (I say conventional because "Rushmore" still trumps every one of them).Furthermore, it's very funny. I wouldn't dare give away any of the really great gags (we've all seen the trailer -- that's not the one I mean), but I'll say this: Weitz and Herz are extraordinarily skilled in audience manipulation, which is to say that they know how and when to spring unexpected surprises upon us. They also know how to use foul language for punch, rather than punctuation.The soundtrack is another positive. It's all about joy and high energy -- even music from Third Eye Blind and Barenaked Ladies that suffers from radio overplay fits the mood appropriately.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>American Pie has all the ingredients of a good movie. First, the plot deals with young people in search of their first sexual experience. What could be more basic to the human condition? Second, although obviously fiction, the film has a feeling of reality capturing the awkwardness and anxiety of young people at this point in their lives. Third, it is well written and not always predictable as each young man employs his own strategy, and of course, in the real world things do not always go as planned. Fourth, the cast consists of very talented young actors playing characters which may remind the audience of people they may have known. Fifth, the film has its poignant moments. The final ingredient is this movie is hilarious. The film has one liners, sight gags, and situations that very funny. The audience, which ranged from teenagers to middle age, laughed almost constantly and out loud. CAUTION: This film is rated "R" for sexual situations and the use of alcohol by young people. If you are easily offended or sexual humor makes you uncomfortable, stay away. However, if you are not in the aforementioned, you may enjoy it. Three stars!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say that the most fun I had at the movies this summer was when I saw American Pie, the funniest picture I've seen since last summer's There's Something About Mary. This movie has taken the classic teenage boy film (Porky's, Revenge of the Nerds) and spruced it up for the 90's. It is hilarious from start to finish. If you like physical comedy, gross out comedy, sexual comedy, American Pie has it all. A great ensemble cast of likeable young actors makes this a joy to watch. I think this year's breakout star has to be Chris Klein. He was phenomenal in Election and he is even better here as a jock who tries to soften his image to score before prom. I have a feeling Klein is going to be Hollywood's next big thing and I hope he has a chance to flex his acting muscles in some different movies (I can definitely see this guy in an action film).Also very good is Jason Biggs who plays the sympathetic Jim character, the guy who is least likely to lose his virginity. His antics are very funny to follow and he gets the lion share of the laughs. Finally a huge ovation for Eugene Levy, who gets major laughs as the Jim's dad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My cup of tea. Not everybody's - but certainly mine.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had the good fortune to see a sneak preview of this film in England, a couple of weeks before release - and I was very impressed indeed. Hurrah - a comedy that is laugh-out-loud funny, enough to make you cringe at the embarrassing bits (of which there are many), and smile at the sentiment, which isn't corny in the slightest. This coming-of-age tale of four boys who make a pact to become men by losing their virginity by prom night is the perfect movie to go the cinema with your buddies to see, but probably not with your family. Having said that, I saw a family (son, mother, father and grandmother) coming out of the cinema, and they had a great time. The grandmother couldn't stop laughing, and saying how true it all was. Which is interesting, if a little embarrassing.Part of the success of this movie is due to the fact that we've all had to contemplate how we feel about sex, and losing your virginity is something which (no matter how fraught with peril it is) bonds us all because it is a very frightening experience. It's also a topic which has so much comic potential, and I'm glad that cast and crew don't throw any of the opportunities away. Here's the thing: if you're going to make a movie that is probably going to offend a few people no matter what you do, and is a very near-the-knuckle affair, why stop at only half-gags? Go the whole hog, push the boat out, thrust it in their faces. And that's what "American Pie" does.The performances are all great, if a little clichéd (are all you Americans really either:a) jocksb) geeksc) sweet, loveable square-jawed heroes/long haired, intelligent heroines? ...gosh, I hope so, that would be so funny for us Brits to watch). There is yet another high school prom (jealousy sets in once more - see "Never Been Kissed"), which causes much consternation for all concerned. There are marvellous scenes between concerned father and embarrassed child, quite the highlight of the movie. I'll be interested to see how the careers of all of the stars fare after this film. I wish them all well, but I find it hard to see them all thriving outside a high-school environment (which is good, because it indicates that they all play their roles with a great deal of endearing believability).It'll certainly give you something to talk about with your mates, and it'll make you think about things, too. It'll make you check what's in your beer, it'll make you think about apple pie, and it'll make you think more about your relationships. All of which is good stuff. The soundtrack is good (although doesn't contain any Don McLean), the lighting is also very good in places, the direction adequate, the editing fine, the . But at the end of the day, this is the kid's movie, and they make an excellent job of an excellent script and situation, so fair play to them. This movie deserves to succeed, and I hope it receives a good welcome from us Brits, who should enjoy it a lot. (Incidentally, this film got a fifteen rating, which I think is about right for it - eighteen would be too prohibitive (after all, isn't this film aimed at people aged fifteen?)). Take a piece of advice, though - if you are embarrassed easily, don't watch it with members of your family. But do watch it.</fullReview>

I do remember owing $20 in late fees to blockbuster video for keeping it so long after it was due back. It was worth it! This has classic written all over it, I think it's safe to say that anyone that was involved with this movie has a great career now because of it. American pie has an absolute all star cast led by the Great Jason biggs Anyone who enjoys comedy, teen comedy must see this movie! honestly you need to watch more movies if you haven't sen this one!!!10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>crude but amusing sex comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are a person easily offended by a film dedicated primarily to the glory of teen sex, you may well view "American Pie" as yet another in a long line of cinematic harbingers of the collapse of western civilization. If, however, you remember adolescence as essentially a period of unending coitus interruptus, you may well find yourself engrossed by this amusing, though admittedly crude, series of sexual and scatalogical gags woven around a plot involving the desperate attempts of a quartet of last semester seniors to lose their virginity on the fast approaching sexual armageddon known as "prom night.""American Pie" gleans most of its comic energy from its outrageous examination of the crazy and innovative extremes desperately horny teens will go to in order to experience the thrill of sex in lieu of the real thing. An attractive, game cast helps to mitigate the crudity of many of their actions and the filmmakers' lighthearted tone encompasses the characters in such a cloak of affection that the audience identifies with, rather than condemns, their antics.As meager compensation for the moralists among us, the film does heavily promote the use of condoms and comes up with even more creative prophylactics for those times when a partner is not available."American Pie" is certainly not for every taste and there are those who would argue that it serves a less than salutary purpose as a guide for already sex-obsessed teenagers. Be that as it may, the film provides a fair number of hearty chuckles for those of us who can find humor in a group of backward youngsters experiencing the frustration and desperation we have all, at one time, experienced.I do have one troubling question though: why do none of these characters, whenever they are involved in a potentially compromising position, ever lock a door? The answer, I suppose, is obvious for, if they did, at least half the film's biggest laughs would become impossible to achieve. For this film, at least, such a suspension of disbelief may be a prerequisite.Be forewarned but enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A shocking, but entertaining comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American Pie starts right off with shock value, and while the film relies heavily on it, there's plenty of story and exceptional performances to hold your interest. I attended a sneak preview of what I was told was a rough cut of the film, although there was only one scene that looked unfinished. The underlying story here is that of four high school senior buddies who have made a pact with each other to get laid before they graduate, specifically at the prom. The problem is, only one of them has a serious girlfriend, and she can't decide if she's ready for sex. But where the film really makes an impact is in it's numerous masturbation related scenes. There is one scene particularly early in the film that should test your stomach for the rest of the film's humor. Now while the film may not sound like it has good morals, there is one repeated underlying message, and that is to do what you like and not what you feel pressured to do. Unfortunately, this is NOT the kind of film its target audience should be seeing. At times it makes getting laid seem like the most important part of high school. The strength of the film lies in the fact that everyone who went to a public high school can relate to some aspect portayed here, and in the strong and well-timed performances of the talented cast. If you're mature enough to appreciate the film for its sheer comical performances, then you should really enjoy it. But if you don't like "toilet humor", then you might not find anything appealing with this one. Definitely not a date movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Honestly ,I can't really understand how a trash movie like this one became such a 'cult classic' for some people ,a really hyped and overrated one anyway. There's absolutely no plot nor story or any kind of interesting characters (not mentioning there's no character developments or any information about their background or anything...) -what's the big hype behind this movie anyway?.... it's obviously just a bunch of stupid teenagers who wants to get sex -so each and every scene were dedicated for this purpose -like a collection of bad scenes along with terrible writing. But the worst part is the fact that it's not even funny -not even a single joke....the whole humor is just too vulgar (mainly sex jokes) and uninspired garbage without any meaning nor aim behind it -In conclusion: sex comedy movies sells even more then a cheap porno for everyone ,spreading the message of stupidity around the world faster -grabbing more cash from the worst kind of idiotic audience that keep funding this crap.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a disgusting movie. I was horrified by it when I saw it. I was more frighten than amused by the jokes and gags. It is quite evident that this was made for the young generation as they are the only ones who find this funny. I am 18, and is both disgusted and horrified by this. If this is what will sell, I wish to have no part with both my generation and Hollywood. There is not one amusing scene in this garbage. I have a better time watching grass grow then sitting though this. At least the grass has enough decency not to be gross when growing. To sum this all up, this is modern day rubbish that attracts to the simple and closed-mined.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I laughed more when i saw Philadelphia. When you're 6 you have poop and p*** humor, when you're a teenager you have sex and semen humor(apparently...), only if you're an oblivious, obnoxious, immature, sex crazed teenager can you find humor in a scene where a guy has "sex" with a pie. Even I'm 17 and cant for the life of me understand how anyone can find this movie amusing. Except teenage boys(and confused middle aged men) who likes to look at half naked teenage girls, or women in their late 20's playing teenagers.basically its a movie about a group of teenagers who wants to lose their virginity before they graduate high school. What perverted hollywood executives came up with that idea?? Stupid plot, stupid movie. Who could've guessed? Don't waste your time, money, sanity on this what i fear will become an American cult movie in 10 years.I pray that one day a director will update the concept of "teen movies", movies that will actually portray how it is to be a teenager. I cant relate to this movie even SLIGHTLY and I'm guessing neither can any other teenager.2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my opinion, "American Pie" isn't so funny as some people said. Actually, I found it to be way too conventional and predictable. The plot was dull and clichéd, involving the dumb and forgettable experiences from a group of teens who made the promise to have their first sex experience before the end of the year.Most of the jokes from this movie were dumb and unfunny, and plot was way too predictable for my personal taste. The characters were incredibly annoying and unlikeable and the visual style was plain, dull and unimaginative. To get it worse, this inspired a lot of equally bad (and sometimes even worse) comedies with a similar premise and with the same kind of jokes and characters.There lots of much better comedies to waste time with this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'American Pie' set the bar for teen sex comedies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"So high school boys everywhere only think about sex, huh?" my Japanese wife turned to me and said about 20 minutes into "American Pie." She looked at me expectantly, as if she wanted to hear me say I was somehow different, above such base pursuits. I could tell she was mildly disappointed when I replied, "Yeah, pretty much." Eighteen-year-old boys' raging hormones is a truly universal theme.There have been four American Pie films to date, not counting the straight-to-video releases. The film notably struck a chord with teens when it was released in 1999. I remember sitting in art class and overhearing a popular and attractive senior girl condescending to an awkward and geeky freshman boy, "You haven't seen 'American Pie'? The great American sex comedy?" I still cringe when I remember that.If you haven't seen it, it is basically about four senior boys who make a pact to lose their virginity before they graduate high school. They shrewdly determine prom is their last chance to get laid, and devote all their energy to getting a woman in bed at the after-prom party, to be held at the lake house of the cocky lacrosse player, Steve Stifler. The boys, particularly Jim, have a series of embarrassing mishaps along the way, one famously involving a warm apple pie."American Pie" set a new bar for teen comedies. Every teen comedy since has tried, and failed, to top the scene where Stifler unwittingly drinks a beer with a load of semen in it.Though "American Pie" is famous for its numerous gross-outs, the movie is good, and not just gross, because we come to identify with the characters, and the humor rises naturally from the situations. The scene where Stifler slips laxatives into Finch's mochaccino, causing him to make a desperate dash for the nearest toilet, is funny not because fart sounds are humorous, but because the film already established Finch's aversion for public restrooms.The Stifler character was especially believable. When Heather (Mena Suvari) asks out Oz (Chris Klein) in front of the lacrosse team, Stifler proceeds to make lewd gestures. Heather misinterprets this as Stifler making fun of her, when Stifler was really just trying to embarrass Oz. When I first saw the film at the age of 16, I thought, That's pretty much how high school boys act.The acting is serviceable. Eugene Levy, who plays Jim's dad, and Seann William Scott, who plays Stifler, are totally convincing in their roles. (Toward the end of the film, watch Stifler in the background check his beer before he takes a sip.) Others, however, give flat performances, especially in dramatic scenes. However, since these scenes take back seat to the comedy, and few of the jokes fall flat from the acting, the mediocre performances don't hurt the overall effectiveness of the film.Another criticism I have of the film is one that pretty much applies to all Hollywood films, and that is that the kids are too rich. You can usually tell who the poor kid is in a Hollywood movie because he's the one who's not driving a late-model car. His family will still live in a two-storey house. Every student in "American Pie" (except for Oz, the only one shown to have a job), lives like the richest kid at my high school.Overall, "American Pie" is an enjoyable comedy that will continue to be the standard against which all teen comedies will be judged. I recommend the unrated version. While scenes in most unrated or extended editions were cut from the theatrical releases for good reasons (i.e., they were tedious), the theatrical version of "American Pie" was really a sanitized version of the better, unrated version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny but very crude and tasteless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A group of high school friends make a pact to lose their virginity before the night of their prom. Each has differing degrees of good fortune and goes after girls of different types (and ages) in their quest. However the perils of that first time are all too evident.The next step in gross out teen comedies was a film entirely focused on dirty jokes and rude set ups. The plot can be described in one line but really isn't even as complex as all that. However what it does do is allow many funny scenes to be placed one after another ? from the premature scene to the frothy beer to the pie itself. The problem is that, unless you are in the mood for really bad taste comedy then you'll probably hate this.The jokes and scenes are all crude and it's hard not to get taste fatigue during the film. There are lucky moments of refreshing available ? the best of which is Levy as Jim's Dad ? providing the innocent lines that are like a breeze in a smelly room! The teenage cast are al alright but only Suvari and Scott standout as reasonable hopes for the future.Overall ? very funny if your taste is somewhere between poor to non-existent. If you want wit, humour or subtlety then you'll be well served to go else where.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie, because my sister said it was one of the funniest movies that she'd ever seen. So, reluctantly, I watched it. I was a little disappointed because of the way she hyped it up. It wasn't a bad movie, just not as great as I thought it was going to be. In my opinion, the sequels are better. And it is so freaking rude. I didn't realize how many curse words and nudity-implied scenes. I do have to say that Stifler is my favorite character from this franchise, and he is incredibly funny. I was surprised seeing Alyson Hannigan, in this movie, because after only ever seeing her as sweet Willow from Buffy The Vampire Slayer, and funny Lily from How I Met Your Mother, I was shocked to see her saying stuff about flutes, you know, going in places.Overall, I give this movie a 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"American Pie" was successful in reviving the sex comedy genre - whether that was a good thing or a bad thing, I shall not get into. But unlike the countless other films to follow in the decade after it - including the spineless sequels after number three - "American Pie" is an honest and funny film that is never gratuitous to the point that it becomes a complete gross-out. Following a story along the same lines as the 1982 cult classic "Porky's", it follows the lives of a group of young men during the last few weeks of high school attempting to lose their virginity. There's Jim (Jason Biggs) who is clueless when it comes to sex and women in general, and is in fact slightly intimidated by them and embarrassed at every turn by his well-meaning father (Eugene Levy). There's Oz - the sportsman - who is a hopeless romantic at heart and Finch, the laid-back scheming geek who discovers a fetish for older women, and Kevin, who has had a girlfriend for sometime now but isn't getting 'any' from her. Harassing them at every chance is the notorious Steve Stifler (Sean William Scott) - the jock and womaniser/best friend of all three who laughs at their misfortunes and abuses them, prompting Kevin to make a pact with the boys that by prom night, they will lose their virginity. Kevin has a girlfriend, now it's up to the other three to find dates for prom. "American Pie" is a personal favourite of mine, which I would rank up there as possibly my favourite comedy. It's not a genre I enjoy too often, particularly nowadays as these kind of films tend be to very over-the-top to the point that they are gratuitous and leave us with the feeling that we have seen it all before. It's kind of like the slasher craze these days, as the likes of "Hostel" and "Saw" attempt to out-do each other in terms of sadism and violence - however, I do enjoy those films. The characters in this film are very realistic and are very likable - even Steve Stifler, who has got to be the most lovable jerk of all time. His verbal assaults and constant innuendos make him one of the funniest characters in the film, next to Jim's dad of course, played brilliantly by Eugene Levy. Alyson Hannigan, Tara Reid and Shannon Elizabeth are amongst the supporting cast as three of the (un)lucky ladies who come into contact with the boys. "American Pie" has a superb opening that sets the tone for the rest of the movie, as it gives us an idea of the misfortunes and countless humiliating situations that poor Jim will be getting himself into. The ending is satisfying, and overall, it's a fine slice of apple pie... but you might not want to leave it out on the kitchen table unsupervised!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best to remember rather than re watch.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's the summer of 1999, I'm 13 and somehow myself and about eight friends get into our local two screen cinema one afternoon to see American Pie. 95 minutes and a lot of thrown popcorn later and we leave having seen the funniest film we think we'll ever see. Now it's 2012, I'm 26, I have a beard and I've gone back to watch the film that my 13 year old self fell in love with before watching the forth instalment of the franchise next month.Towards the end of the senior year at High School four friends; jock Oz (Chris Klein), awkward geek Jim (Jason Biggs), quirky Paul Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) and regular guy Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) are struggling to lose their virginity before they each embark for college. Having seen classmates like loud mouth Stifler (Seann William Scott) have success on this front and after one party believing that even the dorkiest guy in the class Chuck 'Shermanator' Sherman (Chris Owen) has lost his virginity, the four friends make a pact that they will help each other to get laid by Prom Night.When I first watched this in 1999 the idea of hearing teenagers talk about and engage in sex during a movie was still novel and outrageous to me. Some of the jokes and more graphic or gross scenes were hilarious and like nothing I'd ever seen before. Now, 13 years later after the likes of The Hangover which have pushed the crude and discussing acts even further, the film feels a bit tame. It's still pretty gross to see Stifler drink from that cup or for Jim to enjoy that pie but sensitivities and audiences have changed a lot in the last decade or so. Much of the humour I liked 13 years ago now feels immature and I suppose this is because it isn't fresh and also because I've grown up. The humour in The Hangover didn't appeal to me either and the trailer for Project X put me off completely. I wonder how funny someone born in 1999 would find this film now. I expect they would find it funnier that I. One character who still remains funny to me is Jim's Dad (Eugene Levy). His interactions with his son about sex are cringe worthy and embarrassing even today. He stole the film and the entire franchise.One thing that struck me this time round was how poor some of the acting was. Tara Reid is dreadful and Chris Klein even worse. Shannon Elizabeth's accent is ridiculous and the country she is supposed to be from didn't even exist in 1999! Another thing I noticed this time was how sweaty the whole cast looked. I'd never noticed it before but it looked like each actor had gone for a run immediately before reading their lines. I didn't particularly like the sentimentality towards the end and everything ended far too neatly but at least it wasn't a nasty or mean movie. I also really liked the film's soundtrack both in 1999 and now.Despite all its flaws I still have great affinity for this film. It reminded me of being in my teens, wearing the same overly baggy clothes and having the same overly gelled hair. The film has stayed with me all these years and in a way I wish I hadn't revisited it. It's like that video game that you loved as a kid and you see in a shop for ?2. You take it home, dig out and dust down your old console and then realise five minutes in that times have changed. Sure, it was great when you were a kid but you're not anymore. It's best to put it back in the box and remember the good times you had as a kid.www.attheback.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Smutty teen sex comedy with heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American Pie tells a story of four lads, about to leave High School, wanting to enjoy their last summer together, not to mention getting laid. That's about it in terms of plot - nothing terribly sophisticated or original.But the four lads and their girls are all well drawn characters, there are some very funny (if rude) set pieces, and the movie has a great deal of heart - yes, it may be smutty, but the genuine relationships between the characters carry a great deal of meaning above and beyond what might otherwise simply be tacky.It is worth singling out Eugene Levy as Jim's Dad for the funniest performance, and Alyson Hannigan for the single funniest (and most unexpected) line.And here is where I go against the flow a little. Seann William Scott delivers a brilliant performance as Stifler - obnoxious, crass, loud, overbearing, uncouth, gross. I dislike the character, as I dislike such characters which seem to have become the mainstay of American teen comedies, often being the hub around which everything rotates. By all means have such a character, but when they become the centre of attention (and, worse, become portrayed as lovable and laudable), I no longer want to hang out in their company. This is the direction the series started to follow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ultimate Movie Review! - http://tss5078.blogspot.com</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original American Pie is certainly a classic comedy on the must see list, but it's not the best of the seven American Pie inspired films. Personally, I preferred the second one too the first, as everyone was much more relaxed and knew each other, making the movie flow better. Don't get me wrong, this one certainly had it's funny moments, but in my estimation it wasn't as good as the second one. Jason Biggs &amp; Alyson Hannigan are hilarious, but for all they bring to the table, bad actors like Eddie Kay Thomas and Chris Klein take away, making the good performances moot. American Pie is a classic teen comedy about sex and it ushered in a new era in comedy that's still relevant today. It has the raunchy, crazy, good looking youth we see in today's comedy, but unfortunately also has some really lame jokes and bad acting, that thankful went out with the nineties.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amiably smutty rite-of-passage comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Candy-sweet prom drama. Everyone's terrified of growing up and sex is the conducting rod around which plot threads and corporeal gags spark and squelch. Cleverly, with such a coarse general premise the film blooms; the strange exchange of revealed insecurity and galvanised masculinity is sincerely achieved. (Also, with it's postmodern appropriation of ideas from a 30-year history of rite-of-passage flicks, it also manages to pave the way for the parody-anthologies of the Noughties).So plaudits all-round to a new late 90s brat-pack. The film's not quite as delicate or touching as, say, Richard Linklater's Dazed and Confused, but you don't feel like you've simply been watching a 90-min riff on wanking. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A slice of latter-day Americana</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ordinarily, I avoid American teen movies like the plague. But a good movie is a good movie, and this is one of the best examples of this normally obnoxious genre. Its basic premise ? a group of high-school leavers endeavour to lose their virginity before setting off for college ? is a fairly simple one. It is in the quality of the comedy and (some) of the central characters that sets American Pie apart. The story centres on Jim Levenstein (Jason Biggs) and his attempts to get beautiful exchange-student Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth) into bed. The best supporting roles (and side stories) come from the high-brow (and slightly pretentious) Paul Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) and Steve Stifler (Seann W. Scott) who both provide additional colour and depth to proceedings. To be frank, I found Oz (Chris Klein) and Kevin's (Thomas Ian Nicholas) stories to be fairly bland affairs, straight out of a teen magazine (they were virtually redundant in American Pie 2). With its American college rock soundtrack and its almost National Lampoon mindset, American Pie does feel a little dated today. Nevertheless, it contains enough quality to make it worth a viewing.Owain Bevan</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intensely hypocritical *spoiler warning*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, so this kind of comedy isn't my cup of tea - I spent the film either cringing or grimacing when I guess I was supposed to be laughing, but that's just me. I understand and appreciate that for a majority of people it was the funniest thing ever, and I won't criticise or try to change your opinion.What I do criticise (other than the predictability) is the fact that it is incredibly hypocritical. At the beginning the heroes (I use the term loosely) of the piece realise that a "geeky" character has had sex, whereas as they are still virgins. Obviously this state of affairs threatens the entire stability of the stereotypical teen comedy genre, so they set off on a quest to "get laid" at all costs. At this point I could see the end, they all get their wish and it turns out the geeky character hadn't actually had sex, so all is right with the world, but what I hadn't anticipated was the insertion of a life lesson for the foursome. Toward the end they suddenly realise that... y'know, loosing your virginity isn't that important after all...If the film had cut at that point I'd have been impressed and would have felt ashamed at my misgivings. What in fact happens is that it continues and... most of them do, indeed, "get laid", completely voiding the lesson they've apparently learnt. Either this film is vastly hypocritical, or the message it's putting out is "Loosing your virginity isn't important... so long as you've had sex."As far as entertaining people with a receptive sense of humour goes it's obviously a resounding success, but they should have just left it as a string of "hilarious situations" instead of trying to throw in a moral.</fullReview>

Its also not very original either, The best ever teen movie was "The breakfast club" which was very funny and had some kind of plot. It never made you think what someone else says you should think either and most importantly of all American pie isn't hilarious at all. The jokes are all reruns from other films but just done by idiot teens and there pathetic stereotypical lives.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember going to see this twice at the cinema. It was the first day it came out. I found "American Pie" a genuinely amusing comedy, although it may have been the crudest comedy I had seen at the cinema at that time, but, unlike Me, Myself &amp; Irene, this only poked fun at things which you thought wasn't funny but you yourself had to go through, while other, so-called comedies (such as the above) just shock for the sake of it. Really, it is very lightweight, and possibly not as shocking or hilarious as many made out, but as a sex education, you won't get many better films, or come to think of it, a film as funny as it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I scored this film 7 / 10 &amp; am quite chuffed to see it's overall rating is 7.0. Thus, I must be fairly representative of the audience on this one.I'll start however, with the one and only real criticism I had of this film. It was about as funny as a road accident. It was entertaining, easily to follow, had likeable characters, a surprisingly good storyline, but to describe it as a comedy must contravene every trade description law in the book.To hear people rave about how hilarious this film was, you'd think it was Airplane or Naked Gun. It's not in that league, at least insofar as a comedy film. It could be another classic example of the American / Australian idea of comedy being completely different to Europe's &amp; vice versa, as I watched this, though thoroughly enjoying it, completely straight faced throughout. Much in the same way, many Brits do with 'Cheers'. Extremely good lighthearted entertainment, but not particularly amusing.I must also have watched an edited version as I cannot believe the emphasis people place on the character Stifler. Apart from the incident in the toilet, I recall very little else of him. He wasn't part of the pact after all.Other than that though, it was good. I tend to avoid films with the first word 'American' like I avoid warts, as I do with so called sex comedies, given the amount of crap that come out of England in the 70's, in this genre, so this film was a recipe for diaster with me, but I really did enjoy it.I anticipated a shagfest of pre pubescent teens making crude jokes, (especially given the pathetic knob in apple pie scene played to death in the trailers), and a glamourising of teenage sex, to make it seem like the be all &amp; end all of every teenagers life, when most will tell you it isn't &amp; that they do have other interests. But it wasn't really that at all, infact, for large parts the tone was to the contrary, I'm sure it conveyed some positive messages.So for mild light hearted entertainment, I'd certainly recommend this. It's good fun, but not in the 'ha ha' sense.But one thing, please, all in the US &amp; Hollywood. Can this be the last film or song that you export, even just for a year, where the whole story revolves around 'Prom Night'? We've had enough of them for a while. Nobody else has Prom Nights. Us in England have never been to one, and don't really have any idea what they are. We don't export films about fat northern compere's in stringed vests &amp; strippers on stage in Working Mens Clubs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>PIE IN THE SKY!!!!!!!! (contains spoilers!!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I cannot believe the praise and success this film has received. This film has been hailed by many as the "Ultimate Teen Comedy" which to me seems like a total contradiction in terms. As a "teen" film it fails because most of the cast look like they are hitting 30 and as a comedy it also fails because of the lack of humour.The thread of a plot involves a group of these so called teenage boys who make a bet among themselves to see who will be the first to lose their virginity. What follows is a series of predictable and crude jokes that serve only to remind the viewer about the golden age when comedies like Life of Brian, Blazing saddles and the Sleeper graced the cinematic screen. The jokes are so badly contrived and staged it is ironically laughable (about the only true laugh you will get from this film).Because of the lack of genuine wit that is apparent in the dialogue the director goes for visual comedy of the most vulgar with certain scenes such as the one where the hero abuses an apple pie and the one where the guy who tries to film his first liaison with a girl through his Webcam for his friends to watch. The only thing funny about that scene is the perfectly seamless live footage his friends are able to view online via the primitive webcam.The film concludes with scenes of highly unlikely sexual encounters between the lead characters and their so called female conquests. I am afraid this film asks us to drop our expectations of proper comedy to such depths that we cannot enjoy any of what these film perceives as humour. I am glad to read from these reviews that at least there some people out there who feel the same way about this film. This film about a group of guys trying to lose their virginity could only seem funny to those out there who are still virgins.I hope movie hell is big enough to accommodate the cast crew and even the fans of this "joke" film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After hearing a bunch of good stuff about this film and then finally seeing it, I was disappointed by it. The characters are pretty likable, depictions of high school seem pretty down-to-earth, and Jason Bigg's pie scene is the best thing in the whole movie, but there's nothing much else. It's slow and unfunny in pretty long stretches. The sentimental material seems to overshadow the fact that it's a "raunchy sex comedy". It still has plenty of gross-out material, but barely any of it makes a big impact on you the way "There's Something About Mary" does, and it's not so funny either. "Mary" handled sentimental AND gross-out material much better. It's also sad that, with the exception of Mena Suvari doing "American Beauty", none of the main young actors who do a favorable job here (Biggs, Chris Klein, Tara Reid, Seann W. Scott, Thomas Ian Nicholas, and Eddie Kaye Thomas) have done anything good or, in the case of Thomas and Nicholas, anything at all. Overall, the movie is overrated and unremarkable.** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A supposed continuation of risqué early eighties frat comedies such as Porky's, this rather slicker and bigger budgeted studio offering made its money through several hyped up gross-out gags that ultimately belie the films true intentions. Unlike its predecessors, American Pie is never prepared to venture into true bad taste territory, preferring instead to supplant its raunchiness with a desperately twee undercurrent. Scenes of almost gruesome sentimentality are often sandwiched between the cringe-inducing moments which provide the occasional (but genuine) laughs, and the old fashioned values that end up being preached simply stand out as heavy handed in light of the nature of the material and of teenagers in general. There are amusing segments and good performances all round, especially from Eugene Levy's 50's throwback father figure, but second time around the flaws stand out awkwardly. Many of the maudlin moments will undoubtedly end up being fast-forwarded through on video.2 1/2 out of 5.</fullReview>

It has several very funny moments, but with a premise such as this (teenage boys seeking to lose their virginity) you'd think there would have been many more funny moments. That's not to say that the writers were stingy with the jokes, but rather that only a small proportion of the gags were actually laugh-aloud moments.In the end, it's an average teen comedy that could have been so much more. If you want to see a genuinely funny comedy then see "There's Something About Mary" which is twice the movie this is.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SEX!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And with a headline like that more people will read this comment, and sex is what make this movie popular. I can see their point, but it was just too boring. Sexual debut is something which is always funny to talk about, I was therefore disappointed that this movie did such a poor effort. Some funny elements, but too few. To the movies defence , I think one must know about American high school graduation. Being from Norway I can't understand the big fuss about prom night . All in all dull. Virgins will have no fun with this movie. And if you while watching felt that you learned something, have another father-to-son talk.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have and enjoy the soundtrack and had high hopes for the movie but I was really disappointed. It wasn't even particularly good for a teenage exploitation movie which is hardly a high art genre. Finally, near the end, it started to pick up. I guess I'm too old (41) for this kind of movie and the gross-out jokes were way too much.However, the soundtrack CD is great!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's all about SEX. If you don't like sex, don't watch this film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>[may contain SPOILERS] Why is it that so many people call this film "shocking" or "crude"? I think it is really funny, well made, an excellent film. No, you will not find any messages about "racial and/or social injustices" here; it's not that kind of film. Its message is all about sex, teenage sex, recreational sex, period. Teenagers want sex: is that shocking? Is sex crude? If that's so, then we are all crudely made beings!I was surprised by the good quality of both the actors and the gags. I expected less, perhaps influenced by the comparisons to "Porky's". It is also well directed, the action runs smoothly, the gags are not overdone, and the scenes are cut at the right moments. Too often directors seem to fall in love with the jokes and keep a scene going far beyond the point where it stops being funny. Some jokes here are predictable, but funny nevertheless, e.g. the "milky" beer. Others came completely unexpected to me, such as the point where the geek very matter-of-factly declared her innovative use for a flute. I liked the ending too: happy, manicheist, everyone gets laid and the bully sees his mom in sh*tbreak's arms.There are many characters in the film: the four protagonists, the several girls they are running after, the bully, the dad trying to be helpful, etc. Some of these characters were not developed extensively, there was no time for that, but we get a good sketch of each, like a wiring diagram that shows the interconnections without unnecessary details.Well, I know that public references to sex were considered crude in some centuries, notably in the late 19th and early 20th. But customs change and those times are gone. People who don't realize this may grow old to become very unhappy grouchy persons!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gross out comedies about fumbly teenage sexual adventures have a lively and appreciative market judging by the young audience I shared this movie with the other night. But will anyone else find American Pie worthy fare, even taken slice by slice?In Porky's (1981) a pie was pierced by a penis, an event that obviously rendered a significant celluloid scar upon the minds of the makers of American Pie. Fast Times At Ridgemount High (1982) and a larder full of others followed Porky's with similar themes, even if as far as I can remember a pie didn't feature as it does again in American Pie. And then last year a certain body fluid became a fashion accessory in There's Something About Mary, which is certainly not about teensters having it off for the first time, but is the most striking example of the tendency for extreme vulgarity in teen market films.And yes semen again becomes a plot element in American Pie and yet again it's not placed in its intended receptacle, but is this funny as it is intended to be?Well it depends on whether you are a giggly, embarrassed teenager. The scene is set early in the film when four male friends in their last weeks of high school decide that they have better get laid by the prom. I'll assume that you all know what a prom is. We've all seen enough of these films to know.Anyway there's the sports jock (Oz) who falls for a local chorister (Mena Suvari). There's Jim (Jason Biggs) of pie fame who's dorky dad (Eugene Levy ) steps in to help with porn mags. Kevin reckons that oral sex doesn't really qualify and strange Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) wants to get in on the act but seems the least likely to succeed.Things have moved on in the 1990's. The humour is more extreme and the technology is more zappy. In previous decades lewd photographs might have been distributed. American Pie indulges in The Internet and Sexcam. We can only suppose what might be on offer in these films in the years to come as bandwidth improves with internet development. It's however nice to see that these children are up with the latest toys. Children? Yes the actors don't really look 16 or 17 but the age difference is less glaring than it often is. This subject matter is certainly good grist for the film mill. Just about every one does have their first sexual experience, which is always at least memorable.But what of the notion of sex as a singular event rather than as an integral part of whole relationships? And what of sex as a commodity, as a service to sell, even if money doesn't specifically change hands? Sex does sell and American Pie does that notion no harm.But still this film does swing firmly to the notion that relationships can be much more than the sex act and one night stands. It will raise a few smiles, but mainly for those who are still giggling behind the shelter shed.</fullReview>

The best thing about this movie is that it cast un-known actors and was able to make this movie a huge hit.The performances were great. Jason Bigs stands out amongst all of them. He blends funny dialog with very funny physical comedy. I hope to see him in more films in the future. Alyson Hannigan who has a small but funny role is also great.

		<fullReview>There are movies for everyone... movies for people who like Drama.... gore... and even harmless vulgar humor.... and believe it be harmless vulgar humor is 'American Pie'! If you do not like movies dealing with such.. then plain and simple 'Dont Go See It!' No need in coming on here and telling people they are 'sick in the head if you like American Pie' like one reviewer did...Anyways aside from people with rude comments and not taking the fact that different people like different stuff because just maybe we can deal with it.... 'American Pie' is hilarious! It's been a while since I have laughed so much... True it may have a slim plot but with this kind of movie it only can be expected... so I am rating this movie very highly recommended, considering it is in its own genre...Better than the recent 'Theres Somthing About Mary', 'American Pie' excells in humor as much as fun! A definite crowd pleaser... I for one know I have never seen the audience react as wildly or with such togetherness as with this movie... it was outrageous good fun!The interesting part is that along with 'sick humor' it acually deals suprisingly well with the slight touches of 'teen' romance and not sinking to far into just plain lust....Really a treat.. Enjoy it... and don't be afraid to say so... it's worth fighting for... to keep this as one of the best movies of this year (1999)... so far...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am so sick of some of the crap that hollywood has put out in the past years that is supposed to be funny. American Pie had me laughing throughout the whole film. As a high school graduate, I can relate to the humor in this movie, as should anybody (especially male) who attended high school and has a sense of humor. Not all guys are like the actors in the movie. But most guys that I have met in high school and college remind me of some scene in the movie. Of course some of the scenes were absolutely ridiculous and unrealistic but were very funny as long as you were able to take the humor for what it was worth. I left the theater with a big grin on my face and did not feel that I spent my money unwisely.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A teen comedy that's worth its weight in pie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After all of the hype generated about this is a "must see" movie, I finally decided to see what this movie was all about once the hype died down a little.Boy, I'm glad I did.This movie isn't as "disgusting" as a lot of people would have you believe. Sure, there's the opening scene, and the gut-wrenchingly funny pie scene (I knew about this, but it just doesn't compare to actually seeing this), the disgusting beer scene, and a brief nude scene, but there's a lot more to the movie than that. A lot more.The story of four guys trying to lose their virginity before the end of high school is one that anyone who is currently in high school or has been in high school this past few decades can relate to. Sex for each of the guys means a different thing, and their individual "quests" to reach their goal are funny, could very possibly happen, and change each of the guys into something more than just a bunch of sex-starved hornballs. The tables really start to turn when a few of the guys actually start caring about their would-be conquests and other things.I grew to really like these actors and actresses as they play their roles well, and as they grow in personality past their "pact". They're typical high school kids, like it or not.Eugene Levy as Jim's Dad is hilarious with his dead-pan delivery and his never-ending attempts to help Jim through his current er, "phase".Fortunately, the laughs go past just physical slap-stick humor. The one-liners are more often than not hilarious.This movie more than reminded me of those classic '80's teen films, blending a great mix of goofiness and the awkwardness that age. No, I don't think it's like "There's Something About Mary". "Mary" was a movie that was funny just for the sake of being so. "Pie", while having its hilarious gross-out moments, also had its fair share of sincere ones. I liked the kids because they came off as actual people instead of one-joke cardboard teen stock.I recommend American Pie to anyone who has liked a good John Hughes '80's film or who just wants to see a movie that has likeable characters and is really funny. American Pie has just become one of my new favorites.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A surprisingly sweet teen comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"American Pie" sounds like your average teen comedy, but it has a certain sweetness that wins you over despite some rather gross gags along the way. A cast of mostly unknown but gorgeous teen actors star as high school kids struggling with sexuality and love. Four senior boys vow to lose their virginity by prom night, and set out to do so in varying ways. We laugh at their fumbling attempts, but also root for them to succeed. In the end, we've seen a guy "do it" with an apple pie, but also seen a realistic portrayal of teen love. What's more, the featured characters are not jocks, cheerleaders or even popular. It's refreshing to see a movie that would even assume high school seniors could be virgins. "American Pie" is a fine date movie and will entertain young and old alike.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One film that simply isn't for me - 65%</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had to, seeing as I was the last person in Britain to watch this. You see, teen comedies aren't really my thing. They rely on a bawdy combination of crudity, nudity and signposted gross-out moments that neither surprise nor amuse. There's about as much finesse and class to a teen comedy as there is romance in a slasher flick. However, there is no denying that they can be incredible successful as "American Pie" is testament to, cementing its place in movie folklore as my generation's "Fast Times At Ridgemont High" or "Porky's". If you haven't seen it then you know exactly what to expect (certainly I wasn't too surprised) but at least the cast gamely give it their all and there are one or two moments that certainly reminded me of a torturous time in my life.After finding out that popping your cherry isn't as easy as they'd been led to believe, four friends decide to make a pact to lose their virginity before senior prom in a few months time. For lacrosse-playing jock Oz (Chris Klein), it's about getting in touch with your feelings as he pursues choir singer Heather (Mena Suvari). Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) struggles to tell his girlfriend Vicky (Tara Reid) exactly how he feels while Paul (Eddie Kaye Thomas) struggles to keep track of all the rumours swirling about high school about his sexual past. As for Jim (Jason Biggs), his toe-curling lack of confidence with girls isn't helped by the constant interruptions from his dad (Eugene Levy) and unwanted attention by band-camp geek Michele (Alyson Hannigan). Will the boys manage to get their end away or will they learn that there are some things more important in life than sex, despite what the goofy Stifler (Seann William Scott) says?"American Pie" is not big or clever but it does have some things in its favour. You believe that these four guys are genuine friends away from the cameras and there is a real sense of camaraderie on set. It also feels like a genuine school with a vast cast of characters (although no teachers spring to mind) which I must credit the screenwriter for - Adam Herz has a real skill at writing the sort of dialogue you'd hear in any school anywhere and the sort of sweaty nervous that Biggs excels at. In a way, his performance is typical of the cast as a whole who have generally struggled to escape the film ever since. My main issues are that the comedy is just so obvious, it removes any sense of surprise. Whenever you see Levy, you just know that he's either going to do or say something that will embarrass Biggs. If we know it's coming, it's not funny - like the moment that one character ejaculates into a glass of beer when you know immediately that someone will inevitably drink it. We're not idiots, we can figure it out for ourselves.But "American Pie", like I've said, isn't for me. It's for every teenage boy who is desperately struggling to remove a bra or who says the wrong thing or who can't stop fantasizing about sex 24/7. It reminded me of "Superbad", one of many teen comedies that followed in the wake of "American Pie" for years when studios realised that these movies were extremely profitable. What I want is a teen comedy that doesn't rely on sex, booze, parties or reducing women to humble conquests to be used and then forgotten. After all, what kind of message does a film like this put out there - that being a virgin is a bad thing? That you're a failure as a human being if girls won't sleep with you? Given the tragic events of the recent shootings at the University of California, such messages are dangerous and irresponsible. "American Pie" feels almost exactly like "Porky's" and also of that era - a shame for it, then, that society has moved on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"American Pie" set the standard for teen gross-out/sex comedies of contemporary society. It definitely has some unforgetabbly funny moments. The scene with the beer--CLASSIC! A film like this is noted for its crudeness, but what makes it special is it disciplines the crudeness and uses it intelligently. There are few throwaway gags. And through all the crudeness, there's a heart. There's a fine love story that develops via each character, and that romance develops smoothly and not at the usual forced Hollywood pace. And I think that's what made this film memorable. Because we see a lot of movies with crude sexual humor left and right. The makers of this movie KNOW how to tell a sex joke and any joke that regards to bodily functions. I think the scene that caught most people's eyes was the stripping scene with Jason Biggs and the foreign exchange student Nadia, played by Shannon Elizabeth. We do get a shot of her taking her clothes off, but it's not done in a gratuitous manner. It then cuts to the reactions of every computer user in East Falls, checking out the hot naked chick splattered across their screens. The way they edited that scene was really unique. The film even contains Shannon masturbating, and that's also not done in a gratuitous manner. Then we have Jason barging in on her, and she feels humiliated. What made that scene unique is SHE made HIM take his clothes off. Each comic moment goes smoothly because of the timing, delivery and all-out design of the sequences. So these are no mindless gags we usually are faced with in teen flicks of these kind. Of course, SCTV legend Eugene Levy steals the screen in his supporting role. I don't think they could've picked anyone better to play that role. "American Pie" is a treat for teens, young adults and--maybe--some older ones. I think they should find it quite harmless. If you have an overprotective adult in the house who gets outraged if they hear the word "damn" used--make sure you view this film solo. But if your parents are more lenient, there's nothing to worry about. I'm sure they'll laugh with you. I have a cousin who thinks of "American Pie" as the dirtiest film ever made. She thinks it should get a triple R rating. She said, "What kind of dirty teen films are they making nowadays? Back in my day, I was raised with good, wholesome films like "The Breakfast Club" and "16 Candles." She obviously doesn't get out a hell of a lot. If you're stuck in the same close-minded mode as my cousin, skip this one. If not--kick back and have some fun!!!</fullReview>

Almost all of the jokes fall flat and lack the true emotion that makes comedy funny. I have to admit that the last 20 minutes was pretty funny, especially the scene with Alyson ("what's my name, B**ch!") and the scene with "Stifler's Mom" on the pool table but the rest of the movie was predictable and lame. It was NOT worth the hoopla and not remotely worth of comparison to "Something About Mary." Go rent "Risky Business" or "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" to get some REAL teen movie laughs.</fullReview>

I saw it at a friend's house when everyone else decided to watch this movie, and it was like being trapped in a frat house for 2 hours (not a good thing.) And did anyone in this film actually do any homework (besides the "tutoring episode)? I'm 23, young enough to remember high school, and I don't remember having this much time to worry about "getting some." Darn extracurriculars.I will admit that the dancing kid at the end did sort of crack me up, but otherwise this film really was a piece of dreck. Maybe if I were younger I'd like it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THIS is a comedy!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American Pie tells the story of 4 young boys who are "unlucky" in love and all vow to loose their virginity before their High School prom night. With some great laughs scattered in along the way along with great acting talents this movie is a real treat. I first watched this movie last year for the first time (I just turned 15) and I suddenly realised how BAD some "comedy" films can be now-a-days. This film is the prime example of how a comedy aspect that, at one point was so original, is now tarnished by some of the movies that are produced now a days. Some of these movies are jokes now a days with basically the same story line and characters (ALTHOUGH REMAINED!), and all has a link back to sex!!!! American Pie is the first movie ever to do this sort of broad comedy and pulls it off very well and is a great film, although some films have copied the idea of this one and has dressed it up and makes it become quite a sick and offensive theme now-a-days. 10 years after this movie was made .. it's a classic and always will be. I love all of the first 3 movies with the original cast and was quite disappointed though i must say with one element in the third movie, which is that some characters do not return. I loved the characters Ozz, Vicky, Jessica and Heather and I thought that they all deserved back in the third and, especially Vicky as she and Kevin had a relationship in the 1st one and an awkward meeting in the 2nd and I thought that it would really pay-off seeing all of the main characters back together for one last time. But this didn't happen and, apart from this, all of the first 3 films are gems in my opinion. American Pie/American Pie 2/American Pie 3: The Wedding: FANTASTIC TRILOGY!! GIVE 'EM A TRY!! Rating: 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As conservative as apple pie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The American high school, as depicted in modern comedy, is a strange place indeed: full of over-aged, foul mouthed jocks and sexy, self-aware young women and what's more, every one of them is affluent. In a country where many real schools have metal detectors on the doors to keep out firearms, it's a relentlessly aspirational world, which, for all the cruelty and anguish on display, the target teen-aged audience can dream that they belong to. In addition, for all the toilet humour, it's a profoundly conservative world as well. 'American Pie', for example, may set new lows (if that's how you want to consider them) in toilet humour, but fundamentally this is a film about the joys of belonging; belonging with your friends, your lovers, even belonging with your decidedly weird father. In this narrative, the fear of isolation is eventually banished through the mere possession of an essentially good heart. Real outsiders, if they appear at all, appear only as losers, virtually labelled as the child-abusers of the next generation in punishment for their failure to learn how to fit in.In fact, viewed in these terms, 'American Pie' is far from the most offensive film in it's genre, with a little less smug sanctimoniousness behind the smut than is usual in such fare. Unfortunately, it's just not that funny. The plot is simple: four guys try to get laid, and the absence of real narrative reduces the film to a series of set pieces devoid of real context. Even the eponymous pie gag isn't even particularly gross, and there's none of the offbeat charm of 'There's Something About Mary' (which aimed at a slightly older audience and which I found rather funnier than I like to admit). The success of films like this is all about selling a lifestyle: this is a film about how the average teenager might like to lose their virginity. Real life is darker, but also, often funnier as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not since "There's Something About Mary" have I laughed so hysterically in a movie theatre. This teenage comedy about a group of four senior high school students trying to lose their virginity is the funniest thing ever.From maximising the wonders of the internet, to a cup of beer that has a strange distinctive taste, this movie will have you in stitches.This new method of gross out humour, has become very successful in recent years. Started off by the Farrely brothers, it has branched out and as this movie shows, has become very entertaining.Now, there are some people out there that may be offended with this movie, they may turn their heads and become disgusted with it...........but hey, who cares about those uptight repressed morons.

		<shortDescription>The blueprint for all that is wrong with comedies nowadays.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is basically the reason that most mainstream comedies nowadays are so dumbed down. Sure, similar styles had been done before but this is what set off the alarm clock for all the atrocities to come.What exactly wrong with this movie? The whole 'comedy' part is based upon sexual references, sexual references, obscenity, and more sexual references. Ha ha! Hilarious right? Well no. There isn't much comedy in a random girl masturbating in the main character's room for no reason and then him prematurely ejaculating twice. There isn't any hilarity in being caught by your parents which jacking off. The supposedly 'funny' parts are completely bland and done in a very tasteless fashion. I don't think I laughed once throughout the whole movie. Hell, I probably found even Swing Vote more funny, a movie that didn't even emphasize on the comedic aspect all that much.And now thanks to this piece of crud, thousands of movie makers are convinced that you need tons of swear words, lots of sex references, obscenity and perhaps even more sex references to make a movie funny. Plus, most kids think I'm talking about this crap when I mention the song of the same name. Thanks a lot American Pie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At first, when I heard a movie entitled 'American Pie' would hit the big screen, I Believed it would be about Buddy Holly's death(as was the song under the same title by Don McLean was about). When I heard it was a sex comedy, I was offended, to say the least, and thought "Oh great, another "There's something about Mary"". But, as i saw the film, I was even more offended. It has to be one of the worst movies spewed out by Hollywood nowadays. Whatever happened to the Noble movie? Star Wars is one of the last refuges to the ideas that noble beliefs can still be shown on the Big Screen and still be entertaining, gripping, and interesting.And, what was even more offensive was in a commerical for 'American Pie', it had people singing 'How Sweet it is' to pies(something you'd have to watch the movie to understand). I took it as a personal insult(the movie, and the commercial) against two songs in which I love(I hope Don and James hears about this outrage). Take my advice, don't watch 'American Pie', go see Star Wars again, or rent 'Shawshank Redemption'.</fullReview>

The film rely's heavily on unrealistic sexual scenes and nudity. The most extreme being a female character visiting a lad from school she barely knows, being left for 2 minutes in his bedroom and returns to find that in his absence she's stripped off and started masturbating over female pornography that she found in his dresser draw. Reality check anyone? This film could have been greatly improved by removing a few ridiculous scenes so that it was male AND female friendly. Unfortunately this was made purely for testosterone fuelled teenage boys to watch (alone)in their bedrooms with a box of tissues.</fullReview>

The cast, with the exceptions of Sean William Scott and Eugene Levy are 100% worthless... especially Chris Kline. Please, someone buy him some acting lessons.

It was about 25 minutes into the movie, where the father of one of the boys walks into his bedroom with a bag full of porno mags and start explaining their, uh, "use" to his teenage son. I mean, talk about a cringe moment! I have already endured the "accidental drinking of the beer with the used condom in it" scene followed by the barfing over the girl scene, but I have hit my limit. This movie is going back into its case and back to the video store with the rest unwatched. I mean, it's not like I'm some kind of prude when it comes to my viewing habits. I loved "Married ...

		<shortDescription>How can such an awful movie make so much money?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American Pie was undoubtedly a huge success financially. It gave hope to the struggling teen comedy genre and for the past two years we've had to endure rip-offs even worse than this. The movie feels as fake and tasteless as a Mcdonald's pie, with almost no genuine comedic moments. Worst yet, near the end we get a moment where our hero, Jim says he's sick of talking about sex and isn't so excited to have it anymore, while the supporting characters nod their heads in agreement. The moral about taking time to have sex is particularly pretentious in a movie like this, and is even more undermined by the fact that they all have sex in the last 15 minutes. Jason Biggs, as we have seen recent films can barely carry a film without humping a pie, and his career is already burning out. Unfortunately, American Pie 2 will be released this week, which is sure to make a lot of money. American Pie not only stands as a vastly overrated movie, but one of the worst to ever inspire a sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Never before have I seen a comedy that fails so miserably as this movie. At least, I assumed it was a comedy, despite the fact that there was nothing even remotely laughable in it. Anything that may have had even a small amount of humor was beaten to death by the commercials, so when it came up in the movie, all I could do was groan. For example, all the jokes throughout the movie about the one kid's slut mom, and how everyone wanted to nail her were wasted, because everyone already knew that whateverhisnamewas would get her by the end of the movie, because it was in the commercial. Same goes for the infamous pie scene. If you want to shock people, don't show an edited, less interesting version of your shock scene in all the trailers, or put it on all the posters. Perhaps had I not expected a pie to be molested, it would have been funny, but as it was, the scene was dull, at best. I've seen "Batman and Robin," and "Chairman of the Board," yet this holds strong to the title of worst thing I've ever seen. I wish I could give it negative stars, it was just awful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If for some reason you just really, really, _really_ want to see this movie in theaters, then by all means do so. But, if you aren't sure if you can believe the hype on this movie, wait until its on video. In fact, wait until it's off the new release wall so you're only sinking two bucks into seeing it. Better yet, walk right on by the "A"s, and head straight for the "P"s, pick up Porky's, and go home. It will be the same premise, only executed far, far better. And since I'm turning this into a rant... Please, please, _please_ stop comparing this movie to "Something About Mary". (I'm a little leery of comparing it to "Porky's".) "Something..." was a well written, intelligent comedy that, while generously laden with "toilet jokes", did not use such humor as the foundation, purpose, and selling point for the movie. Take away the hair scene and you still have a love story. Take away the pie, and what do you have? Not much. Not much at all. Now that I'm done writing this, I've decided that, much like "Wing Commander", I just can't recommend that anyone see this movie. I can't have that on my conscience. ...Nah, I'm being too nice. This movie sucked. It sucked hard.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am one of the members of the target audiences for this movie, a horny teenaged male, but I didn't think this movie was all that great. It is advertised as a comedy, which it is, there are some funny parts, but they threw in a lot of sentimental stuff and slow parts in here. Like Something About Mary, I thought this movie was way overrated. A few attempts at gross-out humor and some phallus jokes do not a good movie make. South Park: Bigger Longer &amp; Uncut, which was released just a week before this, was a lot funnier, raunchier, and more fun to watch. The funny parts do not make up for the slow boring parts. The movie tries to make you laugh one second and then feel for the characters the next, but for me it didn't work. Good scenes: The beginning scene, the pie scene, any scene with Jim and his father, the Jim and Michelle sex scene, the Fitch and the one guy's mother scene (MILF-Mother I'd Like to F**k), and the scene with Jim and Nadia. Bad scenes: just about everything else. The slow moving parts that try and give the characters feelings and stuff, which doesn't belong in a teen sex comedy. So if you have a choice between this and South Park, if I was you I'd go with South Park. Or, if you still want to see a good sex comedy, go out and rent Porky's Fast Times at Ridgemont High, or National Lampoon's Animal House.</fullReview>

Seriously! That's the whole plot! Now you COULD make an OK film out of this idea (maybe) but this film doesn't even try. It just thinks up every single way a guy can be sexually humiliated and/or appear pathetic and throws it at the audience full force. Hey, why be subtle? Jason Biggs especially is made to look like the most pathetic loser I've ever seen. I suppose the actor DOES deserve credit for humiliating himself again and again. He has sex with a pie, drinks a drink with sperm in it, has premature ejaculation TWICE (which his whole school sees), has his parents catch him with a full erection, does a truly stupid dance to turn a girl on which are his friends playing a joke on him...are you laughing hysterically yet? If any of those above antics make you crack up you might like this movie. Obviously many people did. I just found it stupid, offensive, cruel and pathetic with a disturbing mean streak running through it. The sole bright spot in this is Alyson Hannigan who gives the ONE good performance.Mean, stupid and very unfunny. A 1 all the way.</fullReview>

Before that I could still watch teen flicks and even high school flicks, even though I was no longer a teen and no longer(thank God) in high school. No problem whatsoever. But I guess in '99 I realized it had been 6 years since I was in high school, and these goofy teen flicks got repetive and boring to me. The teens in the theater were laughing their heads off, probably thinking that AP was brand new and original, when in reality it is old, old, old, tired and cliche.I saw AP with two friends, one guy was exactly my age and I looked at him and knew he hated AP for the same reasons I did. My other friend was still 20 at the time, and he was laughing his head off. Poor guy, I guess he can be forgiven, when you are 20 a lot of people still think of themselves as "teens" and can still watch movies like this. I know I could,.....until 23. Millions of REAL teens in 1999(unlike my friend who was 20) will cherish "American Pie" as "their film" a hallmark of their growing years and something that made them "come of age". I guess I had "Dazed and Confused" and even "Clueless". But AP will always be remembered by me....it was a coming of age piece for me. It was the first teen flick I watched where I just sat and stared at the screen trying to remind myself to laugh and stop feeling so old watching this. Since AP, I realized I could NEVER watch a teen flick again without feeling like an old geezer. Trust me, you think it won't happen to you....wait till you turn 23, or even 22.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just LOVED this movie! It is the funniest and sickest and most shocking film I have EVER seen! Funnier than The Pink Panther! Sicker than Cannibal Holocaust! More shocking than Salo! It is a MASTERPIECE! I loved the MTV-pop music ridden soundtrack! Far better than the score to The Empire Strikes Back or Conan the Barbarian anyday! I also love vinyl pants and butterfly stickers on my car and Chinese tattoos on the back of my shoulder! I just got myself a leopard purse and a skin tight leopard shirt! I just put on My Dave Matthews Band CD right before I typed this! Off to the fraternity house I go!Stereotypes abound! Obviously, the only sort of biped a film like this would appeal to. I can't wait for 2 more years to pass by, when all the "stars" of this movie join the "out" crowd of trendy cinema like Corey Feldman, Corey Haim, Anthony Michael Hall, Molly Ringwald.... Cyclical, isn't it? &gt;:)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not some silly fantasy about getting some; this is the real deal. An accurate portrayal of all that late pubescent angst which generally culminates in a less than satisfactory experience. Consequently, this film culminates in a thoroughly satisfactory movie going experience. It is a remarkably masterful work by a talented group of people. The script was honest, natural, and very funny. I would not be at all surprised if Adam Herz' writing is nominated for an academy award. 1000 years from now, when an inquisitive anthropologist wants to know what it was like to be seventeen in the late 1900s this could be part of the definitive reference trilogy along with "Breakfast Club" and "Fast Times at Ridgemont High". Well done! Let's see some more!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To put it simply, you cannot expect much from this movie. A guy masturbates with a pie. I don't know if I've heard anything so ridiculous, I actually feel dumber just seeing this movie. In my opinion it is a stereotypical sexually focused movie for teenagers. There is nothing I did like about this movie, the plot was awful, there was no character I genuinely liked or could connect with and the humour was crude and immature. All humour within the movie is focused on sex or sexual content. In my opinion I can't see the hilarity behind someone wanting to have sex with a food or being walked in while doing this. The characters and situations which occur are very unrealistic and I believe this movie is an example of how little creativity and intelligence people require these days to create or act in a film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't understand why so many people likes this film. It's one of the most stupid films ever made, that belongs to the stupid-film movement of the 90's and 2000's (Big Momma's House, Scary Movie, Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo). This kind of films have a lot of non sense jokes about sex or any idiot thing you like. For example, every time they say "boobs" or "pinus" the whole audience start to laugh. Why? It's all part of the human nature and sex is a serious thing. If you are a Person that likes quality films, a warning: don't watch this. Please I don't want more stupid comedies made by people who are thinking just in sex, sex, sex. Common.</fullReview>

Ratings people, get a life....I don't like teen movies where the teens look like tweens and older. This film is grossly overrated. The infamous "Pie" scene was a joke. Does anyone believe that the erection he has is real? Hollywood relies too much on pseudo-realism and this movie isn't. There is no redeeming social value and little entertainment.

		<fullReview>American Pie was a gruesome experience for me because the first time I watched it was with my best friend's older brother and father. Yeah, just us three. I was thirteen years old and a little part of me died as the brazen jokes kept piling up and culminating in grossness, upon which the father shifted awkwardly in his seat. With hindsight it was absolutely worth every minute of agony, because the film is such a powerful staple on the raunchy teen comedy wall of fame today and surely one of the most laugh-out-loud worthy films in my DVD collection (which isn't saying much since I have a total of like 20 films but still).Its premise and execution both bluntly rehash Porky's but it also updates and modernizes its humour, settings and characters. Both Porky's and American Pie will be extremely dated (the former already is) but undoubtedly that will only contribute to the glossy contemporary feel of the films. They both zoom in on a group of brazen ? but ordinary ? teenage boys in the last year of high school and unflinchingly follow them as they enter a quest to lose their virginity before graduation, whatever means necessary. American Pie boasts of a quintet of absolutely hilarious guys who take on the mission but botch their way through dates and sexual encounters with fumbling ineptness. What is especially refreshing about the aforementioned is that these guys have no 'assigned quirks' to get the message across but only different personalities. In other words, they are playing it totally straight and the comedy therefore stems from the situations.Sure 'American Pie' is not devoid of faults. Not by a long shot. It actively perpetuates stereotypes of the jock, the goody-goody two-shoes choir girl, the pimple-faced nerd, the Latin freak and the band camp geek. Far worse is that it presupposes that all girls are emotional predators of sorts, only after a heartfelt 'I love you' and conversely that are guys are horny beasts. Certainly there is a great deal of truth to both stereotypes but come on now ? it's plain lazy comedy to ride on these clichés. Luckily American Pie has far more weapons to offer from its arsenal of comedy. How can you not enjoy a film that gave birth to the comic genius that is Eugene Levy, the fantastic Jennifer Coolidge as a Mrs. Robinsonesque older woman and coined the expression 'MILF'? The answer is, you can't. It's crude, dirty, gross, too far ? and we love it.8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Any movie that's main gag is a kid doing sexual things with a pie is guaranteed to be a pretty bad 90 minutes. Not only is it bad, it is also more disturbing than funny (the pie scene that is). This movie shouldn't be as popular as it is. The plot is stupid, the characters are completely uninteresting perverts, the humor is appallingly lame, and the acting is just terrible. While I could see a version of this movie working, the overall desire to be as gross as possible without the benefit of having solid jokes or characters ruins any chance of success. I'm not against crude humor, but here the crude humor is used as an excuse for not having much else. The film simply goes from one crude comic set piece to the next without any sense of rhythm, reason, or relevance to the overall story. In the end, the whole thing just comes across as a disjointed mess. 3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stupid boys' movie, with an extremely one-sided and discriminating way of seeing girls, as either "hot babes" or "geeks". It's about teenage-boys trying to loose their virginity. You can imagine how plot goes on, while the boys try to get laid. Lots of goofy jokes and primitive comedy below the belt. No sophistication once so ever. The title is referring to how doing it with a pie apparently is supposed to feel like being with a girl. Which of course end up in a scene where the leading role "borrows" one of his moms warm pies and of course gets caught. In general I will not recommend the movie. I find it extremely discriminating and just plain stupid and a waste of time. Very tasteless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pandering Mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie can be summed up in the title it had when writer Adam Herz submitted his script to studios. "Untitled Teenage Sex Comedy That Can Be Made For Under $10 Million That Most Readers Will Probably Hate But I Think You Will Love." It was cheaply made, and it has the words "teenage" and "sex" in it. That is why the film got made, and that's just sad. It really wasn't much of a comedy, it was just an excuse for a string of sex jokes and fart jokes. If done correctly, they can be clever (see South Park: Bigger, Longer, Uncut) but in this case, the film just seemed like an excuse to show teens having sex. There was no "message" or truth to be learned from the film, and that is why it failed. Most of those teen sex films from the 80s actually had some kernel of truth buried in them, but there's nothing here at all, except, everyone's having sex and if you don't, then YOU'RE the abnormal one. The one relationship that I thought was going to be real was the one between Heather and Oz, but instead it just got cheapened by their post-prom-sex. The movie panders to the worst parts of teenagers, who are obviously the target audience. The only effect I can see it having on them is to make them think they aren't drinking, screwing, or partying enough. That is totally the wrong message, but its the only one that is apparent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why must we continue to endure the sick fantasies of loser Hollywood producers?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One has to wonder why grown adults make films like this one and like the film Kids, which depict young people in vulgar, crude and obscene ways. If you protest the making of trash like American Pie-you are portrayed as some sort of right-wing censorship mongering individual. This is not the case for me. I enjoy films that show a healthy attitude toward sex and do not blush at the sight of nudity on screen. What is sad is that perverse people as the so-called creativity behind this tripe were able to put on screen some of the likely sick imaginings of their youth. I will not see the sequel-I saw enough of the first to know how poor of taste it will be. In a recent interview with shock film maker John Waters-he told the interviewer that he no longer made films to shock-because there were so many of them out there from mainstream hollywood. Waters speaks truly. Don't waste your time with this, there are far too many good films that have and will be made about young people. When you pay to see stuff like this, it is the same as rewarding the folks who write obscene sayings on bathroom stalls. I would not be surprised if American Pie's producers were tops in this department while in high school.Michael</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had always heard that "American Pie" was so hilarious!!! Now let me say that I had heard this from a bunch of teenagers, when I was 12. They were my age. Even when I was 12 I really didn't like kids or teenagers that much because I though they were completely stupid and so foolish, actually laughing at the sex and toilet humor that they think is hilarious. This movie was full of them, and I was perplexed on how anybody could really find this cute. Personally I think it's disgusting and repulsive, not to mention embarrassing and diminishing to one's reputation. How do you think people regard me? They think I actually am that intelligent. Ew. Back to the movie. I have to say besides the jokes, the movie plot was horrible, very fragile and frail, like a building with a poorly constructed frame. It really had no purpose. They wanted to lose their virginity by prom night? Whoop-dee-doo, there is barely a teenager who doesn't. Way to be unique. The acting wasn't the best I've ever seen, but then again I don't really like most of the actors. I don't really like Tara Reid that much. To me she never picked character's that I actually sympathized with. What disappoints me most about this film, and many recent films, is that they seem to take teen sex, or sex outside of marriage, as some little joke, like it doesn't matter. I'm a Catholic, but this really doesn't have to do with anything about my faith. Sex is a deep expression of love and something that should not be taken lightly, especially since the only reason they want to screw you is to for their own pleasure, or their own sick goals, like in this noble movie(ew). With all the pregnancies, abortions and sexually transmitted diseases, sex is not as carefree (if it ever was) as it used to be, and it doesn't help when Hollywood promotes it as a selling point. Oh my goodness, grow up already!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This 1990s teen sex comedy hasn't aged well. The pie is starting to stink.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directed by then-first time directors, brothers, Paul &amp; Chris Weitz, this raunchy comedy was somewhat memorable at the time for its hilarious jokes about a group of high school seniors, named Jim Levenstein (Jason Biggs), Chris "Oz" Ostreicher (Chris Klein), Kevin Myers (Thomas Ian Nicholas) &amp; Paul Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas), all trying to losing one's virginity before their high school graduation. While, this movie was a box-office hit and spawned three direct sequels: 2001's 'American Pie 2', 2003's 'American Wedding', and 2012's 'American Reunion', &amp; a lot of really bad, direct to DVDs spinoffs movies such as, 2005's 'American Pie Presents: Band Camp', '2006's 'American Pie: The Naked Mile', 2007's 'American Pie: Beta House', and 2009's 'American Pie The Book of Love'; it's clear, after rewatching this film, a few days ago, I can say that 'American Pie' is not as good as I remember. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I found the movie's message to be a bit broken. After all, the film concentrates on bunch of friends trying to force sex to happen, rather than allowing it to happen on its own. It wasn't until, near the end of the movie, they decide that was a dumb thing to do, since sex shouldn't be a goal in itself, but something you do with a person who's important to you and when you both want it. That's a nice little moral that teenager can honestly get behind. However, the filmmakers kinda ruin it, later, by allowing all of them to have sex, all on the same night. As much as I like Mena Suvari as Heather Gardner and Chris Klein as Oz's relationship. I found it to be, a bit shallowed. After all, Oz does kinda bragged about sleeping with Heather, afterwards, despite their characters supposedly, taking their relationship slow. To make matters worse, some of the characters find themselves, being used, borderline getting rape, or committing adultery that night. That's not funny. Despite that, some of the humor in the film, somewhat works. I still laugh at some of the gross toilet humor, this film has to offer. The Pie scene with Jim's Dad, Noel (Eugene Levy), along, makes this film, worth checking out. Still, there were some sequences in the film, I found, to be, too low brow. One of them is the famous 'web-cam' nudity moment. I was never, really into actress, Shannon Elizabeth's work, here as Nadia. I found her foreign exchange student character to be one-dimensional and unrealistic. Not only, does her European accent sounds a bit rubbish, but the whole idea, that she would find Jim, kinda attractive, without his character, speaking once to her is just silly. Her character was pretty much, just written in the film, for fan service. If that, wasn't enough, I really didn't like, how the characters were alright with taping her, while, she's changes her clothes. The voyeurism in this movie is borderline creepy and somewhat disturbing. Anyways, she wasn't the only female character, I didn't like, about this film. Tara Reid as Victoria "Vicky" Lathum was very annoying as well. I really wouldn't stand her b*tchy attitude with Kevin in this film. Their scenes, together was such a turn off. The same with the walking-macho-stereotype 'Steve' Stifler (Seann William Scott). Yes, I know, that film help spark Seann William Scott's film career, but gees, his character was really irritating to watch and listen to. Nothing about his character seem real. At least, his character kinda stood out in the film unlike others people's characters. I can hardly remember, the characters, who actress, Natasha Lyonne and actor, John Cho plays as. One character that was very memorable was Michelle Flaherty (Alyson Hannigan), despite being introduced late into the first movie and had less than four minutes of screen time. I really hope, for more from her character than the running joke that she was, in this film. After all, Alyson really does make this character, very likable. It's sad, it's that her talent was somewhat wasted here. It is only the second film on, that her character being more than a one-hit wonder, but into a well-developed, prominent character. It's by then, I kinda fell in love, with this character, but for this movie, her performance was fine with me. Another person that really put it, his all was Jason Biggs. I know, a lot of people, crap on him for his mediocre acting, but he really did, make this film, fun to watch with his ability for slapstick. He nearly died from heatstroke and zinc poisoning, during production. So give this man, some props. While, Jason Biggs did fine as the main role in this film. In my opinion, the true-breakout star of this film, has to be, Eugene Levy. He really makes this film, somewhat watchable. Any scenes with him, were funny as hell. I have to give him, mad praise for making this film, work. Overall: While, American Pie upholds the tradition of horny teenage sex comedies made famous by 1980s films like 1981's 'Porky's', 1983's 'Spring Break' and 1985's 'Weird Science', for the late 1990s. It's doesn't hold up, with more of the recent ones, such as 2001's 'Wet Hot American Summer' &amp; 2007's 'Superbad'. It's still, worth watching. Just not, too much, rewatch value.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Have a Piece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>July 9, 1999"American Pie" is one of the funniest comedies I have ever seen and one of the funniest movies of the year. It may look like a retread of past comedies such as "Porky's" because it revolves around four boys trying to lose their virginities on prom night but it breaks new ground and gives us something different: Characters and a sense of purpose. It also aims to show you that high school is the last great memory before entering into the world and the challenges one may face before getting there.It's about a high school senior, Jim (Jason Biggs) who is awkward, nerdy and lives with his embarrassing father, Noah (Eugene Levy) and mom in West Michigan, Detroit. He attends high school with his friends: Kevin Myers (Thomas Ian Nicholas), Chris "Oz" Ostreicher (Chris Klein) and the ladies' man, Paul Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas). They are all frustrated with the fact that they are still virgins in high school. They also have a semi-friend who is a jock, Steve Stifler (Sean William Scott) who they despise because he is obnoxious and the only one who is not a virgin. Together, they decide to form a pact to lose their virginities on prom night and discover that it might be a challenge getting there.The summer has barely started and this is the movie to kick it off. It opens in a rather funny sequence where Jim is attempting to watch scrambled porn on cable. His mother walks in the room and he desperately attempts to hide with a pillow before his father walks in and they discover Jim's fleshy indiscretion. He seems to be unlucky as he winds up in many silly and awkward situations throughout the picture, one of them involving a pie, I'm sure, will become very memorable for Jason Biggs. Real teenagers are inexperienced little hooligans who will attempt to do anything to get the girl and that's what the main focus of the picture is. That's what these characters are and they are written quite well along with actors who dive right into them. The actors themselves are inexperienced but they play them very well as breakthrough performances.I really admire the characters in this film because they come off as a real people in high school, something teenage sex comedies never get right. Let me make an example: In the 1982 comedy "Porky's," and I use this film because it's awful, the characters are all moronic, loud and mean-spirited, mainly the pee wee character. They spy on girls in the change room like pigs and say all the wrong things because of a poorly written script. These kids are clever, smart and they don't walk around with an inflatable penis chasing all the girls in the school. They have feelings, are human and come off as real teenagers in high school. Stifler is a bit of pig and a smartass but he is naive and acts like he knows everything. Deep down, he knows nothing and that makes him real because he will learn like the rest of them.There has been a lot of talk about how raunchy this picture and, yes, it's very raunchy and vulgar. Some of the jokes in the film are gross but they are kind of setup to show the viewer where one's action might lead to because you know this film with be in the sights of young teenagers under eighteen and the producers, despicably, know this even though it's Rated R. This picture is not for kids or teenagers and is very much an adult film. One of the characters gets drunk at his own party and something gets splashed into his drink. Think of "There's Something About Mary." He ends up drinking it and pukes his guts out to which his friends tease him (Don't party like an idiot and be careful). One of my favorite scenes in the film is when Jim attempts to chase after the exchange student named, Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth) and she tells him she will come over to his house to do homework. In Jims head, he is thinking "She's ready." His friends convince him to set up his webcam so they can watch the whole show. Instead, he ends up broadcasting to the whole school by accident and they see him dance like an idiot and ruin the whole situation; twice for that matter (Don't let your friends get you in trouble).Through all the raunchiness in the film, there is a serious heart to it and it comes in the form of a super-dorky band girl, Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) who has a lot of band camp stories and proves that even the dorky chicks have the sweetest heart and Jim just might win hers. Eugene Levy is a laugh riot as he teaches his son "The Secrets of the Book." Jennifer Coolidge makes a cameo as Stifler's super sexy mom and her character will be talked about for a long time. Mena Suvari plays Heather, Oz's crush he chases after her and she is a sweet soul that is part of the school's choir who doesn't know she is being played. I found the film compelling in the way it tells the story but I found it a little to advanced for high school. Some of the dialogue between Kevin's girlfriend, Vicky (Terri Reid) and her friend, Jessica (Natasha ) was a little too strong for a high school picture and they are really awkward to listen to. Terra Reid comes off as a complete dummy. The ending of the picture lost me when all the girls are played for suckers and they don't even know it. It just feels deceitful. It would have to finish with a predictable party that attempts to close out their high school days. Nonetheless, this film is a winner and it will leave you laughing with a feel-good time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>After this, I'll never eat another apple pie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film tells the story of four teenagers seeking to lose their virginity before the end of high school. Directed by Paul and Chris Weitz, has a script by Adam Herz and has the participation of Jason Biggs, Chris Klein, Thomas Ian Nicholas and other actors.Sex has long ceased to be a taboo but it's not easy for a parent to discuss this topic with a son or daughter. It's part of life and it happens sooner in our times but there are clear boundaries between a healthy sexuality and a dissolute life. This has always been my personal opinion and I am sure that sex is good since it's lived with awareness, responsibility and maturity. And unfortunately, this message of maturity is totally absent of this film, that seeks to do comedy with immaturity and obsession with sex. For the guys in this movie, fu...ng is what matters, even if with an apple pie! It's the clash between a generation that didn't talk about sex and a generation that only talks and thinks about it, overcoming the barriers of shamelessness and making sexuality an animal obsession and an objective in itself. What saddens me most is to see that our adolescents (both boys and girls) are increasingly look like the characters in this film. Make it a comedy is not funny and doesn't help us to show the error that is to have this mentality. We are creating sexual perverts, and movies like this only contribute and profit from it.This film is the paradigm of teen film, one of the most stupid and insipid film genres created for the seventh art. Decidedly, the movie industry is able to reward us with masterpieces in the same way that we can throw up on the popcorn. Who have children, keep this film (and all it's sequels and spin-offs) prudently away from their eyes for the sake of their proper sex education. And who does not have... see this film only if you are completely brainless and like jokes involving human excreta and body fluids.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even almost 20 years after release, you still can't say the words "this one time" without someone interrupting "at band camp!" So I figured it had to be a great movie, I was even so sold that I almost bought the second one at the same time (thankfully I didn't). Aside from a few cringe chuckles from Jim's totally awkward dad and the cameo from Blink 182, I really didn't enjoy watching this. Nothing too funny, just a whole lot of middle school humor. I really don't get why there's so many sequels and spin-offs from a rather bland film. Worth a watch if you've always been curious about some of the long running jokes from this movie, but nothing I'd watch a second time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some funny moments, overall an okay watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"American Pie" is already 16 years old by now. How time flies. it was a huge success back then and everybody from younger age groups, mostly teenagers growing-up, had seen it back in the day. Obviously, with time, it has lost a lot of significance, but it was maybe the 1999 film that reflected society the best back then. It has not aged as a classic or must-see comedy by any means, but these 95 minutes are certainly worth the watch. There are some really funny scenes in there, the beginning when Biggs' character gets caught masturbating by his parents, basically every scene that has Eugene Levy or Alyson Hannigan, Stifler or Stifler's mom, the pie scene... There were definitely also many scenes that weren't really that interesting, which is why I cannot give this film a higher rating. It is certainly not funny from start to finish, but during its best moments, it is extremely funny I think.This was directed by brothers Paul and Chris Weitz before they became Oscar nominees. The writer is Adam Herz and he has basically written almost nothing outside the "American Pie" franchise. The cast includes a handful actors that are still known today, but no real superstars. The most known is probably Alyson Hannigan, an actress I like quite a lot and when this film here was made, she was already quite a star thanks to "Buffy". Back to "American Pie", this film is probably at its worst when it tries really hard to be also dramatically relevant in terms of relationships and sex between young males and females. It's not really working. But the comedy makes up for it on many occasions and makes this probably one of the most known comedies of the 1990s. Still today, almost everybody over the age of 20 has heard about "American Pie". You could maybe say that it was a defining film for a generation back then. Still, it's not a masterpiece or a classic, but definitely worth the watch if you are looking for a light goofball comedy. I recommend it. And if you like it, you can check out some of the sequels too if you're in the mood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not A Bad Movie At All</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first American Pie is a teenage comedy on the top movie list in 1999, but it's not the best of the seven American Pie series. For me, I preferred the second one, as everyone was more relaxed and knew each other, making the movie better. Don't get me wrong, this one certainly had it's funny moments, but in my estimation it wasn't as good as the second one. American Pie is a classic teen comedy about sex and it inspired a new era in comedy that's still relevant today. It has the crazy and good looking youth we see in today's comedy, but unfortunately also has some really lame jokes and bad acting, that thankful went out with the nineties.If you hadn't seen this movie yet you should see it right now. I'm not convincing you guys to watch it if you don't like teen movies but its classic of this kind of comedy. This might look little bit weird because its like a "Weird comedy".Actually, they aren't weird at all it's very hard to create comedy like this and make a movie like this. But I hardly recommend this movie if you are looking for different kind of comedy something opposite from teens movie like good rated movie with good well known actor and a good storyline or a family comedy because it would be pretty weird watching movies with your children or with your parent. This movie is way different about teenagers life, and their jokes. I could say this was one of the best of this kind of comedy i have ever seen. if someone asks for a comedy movie, i always told them to watch American pie. This movie would be best if you're looking for something really easy and very hilarious to watch as I said already.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>American Pie was only good when it had its Original Cast: This one and its two follow-ups... and the Reunion.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American Pie is a comedy film that originated in the very late part of the nineteen nineties and since then it has generated many movies, some of which include the original cast and some that do not. The only ones worth watching, in all honesty, are the first three and the reunion (American Reunion is the eighth movie in the American Pie Series.) I say this because after having seen all eight movies numerous times, it sucks without the originals from this one - Jim, Oz, Finch, Kevin, the original Stifler, Sherman, and so on. I have seen the ones without the original cast and they're: 1. not as funny, 2: kinda boring, 3: 1 and 2 on repeat.This is American Pie, it's the first movie, and it is the only one which takes place in the 90s. I like this one but it's not my favorite. I would say the second one is my favorite. And then after that, I would say my second favorite would be American Pie: the Wedding. And then this one. This one has some real funny moments and it has a few feel-good moments, and I like the characters a lot in this one. Especially Oz. Oz is definitely my favorite and I thought it was great seeing him do that kinda funny but really awesome vocal performance. I used to love that years back.American Pie is a good movie to start of a mixed set of films. The first three and the eighth are all re-watchable, many times, whereas the others you can watch, but they're not even half as good - especially Band Camp and The Book of Love, those two were definitely the worst. Anyways, American Pie is a pretty funny comedy movie and a good film in general.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Quintessential Teen Sex Comedy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The quintessential teen sex comedy that surfaced on the silver screen at the turn of the new millennium and went on to spawn a franchise consisting of numerous sequels &amp; a direct-to- DVD spin-off series while also influencing pop culture, American Pie is a delightful, hilarious &amp; harmless comedy that does exactly what's expected from it... and then some more.American Pie tells the story of four high-school seniors who decide to make a pact to lose their virginity before they graduate and attempt to achieve their goal of getting laid by prom night. The plot follows their adventures as almost all of them run into embarrassing but also hilarious situations at one time or another and find the pressure mounting as the prom night approaches.Directed by Chris &amp; Paul Weitz, American Pie features a shallow plot line &amp; weak characters and yet it manages to be a smooth ride for the most part that never takes itself seriously &amp; simply swims with the tide. The humour is crude, the laughs are plenty, the film is aware of its limitations and tries to have fun with what it has, and the cast does well with their given roles plus their chemistry clicks.On an overall scale, American Pie remains an endlessly enjoyable, thoroughly entertaining &amp; surprisingly good piece of genre filmmaking that still brims with freshness, packs a massive dose of nostalgia, and exhibits a lot of charm over the course of its runtime. Not everything works out in its favour &amp; a couple of moments may have lost its potency over the years but American Pie still works because its heart is at the right place.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There was this one time ? at band camp ? when we watched a really funny film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, so I know that 'teens behaving badly' is hardly a revolutionary genre when it comes to film-making. However, sometimes a film comes along that, while not really offering much that's new, sort of revitalises the genre (and naturally spawns one hundred and one poorer imitations). 'American Pie' did just this. Four horny teenage boys vow to lose their virginity before they graduate from high school and, as the old saying goes 'with hilarious consequences.' But, unlike all those times where that worn and weary phrase never really quite lives up to its boast, this time it does.There are times when a film probably shouldn't work, yet it does. This is one of those times. The story relies heavily on 'gross-out' humour. You will need to have an appreciation for rather crude and toilet-based gags to fully enjoy this. Plus, as 'sex' is a major component to the plot, you'll need to be okay with quite a few dirty scenes.Nearly fifteen years later, you will probably recognise many of the cast, but, back in 1999, they were largely unknowns, the only real recognisable face was Allison Hannigan who played 'Willow' in the Buffy the Vampire TV series. However, despite being a load of non-stars, they all played their parts really well. You'll actually care about everyone here, no matter how dumb they are.If you're really looking for faults, you could say that it's riddled with clichés. The four main lead characters aren't exactly 'fleshed-out.' They're all walking/talking caricatures and pretty dumb (but then they're teenage boys, so I guess the lack of I.Q. can be forgiven). The females on the cast fair a little better. They're slightly more smart and sensitive, but at the same time are largely only there as potential candidates for the four boys' adolescent lusts.American Pie will never be 'high brow entertainment' yet it is enormous fun for anyone with an appreciation for silly (definitely low brow) humour. Many other films were made after it trying to fit the same mould and recapture the magic. Some were okay. Others were good, but all fell short of this one. Even the official sequels themselves slowly degraded and I didn't even bother to finish all of the fourth instalment 'American Wedding.' I'll stick to this one thanks. And possibly part II.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>American Pie (1999): Dir: Paul Weitz / Cast: Jason Biggs, Chris Klein, Eugene Levy, Seann William Scott, Shannon Elizabeth: Here is a vulgar teen comedy where its biggest pitch is to feature a teen male with a baked apple pie plastered over his crotch. It reflects the teenage sex drive with a title suggesting innocence that they do not possess and their parents do not see. Four teenage males make a pact to lose their virginity before prom night. Director Paul Weitz understands the teenage sexual hunger. Eugene Levy steals scenes as a father who understands his son's sexual appetite and arrives home presenting him with issues of Hustler and has long discussions about masturbation. Jason Biggs brings out Jim's sexual longings and becomes involved in an Internet stripteases. Chris Klein takes singing lessons to impress a girl who doesn't realize that she is being played. Seann William Scott highlights the gross humour particularly when he drinks a beer without knowing what was expelled into it beforehand. Shannon Elizabeth is the fixation of Jim as foreign student Nadia whose homework session becomes a web cam sensation. While humour will discourage some, it is the sexual freedom being flaunted that may send the wrong message. Theme regards teenage sexual appetite with an ending that sends the wrong message of clothes coming off and everybody waking up in someone else's bed. Score: 8 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There were so many outtakes from everyday life in America. The house parties, the strive to get laid, the bond amongst friends, going to college, and prom all played out in one way or another for most Americans. American Pie definitely blew some scenarios out of proportion, and the result was comedic. Film makers stripped this film down to just the set and a fun script. Most of this movie relied heavily on the script with a nice setting at the end. Dialogue between couples, conversation amongst friends, and advice from parents were all simple yet smart enough to stay funny. Physical humor did make a few cameos. This movie was like a slice of every funny memory from everyone's experiences all mashed up in one pie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's not beat about it, American Pie is hilarious. Its crude, raunchy humour and frequently outrageous giggles will leave you scoffing with a mixture of bowel crunching laughter and light shock. Like most teen movies, it's extremely cheesy, but once you get past that, it's only too easy to fall into seeing the flick the way it was intended... without a shred of seriousness. The plot is simple enough. Four high school seniors pledge to lose their virginity before their fast approaching senior prom. The actors are at their best together, where the totally outrageous script truly doesn't hold back. By far the best feature of American Pie is its on-screen gags, which are both frequent and clever. They're outright brilliant, and will make you howl with laughter. However, for those who view their cinema closely, American Pie is also an exploration into coming of age. You get the impression that the boys are desperately on the cusp of bridging the gap between teenager and adult. Such an impression is all too easy to relate to, and viewers may feel all overcome with nostalgia at the eventful house parties and sexual banter. American Pie is comedy gold. It's utterly without dignity, but that's what makes it so wonderful. Sure, the acting's nothing special, but it's the boys' experiences that make it such a laugh. The plot and characters are strong enough that the film isn't totally ridiculous, but it's so cheeky and funny that it's become a popular classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly Entertaining, and Warm Hearted.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I want to start this review with a shocking statement: I am a Christian. That's right, a Christian watched "American Pie." Okay, so to you this may not seem like much of a big deal, but trust me, to 99 percent of Christians, it is. See, I grew up being told that these films were stupid, raunchy, cheesy, sex comedies. I put in the disc for AP expected to be greatly offended and find it to be all of those things. I only watched it at first because I am a very big Alyson Hannigan fan and I wanted to see her trademark role. I'll be the first to admit that there is a lot of inappropriate content in the movie, and yes, he has sex with a pie, but I think people overestimate the way that these things are shown. The movie isn't a porn flick. It shows his butt for a few second while he is over the pie. Yes there i frontal nudity on a girl, and yes, it is in a prolonged scene, however, this is probably the most justifiable nudity of any movie in the 1990's. In the 1990's teen films had become so squeaky clean, and afraid of offending anyone that they had become incredibly unrealistic. AP was a throw back to 80's films like Fast Times At Ridgemont High, The Breakfast Club, and Sixteen Candles. Granted AP is worse than all of these. There is no way to justify the content, but that doesn't mean the movie isn't a good movie. It is a well-written, well-acted, funny, somewhat original comedy with a lot of heart. It brought back the bro- mance. The fact is that if you are easily offended, you will HATE AP, but if you're not, grab some popcorn, a large coke---and maybe some apple pie-- - and enjoy this truly one of a kind, hilarious movie that(in-case you're one those people who thinks it is) is not a sex comedy but truly a bromantic comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me make things clear. This movie is not an intelligent, moving piece of art that reflects life in in a beautiful way. But it's not supposed to be. It's intended as light fun. And in that aspect it clearly delivers. The characters are all wonderful. Jim despite being a bit of loser does try to do the right thing and does seem like a nice guy. There's nothing particularly wrong with him, he just wants to know what sex feels like and you do become invested in him as time goes on. Oz is a jock who hangs out with the geeks, not exactly the most original character but a guy with so much charisma you can't help but like him. Finch is an oddball who takes himself a tad too seriously but still means well and Kevin is more mature than his counterparts but still having as much fun as his friends. Each of them are very likable and the way they interact with each other is very funny. When they fall into these ridiculous situations, it's all the more hilarious than it would be to less interesting characters. The two scene stealer's though are supporting characters. Steve Stifler is the obnoxious womanizing asshole who you love to hate. Again kind of generic of a characters but Sean William Scott kills it in the role. He's just so funny and has so much fun on screen. And the other scene stealer is Jim's Dad(Eugene Levvy). This guy is so supportive of his son that it's kind of embarrassing for Jim. I think we can all admit we've had embarrassing conversation with our parents about the birds and the bees but this is just taking it to another level. For the viewer though, it's hilarious. The movie does have some teen drama as well and it does work because you care about the characters so much. Still it still remembers what it is and is an is 80% comedy. I can't say it's as funny as it probably was when it came out but it's still pretty damn funny and if you're still quoting "Warm Apple Pie" to this day, you'll know what I'm talking about</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The structure and plot is the pie, while the characters are the attractive and sweet whipped cream</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American Pie is smarter than many, many other teen films that I've seen over the last few years. Its depiction of the fun, spontaneous antics that exist in high school don't take the nihilistic or dehumanizing route many films of the same genre do. Some have written the film off as "unoriginal," and while it really isn't, it's a comedy for a new generation. The seventies had National Lampoon's Animal House, the eighties had Porky's, and the nineties got a nice helping of pie.The film follows four naive Michigan high school students, who are close to each other, but not to the people they truly want to be close to; girls. Jim (Biggs) is a pasty, awkward teenager hoping to get lucky with the foreign exchange student Nadia (Elizabeth), Chris "Oz" Ostreicher (Klien) is the all-star lacrosse player trying to make things work with the sweet, innocent, and charming choir girl Heather (Suvari), Kevin (Nicholas) is the self-confident and sexually motivated one of the group, hoping to have sex with his girlfriend Vicky (Reid) before they go off to separate Colleges, and Finch (Thomas) is the shy, solemn soul who usually sits idly by while the antics unfold. The four make a pact to lose their virginity by the end of high school, hoping to make it all happen the night of Senior Prom. The gang's motivation comes from their loudmouth buddy Steve Stifler (Scott), who is unapologetically crude, yet irresistibly lovable.Perhaps the funniest character in the entire film is Jim's dad (Levy), who must be the most conscious and understanding father in the history of film. Many teen films portray parents as out of touch codgers with no knowledge or comprehension of current events. Jim's dad is the total opposite. He is way too understanding, even when his son tries to practice his moves on a baked apple pie.One character that seems tragically underused is Vicky's friend Jessica (Lyonne). The character is seen at rare points in the film, usually providing her friend with sex insight. She seems like the black sheep of the group, who doesn't fit in anywhere and doesn't really want to. When she does turn up on screen, usually for a slender amount of time, she is witty and fun, much like the rest of the characters.I was never hugely fond of the eighties' generation-definer Porky's. I found it to be a little weak on the characterization, yet still on par with its projection of high school students. The reason why American Pie soars high on the grading scale is because it manages to provide us with lovable characters that would become familiar to us like those in a sitcom. These characters are sunny and infectious with their one-liners and their wisdom. They aren't indulgent, meaning they are always learning new things and reciting a good moral or two. After not seeing the film in many years, the end scenes were a big surprise to me. It shows the characters are gaining insight and knowledge; I thought that simply couldn't happen in a teen movie. The end also goes in a way one did not expect. I was crossing my fingers that it wouldn't turn into the cartoony cliché I was thinking, and what do you know, it turned out to be just as sweet as the film itself.What a joyous and lovable excursion American Pie is. It provides well delivered, intelligent laughs and realizes that it doesn't need to discover a new "breast per screen" ratio in order to be funny or memorable. It introduces us to naive, confused teenagers, perhaps somehow reflecting ourselves at the time, and goes from there in what appears to be a totally fresh take on the subject of losing ones virginity. It is simple, efficient, and wholesome even when it shows its darker side.Starring: Jason Biggs, Alyson Hannigan, Chris Klein, Natasha Lyonne, Thomas Ian Nicholas, Tara Reid, Mena Suvari, Eugene Levy, and Eddie Kaye Thomas. Diretced by: Paul Weitz and Chris Weitz.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Real talk about this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you hadn't seen this movie yet you should see it right now. Of course im not insisting you guys to watch it if you don't like teen movies but its classic of this kind of comedy.I mean it! This might look little bit stupid because its like a "stupid comedy" Thats how i like to call movies like this.Actually they aren't stupid at all it's very hard to create jokes like this and make a movie like this.But I could hardly recommend this movie if you are looking for different kind of comedy something opposite from teens movie like good rated movie with good well known actor and a good storyline or a family comedy because it would be pretty weird watching movies with your children or with your parent (depends who you are).This movie is way different is about teenagers life, and their jokes. I could say this was one of the best of this kind of comedy i have ever seen! if someone asks for a comedy about teens first movie i say is "American pie". This movie would be best if you're looking for something really easy and very hilarious to watch as I said already. Thanks for reading</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie defined my generation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember when this movie came out and I didn't want to see it.I thought it was corny and ridiculous. Well I was wrong. It's one of the funniest American teen comedies, and yes.. this movie defined the lives of the teenagers that grew up in the 90s. It's not a deep, heart-breaking story, it is not complicated. It's fun, it makes me laugh every time I see it on TV (which is often) And of course, one of the funniest scenes (and everyone will remember it) is the pie scene, Jason Biggs was the perfect choice for the role, and his father is so hilarious, his bushy eyebrows and his attempts to talk to his son about puberty makes this movie an original one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>1999 was THE year in movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all I have to say I really laughed in the scene that Jim said angrily "I hate sex!! I've never done this I already hate it" or something like that.In the first 20 minutes, I was ready to give it a bad review. American Pie began too silly and seemed to be a movie for pre-teenagers. But after the web camera scene, it began being funny and entertaining. You know, putting funny jokes much after the beginning makes the spectator loses the interest for the film, the writers here were really brave to do that (and fortunately, it worked). It deals with many of the youth issues, such as insecurity, inexperience, curiosity and growing up. The end of the movie is mind blowing; they really made it in a way to satisfy the spectator (and me as well, of course).Also, Jason Biggs proves to be a real actor that deserves the attention he had in here. I just watched this film and right after I went to youtube to see his interviews. He is really very different from Jim, which shows he can act and leave the comfortable zone with talent. American Pie is a legitimate classic that everyone should give a try.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can't say I never laughed, but this is another overrated immature romantic comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been aware of this movie's existence for many years now. Released in 1999, it's a romantic comedy which turned out to be an absolute success and spawned two sequels, "American Pie 2" in 2001, and "American Wedding" in 2003. I even remember listening to the "American Wedding" soundtrack six years ago, but never actually saw any film in the trilogy until this month, when I finally watched the first one. The original "American Pie" was released the year after "There's Something About Mary", another successful R-rated romantic comedy. I watched that 1998 release earlier this year and really didn't get the hype. I knew this film was a lot like that one, and thought it was slightly better than its predecessor, but still vastly overrated.Jim Levenstein, Chris "Oz" Ostreicher, Kevin Myers, and Paul Finch are four high school friends who are nearing the end of their senior year. One of their fellow students is Steve Stifler, a popular sex-crazed jock who can be very rude and insensitive. After a geeky student named Chuck Sherman claims to have just had sex, and it appears he is telling the truth, the four friends are shocked. Jim, Oz, Kevin, and Finch then all vow to lose their virginity before graduation. Since they are convinced that Chuck has had sex before finishing high school, they figure they obviously can as well. In order to achieve their goal, they will have to get themselves girlfriends before the senior prom, which is coming up in three weeks. They don't have very much time, so each of them soon attempts to find a female peer and win her heart, but as the night of the prom draws nearer, they find that trying to lose their virginity in time isn't so easy.This R-rated comedy is crude and juvenile from the beginning, showing Jim getting caught watching an explicit channel by his parents, and I have to admit that this made me laugh. Many more crude gags follow, and they often made me laugh at least lightly, including the part with Steve drinking beer which he doesn't realize Kevin has ejaculated into, though I'm not proud of that, and didn't find the scene that soon follows this, with Steve throwing up in the toilet, very funny. There's even a part showing Jim practicing sex on a pie, and this part probably wouldn't have made me laugh had it not been for his father coming in and catching him in the act! The scene with Jim's Dad, played by Eugene Levy, giving his son a bunch of porno magazines, and at least one later scene with this character giving his son sexual advice, also made me laugh. Levy's talent was probably a major reason for this. However, most of the movie isn't THAT funny, and is sometimes pretty lame, even cruel, such as the part where many students get to see the sexual activity in Jim's room on their computers, and Steve giving Finch diarrhea and leading him into the girl's washroom to let it out, even if I didn't keep a completely straight face throughout these segments. Finch even has to face Steve and many other students laughing at him when he comes out of the ladies' room! I also didn't care much for the characters in general, there's nothing too special about them, and very rarely do I see a movie with such a stupid and uninteresting premise!Some super-raunchy modern comedies are really funny to me, while certain others have failed to make me laugh even one time while I watched them. For me, "American Pie" came somewhere in between. I did laugh at times, and I've certainly seen worse excuses for gags than any of the ones I saw here, but the laughs weren't consistent enough, and the movie certainly has some notably lame segments. Since there were parts I found funny, even if that's not necessarily a good thing, I give this juvenile R-rated romantic comedy a 6/10, but thinking about all the lameness I saw in it, I get the feeling even this rating is a little too generous. Unsurprisingly, nothing here made me feel the same way as the zipper accident in "There's Something About Mary" (I've said in previous reviews that nothing else in any movie ever has), but like that 1998 comedy, I really don't think this one deserved its massive success.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>1999 seems so long ago.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American Pie probably needs another review less than almost any movie in the world. Is there anyone left who hasn't already seen the movie, or at least knows what it's about? Regardless, here are my two cents.&nbsp;American Pie hasn't aged particularly well. It doesn't have the timelessness of some of the other movies in the raunchy teen comedy genre, and it's been greatly surpassed by movies that have come after it. It's still funny in some ways, but a lot of the gross scenes that used to be shocking, are fairly unremarkable by today's standards. The most enjoyment I get from the movie now, is from looking at the substantial cast and seeing how their careers have changed, remained stagnant, or basically ended all-together, since 1999. There aren't many other reasons to go back to American Pie. &nbsp;</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first American Pie is the best American Pie out there in my opinion! (and probably the best of teenage comedy).I watch it 100 times and I still laughing about their jokes and Jim (played by Jason Biggs) is a truly funny character with all his sex experiences and the advices that his father (Eugene Levy) gives to him, are awesome! Stifler (played by Sean William Scott) is also a very funny character! Shameless and he plays a real 'macho-men' very well. In spite of being a movie that doesn't have any brilliant performance and doesn't have any complexity that puts the actors in difficult situations, it's a pretty good film with lots of funny moments, lots of nudity, sex jokes and scenes, all the ingredients to make a very good teenage comedy!So, if you're a teenager with a tough 'sex life', watch this movie and you should learn something (or, at least, have a good laugh)!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie revived the whole raunchy comedy genre, but really it isn't all about bodily fluids. Its many knock-offs never seemed to get this, but the sex jokes weren't the core of this movie. Sure, it's funny when some dude gets caught getting it on with a pie, but that wasn't really the point. The way I see it, it was really about a bunch of guys trying to cope with growing up. Jason Biggs and Eugene Levy master in awkward situations, but their scenes are also incredibly heart-warming, especially the one with the nudie magazines. My absolute favourite part though (apart from the inevitable Nadia scene) comes near the ending, when Jim finally manages to put everything into perspective and tells everyone of. Such a brilliant scene, or maybe I'm just getting soft. This movie has been called the "Porky's" of its generation, and really I couldn't have said it better myself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's gotta be the best movie EVER. Honestly, I think the day I watched the last part of the series was the worst day of my life. It lost all meaning without American Pie. It wasn't easy to continue a normal life after 6 days of American Pie-ing. And then one day, I came to know about American Pie 7. Colors rushed into my life, everything seemed so beautiful.I might've exaggerated a bit, but yes, that's the sort of effect you can expect the series to have on you. American Pie isn't just a movie, it's a brand, an icon with a huge number of fans worldwide. If there was ever a movie that deserved Oscars and BAFTAs, this is it. It's the most well executed movie/series in this genre (teen sex comedy) ever made. The actors don't seem to be acting, they're rather living their part.You don't need to think twice before seeing it, run like mad to the nearest parlor, rent it, and wait till folks at home are asleep. Just a tip, if your parents' room is close to yours, you might wanna lower the volume a bit in the beginning. :P</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Outrageously Funny Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sex by itself is not funny. Nor is anything else, for that matter. The key to comedy is appropriately setting up and executing the jokes. Fortunately, "American Pie" has all the requisite elements.Four best friends, Jim (Jason Biggs), Oz (Chris Klein), Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) and Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) have a problem: They are seniors approaching graduation, and they still haven't gotten laid. Their egos are hurting, but when the biggest geek, Sherman (Chris Owen) gets laid before they do, they decide enough is enough. The four make a pact: each of them will have sex before the Senior Prom.The key to this kind of comedy is pushing boundaries. "How did they get away with this?" will enter anyone's mind at more than a few points in the movie (the prudish MPAA notwithstanding). All the characters are curious about sex, but they don't know how to respond to it without looking like geeks. This kind of awkwardness is good mining territory for comedy, and the creators of "American Pie" exploit it for all it's worth. The result is a riotously funny comedy that will have even the most tightly-wound doubled over in laughter for much of the time.But what really elevates "American Pie" from the usual raunchfests (other than its funnier than most of what Hollywood shells out), is that we actually begin to care about the characters in the film. None of them are especially well-developed (this is an ensemble comedy), but they are likable and more importantly, surprisingly real. We recognize Jim's infatuation with the Nadia, the sexpot foreign exchange student. We understand how awkward Oz feels talking to a girl completely different from him for the first time (Mena Suvari). We empathize with both Kevin's fears and uncertainties, and those of his girlfriend, Vicky (Tara Reid). And strange as it may seem, we can see a bit of ourselves in Finch's refined taste.The acting is actually very good. Jason Biggs has the social awkwardness down pat, and quite frankly, no one shows complete and utter embarrassment like him. Thomas Ian Nicholas is good as Kevin, although he is rather flat in his "big moment" speeches. That shouldn't be entirely faulted on him though, the dialogue in these scenes isn't especially well written. Chris Klein is rather flat as Oz, the jock. He's not bad, it's just that Oz could have used a little more energy. Eddie Kaye Thomas is great as the tightly wound Finch.The girls are great too. Shannon Elizabeth is wonderful as the sexpot, especially because she knows the effect she has on Jim. Tara Reid is good as the girlfriend who wants everything to be perfect when she loses her virginity. Mena Suvari is especially good as the mature good-girl who, despite everything, falls for the jock. And Natasha Lyonne is terrific as Jessica, the sexual know-it-all who is on hand to give advice.There are three other actors that deserve mention. Eugene Levy is hilarious as Jim's Dad. The teenage years would be smooth sailing if every teenage guy's dad was Mr. Levenstein. When he finds out about his son's interest in sex, he's not horrified, he presents him with porn! Seann William Scott benefited most from his performance as the obnoxious and egotistic Stifler, who's so stupid that he doesn't realize that no one actually likes him. Jennifer Coolidge is hilarious as Stifler's Mom (more than that I will not say).If you want to really laugh (and laugh hard), "American Pie" is a great way to go.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>American Pie follows four teens in their senior year of high school. After experiencing some daunting sexual experiences, they decide to create a pact that will increase their chances of scoring before the year ends. The four set a goal to lose their virginity on prom night, for the sake of their own good.This film has a near-perfect formula ? a variety of characters that are evident in high schools (making the film easy to relate to), original and funny jokes that run throughout the entire duration, and an interesting conflict (if somewhat farcical). Could have been funnier though. Standout characters in the film are Jason Biggs as the protagonist Jim, Alyson Hannigan as the geeky Michelle (who has a hilarious obsession with telling anecdotes about band camp), Seann William Scott as the high school jock Stifler, and Eugene Levy as Jim's erudite yet slightly dim father.Although the beginning was great, the end was kind of a disappointment with satisfied. It was very much predictable that they would accomplish their goal yet you were interested in seeing how the story folds. American Pie's characters were high school seniors but they looked passable for college students. Overall after rewatching this film, I can surely agree that it is indeed the best of the series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"One Time, In Band Camp...."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is one of the most beloved comedies of the last decade, seemingly revered by all members of Generations X and Y; the first of a series that supposedly includes no less than three inferior sequels; AND the popularizer (if not the originator) of the term "MILF." It also jump-started the careers of actresses Shannon Elizabeth, Alyson Hannigan, Tara Reid and Mena Suvari. So I thought it was high time that this baby boomer finally caught up with 1999's "American Pie," and you know what...this film really is some funny stuff, and had me--a hard person to make laugh out loud--laughing out loud any number of times. The film's plot, about four soon-to-be-graduating high school guys (Jim, Oz, Kevin and Finch) in pursuit of the Holy Grail (i.e., losing their virginity by the night of the senior prom), may seem like a familiar one, but it is fleshed out with likable and amusing characters and benefits immensely by a brightly clever script. Among the funny scenes are any that include Eugene Levy as Jim's embarrassingly decent, well-meaning father from hell (the scene with the dirty magazines is a riot!); the plight of poor Finch in the ladies' rest room; the initial making of the boys' pact; and, of course, any bit with "the Shermanator," the most hilarious would-be (nerd) Lothario until "Superbad"'s McLovin' came down the pike eight years later. The film has a raunchy exterior and a sweet soul, and ultimately gives its audience the mixed message that sex is always better when it is combined with true love. Especially if one really loves warm apple pie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A new era</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With American Pie a new era of Teen comedies began. In the Porkys tradition (sort of), this revitalized a sub-genre, that seemed derived of new ideas. But the mix of characters, their story (promise/oath to each other) and their embarrassments to achieve said goal(s), a new breed was born.While the showing of flesh (naked body/ies) seemed to be a problem for the censors in America, the movie got a "12" (equivalent to the PG-13 in America) rating in Germany, in it's "unrated" form. Some of the stars seemed to have a bright feature ahead of them, but most of them didn't do anything. The most popular one, although not represented much in the first installment, was Sean William Scott (aka Stiffler). Shannon Elizabeth and Co. kind of "dissapeared" after a while and don't seem to make many movies nowadays.But that doesn't take away the fun that you can have with this movie. So if you're not too prude, just go ahead and watch this. Despite all the sexual gags, this still got a heart</fullReview>

But each student have different experiences with the relationship... they have with their girlfriends or the young woman... they encounter. But none of them... realized that losing their virginity and especially growing up is tough.Directed by Paul Weitz (About a Boy, Down to Earth, In Good Company) made an hilarious coming of age teen comedy about growing up maturely and sex. This was the first film to make sex, just as hip for the young girls instead of the usual horny teen boys. The young cast are especially good but Eugene Levy as one of the boy's father has some of the funnier moments in the film.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an good Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. This DVD is the unrated version. DVD has an hilarious commentary track by the director, screenwriter Adam Herz, actors:Biggs-Kaye Thomas and Seann William Scott. DVD also has behind the scenes featurette, outtakes and more. This was one of the most successful comedies of 1999, it was so popular and well received. There was two successful sequels were produced in 2001 and 2003. "American Pie" is certainly one of the funnier sex comedies since "Porky's" but this movie has an bigger heart and it is more realistic as well. Don't miss it. (****/*****).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first American Pie really set the ground work for the others to follow. Although there are too many to count now and a million different Stiflers you still think back to the first pie movie. It really lead the plot through the sequels and spin-offs. If I ever catch this one on TV I will turn to it right away because it is truly a great teenage sex comedy. The two sequels to follow were not as great as this because it is the piece of pie that sliced it open for the others to follow through. I enjoyed this movie a lot and recommend seeing this before any of the other knock offs or sequels. Jason Biggs really pulls through as the nerdy high school guy that is just trying to get a little action. So if you haven't already seen this then see it sometime soon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"American Pie" stands out despite what it might stand for</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"American Pie" should be better known to the world as "the comedy that launched 1,000 terrible movies." This is the film that slapped a sticker on the genre "Teen Comedy" and convinced movie producers everywhere that the way to attract the overpaying audience of teenagers is to give them movies focused around sex and sex jokes. While "American Pie" certainly deserves that rep, lost in it all is what makes "American Pie" better than all those movies (including those of the same name that followed it). This is a comedy that despite glorifying teenage sex, has an sense of genuineness that anyone who has graduated high school can't deny and that's what makes it stand out.The film follows four friends who make a pact to help each other lose their virginity by prom night. Nice, simple and vulgar. What makes the comedy tick is that these friends are all different and attached to teenage stereotypes. Naturally, they find themselves in situations with women that come into conflict with these stereotypes or make for comedic opposites. This is a character-focused gag comedy. It's not slapstick, but all about gags making you empathize even more with these characters. While it's all very formulaic, it works somehow. You laugh and yet you have some vested interest in what becomes of the characters.Credit to writer Adam Herz for creating such memorable characters, though the actors themselves are half the success. Director Paul Weitz knows when the script is at its strongest and helps get these young actors to make some believable stuff despite their insensitive hijinx. Somehow, he gets a believable performance out of Chris Klein, for example, who plays Oz, the jock who decides to "extend himself." Normally he'd seem like a junky character, but his unlikely relationship with Mena Suvari's character works despite just an OK script.Most importantly, it must be stated that this film kind of operates with the liberal mindset of those who understand teenage sex happens so you might as well make it into something funny. To its credit, the film does address issues of safe sex and being in love and having sex, but that's not to say the film addresses moral issues, because quite frankly, it doesn't hold them with high regard.So as much as I want to hate "American Pie" for all the stereotypes and formula work, there is a lot of strong work being done with this film. It has terrific characters and most importantly a sense of being true to real life--though only the real life of one who accepts teenage sex as part of real life. The fact that Weitz was able to get these great performances out of a bunch of 19 and 20-year-olds is really impressive. So despite all the ridiculous gags and unnecessary jokes and bad movies the followed, "American Pie" really does work on a higher level and deserves to recognized for its contribution to pop culture (The term MILF has transformed the porn industry) and the comedy genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie. It's one of my favorite teen comedies. The weird thing is a lot of young people in my area don't like this movie. They keep comparing it to "Fast Times at Ridgemont High", "Animal House", or "Porky's". Why must it be compared to anything. It's just a funny movie. I mean you'll never hear me say it's better than "Porky's", but it's still good stuff. I should say that most of the people I referred to are mostly kids who just try to go against the crowd anyways. A bunch of emo punks. I'm not going to lie to you, I'd like to take each of them out back and beat em'. Anyways, back to what I was saying, this movie is hilarious. I remember when it came out I said that it would be a future classic. Well we're almost up on the ten year anniversary. I'm gonna go ahead and say it's a comedy classic. It has everything you could want. Sex, outrageous comedy, toilet humor, Eugene Levy, and above all; the one thing that ties it all together... it has heart. It has believable characters that your feel for. This is also the movie that started the whole MILF thing. I mean if that alone doesn't consider it a classic, I don't know what would. It was followed by two theatrical sequels and three straight to video sequels. I know I have been praising it, but it's actually my least favorite of the first three films. I mean it's good, but the other two are better. OK this is starting to drag so I suggest that everyone should watch this because it is funny. That's it.</fullReview>

Really the best character in the movie is Eugene Levy as the kindly dad who's always willing to talk about sex and everything related thereto. I haven't seen any of the sequels, and it seems that most of the unknown cast members haven't done anything of particularly high quality since this movie came out (although Shannon Elizabeth and Jason Biggs both had great roles in "Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"). All in all, this movie is ridiculous, but pretty funny.

		<fullReview>"American Pie" is a film made from a tired recipe of tasteless sex jokes, cliches, and over-the-top attempts to shock, yet titillate the unsuspecting viewer.Teen angst is at the center of this Michigan high school romp, which describes the attempts of how four seniors lose their virginity in a short amount of time.I can plainly see more shortcomings than strengths from this movie (reportedly directed and produced by first-timers Paul and Chris Weitz, and written by the neophyte, Adam Werz).But, I admit that some of the time spent with these fictional characters made me smile, even chortle to boot. The balance for all of the sexual bufoonery comes in two forms: the attempt by the school "jock" to create a meaningful relationship with a female choir singer, and the attempts by Eugene Levy (as the father) to help his son ( played by Jason Biggs ) come to grips with the youth's burgeoning sexuality...literally.In contrast to Sophia Coppola's "The Virgin Suicides", where the teenage struggle for sexual self identity takes on a grim capacity, "American Pie" is a constant barrage of locker-room innuendo, punctuated by zany stunts performed by four believable boys who have anything BUT school on their minds.Though not the funniest film I've seen in this genre, I have to hand it to the Brothers Weitz and Adam Werz for turning out such a piece of pastry for their first try.</fullReview>

I must give credit to the Weitz brothers for an outstanding and convincing job how high school really is."American Pie" might be humorous movie with an okay plot and average performances, but failed to win me over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a VHS rental, it was a strange movie but a good way some of the scenes were weird like to sock on his ???? and trying to hump the pie to see what IT would feel like. If I recall right they all seemed to end up with decent dates. I will have to watch "2" just to see the next one before I watch Am Wedding. but most likely wont see it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>American Pie / ** 1/2 stars.Well, i'll start out with saying that it is one of the better movies of it's genre. It has quite a few laughs throughout the movies running time, but for some reason, watching it over all the way is kind of difficult.I was trying to watch this again the other day thinking back to how funny it was the first time, but some of the scenes were boring and made me want to skip around to my favorite parts. The acting however, was alright in the movie. I was actually kind of impressed with how well the actors portrayed their characters. Hannigan did an excellent job as Michelle Flaherty in this movie, and hopefully she gets to be in a lot more movies in the future.American Pie is about four teenagers who are on a mission to lose their virginity by prom night. But each one has their own way of working their plan out.My thoughts are that you can't watch this movie more than once or twice, and I think the same will go for the sequel because some of the jokes get old and aren't even funny the second go around.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ok, at first i wasn't going to reply to this movie. I felt that there was no reason to. But after seeing negative responses to this movie b/c of its crude nature, I had no other choice. This movie, in my opinion is the best comedy of the 90's. I remember when this movie first came out, I went to see this movie 3 times in the movie theater. I did't even see the Matrix 3 times in the movies. I not only own American Pie 1, but i own American Pie 2 as well. I'm also looking forward to American Wedding. Anyways, back to the matter at hand. This movie is CRUDE. This movie is STEREOTYPICAL. This movie has NO PLOT. However, this movie is not necessarily AMERICAN. it should just be called "PIE". in fact, the original name of this movie didnt even have AMERICAN in it. if you can not relate to this movie, you must have some genetic defect. american or not, this movie relates to every growing teenager thinking about sex. it has its crude humor and i love it. i love crude humor. i love howard stern mornings and i love porkys. i like when people eff up and i love when laughter is pointed at others. call it sadistic, but i think alot of you people need to lighten up. this movie is a light hearted comedy and if you can't find an ounce of humor out of it, i'd hate to even know you.IF YOU FOUND PORKY'S FUNNY...RENT THIS! WAIT...BUY THIS! GOOD DAY TO YOU!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Raunchy, Funny, with Apples.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What do you get when you combine a teenage boy's sexual fantasies with a double dose of gross humor and some heartfelt romance?In short, you get American Pie- a funny, raunchy comedy that pulls absolutely no punches in its quest to dominate the teen-movie field. It follows the juvenile yet valid quest of four teenage boys who have made a "pact" to get laid... and their various misadventures. The characters are well developed indeed; Kevin, a sexually frustrated young man who's "stranded at third" with his girlfriend Vicky. Oz, a socially hopeless lacrosse player who joins choir. Jim, a sexually confused teenager whose sexual misadventures are absolutely hilarious. And finally, Finch, a philosophical weirdo with some serious social issues.Helping the storyline along are Stifler (performed excellently by Seann W. Scott, the keg-throwin sex beast; Vicky, Kevin's girlfriend and fellow sexually inexperienced young teen; Jessica, Vicky's friend and sexual advisor; and Jim's dad (performed without flaw by Eugene Levy), who tries to help the confused Jim with his, er... personal issues.****SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS**** This next paragraph contains several, you were warned!!!!The entire plotline revolves around the four boys' sexual desires and hopelessness... Kevin seems to have it made already, as he and Vicky have oral sex twice during the duration of the movie. The other four, however, seem to be stuck in the mud. Humor abounds (raunchy I might add, such as Stifler injesting some "pale ale" (watch the movie for details). And of course Jim, who is the most confused of them all, somehow manages to get the beautiful Nadia, a foreign exchange student, into his room to change clothing. Of course, with the help of the internet, the whole school gets a view of Jim's extremely botched near-sexual encounter with Nadia. Says actor Jason Biggs (who portrayed Jim), "I loved doing all those scenes. I just figured the stupider I looked and felt and the more embarrassed I was, the funnier it would be."We wholeheartedly agree.This is NOT, I REPEAT NOT, a movie for the faint of heart or those without open minds. You should probably put the younger kids to bed before you watch this one, as it is quite inappropriate in several places (such as the ****SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER**** bare-breasted scenes of Nadia). I give this one a 9 out of 10, as some of the scenes were just a little too slow-moving for me to stomach. However, it comes through as one of the funniest movies ever made, and a storyline worth remembering!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>AMerican Pie is a hilarious teen genre movie that you have to see.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Besides `South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut' and `Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me, `American Pie' has been identified as one of the most highly anticipated films of the post- summer movie-going season. `American Pie' is a teenage sex comedy, following the sexual misadventures of some well-scrubbed high-schoolers. This movie focuses on the story of four high school virgins who are more than determined to have sex before graduating from high school. Jim one of the main characters in the movie is a clumsy guy who seems to be able to mess up every opportunity to hook up with a lady. Along with this he has been caught by his father in embarrassing situations throughout the film. His best friends also are trying to score with the ladies but seem to be back at base one as well. Unlike clam, sweet, teen comedies such as: `She's All That' and `Never Been Kissed,' `American Pie' stays away from the clean cut look right from the opening scene in which Jim gets caught in one of those embarrassing moments by his father. With a number of gross-out comedic sequences and Jim's father Frank discussing the how's and what's of sex, this film appeals to one of the comedies of last summer, `There's Something About Mary' and over takes it with the `apple pie scene,' the `beer scene,' and the extra activities of a school band geek who gets up close and personal with her flute. Since the beginning of this year, `American Pie' has been hyped as the next big thing, a film that would ever change the teen comedy genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** Starring Jason Biggs, Chris Klein, Thomas Ian Nicholas, Shannon Elizabeth, Alyson Hannigan, Tara Reid, Eddie Kaye Thomas, Seann William Scott, Mena Suvari, Jennifer Coolidge, Chris Owen, and Eugene Levy as Jim's Dad.The story is about four friends, Jim, Oz, Kevin, and Finch, who are seniors and about to go to college. When they find out that their geeky classmate, Sherman, has sex at one of Stifler's parties, they make a pact by sticking together and planning to lose their viginity on prom night. Jim and Kevin are your average teenagers, while Oz, whose real name is Chris Ostreicher, is a sports jock who joins the school choir. Finch, is more like the character who stands out. Jim's dad talks about sexual situations the most in Jim's life during this movie. He brings sexual magazines and talks to Jim about masturbation. And in which, it makes Jim very uncomfortable.Then Jim comes up with an idea of posting his web cam to Kevin, Finch, and Stifler of a foreign girl coming to his house and "changing her clothes". Unfortuntely, Jim's plan backfires when he accidently mails it to every one in the school. Everyone is amused to see Nadia nude on the screen, but when they see that Jim blows his chance, they think he is a total loser. Kevin's girlfriend, Vicky, wants to have sex with Kevin, and gets advice from her friend Jessica, who has already done it. The girls start to fall for Finch now, and Stifler, after having his girlfrind dump him, embaresses him in front of the whole school with a "bathroom incident". Watch the movie to find out the rest.Kevin and Oz seem to have good relationships, while Jim and Finch, seem to be going nowhere in a relationship, although Jim had a chance, but blew it. Kevin is on a "third-base" relationship with Vicky, and Oz is just getting to know Heather.There is a bunch of sick humor in the movie, but there is also some normal, comical humor in the movie. It was funny to see Seann William Scott in the movie. He and Finch were problably my favorite characters, and the co-incidence is, that both are against each other in the movie. And in which Finch falls for Stifler's mom."American Pie" is better than your average teen sex Comedy, and surpasses "Porky's" by a mile. "American Pie" is an above average Comedy, filled with humor. But your younger brother/kids to bed before you watch this.3 out of 4. My IMDB Rating: 7.7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The 'Scream' of Teen Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1997, a little horror film called 'Scream' came along and blewour minds away with it's great writing and twists and turns. Itbreathed life into the fledgling (read: bad) horror genre, mademoney and became something of a cult classic. So, that's onegenre ticked up a notch, let's name another failed genre: The teenmovie. The 80's were the hey day for the T&amp;A flicks. You had theexcellent 'Porky's' and the absolutely classic 'National Lampoon'sAnimal House' and add to that more quieter down to earth yet stillraunchy John Hughes teen flicks like 'Sixteen Candles' or 'WeirdScience'. When anyone mentions film in the 80's, it is always theteen flicks that stand out amongst the bunch but, alas, they havefailed us in more recent years so in 1999, a film came along madeby the unknown Weitz Brothers (who would go on to make 'About aBoy') with a script by Adam Herz that would breath life into the teengenre much like 'Scream' with the horror genre. Sadly, though,'American Pie' pales when compared to such a classic like'Porky's' and, ultimately, 'American Pie' is a good script that workedwell on paper but gets kind of boring on screen. MInd you, JasonBiggs and Sean William Scott were actually impressive andcomedy genuis Eugene Levy gave his is best performance that hetopped with 'Serendipity' in 2001. 'American Pie' isn't really a badmovie, it's just that it stretches too far just to get to one meagrejoke about any form of sex imaginable. Of course, it has some realgood laughs in it and is worth at least one viewing in your lifetime.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A must see. This has to be on of the funniest movies I have ever seen. Of course, it is a carbon copy of Porky's, but nonetheless, it was still hilarious. It just mainly deals with teenage boys and their "quest" for sex. That is all it is, and all it was ever billed to be. And it goes over great. I admit, I was not too excited about renting this, but now I am glad that I did. If you don't like raunchy stories about teenagers, and if you didn't like Porky's or Fast Times at Ridgemont High, don't rent it. Otherwise, if you had half a life in high school, and remember the things that you got in to, rent it and laugh your *ss off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good film -- more than meets the eye</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Crude, rude, crass, sophomoric and predictable at times, American Pie is carefully crafted to appeal to a range of audiences. But whatever you can say about it, for me the whole thing works!I do not think you can view this movie as simply the exposition of late 20th century mores viewed through the lens of the average hormonally driven American male. Rather it is at once and the same time an exposition about expectation. The expectation of the time after high school, of relationships, of new found physicality, of intimate expression, of going forward into the future.Herz and Weitz craftily use the testosterone enriched environment of high school as the vehicle on which to carry this theme. While many characters in literature and cinema have embarked on their own search for truth, American Pie is more about the embarkation upon the journey than the journey itself.The theme is repeated over and over again, and subtly (as distinct from the crassness of much of the movie) reinforced through out the film. The journey is presented in the choices of colleges, the coach's speech at the lacrosse game, the `bus' to the prom night party and the duet sung by Heather and Chris. It is expressed most poignantly by the characters of Vicky and Kevin when they recognize that while they have each consummated there love their futures will lead them to something different than they had envisioned just hours before.The late teen years are perhaps the only moment in time when the future potential of each of us is present in such abundance and so readily convertible into present achievement.If you are young (a late teen) and you watch this movie consider how this movie presents a modern parable to you about all the future potential you have before you and how this moment is a but a temporary gift, to be used and enjoyed before it becomes the prevailing present.If you are older, allow the magic of celluloid and the fine craft of the writer, director and actors to transport you back to a time when the future beckoned and each experience was as new as that spring day on which this movie begins.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Teen Movie That Works (Spoilers Included)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I usually hate teen movies, the only series that I think has the ability to stand above the whole lot of them would be the American Pie series (that being American Pie &amp; AP 2).What worked for the first release was the colorful characters, who at the time of this release were pretty much unknown. While there was a lot of crude humor, high school itself for most people was probably the time in their lives where they were at their crudest levels. Basically, the message of the film boils down to a teenager's view on sex (especially from the perspectives of 4 male virgins).The humor of American Pie depends almost solely on the presence of Steve Stifler, who was played brilliantly by Seann William Scott. He plays the sexually active, egotistical jock that was worshipped by his friends, and while loathed by the band geeks and computer nerds, everybody really wants to be like him. This character DEFINED Scott's career, and it is a character which he is truly a master of.Now, about the virgin teenager male's perception of sex. What's great about this film is the presentation of the humor and seriousness about losing one's virginity. On one side, we see the semi-nerd Jim have a laughable encounter with the band geek, as well as Finch pulling of a Graduate-esque romp with Stifler's mother. On the other, more serious side, we see Kevin wind up doing something with his girlfriend which he ultimately winds up regretting in the morning; and Chris, the love-struck jock/choir boy who actually gets this sex thing right.Ultimately, this is a great coming of age film that does a great job showing us that while sex can be fun and really enjoyable, there are serious aspects that need to be addressed as well. And honestly, who doesn't remember themselves or other people doing the stuff in this film when they were in high school?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked this. I put off seeing it for years because i assumed (naughty me) that it would be like Animal House or Porkeys. That is... i assumed it would have nothing but contempt for women. Shows you how much i know.American Pie is more like Diner than Porkeys or Animals House. As in Diner, the boys in American Pie gotta grow up and go beyond boy friendship to get what their hearts truely desire. Do you remember the story about the Princess and the Glass Mountain? The knight has to figure out how to go up a glass mountain to win the Princess's heart.Hey.... it's an old story and as valid today as ever it was.All the actors are charming. Eugene Levy is genuinly touching as a dad who tries to steer his son towards wholesome happiness. I did wonder where mom was....but that's okay... this is a BOY coming of age story and like i say at the top... They are evolving. It actually seems to be okay to like girls.

		<shortDescription>Sex Comedy With Heart - An Oxymoron?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since "There's Something About Mary," sex comedies are all the rage in Hollywood, so predictably, studios churn out a lot of forgettable, too-raunchy-for-its-own-good fare like "Tomcats," or "Slackers." Thankfully, there is an exception to the rule, and that is this film.Don't get me wrong, this is one of the most raucous movies ever made. From the opening scene (that demonstrates a new and innovative use for a tube sock) to the satisfying finale (that demonstrates a new and innovative use for a flute) sexual innuendo is crammed into almost every scene. So, what sets this movie apart from all the rest? The characters. Almost every character in the movie is instantly endearing and memorable. Besting them all is Eugene Levy, who shows off the full range of his comedic timing as Jim's good-intentions fueled Dad.American Pie managed to do two things that very few sex comedies can. Create an interesting and funny premise, and, even more shockingly, deliver a sequel that was even better than the original. On it's way to becoming a classic of Animal House proportions, American Pie serves up equal dishes of hormones and heart. I came for the raunch, but I stayed for the characters. And the pie.(***/****)</fullReview>

I loved every single second of this movie, the script and directing is well done and all of the main and minor actors play their role well including Shannon Elizabeth, Seann William Scott, and of course Jason Biggs. But the one thing that makes the movie completely enjoyable is the gross out humor and sexual exploitations, all of which are done very well (which is rare).

Much of the movie is getting caught in embarrassing situations in which many of us had experienced but never caught, where those what ifs were always in the back of our minds. The movie also had its tender moments unlike the typical sex starved teen movies, with the aspect of love, the right person, waiting for the right time themes thrown in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is, undoubtedly, one of the funniest movies I've seen in a while, (barring 'American Pie 2' and 'Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back'), though, if I may suggest, if you're going to buy it, you MUST ABSOLUTELY get the unrated version of this and its sequel, because in lowering it to R rating, they take out some of the greatest scenes and jokes in the movies. Just my humble opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>funny, but......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is really funny in some scenes (Jim's dad sex talks, Nadia, Stifler etc.) and me and my friends really liked it when it first came out in 10th grade, but now I see a lot of flaws in the portrayal, message, and theme of this movie.This is really just an average white-suburbia, spoiled kid, focus-the-plot on sex movie. And being from white suburbia, I know this better than anyone. the lives of these teenagers is pretty much like stuf I saw in my high school experience. Kids worrying about how good they look every day, how hot so and so looks today, or i cant wait for the party on saturday attitude. This movie succeeds at portraying the life of suburbia. suburb kids have it so easy, the only thing they have to worry about is having sex and looking good. Beleive me...I know! The movie KIDS does a really good job of showing the opposite...the dangerous and unsafe lives that city kids go through today, a life much different than suburbia.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I usually avoid high school sex comedies. They're usually very pretentious, obnoxious, and bare little resemblance to reality. I finally saw this much talked about movie, and it is pretty much what I expected. I couldn't beleive that in the documentary on the DVD, the cast members were saying the movie was just like high school. I don't know what school they went to, but it seems to me most people in high school are angst ridden and depressed. The surprising thing for me was how unfunny the movie was. There was a couple of amusing moments, most notably from Eugene Levy and Willow (Band Camp girl.) Only once, just once, did I laugh out loud.And that was when the guy watching the streaming video said "Go trig boy, it's your birthday". That's funny. Totally silly. Probably wasn't even in the script, just improvised.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps we're taking this movie a bit too seriously?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was shocked to read all the negative feedback on this movie. I mean, I can understand that it's formulaic, been done 100 times, etc. All that I understand. But that's for the critics to discuss. I don't care about that. What I want to know is how someone can watch this movie and look me in the eye and honestly say it wasn't funny. This movie isn't groundbreaking, it's not eye-opening, and it's not supposed to be. It's funny, and in many cases extremely funny, and it appears obvious to me that much of the high-brow disdain for this movie comes from people who can't or choose not to relate to the situations that occur in American Pie. While I realize that most of these situations are to the extreme, the fact remains that all teenagers have gone through embarrassing moments similar to the ones shown in American Pie, and to not be able to laugh about it means you might be taking yourself, or perhaps the intent of the movie, far too seriously. Beyond the obvious comedic value of the film (and the scenes are too numerous to mention), there really is a message here. It appears at first glance that there's nothing going on except crude humor, etc, but in reality, by the end of the film, the entire cast has learned something about themselves, sex, and the relative importance of sex in their every day life. I think Oz is the best example of a lesson learned in this film. In the end, after all his posturing and grandstanding, he tells his friends that nothing happened on prom night, when something obviously did. Each character learned a little something about themselves and how they fit in to society. I don't know, maybe I'm way off here, but the criticism I've read on this site about American Pie seems way off base to me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wildly over-the-top, boldly honest, laugh-out loud funny teen comedy centers around four hormonally charged high school guys who make a desperate pact to lose their virginity by the night of their senior prom. Their antics to win the bet soon get out of control as they all must learn the hard way how to wine and dine their prospective female companions. The film is sure to please because of its gross-out gags which, while a bit extreme, are genuinely funny and convincing portrayals of teenage sexuality. The comedy cleverly avoids turning mean-spirited despite the sometimes raunchy subject matter, and there are plenty of likable, memorable characters and situations. An ideal, good-natured teen comedy. ***</fullReview>

		<fullReview>American Pie is a film that certain people would look at the film's cover and thing it is not worth to see, well, you're wrong. It has many laughs and some jokes where you have to pay attention to understand. The film opens with Jason Biggs (Jim) trying to masturbate (with a tube sock over his privates) while watching scrambled porn. His mother walks in to put clothes away and say good night. She personally thinks he's trying to watch illegal channels so Jim's Dad (that is what they have him listed as in the credits) comes in and says it is only coming in bad until he here' the man screaming "Smack my hairy a-- b----." He immediately rips the pillow off of his son's lap to find a tube sock over his privates. There are a couple more sick jokes in there like when Jim's date for the prom says to him to get his attention "At band camp I once stuck my flute up my p-----." He freaks out and she then says "Don't you think I know how to turn myself off. Now I'm getting antsy. Want to screw?" And a joke about semen in a beer and someone else drinking it. Also the Internet broadcast of a foreign exchange student in his room topless and masturbating. In a unique way it has something for everyone!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>American Pie is funny but it also manages to be sweet, sort of. Well it's mostly crude humor in a story about four guys who creat a pact to get laid before high school is over. I laughed out loud a few times and there was a number of smaller laughs. The pie scene is a classic scene in my mind. It also is in the line of movies like There's Something About Mary (though not quite as funny as that movie) that go for both shock value and comedy and work well. I give it a 7 out of 10.

		<shortDescription>Sex at any cost.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In writing this bawdy comedy about four friends who will do anything to lose their virginity before going to college, screenwriter Adam Herz set out to overturn the conventions concerning films about adolescents. This is why the script he submitted to the film production studios in 1998 was entitled "A sex comedy for teenagers which could be made for less than 10 million dollars, which most readers are no doubt going to hate but which you will adore". After many rejections, the script won some admirers at Universal Studios. There, it was firmly believed in, but no one was going to take the gamble of casting star names. The actors would be unknown, the director likewise. Chris Weitz, one of the producers, convinced his brother Paul to make his debut as a film director with this film, renamed "American Pie". Paul and Chris co-authored the script de "Antz". Having a controversial sense of humour, they knew that the film they were going to make would create a few sparks. And that is what happened. First with the censor, who banned the film for under non-accompanied 17 year olds, and then with the public, who raced to the cinema, howled with laughter and made this small summer film into one of the blockbusters of the year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this was a very funny movie. Not an uproaring laugh-a-lot movie, but still quite humorous from time to time. Sean William Scott has got to be the best young actor out there today. He's so funny and quirky, and seems to be a natural at this college-party animal character. Jason Biggs is good as an unconfident Jim who falls in on the bet with his friends to lose their virginity before high school's out. All I need to do here is say Shannon Elizabeth and everyone knows what I'm thinking. Chris Klein was also an exceptional actor, playing the sweet sensitive Oz quite effectively. And Jim's dad, Eugene Levy, is yet another reason us Canadians are some of the best comedy actors in the business- we're a little wierd and off the wall, but still funny in that shocking, embarassing sort of way. Thomas Ian Nicholas and Tara Reid co-exist quite well, playing the confused couple who wants to please each other. I mean, some of the dialogue may be stupid, but it really fits the story and keeps this witty piece of our time rolling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crude but sweet sex comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't all that crazy about "American Pie" the first time I saw it. I missed it when it played in theaters and when I caught it on home video, it was funny, but not as funny as I thought it would be. However I watched the movie a couple of more times and it started growing on me. It got better and better with each viewing. "American Pie" is a movie that most people (including myself) can relate too. It's about four high school boys who make a pact: lose their virginity by senior prom. This movie was the "There's Something About Mary" of 1999 with it's disgusting jokes and crude humor, but "American Pie" is a much better film than that 1998 Cameron Diaz box office smash. Plus, in spite of it's lowbrow comedy, it has a heart. Eugene Levy (of SCTV) was the only familiar face in the cast when this first came out. The entire cast of young actors were basically unknowns, but gained popularity since the film went on to be a sleeper hit. Jason Biggs, Chris Klein, Thomas Ian Nicholas, and Eddie Kaye Thomas play the four buddies who make that pact; Shannon Elizabeth, Alyson Hannigan, Natasha Lyonne, Tara Reid, and Mena Suvari play the girls in their lives; and Seann William Scott steals the show as Stifler, the one who knows everything about sex. But all the actors are good here. Plus, there are some big laughs throughout. The part of "American Pie" that I liked best was the generally sweet relationship between Chris Klein and Mena Suvari. I'd follow them two anywhere. "American Pie" isn't the best comedy ever made, but it's a very good one. But the thing that surprised me the most, the sequel would turn out to be even funnier.*** (out of four)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Raunchy, original teenage sex comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>AMERICAN PIE (1999) Rating: 8/10I like this film a lot and I don't care who knows it. It is funny, romantic, dramatic, truthful, funny and did I mention it's really, really funny. However, I was disappointed by the Un-rated version. It didn't have much changed from the old movie, maybe a little bit more explicit, but please! They could've at least made it sound as good as the cover promised. Don't worry too much though, it improves on the first movie's sexual details, and you'll still find the film as enjoyable and as rewatchable. Now, back to the film. The star-studded cast all do fantastically, bringing their characters' sexually desperate, teen angst feelings blazingly alive. Most are newcomers who have had small roles ? Tara Reid in Urban Legend or Chris Owen in October Sky ? but they are all promising roles as good as this one in the near future. The script is repeatedly clever with its hilarity and although drink will be coming out your nose, for the most light-hearted people, tears may be coming out of your eyes. All in all, this is a ? I'll repeat it again just so you understand fully ? REALLY funny film that won't appeal to everyone, but for all viewers who are looking for some raunchy fun, don't miss American Pie! It is well worth the time and money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another plane movie. "American Pie" was R(A) in Singapore (21 and over to enter). I was 14 when I saw this (I'm 15 now, and I'm sure that required so much Maths skills). With my mom beside me. She was, of course, mortified that I was laughing at some of the scenes, but oh well.Okay. "American Pie" is a funny movie, no doubt. I think it's rather hilarious, and um, Jason Biggs is funny, but if you ask me to describe the plot, I'm not sure if I can do that. Because 1) I can't remember half the movie and 2) there isn't a plot. "American Pie" is just a comedy with lots of sex. That's all there is to it. It requires no thinking skills, or even any apprehending skills. Perfect in-flight movie, considering the other junk they showed (like oh, "Sweet November"), and perfect cure for boredom. The funniest scene is the Jim (Jason Biggs' character, I'm not sure of his name) and the Pie scene; absolutely had me in fits. And Jim's dad is hilarious as well. Alyson Hanningan is SO irritating. Can she just stop doing the nerd roles, because quite honestly, I can't tell the difference between Alyson in "American Pie" and Alyson in, say, "Dead Man on Campus", or even "Buffy". Besides all of that, I cannot remember anything else.Definitely one of the better "teen movies" (funny that it was rated R(A), as I don't consider people over 21 "teens"), but not one of the more memorable movies released that year, whatever year it was. Or maybe it's just me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>American Pie is one of my favorite movies every, that is why I am so amazed when I read all the reviews here. I first saw this movie about a year ago, and have seen it about 10 times over again. The thing that spoke to me most was the excellent casting of all the actors and their interaction. They really looked like good friends who grew up together, and whole picture of them working their way through the end of High School was so familiar to me. I felt with those guys, and could image myself in the same spot. Added to that is a healthy dose of good humour (in its genre), making it a movie that amuses me over and over again.And please, do not say that you're grossed out by it, that's about the same as saying that you went to see Nightmare on Elm Street and got scared. This movie is MENT to gross people out, probably especially Americans, for whom sex is still a big taboo. I wasn't grossed out by a masturbation scene, of course not, the only thing one could see even were some boobs, and I've seen those before. The pie scene was, in my opinion, just funny because of its oddness, and because of the great acting of Jason Biggs and Eugene Levy.Yep, this is certainly one of my favorites, I can watch this thing over and over again, and still be amused.

		<fullReview>In American Pie, the frat-boy, gross-out humor gets laughs, but not because of any especially clever writing. It gets our attention by saying things we've seldom heard on screen before. They had to outdo THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY, right? One movie's hair gel puts head on another movie's beer. It's PORKY'S for the new millennium. The simple story has four high school friends with hormones raging, obsessing about sex. How to lose one's virginity before prom night, only two weeks away? Get busy, guys.Jim, who has been interrupted by his father while putting a tube sock to new use, has few romantic prospects. Kevin seems to be better positioned as he already has a girlfriend, albeit one who's keeping her thighs wide shut. Oz is a handsome lacrosse player who decides that being sensitive will help him make the score. Finch is so uptight that he must go home to go to the bathroom, but gets the help of a co-ed in spreading rumors of his generous endowment. Will they or won't they? Therein lies the obvious rub. The girls in PIE are given more dimension than the standard for juvenile sex comedies, which is some sort of progress. The fresh cast is quite agreeable, especially Shawnn William Scott as Stiffler and Natasha Lyonne from THE SLUMS OF BEVERLY HILLS. Eugene Levy performs a marvelously deadpan cameo as Jim's clueless father. Remember to keep your eyes on the flute.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a fine piece of movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"American Pie" is a film that has been taken at face value by most of its target audience. To many, it is simply a film about four friends trying to get laid before they graduate high school and go on to bigger and better things (well, maybe, let's see the sequel). But I believe that the writers and the concievers had something else in mind. If they wanted to do another sex comedy, they could have done a remake of "Losin' It" or "Porky's" or something else from the '80s. Instead, they found a way to incorporate those entertaining tactics into a film with a finely developed coming-of-age message. The sex part is really just to keep the viewer watching. I'm pretty sure that I'm right because 90% of the people I have talked to that are part of a face-value generation have said that "there's something there" and that it "has a message". "American Pie" could be called an organized sex comedy. But I think it's an organized drama. The ending was a fine one--something that I could relate to as I am saying goodbye to my friends in High School and heading onto bigger and better things. Yep, I guess I'm starting the second film of my life, and maybe we all will understand the message of "American Pie" when we finish it. Anyway, highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny, sick and plenty of eye candy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As far as teen comedies go, this takes the genre to a whole new level. It's filled with crude scenarios and toilet humor, and succedes in producing a generaly funny movie."American Pie" focuses itself around the life and troubles of a bunch of sexualy frustrated teenagers in high school. Obviously they are all virgins, which leads to the group making a pact, pledging to prove their manhood on the senior prom night. The majority of the movie is kind of an anti-climax, so for the duration we see the guys making preperations and attempting to get their dates.Funny, sick and plenty of eye candy. This movie is one I will never grow tired of.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amusing and hilarious teen sex comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On a scale of 0 to 100; I gave American Pie a score of 77.Before watching American Pie you must be warned: your sides will hurt from laughing too much, and this laughter will come from mostly crude and rude jokes that come with endlessly imaginative actions and fantastic one-liners. And after watching it you also must be warned: you will never, ever, ever under any circumstances eat apple pie again, so make sure you have a slice before you watch this laugh-a-minute teen comedy.At a high-school party, four friends Jim (Jason Biggs), Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas), Finch (Eddie Kay Thomas), and Oz (Chris Klein) find that losing their collective virginity isn't as easy as they had thought. But they still believe that they need to do so before college. To motivate themselves, they enter a pact to try to be the first to "score." And of course, the senior prom is their last best chance. As the fateful date draws near, the boys wonder who among them will get lucky. More importantly, do they really want to do it at all?To get the flaws over and done with; Natasha Lyonne is underused, and it is a shame because she is by far the most interesting character in the movie, she has some great quotable parts in the script (`It's not space shuttle launch, it's sex'; `I like to keep my options open') and hopefully, in the up-coming sequel, she'll get more time on-screen. There is also a largely unfunny toilet ?gag' with the character of Finch, the scene totally steals from Dumb &amp; Dumber, and crapping scenes have been done much funnier and much better. Okay, back to the good stuff, the cast is fantastic, Biggs is a great find (unfortunately he kind of ruined his career with some dumb comedies after he invested the part of Jim), Klein is sensitive and believably hip, while the chick-a-dee's like Mena Suvari, Tara Reid and ultimately Buffy's Alyson Hannigan, who manages to steal the entire film with only one line. This is one blast of a fun movie, I can guarantee you'll be chuckling and smiling a long time after watching it.If not perfect, American Pie is easily the best teen sex comedy of 1999. Highly recommended any time, any day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Guaranteed to revive memories for male audiences.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A light-hearted romp among a group of American High School students who make a pact to get laid within the next three weeks. Despite their bravado the boys are naive and inexperienced in matters of sexual behaviour. This makes for some hilarious situations in their first approach to the opposite sex. Taken in the spirit of fun, the risque bedroom scenes are acceptable in context though some might find them rather offensive. The teenage boys are so infatuated with salacious sex one wonders if their brains have relocated between their legs, It's a real situational farce with characters being caught in compromising positions. For me there were quite a few memorable scenes. For example: the father/son discussion about women's bodies as illustrated in the centre folds; the girl who discards her clothing in a bedroom which has been set up with a computer and digital camera and the whole stripping and masturbation sequence broadcast on the internet; the wolf whistles from the students next morning; the young guy giving a girl a taste of foreplay while he considers his next move in consultation with an illustrated sex folder; an irrestible urge to masturbate in a hole in his favourite fruit pie baked by his mother.... It goes on and on through a series of sexual activities that are accomplished with such naivete and awkwardness, it can't help but raise a few chuckles. The scriptwriter has cleverly captured some of the frustrations of growing up in the turbulent teenage years. The film goes at a good pace as the scenes bubble along one sfter another and the film is about the right length too. Any longer, it would tend to become repetitive. The singing group adds variety to the film and the background music used to accent the comedy in some of the scenes is a brilliant and original idea.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>American Pie is my number 21 movie. The first time I saw it I did not like it that much, I just found it was quite amusing. But the second time I could almost not stopped laughing, because I noticed all those jokes that are in there. And there are many of them. I almost have to like this movie, since I am a 17 years old guy, and I love it. It maybe is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen, featuring one of my favorite characters : Jim played hilariously by Jason Biggs. I heard that there will a second American Pie. I am really looking forward to it, and I hope it won't be less funny.Good points : Jason Biggs, many different characters, the girls, story, hope for a sequel, comedy, beginning, ending, soundtrack, score, ideas, screenplay,Bad points : sometimes to emotional, I thinkAll in all, I rate American Pie 9.5/10 and recommend it to comedy fans. It is one of the greatest that there is. See it!!! CU; Rinho.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Teen movies come and go... but this won't be forgotten! This brassy film is in a league of it's own and the only other movie that could compare to the gross-ness in a teen film, would be 'Cruel Intentions' - and that has two girls kissing, and two guys having sex...The story is about 4 high-school seniors (among those are 'Loser' star Jason 'Pie-guy' Biggs, child-star Thomas Ian Nicholas and Chris Klein from 'Here On Earth') who bet eachother that they will have sex before the end of school.Main guy Jim (Biggs) lusts over hot exchange student Nadia ('Scary Movie's Shannon Elizabeth), and even strips for him... another, Kevin, (Nicholas) tries to further his relationship with long-time girlfriend Vicki (Tara Reid, star of 'Urban Legend'), while Oz, (Klein) joins the chior in hopes of getting closer to Heather, (Mena Suvari who worked with fellow 'Pie' star Jason Biggs in 'Loser').Alyson Hannigan, from 'Buffy The Vampire Slayer' stars here, as one of the films most memorable characters, Michelle ("there was this one time, at band camp...") - a loser who plays the flute. Natasha Lyonne ('The Slums Of Beverly Hills) is also among the teen cast, as is Seann W. Scott (from 'Road Trip).This film boldy goes where no other film has gone (and I'm not talking about the pie!) and it's hilarious nature, makes this movie a must-see for anyone over the age of 13!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Allow me to review Mena Suvari's second "American" 99 movie. While not as dramatic, well written, acted, or even thought out as Beauty, Pie has an endearing charm that I cannot deny. An obvious throwback to the days of Sixteen candles and Pretty in Pink, Pie does things that Hughes would never take. and do you know why he wouldn't take them. because they are crude and disgusting. Sort of funny, but really crude and disgusting. There are better movies in the genre out there (there's something about Mary immediately springs to mind), but if your home on a Saturday afternoon with cable, give it a go.

		<fullReview>Another easy Hollywood "we know where the money is" plot formula, marketing heavily at those discretionary incomes. Four comely lads looking to lose their virginity, as they're tired of just being comely. Yes, as I recall in high school, it was always the good looking dudes that had the toughest time scoring... Okay, now that we understand the movie isn't exactly grounded in reality, it is actually pretty funny in quite a few spots. Yes, the humor tends towards the raunchy, and one won't need a discussion group after, yet the performances are rather endearing and earnest. This helps AMERICAN PIE considerably, and keeps it on track towards its audience. Light fare worth a look.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When American Pie first came out here in Australia, I thought that it would be just another lame teen film. So I dismissed it. But after much urging from my girlfriend I finally went to see it and was pleasantly surprised. This was such an enjoyable and fun movie to watch and i can't wait for the sequel. But i'm still baffled as to why most people say that this film is too risqee. I mean sure it was nudity and adult themes, but so what!!!. Let's just cast our thoughts back to one of the last scenes of the movie where there is a sign congratulating the seniors on graduating. The sign says congratulations seniors, I think we all know what that was actually refering to though, don't we?. lol</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suburban Anthropology</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!" Get it at Amazon.)This is a cute, even sweet, coming of ager with an attractive cast. But be warned, if sex offends you, you will be offended. It is also more than a little on the juvenile side, especially the first half or so. I can't even discuss the subject matter on Amazon.com, which is just as well. And you DON'T EVEN want to know why it is called "American Pie." Suffice it to say that if you're past your early twenties much of this will seem lame and adolescent. If you're younger, you may just crack up over all the crude, but sometimes sharply observed humor.Thus the question: why did I watch it? Easy: Mena Suvari. The beauty of American Beauty is here a drama dweeb--or is that a drama geek? Actually she sings in a jazz class, which I suppose is close to the same thing. At any rate, she is not a cheer leader nor the queen of the hop, just a pretty girl with values. She is excellent. Also good in a supporting role is Alyson Hannigan (from TV's Buffy) as a nerd girl who surprises with what she learned at band camp. Eddie Kaye Thomas as the boy (Paul Finch) who learns that women only get better with age is just perfect. However, I think Jason Biggs was a little lamer than was absolutely necessary. Sean William Scott was true to his part as your classic neanderthal jock.Funniest line, from Biggs, after finding Michelle gone in the morning: "I was used--Cool!"Another reason for watching this film is that one does get some, no doubt twisted, idea of what passes for adolescent sexual preoccupation these days and can compare such notions to an earlier era. Call it suburban anthropology.As I was watching Mena Suvari I got to thinking about the appeal of her very captivating face. Like fashion models and other stars with child-like faces, we adore her. Why? Call it neoteny. This led to a further thought. In the future, as we continue to look more and more like our children, some day we and our children will look the same. (Perhaps this could be a good idea for a science fiction story.) Some say the appeal of imagined aliens is that they have child-like features (think of the big round heads and the big eyes). But really they are unconscious caricatures of ourselves and the values that we most esteem, brains and photogenic eyes.Anyway, American Pie is kind of sweet if you are not offended by vivid depictions of adolescent sexuality or crude bathroom humor. And there is more sophistication to the relationships than might be supposed at first blush. It ends at the prom, as all good American coming of age flicks should. The boys grow up and begin to learn the difference between love and sex, and the girls find they no longer have to teach the boys how to kiss. This is an American Graffiti for the new millennium.</fullReview>

The image of Jim doing something really nasty with a pie was extremely gross. I kept thinking, "God, kid, are you crazy or just plain stupid??" The whole point of this flick is how a group of teens would do and how in order to lose their virginity. But for the most part, it's really exaggerated, like aversion of "Kids" written by the creators of "Saturday Night Live."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit that while this comedy is adolescent and raunchy, I loved it and saw it several times. Then I bought the DVD and listened to the commentaries. If a teen sex comedy can be a classic, this is it. The outrageousness is done so offhandedly that you just have to laugh.The talented young cast does a delightful job with the material, making this the third part of a truly strange trilogy that also includes the weird AMERICAN PSYCHO and odd AMERICAN BEAUTY. The three films together pretty much define America at the turn of the 21st Century -- heaven help us!The film is as American as the apple pie which is raped so blatantly. Pity the poor pie -- and then laugh yourself silly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect choose of characters! Everybody in the right place!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just figured it out that everybody was chosen very carefully after watching the movie for the 2nd time. Every character was appearing right in time and in the correct place. In addition, the movie is telling the truth of life in a fantastic voice. It's really a masterpiece in my idea. It takes you back to the world we all lived in for some years. "Guys! The big dance AND graduation are coming up and we still HAVE TO get laid." Jim (Jason Biggs) is a bright but socially inept guy whose despair at being a virgin only increases his foolishness. He gets little help from his dad (Eugene Levy); his ideas of sex lectures are to thumb through a copy of Hustler magazine with his son. When Jim's using his webcam, the movies reaches its climax. He's playing professionally like a real virgin. The part he's trying to make his hair the way girls like is realistic. However, along the way, a few lessons are learned, and at least a few of the boys' questions are answered, balancing most of the film's vulgarity. The best characters used in real romantic scenes, were Mena Suvari and Chris Klein. Their appearance was one of my personal favorites which was played professionally in this movie. It's the most amuzing sex comedy I have ever reviewed, with the perfect use of a vast variety of different characters.-Ahmad Anvari, Movie Reviewer - Tehran, Iran</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Which is Funnier?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What is it about this movie that makes it eligible for repeat viewing? Why is it funny? It's gross, sexist, lewd, crude, and many of the situations are socially unacceptable...definitely not a first-date flick. But it's just so darn funny! Why? Why, why, why?Many comparisons have been made to "Animal House", some favorable, most UNfavorable. In my humble, rank amateur's opinion, this picture is superior. There is no food fight, nor is there anyone who remotely approaches Belushi in terms of comic talent. But the story is not as preposterous in "American Pie." It stays real to the characters without having to resort to something that distracts from the main goal of the picture. People in "Pie" do wacky things, but you believe them. People in "Animal House" do wacky things, but there is no clear motivation. Okay, these movies are not necessarily concerned with such mundane tasks as finding motivations for every action, but there was more of it in "Pie" than there was in "Animal House." Since it was more believable, it seemed more natural, and thus it was funnier because the characters were just being themselves without TRYING to be funny. And since it's funnier, it's more watchable and eligible for repeat viewing.Then again, I could be wrong. Though I doubt it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those numerous films that, once you've seen the ad or trailer, you pretty much know the whole story. The purpose of a trailer is get you psyched up to come back to see the film. Well, in the case of "American Pie", most all the good parts ARE in the trailer.If you're expecting a non-stop hour and half of lusty busty high school girls whipping off their clothes, forget it. Except for a short topless scene, you won't find that here. The ads promise a whole lot more than this film delivers.High school seniors. Horny teenage boys craving Virginal teenage girls. Prom Night. Rights of Passage and Bragging Rights. That's about it.Except for Eugene Levy, there's barely a recognizable face in this entire film. Is that good? Bad? I don't know, but all leads, both male and female, are mostly interchangable. With their similar hairstyles and manner of dress, it's often hard to tell which one you're looking at anyway. At least this film eschews the cliche' of the High School Jock Bully and his Sadistic Henchmen [tm] and puts the guys pretty much on par with each other, socially and sexually.Sad as it is to say, I found the most entertaining scene in this entire film a "forced him to drink laxative.. egads! Where's the toilet!" bit, and it was outdone tenfold by Jeff Daniels, in "Dumb and Dumber." If it's a super-charged romp you're looking for, cast this one aside and rent or watch "Animal House" instead. Sure, those are college kids, but the idea's the same, and the execution is superior in every way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is this really how teenage kids behave???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well eh??? yes. This is a film that depicts the way teenagers behave in a great way. The stuff they talk about the way they treat each other and so on. The only thing that just might not be entirely true here is that kids of my age (17 ? 19) don't actually need to get laid before going to college yet or maybe that's just because I live in a little hellhole. Here in our town it is more about kissing (french kissing most of the time). There are actually people who do that 3 or 4 times a night (both males and females). Of course coming to the conversational part of the movie, I can't speak for the girls, but the guys, well they sure like to observe pretty girls, they sure like to talk dirty and stupid and they sure as hell make some dumb bet's or pacts. Some may even do pretty dumb stuff, like Jim, but I haven't witnessed that, I only know the stories (maybe I'm lucky not to have seen some things). If you don't want to hear this or read this, you should stop and start reading the next bit after the blank line. This filthy story is actually from a German film (but I've heard a story about a few drunk guys a friend of mine knows who did the exact same thing). In the film (and in reality, according to my friend) a couple of guys lay a piece of bread on the ground and form a circle around it. Then they started masturbating and the one that came missed had to eat the slice of bread. Well that is quite nasty I must say and I feel far worse than what was depicted in American Pie, for it was intentional.On to the film I must say I was not so disgusted as many of you Americans might have been. Most of the stuff there seemed pretty natural to me (with a few exotic outbursts, but hey it is a comedy). But what I really think is strange about this is that never have I read a review or comment about this film (or heard from one of my friends) is that there is actually a bit of romance between all that talk about sex and the gross ? out comedy. That I found particularly good, for it brought some real refreshment tot the film. Due to the romance it was not the way that there needed to be one crude joke or action after another, you know. That is something that often happens in spoofs like The Naked gun. In those films they become so determined to make you laugh, rather that they totally cross the line and become ridiculous instead of being funny. They should be looking for something refreshing, like the romance here in American Pie (which is a film that can hardly be compared to the naked gun for it is not nonsense). Back to American Pie though. It was not only the story and the jokes that made this a good and fun film, the good performance of the young actors and actresses helped a lot too. They were all good, though there is one actor I must mention separately and that is Jason Biggs. He was really great. He was the best of the bunch, for he was the one featured in the funniest parts of the film, plus he came over like a real funny guy, who was kind of new to everything and who behaved most like I would have behaved I guess (I think he reminded me of myself and that's why I liked him so much).This really is a film I can recommend to everyone, for I don't see how you could be offended by the jokes and the situations. The only thing there may be for me to say that this is a film suited for no one under the age of 16 or so (because of the content, although I can imagine I might have liked it then only because of the dirty jokes and not because I had the feeling that the way me and my friends behave is in some form the way teenagers around the world are behaving, maybe even RIGHT NOW). I sure as hell want to see a sequel and I sure as hell know I'm not going to need force someone to make American Pie 2.8 out of 10</fullReview>

Some of the ways they thought of weren't available at my time (eg, web cam), but I was sure hoping they'd succeed. :) While you won't call this a great movie - it is after all a teen flick appealing to hormonal teenagers - it is still a great movie to watch and enjoy, especially, I guess, if you are a young couple.</fullReview>

American Pie II will be one of the worst sequels ever, mark my words. If you thought Ghostbusters II was bad, wait for this. I will see this movie out of respect for the first one, but I can see the handwriting on the walls. On a good note, there's no way this movie could ever be as bad as "Loser". Ouch!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny comedy, ruined by the message it carries</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*SPOILERS , kinda. but its obvious how its gonna end. in a typical hollywoodian fashion.*The movie deserved a 9. Its a funny comedy about senior high schoolers trying to get laid before the year ends, and I liked it. But I only voted a 6. Here's why: I could relate to Jim and the others throughout the whole movie, except at the end. Jim says "I'm tired of everyone hyping sex, I dont wanna do it anymore. To hell with it all" (close enough). Ok, if the movie had ended with at least ONE of the "good guys, normal guys" not getting laid, the message or moral would've been "ok, some guys make it, some dont". good. but it didnt. they had to have all the "normal" kids have sex, and the viewer,if a male teenager, will leave the theater thinking "ok...so if i dont have sex while in high school, im a loser like Sherman" (that's what many thought, and that's what the previous reviewer Longtrip thought) . How screwed up is that? I mean, only a select 30% (im only guessing) of guys got laid at my high school, does that make the 70% remaining losers? No, but that's the message you got from American Pie. That you're like Sherman. (for the record, I didnt get laid in high school). I really wish at least Jim would've stayed a virgin, at least until the next year. Also...whats up with using 24/25 year-old girls to play the role of 18yo's? huh? Shannon Elizabeth is a PLAYMATE, yet they pass her as a regular 18yo student. The average teenage girl watching the movie will obviously notice the difference in looks between her and the sexy cast of American Pie, who's supposedly "normal average 18yo's". No way that'll help her self-esteem, in this f***ed up world where girls think that if they dont look like the girl on the cover of Seventeen, they'll scare guys away . So, both male and female teenagers that are like me (that are part of the aforementionned 70%), when leaving the theater, will walk out with a bad taste in their mouth.I liked American Pie. Half-way through the movie, I was thinking that I'll be giving it a 9 here. but with the moral/message it has, I cant allow myself to give it more than a 6, sorry. Have a nice day, people. (oh, and sorry if I dont express myself as eloquently as some other reviewers)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a recent college grad and got to see this movie with a friend I hadn't seen since we graduated high school together. This movie really hit the spot and gave us an opportunity to talk about our glory days in high school. Many seem to complain that sex is too often the topic, but unless you don't remeber because your too old or are ashamed, sex is a major issue to most at that age. The only way I can see people not liking this movie is because you did not share these experiences back in your day. Finding your first love, losing your virginity, and being in the tightest group of friends you ever had and ever will have because you grew up with them for so long. And that "next step".... it can prove to be the last time you have the opportunity to have as much fun like the characters in this movie seemed to have. I can only imagine those who hate this movie being one of the band dorks or the likes of the "Shermanator" and I feel sorry you missed out on the experience and wild ride high school could have been.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yeah, it's got an attractive, charismatic cast and some good laughs, but too many scenes just waste away with no punchline. Although I'll admit the flute comment had me rolling on the floor for a good twenty minutes, and Eugene Levy is wonderful. And the webcam scene is so sexist, but still pretty hysterical. But its portrayal of horny teens and the loss of virginity has none of the dark, ultra-realistic complexity of Fast Times, which proves this subject matter can be both funny and honest. American Pie doesn't even try, which I guess is okay to most teens, since this made a load at the box office. Oh well, maybe I'm just getting old...5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If evidence was needed that mid-80's nostalgia is here, we get it in AMERICAN PIE. It is no more credible than a remake of Porkys or Screwball Hotel, not that it matters. The makers of those pictures were very aware that plots and characters were irrelevant, so rude set pieces instead were the order of the day. They were rarely very good (the oft-cited classic ANIMAL HOUSE belongs to a different genre altogether).Riding into cinemas on the back of THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY did not hurt this films box office potential. The makers laughably suggested this was an evolution of the genre. Judging by its success, you can fool some of the people all of the time, and all of the people some of the time. What separates AMERICAN PIE from the rest is a series of poorly devised high school romances. Which would be okay if it was still funny. It isn't.The most explicit homage to the original inspirations is the casting of Eugene Levy (a chorus of `who?' rings out), best known for being John Candy's sidekick in a bunch of forgettable idiot comedies. So his `comeback' hardly rivals Travolta's.AMERICAN PIE belongs to a time called `mid-80's'. That time is long gone. It belongs to a genre of jocks-and-sex comedies. The originals still inspire occasional bouts of laughter on late-night television. Watch them instead. It's cheaper.</fullReview>

Even though adults might be repulsed by the crudeness and sexual nature of the film, they're guaranteed to crack a smile. The plot alone lets the viewer know that the film will be funny. When four boys make a pact to lose their virginity before prom night, you know that many things can go right and some things can go SERIOUSLY wrong. So if you watch this movie, and follow the stories of Jim, Finch, Kevin and (Oz?), you'll roll over in your seat laughing!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For a comedy to work, the characters in it must either be very sympathetic or very unsympathetic, with little space between. This film chronicles a couple months in the lives of four likable high school seniors, desperate to experience sex before finishing high school. The lack of originality in the idea is more than compensated for with loads of humor, a truly appealing cast, and an unexpected sweetness amid all the vulgarity. Funny, witty, and certain to contain many future stars.</fullReview>

However, after thirty minutes or so, the film gets better, it's even cute at times, but I really don't know what all the fuss is about. So, teenagers talking about sex, having sex -- who cares? The funniest character is without a doubt Jim's dad (Eugene Levy) and the best line (because it was so unexpected) belongs to Alyson Hannigan's geeky character. Well, not very good, not very bad.

		<fullReview>"American Pie" is one of those movies that looks really crude and stupid in the previews, but turns out to be sweet and actually good in reality. There is nudity and a lot of things that moral people would consider "questionable material", but that is also funny. Despite a few ridiculous situations, the movie is actually surprisingly in tune with high school kids and realistic. The plot is basically this, four high school senior boys make a pact together to lose their virginity by Prom Night. A lot of mix-ups happen, as well as humiliations and popularity shifts among the other seniors. One thing that I don't really think is realistic, though, is the fact that the students all remain more-or-less friendly and don't really go for each other's throats all of the time, despite the fact that they have all been terribly humiliated and embarrassed. This leaves the film a little more innocent, though, and doesn't really hurt it much. So, in conclusion, this movie was funny and pretty much realistic, with a few sip-ups.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you don't like this film, you most likely don't like sincerity. This film is by far the most open-minded film on sex ever made in the US.Sex in movies instilled moral panic in Sweden in the 50's, and I must say that the nudity in this one is about as lame as any Swedish film from that era. The talk isn't much more revolutionary.I laughed my ass off at this movie. It was funny, heart-felt and is probably a lot more akin to the truth about what's going on inside a high-school guy's head.What bothers me most is that people tend to think this film actually wants kids to go on and do it, the quicker the better - don't you get it! It's irony: I-r-o-n-y, look it up. With that kind of understanding of movies, one could as well say that every movie about concentration camps tells us to commit large-scale murder.

		<shortDescription>What old teen movie does this REALLY remind you of?(Possible Spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of people, especially IMDb users have been comparing this movie to "Porky's." I say it's more like another teen movie made in the same year, specifically "The Last American Virgin(1981)," albeit with a much happier ending. For example, all four friends succeded at their goal of losing their virginity by/on prom night, two of which with someone they truly loved. Nobody got their girlfriends pregnant, accused them of being whores, or took them to the abortion mills. The 1950's neo-greaser attitudes towards sex is missing here, and that suits me just fine. Alyson Hanigan is not as annoying as some might believe, playing the role of Michelle(..named after "Meyrink," perhaps?), the nerdy-flutist, who's only life outside of school is at band camp. What a pity, until you find out what else she does with her flute in her spare time. I was as 'antsy' as she was, after hearing that line, even though I should've seen it coming. Well worth watching for teenagers and all those who are over their teen years too.</fullReview>

One can't get a girl, one gets a girl in a chorus, but isn't interested in that kind of thing, one almost got a girl but screwed up because the girl was shipped back to her home place (for good intentions), and one has a girl but wants to get to know him before they get into "extreme measures."I thought this was an extremely gross out comedy. It had pretty much everything a funny movie should have. Although their was soem funny parts, most of the time (mostly the ending) wasn't that funny. But if you liked There's Something About Mary, you will like this. Starring Jason Biggs, Chris Kleine, and Eugene Levy.*** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is really funny from a teens point of view. I dont know what you adults would think though,it does have some pretty silly and disturbing scenes....But otherwise,to me,this was a hilarious crude comedy,basically about 4 dudes that really wanna score,before graduation. It starts of with a funny scene,and the acting is very acceptable,but was blatant at times by some of the cast. The love relationships were fairly unrealistic,and biased.Now,its not as easy as it sounds,this has more crude that sex scenes....now,you either find it hilarious,laughable or totally stupid thats up to you to decide.The script was pretty well developed,and had some scenes,which left you crying for more.To me,the bad point was how the film developed towards the end,it slowly begins to go downhill from there,but luckily it ends before they actually ruin anything.Well....For the sex scenes themselves,were highly un-erotic,but not stupid,and the 4 dudes really do remind you of your friends!Is it worth the rent??Certainly??But i recommend that if your,what?Over 25 NOT to watch it unless your really hip and cool cause you WILL understand it,but find it disgusting,and laugh is disgust basically...Is it a film you can watch over and over again? CERTAINLY.....This film is very addictive,and no matter how many times you've seen it,you want to invite your friends over and watch it again.!Rating of 10? Well,it might just not be a blockbuster..! But it definitey IS a great film that im extremely certain you'd enjoy!8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vulgar and entertaining!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over here in the UK, we seems to have been bombarded by American teen comedies, either on TV or in Film. We wouldn't mind, but none of them seem to be that good. Of course we haven't actually made any ourselves, so we're hardly in a position to criticise, but the really sad thing is that the teen-com concept is full of potential. Finally, someone was daring enough to explore the outrageousness of lusty adolescence. American Pie was born!Make no mistake; the main strength of this film is it's sheer vulgarity. The usual patronising moral preaching that accompanies, and spoils, so many films of this type is absent. Replacing it is a no holds barred look at teenage angst, sexual curiosity, and the art of bodily function jokes. In addition, the subject of masturbation has never been approached with such an unflinching eye!!The young cast, all relatively unknown, offer some impressive performances. The individual honours belong to Sean W Scott, who is repulsively likeable as Stifler, even if it is nothing more than a role as the typically moronic American Jock. However, the most skillful moments of the film are provided by Jason Biggs and Eugene Levy, who offer an excellent double act as the son with strange methods of experimentation and the father, whose methods of sex education are at times equally bizarre. The sense of awkwardness as they endure their 'man to man' talks is remarkably convincing.The film isn't consistently funny, but the half dozen side splitting moments are more than enough to keep you amused, even if you have been told of them in vivid detail prior to watching. (Like I was)At times though, American Pie can certainly be accused of feeling a bit familiar. After all, the guys trying to get laid routine has been done a thousand times before, and some of the jokes (such as the old classic of post laxative attack panic) are hardly original, but the film does include some touches that save it from being totally predictable. For example there is the character of Finch, the mysterious member of the sex-obsessed quartet with sophisticated mannerisms, and the way the Jock element is played through Lacrosse, rather than a more obvious or traditional American sport.The purists will no doubt, make criticisms about it's over explicitness, and other such garbage about the corruption of the young, but as usual they are looking deeper than is necessary. While you could argue that American Pie brings attention to the awkwardness, anxiousness and confusion of adolescent sexuality, it is really just an entertaining comedy, with grossness that lifts it head and shoulders above the rest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was a preview and it was free, so we went to see this movie that in reviews was labeled "Porky for the 90's". We were sitting at the ail, so we could make an easy escape. But soon we noticed we were laughing out loud. We even cried real tears laughing. It is true that the jokes were mostly stupid and mostly about sex (after all, it's all about a bunch of guys deciding to loose their virginity before graduating), it is also true that you could see them coming from miles away. But this was certainly not a movie about t+a-jokes. It was simply great fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a terrible disappointment this movie turned out to be!Movies like Dumb and Dumber, Kingpin, Flying High, Spaceballs etc. etc. belong to my favorite movies of all time, so I was looking forward to this so much. But this movie never even came close to those classics.What made the other movies so good was that even though the jokes were stupid, there was a sort of cleverness in them. This movie lacked that cleverness all together. Almost all jokes were predictable and therefore not very funny.Also a lot of the story lines and jokes seemed to be derived from old jokes of other movies, which made them less funny because they weren't new.Highlight of the movie for me was the 'Shermanator'. This kid reminded me of Anthony Michael Hall is his young years, and almost singlehandedly saved the movie for me.So all in all not a terribly bad movie, but certainly not a great one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many horny high school students throughout history have tried to solve the pie equation. No! Not the 3.14 one, but the one that makes them as shagadelic as an overmojoed Austin Powers. My friends that would be called the "American Pie " equation. These and many more hilarious pursuits are rekindled in a very funny film called ( Yes! You guessed it!) "American Pie." This hilarious gem is about four high school students who make a pact to lose their virginity by graduation ( or in other words solve the "American Pie" equation.) The movie contains some outrageous scenes such as a powerful laxative that will make you pee in your pants, a new meaning to the term the world wide web, and a beer that is definitely not less filling. To rephrase the great Forrest Gump or in this case I will call him Forrest Hump- " Life is like an American Pie, you never know how horny is going to get." ****Good</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nicely heated, pretty bland</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yet another teenage rite of passage flick churned out by the Hollywood sausage factory. However this one is low fat, not particularly salty and has quality ingredients. Four senior high school buddies vow to lose their virginity by the end of the high school year and before they go to college. (Naturally, everybody's going to college even if it's on a Lacrosse scholarship). You'd think that wouldn't be hard. Well of course it's not, but the trick here is to keep the audience guessing as to how. The girls (no gays please, this is Middle America) are eager but inexperienced (with the exception of a ridiculously tanned and beautiful exchange student from evil old Eastern Europe who seems to have been at it for years). So are the boys. There's too much talk and not enough action, lots of false starts and misunderstandings.Naturally, in an update of this hoary old storyline, the Internet get used to broadcast round the campus the hero's fumblings with Ms Czech Republic (shades of Hot Lips Hoolahan and the company dentist in "Mash"). Naturally, the climax (and I use that word advisedly) comes at the after-prom party, and it is a multiple one. Naturally, the parents scarcely seem to be aware of what's happening (except for one who becomes part of the action - "Mrs Robinson" is a potent American myth). Naturally, the guys are types, your ordinary average sex maniac who'll try it with a warm apple pie, the gentle jock, the pimply guy with sophisticated tastes, the other ordinary average sex maniac who actually has a girlfriend but isn't getting very far.OASM no.1 (he with the apple pie and awful parent) is nicely played with eager desperation by Jason Biggs, who looks a lot like Adam Sandler but is a lot less irritating. Chris Klein as the jock puts in a sensitive performance, as does Mena Suvari (a stand-out in American Beauty as the beauty) as his Kylie Minogue-like girlfriend. The rest of the cast are all pretty ordinary, but it's a nice looking production appropriately filmed in the springtime.The US education system succeeds brilliantly at one thing, prolonging the dependency and emotional immaturity of adolescence of kids who go to college. They won't have jobs and be free of parents and school, not to say school friends until they are at least 25, probably 30. It is of course all a conspiracy so Hollywood can sell movies like this. That half of the population who don't go to college and instead wind up in McJobs at $5 an hour (if they are lucky) will of course hit reality much earlier. I'm not sure they will find much to relate to here, or all that much to envy, at least on the emotional front. If you can't be bothered watching this movie just view the trailer - it has most of the funniest bits in it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the funniest movie I've seen in quite some time. A few people compared it to Porky's, but I think it was better. I was a teenager when Porky's was out. Whereas Porky's had a number of funny scenes, American Pie was 90% funny. Also, some of Porky's jokes were mean spirited. It was refreshing to see a funny film that thrived on the funny side of the human experience instead of making jokes at someone's expense. I saw the uncut version on pay per view so I can't diss movie go-ers for their reviews. But if you get a chance to see the uncut version, do it! While it's not appropriate for young children (&amp;16), I think most young and young minded adults will find it hilarious.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I actually saw the movie one hour ago and I am not that enthusiastic about it. Maybe it was the people I saw the movie with; 15-year olds, young couples in love, screaming and playing with their cell-phones... Or maybe it was just the movie.Don't get me wrong: I am not THAT old, I am 22, but the movie was full of cliche-jokes and morals. The moral maybe was the most annoying part of the movie: it is love that counts, not sex, blah, blah, blah, yada, yada, yada.Come on: this is a TYPICAL American comedy... like we've seen zillions of... I am not even gonna sum them all up.Anyway... some parts were nice like the whole thing with the dad (the flick made such an impression on me I even forgot most of the character's names).But there were some promising young actors in the move. One of them I remembered from 'American Beauty', Mena Suvari (geeze what is her next move going to be called...? it must start with 'American' that's for sure).It was amusing but only occasionally. It was surely predictable as well as too moralistic (as I mentioned before). I hope you Americans with the number one country on teenage pregnancies and the hatred against gay people would look better on European movies and stop making these moralistic nothings. This is the year 2000 for crying out loud! Stop the double standards and hypocricy... but you are nice people.... don't get me wrong...I'd say: a 6 out of 10...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>American Pie is a great comedy, in my honest opinion. I'd like to say its very realistic, since every single problem in there and situations can happen in real life, I've even had problems like that, and watching a movie like that makes you feel like you're not the only one passing through all of that stuff.None of the actors in this movie are really great, they all did a good job, but nobody did something special.The movie was not good because of it's actors (hell no!), it was good because of it shows things the way they are in real life. I think every single teen ager (with a normal life) would love to watch this movie.As a comedy it was very good, it made me laugh a few times (and long laughs). But the good thing about this movie is that it's not just a comedy that makes you laugh but has no script, this movie has a very nice script that keeps you paying attention all the time, and you don't only get interested waiting for a funny part, you want to know what's going to happen with all the boys and the girls.I enjoyed this movie a lot, and I watched it twice in the theaters. I'll rate it with a 7 out of 10. If you're a teen go watch this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A hilarious caper from beginning to end! It echoes of past greats such as Porky's but with far more sensitivity and youthfulness, more likened to the John Hughes classics of the last decade. Even at the senior prom, the band are playing a cover of Simple Minds' Don't You Forget About Me, perhaps paying homage to The Breakfast Club. Although these eighties trends are relived, the film keeps up to date fairly well and to emphasise this, one of the gags involves the Internet!The plot is simple: four high school senior lads make a pact to lose their virginity before they go off to college. They have, basically, until Prom Night left, and they don't even have a date. Although the plot centres around sex, it is more to do with dealing with adolescence than the typical over-confident characters in a lot of American teen-flicks which centre on the college student. The film deals with sex as an issue of uncertainty to both genders; a refreshing change for this new age of brat-pack movie.With certain exceptions, the characters in American Pie are easy to identify with. They are almost likeable in their geeky ways, and their parents almost tolerable! The only thing that misses for me is that perhaps I am too old to fully appreciate it. I have a feeling that it was designed for people of similar age to the characters within the movie for full impact. Being the case, then, I would imagine many who see it are below the certificate minimum.However it is a film for all to enjoy, although if you have a dislike for toilet humour then avoid it. It relies on this as its backbone and the theme of masturbation is rife, albeit hilarious! Watch out for familiar faces from Buffy, most notably Alyson Hannigan. Perhaps not one to see with your better half, but your younger brother will adore it!</fullReview>

If people could get past the strong sexuality, strong language, and teen alcohol use, I think they could find there's much more to it then the critics say there is. Point is, I'm a big fan of romantic comedies, and I do think there is romance in this movie that you can't get if you saw it in the theatre and walked out within the first twenty minutes. Fact is, some of the boys, even though they think they're looking for quick sex, actually end up falling in love and feeling real emotions for their dates. Also, as a high school student, I think it does have some great commentary on the teenaged sex life, however I do feel sorry for anybody who relates to it too much. Happy viewing, and if any easily offended conservatives intend to watch this, I beg you to watch the whole thing, otherwise, you won't understand it one bit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For a teenage movie that approaches very touchy topics, this is still a lighthearted movie. After a big loser loses his virginity to a nice woman, four boys make a pact to lose theirs by the prom. Their only inspiration: themselves. The movie seems to drag as the poor guys try some pretty stupid tactics, but the highlight has to be Nadia in Jim's room. Throughout the rest of the movie it's that moment and the "warm apple pie" that will go through your head. In the end, it's all dumb and obvious because it's only a movie with either a "you win all or you suck" attitude. But next to that, it's a movie for the times, as boys of this era are becoming sensitive for the wrong reasons to become "men."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After all the hype and the amount of recommendations from people who said this was a great comedy, my friends and I rented "American Pie" to see if it lived up to the hype. You know what, it did. "American Pie" had us laughing our asses off from start to finish. Others have said it's not funny because it's stupid and raunchy, but the stupidity and raunchiness of it is what made it soar. Laughter is always the best medicine, and "American Pie" succeeds in giving us a double-dose! None of us had seen it before, and we were lucky enough to have rented the Unrated version first. We got to see, in full effect, the version of "American Pie" the filmmakers wanted us to see. There's not many differences between the two versions(after reading about them on the internet of course), except the largely talked about "pie" scene, which was pretty sick. Still, to be frank, I thought that the Unrated version couldn't be any raunchier than R rated version. It's silly how protective the MPAA feels they have to act for us. I don't know. People complain that this isn't any funnier, better, or sicker than stuff like "Dumb and Dumber". I was satisfied with "American Pie", and I thought it was very funny. Go rent it, and rent the Unrated version. That's the "American Pie" the world was supposed to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Adolescent Sex Comedy, But Funny!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I expected this movie to be another Porky's or Animal House which I thought low-brow comedy to be sure. I was pleasantly surprised with this movie. Not only was it funny but there was tremendous character development in it. The plot moved forward with a solid conclusion. It looked to me like a pretty accurate depiction of adolescent sexuality--its not all G rated, but then adolescence wasn't either. Mr. Biggs is certainly not afraid to do wild things and perhaps his scenes are the most memorable in this movie--I chuckle just thinking about the "illegal channels" scene, for who in their adolescence hasn't explored auto-eroticism in fear of being discovered by his family? His dancing scene in front of the computer camera perhaps will go down in the annals of comedy--at last something Lucy never did before! Eugene Levy's sympathetic and somewhat understanding, but at the same time bumbling father role, was great. My thinking was "at least he's trying...."Even though there were no real bad guys, it looks to me that Sherman and Stifler got their just rewards in this movie too. Probably something a lot of teens have wished for with regard to similar characters in their high school experience, but were denied; for in my experience those characters also seemed to get away with their insensitivity to woman and untrue boasts far too often. It was nice to see those types put in their place in this movie. If you want a good romp in the field of sex comedy, this movie is worth watching. I hope to see more of this cast in future comedies. Since this apparently is a first attempt by the Weitz brothers(?) I expect that we'll see other great comedies from this writer/director duo.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unique view on high-school</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this movie as it was probably intended to be viewed -- sitting in a room with a few of my male college friends.For the film itself, I feel that it speaks true to a lot of the stereotypes portrayed in many peoples minds. Talking to a few of the people that have seen the film, they usually touch on the point of how they feel that the "High-school" theme was extremely exaggerated throughout the movie. I would agree with that to an extent, though I do believe that a lot of the underlying principles portrayed in the film strike at the heart of what high-school does to the mentality of some of the kids there. That they only touched on one of the aspects of our glorious education system...But my small rant is over -- and to sum up, I truly enjoyed this film and would recommend it to any that feel they can handle it's mature content. I don't need to delve in to what I mean by 'mature content'; most of the people that went to see this movie already knew what the main climactic scene in it was.9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not that funny but a good film none the less</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Considering the immense publicity given to the film and it's more 'noticeable' bits I was somewhat surprised to find myself not the least bit shocked by the whole thing. Sure it was funny but not laugh out loud funny, not the burst my sides laughing funny that I had expected. I actually found it to be a good film on it's own, more of a nineties spin on the old John Hughes tales of growing up and wondering exactly who you are and what you want. The fact that the main focus of the film was sex changed nothing as it more than emphasised the fact that sex is only truly great when you are with someone you love. It also placed safe sex prominently, yet subtlely, in the window. It also marked something of a radical shift in teen films by not strictly placing every one in a distinct social group (The band nerds aside). The fact that the four main characters hung around with each other despite their apparent differences made the film more realistic in my opinion than the clearly divided 'The Breakfast Club' fivesome. It was more 'Ferris Bueller's' and was all the better for it. Stifler was a truly brilliant character and I hope teen film writers take a leaf from this movie in how to deal with the 'cool, rich' male leads. To label this film a 'gross out movie' is to completely misunderstand it. I found myself agreeing for the first time ever with Leonard Maltin that it's a good film with it's heart in the right place. Not overly moralistic or totally without decency it takes a good stab at what it's really like to be an 18 year old on the brink of entering a world unlike anything they've seen before. I liked it, but not because it's got masturbatory gags or endless sex remarks, but because it dealt with issues and a context never before seen in teen movies. The one major downer about it though is that it's going to usher in a whole bunch of other teen sex comedies each going further than the one before and getting worse with it. Mark my words.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Way better than standard teen sex movies-- Funny, sexy, and has a heart!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much better than the usual teen-sex-glitz-farce. I watched the unrated version of "American Pie" on DVD the same week I also watched "10 Things I Hate About You," and the contrast between the two was clear. Both movies are a little gross for some tastes, and probably will concern or even offend a portion of the population. But beyond that kind of knee-jerk "tut-tutting" in the media there is a very good reason to enjoy "American Pie": It's a very good movie.I avoided "American Pie" in the theaters because the trailers and the reviewers focused on the "hi-jinx" aspect-- clumsy, self-absorbed boys running amuck while trying to satisfy their physical urges without regard to any higher values such as love, relationship, appreciation of their fellow human beings, etc. At the urging of my parents, however, I watched the DVD, and was pleasantly surprised to find that the movie indeed had a heart. As well as a bunch of crude, funny material-- solid comedy.Without revealing the outcomes of the "plot"-- let me just say that the characters undergo a believable redemption and maturing that would be a high point in any "chick movie." I hesitate to give praise here at others' expense, yet I think it is important to note the vivid contrast of this fine and good hearted movie with another teen sex flick: "10 Things I Hate About You," which was released about the same time. "10 Things...," as with so many movies in this genre, was mean, low-spirited, and viciously hostile. It was an insult to the audience, especially in its vulgar depiction of adolescent boys as perverts and buffoons, and adolescent girls as greedy, ego driven bitches. That's bad! It perverted what is otherwise a normal part of human life-- wholesome, randy good humor."American Pie" has a good heart, and a good eye. See it and laugh, but don't be surprised if you also get a tiny bit edified at the same time. Oh-- the commentary track on the DVD is also great-- The director, the writer, I think, and several of the actors all appear together with spirited good humor and genuinely informative info-- that alone is worth the DVD price!</fullReview>

The humour is highly sexual in nature and at times completely gross. You will either love this movie or hate it utterly. Yet despite it's crude appearance it is actually very close to the mark in it's depiction of high school teenagers.Alyson Hannigan's performance as the target of one of the lads affections was probably the one that stood out from the others but I was too busy laughing to notice too much. This is definitely a movie for a fun night out but don't even think about watching it if you are expecting to see an intelligent, thought provoking movie, or if non-stop sexual gags offend you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film in the vain of John Hughes's great 80's teen comedies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the great genre of 'Teen Comedy' looking decidedly tired at the moment it is refreshing to see this well directed, scripted and acted offering reminiscent of John Hughes's great teen comedies of the 80's such as 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off' and 'The Breakfast Club'. The young previously unknown actors worked perfectly together with Jason Biggs doing a wonderfully confused 'Jim', Eddie Kaye Thomas a suave 'Finch' and Natasha Lyonne shines a streetwise cool as the dry witted 'Jessica'. Adam Herz's script is pacy and never fails to keep the viewer enthralled. Perhaps however it's greatest feature is the fact that it doesn't treat a presumably younger audience as though it has the brain capacity of a fly (Be watching for a very funny reference to 'The Graduate'). It's fast, funny and manages throughout to hold onto a central issue. My only complaint is the incredibly harsh rating it received in the US. Far from being unsuitable for persons younger than 18 I recommend that it is shown to all people in high school to help de-mystify the issue of teenagers and sexuality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Raunch was never this cool!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know, when I was a lad in the eighties, the big deal for us teens was Porky's (and its two sequels). In that film, set in Florida in the 1950s, a group of horny high school kids tries their very best to lose their individual virginity as soon as possible.You can consider American Pie an update of Porky's, except that it's a LOT funnier while still retaining all of that raunch. The hook for Porky's was that you got to see a little nudity, which was a big deal to a teenager in the early eighties. Pie surpasses the raunch and adds dollops of good, solid, vivid, and (especially) authentic characterizations. While the kids in Porky's were fairly stereotypical, the kids in Pie are.... well, typical, really. Of course, some things never change, and the driving force of the story in Pie is that males just wanna get laid, while females want it to be just right. The movie also tackles such issues as true love, masturbation (male and female), pornography, sex toys, orgasms (male and female), older women, and even diarrhea! Quite a lot to cram into 90 minutes, but not only does the film not skip a beat while delivering these goods, it does so with such honesty that you'll very rarely see in a so-called teen film of the late nineties. And I'm pretty sure it's the only film ever to tackle the all-important issue of sex with pastry!(Side note: Good to see Thomas Ian Nicholas, from Rookie of the Year, a little more grown up - so to speak!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A film worthy of repeated viewing again and again, and the nudity is not the reason. It's a movie written expressly by guys for guys, but somehow women like it as much as men do. The movie has so many scenes of absolutely hideous embarrassment alternated with scenes of triumph. There were somewhere around ten times in the movie when I started shaking my fist and going, "Yeah, baby!" Why? Becausen this is a movie that so many guys my age (I'm 18) can relate to. We cringe with embarrassment beyond what we've ever known when we see Kevin get caught spouting off about trying for a sexual homerun; we cheer when we see the guy get the girl not because she coerced him into saying "I love you" but because he truly was interested in her. This is immensely gratifying for us to see, partially because we never see it in real life. For fans of the movie "Swingers" I would highly recommend this as a guy movie. Storywise, this is very well written. As noted above, there are some similarities to "Swingers" - obvious scenes when you can't help but feel sorry for the guy acting too effeminate or being too much of a pushover - to be contrasted with scenes (like Mike's dancing in Swingers) where you want to stand up and cheer. It's the tension between these moments of "I can't watch this!" to "You just learned how to be a man!" that gives this movie its great appeal to me. When I first heard of the movie, I swore that I would never see it. I heard of scenes with a pie, of awkward porno-magazine distribution scenes, of the endlessly repeated "Band Camp" lines, and of a guy using a tube sock to encase something other than his foot. Yes, these are indeed gross, but you must realize they are realistic gross. Whether or not they cross into gratuitousness is up to you, but I feel that this film's reputation as "The Most Dangerous Film to Our Youth of All Time" is undeserved. The gross scenes appeal only to the easily-titillated, or social reformers who need an excuse to impose some more limits on what we watch. Watch it for yourself, and how you really think. You'll find it worthwhile.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why is it so hard to really say why American Pie just didn't do it for me? My expectations, perhaps? Of course, like any movie you have a feel for what you hope to _get_ out of the movie right before the lights dim...I was expecting something outrageous and over-the-top, especially because I had the Unrated DVD starting to spin. I mean, this cut couldn't even land an 'R' rating. South Park did (although certain MPAA members came out later "regretting" their decision to shy away from the dreaded NC-17), so I was expecting something on par. Truth is, American Pie bogied, if not three-putted. It had a throw away message (sort of like South Park, but less campy and almost taken seriously, a definite negative) about the virtues of beating down peer pressure. It had forgettable characters and a weak script. But that's hardly why I was excited to see it...I wanted pure, unadulterated, NC-17 teetering outrageousness...and I didn't get that.The mutilated pie was funny. And I never really thought about how useful a flute might be...but that was about it...all the gags seemed so...forced. I couldn't tell if I was supposed to take the movie seriously or not, and that's its inherent flaw. If you're going for the push-the-envelope gusto, by all means strap on the booster rockets and GO (which, by the way, was a far better movie chronicling the outrageousness of teen angst.). Jim and the gang were so...serious, and even if that was the intent, it wasn't very amusing as it unfolded. For example, as Jim consistently struck out with a man on first, I really didn't care...it didn't HURT, hit the brotherly sympathy nerve, like the answering machine scene in Swingers. All the characters were positively dull and terribly zero-dimensional.I don't mean to analyze this movie to death although I probably just did, which makes me something of a hypocrite. The bottom line is that it's supposed to transcend critical review and just be damn funny, no more and no less. But it wasn't and that's what made me wonder, Why?</fullReview>

The antics are relatively extreme and always appropriate for the moment. I found myself saying "Oh Jesus" as much as laughing, though. Look for the apple pie scene!I'm reminded of the 1987 film, The Allnighter, with yummy Susanna Hoffs and Joan Cusack. I've caught The Allnighter late night on cable once or twice in recent years, and I simultaneously find my eyes glued to the TV and my deepest innermost self completely embarrassed for myself and for the cast.

Disgusting and nowhere as funny as it was advertised to be.

		<fullReview>When I first caught the trailers for American Pie I thought that it was going to be too crude. There was no doubt that this film would make Something About Mary seem like a Disney flick. But now, in the comfort of my own home, having just witnessed the DVD version of American Pie, I have to say that it is an excellent movie. Having been raised on films by the Zucker brothers and Mel Brooks, that's a difficult statement to make. But those movies were the early stages of making sex a comedic subject, and American Pie is the next step in the evolutionary chain. I'm sure I was as shocked at some scenes as the previous generation were at segments of Airplane! or Blazing Saddles.It's difficult to believe that this is the Weitz brothers first film. The story flowed extremely well, particularly over the raciest subject matter. And the cast is superb. Had the screenplay been handled with less finesse, or the lines read with less youthful innocence, I'm certain this would have been a movie to avoid. But instead I found it a great escape.Eugene Levy was the only cast member I recognized from previous roles, and he did a very credible job as the loving father awkwardly attempting to help his boy pass into manhood.I would strongly recommend American Pie to any of my friends interested in comedy films.&gt;</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"American Pie" starts off with a bang, and gets a bit shaky from there. This story of five friends who make a pact to lose their virginity by prom night is often hysterical, occasionally dull, but always interesting.Jason Biggs leads the cast as Jim, a young man who is growing increasingly frustrated with being a virgin, and goes to great lengths to lose it. Let's face it, this guy is forever going to be remembered for the hysterical pie scene, but has other embarassing moments as well, either always being walked in on by mom and/or dad or a beyond description funny internet snafu. Great job by this first timer, and I can't wait to see what he does next.Chris Klein ("Election") plays "Oz" as he's called by his friends.....this mr. popular lacross player is probably the most interesting character in the film, with an absolutely adorable characterization. His attempts to woo choir girl Heather (Mena Suvari ("American Beauty") are so sweet and genuine that it adds a needed dose of humanity to this otherwise crude comedy.Since we're on the subject, Mena Suvari plays good girl Heather to the hilt. A stellar singer and somewhat distrusting of Oz at first, she eventually realizes there's more to the boy than first thought, and she falls for him. This young woman is gonna be around for a long time to come, and is gonna be a major player before long.The rest of the cast is good, Tara Reid ("Urban Legend") gets a better character here, and does a good job, Shannon Elizabeth as the sexy exchange student Nadia, Eddie Kay Thomas as the nerdy Finch, Seann William Scott as the rude jock Stifler. All good characterizations and believeable as people you went to or go to school with. Alyson Hannigan (TV's "Buffy") was easily the biggest surprise for me, the nerdy character (much like Willow) suddenly gives way with THE line in the movie.....towards the end, pay special attention!!!Two others stood out to me.....Eugene Levy as Jim's dad, hysterical as he tries to reach out to his son concerning sex. He is a scene stealer and was easily the highlight of the film.The other was Natasha Lyonne ("Slums of Beverly Hills", "Detroit Rock City") As good an actress as she is, she was woefully underused in this one. She rarely is on screen, and is giving advice to the others in short spurts when she is. Ms. Lyonne deserved better than that, and that is my only gripe."American Pie" is a good coming-of-age movie for the 90's, but is often very off color and crude. If you're easily offended, try to either avoid this one or watch it in sections. If you want a funny teen sex farce, and don't mind the crudeness, this one is for you!3 1/2 out of 5</fullReview>

American Pie has run away from its pubescent pack by capturing high school the way it really is. Four years of frustrated preoccupation with sex; what it is, who's done it and how to get it. This movie is hilarious, mostly because it depicts the essence of what it is like to be wrestling with the confusion of emerging sexuality while trying to convince everyone else that you are cool.Director Chris Weitz has found the right balance between sexual obsession and teenage self consciousness. The fact is no-one is as experienced as they pretend, and they're scared to death of the embarrassment it would cause if everyone knew.The skits are mostly funny, sometimes raunchy, sometimes touching, but always right on the mark emotionally for that age group.Jason Biggs (Jim) takes the cake (pie) when it comes to comic prowess in this film. Alyson Hannigan is priceless as the nerd girl refugee from band camp.This film is a must see good time. Check your maturity at the front door and just enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not about to tell you about how obscene or offensive this movie is - and no doubt it is both of those - because I know that you've heard enough about that. I am also not going to lecture the film industry either on gradually shifting the limits of comedy to the point where story is no longer a critical aspect provided that you can put the characters into as many embarrassing and disgusting scenes as possible or on how despite the films rating which supposedly restricts admittance to those 17 and over (yeah, right), it is a perfect example of Hollywood's marketing to an audience for whom it maybe shouldn't be.American Pie is a textbook case of all of the above points. It's plot, high school seniors vow to lose their virginity by graduation, sinks beyond unoriginal and enters blatant cliche territory. But, the fact that you get to see one of the characters masturbate with baked goods makes up for it in the laugh department.That said, American Pie was NOT a bad movie and for that matter I DID like it...sort of. It's characters were certainly likeable enough and somewhat sympathetic. And indeed, I caught myself laughing at things that I probably wouldn't want to admit to.However, like so many teen sex comedies before it (however much more explicit this one is in relative comparison) it is stale and predictable.A few redeeming performances, notably Chris Klein who, although, seems to be playing the exact same character as he did in Election, comes off honest and refreshing. Even more notably, Eugene Levy, who more or less using his comic genius managed to add hilarity to an otherwise dreary work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is somewhat gross, but it's funny! I think it accurately portrays what happens in a teen's sex life. I liked the character Jim, though...although he gets caught several times his dad was really cool about it, which was the funniest part of the movie. I also liked the fact that Blink-182 made an appearance, too. I recommend this movie to everyone over 15.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not to be taken Seriously</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American Pie is definitely a raunchy comedy. You realize this, five minutes into the film. But also, I think anyone who sees it, realizes it is just a movie, and it shouldn't be taken too seriously. During the summer, the critics, as well as the press, thought this film was meant to expose teenagers. Although this may be true, all teens who see this, know that is is a comedy, most of the things that happen in the film, already happen in high school today. It's plot basically involves four high school boys, who make a pact to loose their virginity before their high school prom, which is in about three weeks. Only one of the young boys has a girlfriend. From there, it gets even funnier. The cast, which turned a lot of un-known's to stardom, was great. Jason Biggs really has a lot of potential, few will forget his famous 'pie scene,' nor will you forget Shannon Elizabeth's character, Nadia, after she exposes herself on the Internet. Watch this film with your friends, or a date, but definitely not with your parents!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>American Pie is probably the funniest teen movie of 1999. It made big bucks at the box office too. I am glad they picked some fresh faced to the screen. I think this was Jason Biggs first big screen movie. This movie would have sucked if they picked dawson creek kids. The only WB teen star they did use was Alyson Hannigan, she is great, they should put her in more movies. Thomas Ian Nicholas, i recognize him from kid movies like Kid In King Arthers Court. Im glad that he is moving on. The cast was perfect. Its good they didnt use James Van Der Beek or Katie Holmes or Sarah Michelle Gellar...the list goes on! I was mad they didnt show more of Natasha Lyonne. i LOVE her!!! I liked the plot too, 4 friends making a pact to loose there virginity by prom night. This was a funny ass movie! i watched it twice already. i give it 4 stars out of 4, i recomend every parent and teen sees this. if u r under the age of 13, i would tell your parents not to let you watch this because it has very bad language, nudity, sex scenes, and some information you little kids dont need to know yet!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fusion of raunchiness and warmth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"American Pie" is not you average teen flick. It's reputation for being raunchy and outrageous is totally justified, given the fact that it does refer to, and sometimes show, everything involved with sex, from bodily fluids to masturbation to using food as a a metaphor for third base. It's sort of like a "Fast Times at Ridgemont High" touched with "There's Something About Mary" grossness. Believe it or not, this film is relentlessly honest when it examines teen guys, with their consistently raging hormones, driving them to explore just about everything. Yeah, it does get a bit silly at times, but is also, strangely, illuminates alot of information about teens adults don't know about, or probaly don't wanna believe. But it's not like the lead characters are one-dimensional youths trying to get laid, there are actually some touching moments near the end where they come to realisation that relationships and love will always be more fulfilling than scoring. "American Pie" manages to successfully combine hilarious toilet-humour with warmth, and it owes a lot of credit towards the performances, everyone showcases potential, including Jason Biggs. Okay, so it's gags do get a but tiresome, and some character's don't develop well, but overall "American Pie" is a teen comedy worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this movie was going to be sick and perverted and stupid. 2 out of 3 is right, it is sick and perverted, but it wasn't stupid, well it was, but it was hilarious! Being a teenage, hormonal guy, i can relate to Jim, Finch, Oz, and the other guy. They remind me of me and my friends. The quiet guy, the geek, the jock, and the nice guy.Basically this movie is about four guys, Jim Biggs, who needs to learn to pleasure himself in the bathroom becuase he gets caught every flippin time, Jim is quiet and doesn't exactly know what to say to girls, even if the most beautiful girl is naked in his own bedroom. Then there's Finch, classy, high society, and never sh*ts at school, always goes home, everyone calls him Shitbreak. Then there's Oz, he's on the lacrosse? team, and needs to learn how to be sensitive, then there's the other guy with the hot girlfriend, who is more experienced than any of the other three combined. After a party of hopeless attempts to get some play, they decide to make a pact to get laid on prom night.This is definetly one of the funniest movies i have seen in a while. My favorite character was Michelle, the band girl. "One time at band camp" is the beginning of her every sentence and "it was so funny." is the end of all them. She was so hilarious. I give "American Pie" 10 stars!! Oh yeah, Stifler's mom WAS a milf. heh heh heh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The 90's "Porky's"...and something much better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American Pie is a funny and alarmingly clever film that became one of the sleeper hits of the summer of 1999. It is a teenage T/A film, reminiscent of those produced during the eighties featuring such superstars as Phoebe Cates and that girl from "Tomboy." However, American Pie is well made, well cast, and delivers exactly what it intended to do, while others of its mold, such as the Porky's series, simply lapse into derivative slapstick and un-funny scenes.I found American Pie to be very imaginative and incredibly witty, and it depicts the lives of teenagers in a sweet light that could have easily degenerated into some sort of "Kids"-esque oversexed romp. Young adult viewers will enjoy this film not because of its truthful story line or dead-on performances, but rather its non-complicated gross-out comedy. In other words, parents don't faint when you decide to take a seat next to your son or daughter and watch it.Highly recommended.</fullReview>

The humour is toilet humour, sure, but its toilet humour dressed up in a tweed jacket and smoking a pipe, whilst listening to some good jazz. Male or female, old or young, I recomend this film.

The jokes are as immature as the film's protagonists; a rather milky glass of beer, for example. But there is something strangely endearing about the characters as they each discover sex and its implications and that maybe it isn't such a fine conquest at all. The actors don't have to try hard to be funny when they face us with their problems (premature ejaculation, a rather bad case of the squirts) but in the end it is nice to see what becomes of them as they finally get what is coming to them.It is juvenile, there is no doubt, but it is hard not to come out with a daft smile on your face, knowing you have seen something so frank and blatant, it couldn't possibly be made up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, what can I say that hasn't already been said? Now, I know this movie is called a comedy, but I found it a little too gross to laugh at sometimes. At any rate, I really like social satire, from obvious sources like "Saturday Night Live" and "National Lampoon" to more hidden forms, like anything by Mel Brooks ("Blazing Saddles" especially) and "South Park." American Pie sounded like a neat idea, because I don't think that the 90's have been spoofed enough. In the 60s, social satires like THE PRODUCERS were around. Then, there was BLAZING SADDLES in '74. The 80s gave us "Fast Times at Ridgemont High" which I liked alot. But the 90s has given us either 60s throwbacks or fantasy satire(where the film is satirizing something that doesn't really exist!) Now, I know that if someone made a movie(like BLAZING SADDLES) with negative images of minorities, or dancing Nazis,there would be riots in Washington. But maybe, that's where these new comdies and "satires" go wrong. Instead of blithely attacking current issues (racism, political corruption, murder), they go after themes that were cliches back in 1580 when William Shakespeare was the world's leading satirist! AMERICAN PIE is nothing more than a more graphic teen love story. It's saitre could be seen on a variety of levels- we could perceive it as a representation of the carefree 90s, where little can go wrong. we could perceive it as an attack on the machine age a la MODERN TIMES (the Internet camera left on in the room) And we could perceive it as a comment on the voyeurism that goes on today (the friends eagerly watching the TV hookup to the room, etc.) Take it or leave it, AMERICAN PIE was the "big" movie during the summer of '99-the summer that Hollywood agreed that audiences were ready for scenes in a kids' comedy that are more shocking than the most disturbing images of SCHINDLER'S LIST or SAVING PRIVATE RYAN! My only problem with the whole thing is that in twenty-five years, AMERICAN PIE will seem just as shocking-but in a different way. How- I don't know. But, witness BLAZING SADDLES. I mean, it couldn't get released today because of the racism, but in 1974 the racism was the least of the problems-it was the language and the famous campfire scene. But today, the language heard in that R-rated movie can be heard in any PG rated movie or TV show, and the campfire scene can be found in such children's movies as DENNIS THE MENACE! So, I wonder, in 25 years, where this movie will stand. The sex scenes won't be the problem. The problem will be something that we don't even notice today. What-I don't know, but it will be interesting to find out what it will be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see this film with a group of girls and they found this film funny as well as me, but I found it hysterically funny. It just shows that this film caters for all tastes not just the guys of the cinema world. Well I don't think the scene with the girl masturbating would suit some girls tastes! I wouldn't see the film on a date but with a group of mates, it's just perfect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crude, but very, very funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American Pie is a film about virginity, and the race to lose it. The film looks at the exploits of four friends who make a pact to 'become men' by prom night. What makes this difficult is thae fact that only one has a girlfriend, and even she doesn't know if she wants to go all the way. Of the other three, one is a jock who has to learn how to treat ladies with a little more respect, and the other two are completely inept at even talking to girls. Needless to say, this mix provides for some great laughs and entertainment.American pie is crude, there's no doubt about it. Some scenes push the limit of taste, but it is very, very funny. You will never again see an apple pie the same way; this same goes for flutes, 'pale ale', 'nature' channels and 'helping' out foreign students.The acting was also pretty good. The scenes with Jim's dad were absolute classics. Poor old Jim gets caught every time he tries something different.I was just about rolling around on the cinema floor.All in all, a funny film that's not meant to be taken with a grain of salt; it has no real message, it's not serious, but you'll leave with a smile on your face, and if you're old enough, will bring back fond memories of your own escapades as a high school kid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I thought this movie was going to be one of those puerile farces where getting laid is the Holy Grail that all of the characters aspire to. Leaving the cinema, I was pleased that some of the characters had a bit of depth - in particular, Oz, the jock who joins the choir to plumb its resources, only to fall in love and become truly sensitive. I also loved the character of Finch. I kept thinking that the actor who played him, Eddie Kaye Thomas , reminds me of a cross between a young Nicholas Cage and Steve Buscemi. One to watch out for in future projects? I also admired the fact that condoms were given a large amount of screen time, showing how important they are in today's society. Funny? Yes. Farcical? No.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sweet? Inoffensive? Sentimental?! What IS happening to the gross-out movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm sorry. I go to gross-out movies to see a mounting series of disgusting, childish mishaps befall relatively pleasant characters. I want to see scenes that should probably never have been allowed. I want humiliation, body failure, slapstick and the obligatory liquid scene. This AMERICAN PIE provides in mild-mannered spades. What I don't want is maturity and Prince Hal.It could be argued that THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY, last year's Hollywood masterpiece, leavened its gross-out with generous portions of ick, but a love quest was built into that film from the beginning, the success or failure of which was going to have an emotional effect. Also, the characters were significantly older than the kids of AMERICAN PIE, so the pay-off was more believable, and because the characters were so sweet, more satisfying.AMERICAN PIE is about a quartet of hormonal boys who want to get laid before they go to college. As 49% of the population experience this agony at some time in their lives, the film has to be pretty accurate in its details to succeed, and it largely is. The guys are very likeable and believable, their mishaps ring very true. Their worldview shapes the film, and is rarely betrayed. The film, which everyone compares to PORKY'S, is miles above that infantile gag in its relatively even-handed treatment of women, who are not the inscrutable, unattainable, type, but a varied, complex lot. Even the set-piece with Nadja, which begins as sheer exploitation, ends up with the male lead deeply humiliated. The universal implications of the title are a wild misnomer: it should have been called Upper-Middle-Class American Pie. Every character lives in a big house, with no real dysfunction, so that they can afford to spend all their time fretting about sex (I'd forgotten how much EFFORT goes into this, though). Every character is going to college; every main character is white. An AMERICAN PIE from the projects would be a very different film.For a comedy to be lastingly funny, there has to be trauma. That's why the mature angst of one couple strikes me as false. The growing relationship of another is lovely, but unlikely: it's like gross-out films lack the bottle to go all the way - the repulsiveness has to sweetened. The Farellys tried with KINGPIN, but were accused of misogyny, even misanthropy. Only SOUTH PARK dared to go all the way, cynically parodying feel-good redemption, But, hey, that was only a cartoon, right? And yet, even the maturity is a lie. The characters learn that a selfish obsession with having sex is not the most important thing in life, and yet they do anyway.But I don't know why I'm carping. AMERICAN PIE is a side-splitting hoot from start to finish. LIke all the best comedy, the humiliation is linked to character, and Jim's experiences especially are among the funniest things I've seen in years - the practicing; the understanding talks given by his father; his immortal strip-tease; the pie! Priceless. Shame he looks like a cross between Ross Geller and Adam Sandler.A more satisfying melancholy concerns the allusions to Hal and Falstaff. Like the former, the characters have big careers in front of them, and must reject the exuberant licentiousness of their youth. There is a real sense of loss at the end, of a time having certainly past, which is perversely moving. Most adult figures condone, even encourage, the teenage hi-jinx: they know it's as good as it's going to get.None of the misfortunes really spring from malice, so there is rarely a bad taste left in one's mouth (except Stifler's). Director Weitz could become a great comedy director - he knows how to cut scenes short for maximum effect: more experienced comedians drag on and on. My only complaint would be the relatively short space allocated to Finch - he is a wonderful character, filled with a strange, devious self-confidence behind his apparent geekiness: you've got to like a guy who can wisecrack in Latin.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometimes I laughed, sometimes I cringed, sometimes I creaked in my chair hoping for the film to pull itself out of "Dawson's Creek Mode""American Pie" is nothing more than a childish comedy with a supposed morale-edge. This morale-tone fades with every scene as the perfect-skinned girls and our troupe of heros eventually "get it on".Far from being hopeless, "AP" trips itself up by being too lewd. It begins to stutter and grind as the ending approaches and before long even the enthusiastic members of the audience began to realise the film was running out of steam.Not bad, not good: but still worth it for *that* scene.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>American Pie concerns itself with four likable virgin teenagers three weeks before their graduation. Each fears leaving high school a virgin and so they make a pact to help each other score before their graduation.There are some scenes in this movie that out-gross There's Something About Mary and that's some feat but the overall tone is sweet. It's possibly the best-natured teenage movie for a while. The four leads are convincing. Jason Biggs as Jim gets possibly the most embarrasing role in recent years (he's the guy with the pie on the poster) but he gets most of the laughs. Kevin is the most experienced of the three. He has a full time girlfriend and their relationship becomes the cornerstone of the film's drama. Both are unsure of their relationship and how sex should fit in it. Finch is the shyest and strangest characters. He borders on a nerd but he formulates a plan to make him the most talked about boy in the girls locker room. The only unconvincing element of the four guy's adventures was with "Oz". His efforts border on sentimentality and his playing of a character who wants to find his sensitive side doesn't work.The supporting cast are used effectively. The girls are not just objects of affection. They are fully developed characters in their own right. Possibly the funniest lines come from Stifler. An experienced jock who enjoys teasing the four. American Pie is hardly family fun. For me it's success shows that there are a lot of under-age teenagers sneaking into theatres. It may be a gross-out comedy but hey it's heart is in the right place.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film yesterday. It has a 15+ rating and when buying my ticket, I was asked how old I was (I'm 20). Anyway, my friends and I were surrounded by a pack of practically pre-pubescent "I just turned fifteen today" year-olds.I had heard that this movie was shocking, and not for the weak-of-stomach. But I should have realised that with it's rating, it couldn't be too "out there".I admit that I did find the movie amusing, and it was interesting to see Alyson Hannigan outside of Buffy. But I did feel old, and the camera-work made me feel a bit dizzy. Having all the conversations filmed directly from the perspective of the non-talking participant meant way too many close-ups, and I started to wonder about that perpetually stray strand of hair of Oz's, and the lack of subtlety as regards the guy's eye make-up.Some scenes seemed totally unbelievable. I don't think anyone I know would start masturbating in a virtually unknown guy's bedroom, while they were 'getting changed'. I also don't see how it's acceptable to show a lithe female naked except for a pair of lacy undies, when the male equivalent is a flaccid youth with disturbing boxers.Basically, it was a funny movie, but I wouldn't really class it as shocking. I guess I've grown up since I've left high school.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At the time at which I write, American Pie has not yet hit the Australian box office. I, along with a few lucky punters taking part in a promotion, was pleased to discover that the Mystery Movie at our local cinema was this film (thank god it wasn't Big Daddy or Deep Blue). Anyway, I remember this one time, at band camp...What can I say? The whole thing is almost a conglomeration of cliches but I've studied films in cultural studies that twist familiar things to make them interesting and original - like American Pie. I think all the 'bad' guys (Stifler and Sherman) get what's coming to them, as does Jim though he's actually pleased. Everything works out rather nicely and surprisingly - I mean, how many people thought things were going to be resolved about halfway when Finch seemed to have everything under control, Jim has the Czech girl over his house, Oz had 'won' the girl and Vicky had finally decided to do it with Kev? But the film ploughed on and these situations started to change and I was like, so how are Jim and Finch supposed to get laid now? But with very clever twists it all gets resolved. Love this resolving that's running rife in movies these days!Well, I must say it was an enjoyable film, utterly hilarious at parts (the apple pie is just one bit). You gotta love quotes like "Scotch in the cupboard on the right... aged 18 years - just the way I like it." (Stifler's mother) and little things like Jim's 'strip' which almost saved him from humiliation (the deftly aimed shirt). I'll shut up now. Go and see it or you won't know what anyone's talking about.I remember this one time, at band camp...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, "American Pie" is a tasteless, disgusting, raunchy and obscene, but it's also sweet and F***ING HILARIOUS! This film has been called a teenage version of "There's Something About Mary." However, I feel it exceeds "There's Something About Mary" simply because there were much more individually funny moments than "Mary." Sure, the "hair gel" scene in "Mary" made me fall out of my chair in the theatres, but those laughs were few and far between. In "American Pie," moments like that flooded of the screen into the back of the theatre. The distinct difference between "American Pie" and "There's Something About Mary" is that you can be along and still laugh hysterically at "Pie," whereas with "Mary," you have to feed off an audience's reaction to what is happening on screen. "American Pie" is the best and funniest teen film ever. It is hilarious, sweet and so much fun all at once. I will never be able to watch "Buffy, The Vampire Slayer" the same again and not think, "Say My Name, B****!" Those who have seen the movie already know what I am talking about.</fullReview>

Think of "American Graffiti" from a different angle. With as much fun as "Ferris Bueller"What we found was that ALL the characters in the movie were multi-dimensional even the girls who usually suffer from the cardboard sex-object treatment in these things.Anyone that doesnt think this movie is representational and realistic -yes, even the gross-outs- is suffering from denial or delusions. ..

		<fullReview>Warning: This Review Contains Plot MaterialI really liked this movie a lot. A lot of the scenes were great (including the now infamous Jason Biggs and the Pie scene), and the acting was hilarious and excellent.I thought the two strongest characters who really made this movie extremely entertaining were Eugene Levy and Alyson Hannigan, and I don't think many people disagree with me there. Eugene Levy, playing Jason Biggs' father, was just downright hilarious as usual. Seeing someone like Eugene giving a sex-ed role like he did was just so funny. Like when he saw the condoms in his sons room, or the opening scene (I still laugh thinking about this) when he walks in on his son....I just can't get enough of how funny Eugene Levy was in that movie.The same goes true for Alyson Hannigan. Seeing her play the "geek" (no offense) on TV's Buffy, the Vampire Slayer, a show that I love, and then seeing her change of character in this movie is hilarious. At first, you see her pretty much resembling her dorky character in Buffy, but then she suddenly changes, and she becomes a totally different person. It has to be one of the funniest things I have seen on the silver screen in a long time.I really liked this movie, and I recommend it for anyone who wants to be purely entertained, because this is what American Pie does, and in a very big way. Go see this movie soon. My grade: A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good film reflecting teens sexuality issues</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American Pie is a great movie. Why? I'll try to explain... When I first saw the film i laughed at the scenes where Jim was discovering his own sexuality, or lack thereof. But if you think about it for a second, isn't that the problem of many, many American teens nowadays? Adults are constantly proclaiming that sex is bad, something you should stay away from until you are at least 67! I so very often see adult Americans tell their mid-puberty-hormones-going-wild teen kids to stay away from all things fun, and not to forget - natural. "We accept the world presented to us" Ed Harris said in The Truman Show, and I agree to that. If I were told all my life that blue actually is red - I would believe it, but that doesn't make it right. American Pie shows us all that sex is a problem teens struggle with, and it is the parents obligation and privelidge to assist and guide their children. A very important point here is "guide", it's better to tell your children "how to" rater "not to", I believe. "Man shaped in Gods vision" ring a bell? Just kidding. We need more reality in films, especially American films. Even a comedy like American Pie can have an important story to tell, and I believe this film gived it a very good try, perfect I'd say. Today's society needs some "Grrrr" and "Swinging, baby" as a great british spy would say! So my final comment is that American Pie is a great film, very funny, the actors do a good job portraying young frustrated, scared and real teenagers longing for "love". It makes a good point which can be helpful in life, for both parents and children. Is it dangerous to tell kids that sex is allright? No! Love and sexuality is a great thing! And it's important.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well...that is my opinion. But the truth is, I haven't seen one teen movie that could match the joy and excitement that "The Breakfast Club" (1985) could ever offer a movie viewer!I saw this movie last night, and while watching it in the beginning, I thought it was going to be boring, because it started out very slow in the beginning. I was thinking in my mind, "Please don't make me disappointed!"Plus, I thought that I would end up rating this movie a five instead, but as the movie extended from the beginning to middle to end, I began to think differently. It was really hilarious, outrageous, and fun! It brings a lot of laughs and attracts attention to all movie lovers and of course, teens.What I loved best about "American Pie" was that it had a mixture of romance and comedy and friendship. It shows the excitement of being young, happy, and free especially when it is your senior year in high school. I truly did enjoy "American Pie"! It's a light hearted, bubbly, fun, and hilarious comedy that not only teens can enjoy, but also adults (just don't take young children to see this movie...you'll see what I mean)!This is my favorite teen movie of ALL TIME!!!!!!! - "The Breakfast Club" comes second...of course! :o)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, in this world of mimicry, its no surprise that movie producers have much less room for innovation than for duplication. American Pie is yet another example of this. After the suprise hit "Theres something about Mary" was released last year, Universal just had to get in on the action. So they made a film with a similar theme, reduced the target audience age by about 10 years, and "American Pie" was born. Only now we have a film which is so gross, so tasteless, and so immature that it makes Mary look like a G rated family adventure. If you think the hair gel scene in Something about Mary was pushing it, check out the expectoration-beer scene in this movie.I've always been a huge fan of the 1980s comedy skin flicks like Porky's, and don't really mind gross humor (I loved Trainspotting) as long as its got something good to balance it. But all this film has is annoying teens drinking, reading porn, and finding new ways to beat a proverbial dead horse (don't even consider that a pun) with a nonsensical apple pie scene that has already been made notorious from TV advertisements. Sure there are a few attempts to make this film seem original and innocuous, like a choir subplot and Eugene Levy's fatherly concern (He happens to be a likeable guy), but nearly every scene in this movie revolves around boringly crude bodily function humor.Im sure this movie will do well when released on video, its an ideal teen slumber party feature, but its a far cry from its much handier 80s progenitors. If Cinemax ever decided to have an adult TGIF, this would surely be their focal point. After all, its merely an R rated version of "Boy Meets World."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>American Pie - ***This film tells the story of four male high school friends in Michigan who enter into a pact with each other to lose their virginity by prom night. Jim (Jason Biggs) is an average kid who finds himself tongue-tied whenever he attempts to speak to a beautiful classmate like Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth,) a foreign exchange student. Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) has already gotten to third base with his longtime sweetheart Vicky (Tara Reid,) but he cannot figure out how to... steal home. Oz (Chris Klein) is a Lacrosse jock who joins the choir in order to meet chicks. There he meets Heather (Mena Suvari,) who becomes his duet partner. Finally there is Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas.) A true outsider at the school, Finch supplies his friends with homework assignments and refuses to use public restrooms. During the weeks preceding prom night, the guys pursue various romantic entanglements. Sometimes they find enlightenment, sometimes they find humiliation, but mostly they find humor.When American Pie arrived in theaters, it was already cloaked in controversy. Here is a mass market comedy, geared toward teens, which barely escapes the dreaded NC-17. The film is so raunchy that it has been dubbed "There's Something About Pastry." Consider the tag line on the poster: "There's Something About Your First Piece." Is the movie too raunchy? No - but it pushes the envelope. There are three scenes in particular which will probably achieve a certain infamy. Let us quickly dispense with them so we can move on to the rest of the film. (1) The opening scene, in which Jim finds a unique use for a tube sock. (2) The party scene, where Stifler (Seann W. Scott) takes a drink of beer only to find that it is laced with a certain bodily secretion that was taboo in the mainstream cinema until 1998. (3) The scene in which Jim has intimate relations with an apple pie. Yes, the aforementioned scenes are crass, but are they funny? Jim's scenes are, because they both end in his being caught by his father. And they both reinforce the awkwardness and desperation of the teenage male. Stifler's scene, however, is merely gratuitous.Perhaps the most surprising thing about American Pie is its warm-hearted center. Unlike Porky's or any of the other alleged "sex comedies" of the 80s, American Pie gives all of its characters, both male and female, well-rounded personalities. Of course the guys are interested in sex. But they're also supportive friends to each other, and they're interest in women is multi-dimensional. Oz, for instance, finds that he falls in love with Heather. What started out as a crass conquest turns into a rather sweet romance. The picture is also quite funny at times. I particularly liked the scenes between Jim and his father (Eugene Levy.) Another blockbuster scene is the one in which Jim performs a striptease for Nadia. What Jim does not know is that his performance is being beamed across the internet. American Pie is also successful in the way it presents us with the standard teenage stereotypes (jock, nerd, choir girl, band girl, etc.) and then proceeds to tear them down and show us that all of these characters have other dimensions.Alas, the film sometimes gets in its own way. The direction, by Paul Weitz, is rather rudimentary, even clumsy at times. The truly romantic moments are undermined by dreary, by-the-numbers musical interludes. Finally, I felt that the film sometimes reveled too much in the humiliation of its characters. Granted, humiliation is a part of life in high school. That is why I liked Jim's sexual encounters with Nadia, the sock, and the pie; while Jim was humiliated, his father would painfully try to explain that "it's perfectly natural." But I felt the movie crossed the line when Stifler slipped Finch a laxative, leading to an embarrassing encounter in the women's restroom. This served absolutely no dramatic purpose. Likewise, the character of Sherman (Chris Owen) achieves total public embarrassment at the conclusion of the picture. Dramatically it is meant to be Sherman's comeuppance, but I felt that it was too harsh - even for him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gross but Hilarious!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Probably the funniest slapstick movie of the year! I laughed out loud non-stop! The story follows the attempts of 4 high school guys trying to lose their virginity before they graduate. Their antics are ridiculous but funny! Sure some scenes, like the pie scene or the "stuff" in the beer scene, were nasty and extremely distasteful. But the movie had strong performances and a hilariously entertaining script. Shannon Elizabeth is the highlight of the film! It comes across as a "guy flick" but I think both genders would enjoy the film. I strongly recommend this film to anyone who isn't offended by some extremely distasteful content.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You'll never look at Apple Pie the same way again.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's really nothing spectacular about American Pie other than the fact that it really is funny as hell. I found myself in a state of general disbelief in several parts of the film (namely the opening scene and the now infamous pie scene which both featured humor at Jason Biggs' expense). Yeah, this movie is Porky's with better writing and more heart - but hey, so what? Who didn't love the Teenage Sex Comedy genre when it was on top years ago? Alright, movies like Meatballs Three sunk that ship (and rightfully so) but now the genre (as they all seem to do) has returned with a bang.Looking back on those movies from the eighties, the realization occurs that they just weren't all that funny. American Pie is very funny. There were points while watching Pie when I couldn't hear most of the follow up jokes to the big gags because the audience was laughing so loud. The characters (both male and female) are certainly likable enough even though it's not clear whether there is a future star amongst the young actors (though Biggs deserves something for his self-deprecation). However, proper accolades must go to veteran comedic actor Eugene Levy who is simply brilliant as Jim's straight-laced dad. It is their hilarious and at times very touching relationship that really shone through for me. Call me crazy but if there is any justice at the Oscars this year Levy will get a supporting actor nomination. But, alas, we all know that comic actors seldom get the nods they deserve from the academy (Murray got wrongfully slighted for Rushmore last year in my opinion).Overall, American Pie is perhaps the best Teenage Sex Comedy of all time. So, if you're starved for a delightful romp or if you've ever been to band camp?</fullReview>

What makes the film great is an excellent cast (the youngsters from this film are unbelievable) and the absence of that stupid consumer-society predictability that colors all those commercial Hollywood productions. The extent of predictability still found here is excused by our sympathy to the protagonists and so familiar troubles they go through. A thumb up. Bravo!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>AT LAST, THE FIRST FRUIT OF THE SUMMER CROP OF MOVIES</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most emotionally true films of the year has arrived, dressed in the costume of gross out comedy benefiting from "There's Something About Mary's" raising the bar on semen jokes and other not-for-polite-company material. One of the biggest hurdles to producing a good film about the high school experience - which seems to be a bigger factor in determining character to the average American than college - is getting a handle on believability. With so many seemingly overwhelming forces at work (academic demands, budding sexuality, growing peer pressure), teens lead unacknowledged complicated lives. Also, it is the last time many will be truly unique individuals, before society and its media bombardment flatten out the rough edges. "American Pie" scores on getting it right.Starting with the casting, this is a film where the writers and director have shunned the "Hollywood version" with every decision they made. Instead of a cast culled from the best looking members of (fill in teen-targeted TV show here), these are the people I went to class with. The central quartet has only one member of better than average looks. Yet Oz (Chris Kline) is so aware of it that it makes him try awkward come-ons only Sean Connery as 007 could pull off. The rest look like any student you could pick at random out of a yearbook. The central character, Jim (Jason Biggs), is the goofiest looking. Which, of course, is what we all thought of ourselves in high school isn't it?The biggest surprise of "Pie" to the uninitiated will be that it's antecedents turn out to be not "Porky's" and rip-offs, but "The Waltons" and "Family." The four buddies learn that getting laid by the prom is not what they thought it would be. Each gets a different "life lesson" as they pursue unlike paths to that common goal. Those lessons give them and the viewer an unexpected warm-fuzzy feeling. In that regard, "Pie" will be a valuable political instrument for the next year. "Say what, Mr Kotter?!" Well, anytime you hear some blow-hard going on about decency and family values and decides to hold up "American Pie" as an example of Hollywood's moral deficiency, you'll instantly know he's full of s***.The only real deficiency is with a storyline centering on the four young men, the young women don't get much to do beyond interaction. Which is a shame, because it wastes the talent of Natasha Lyonne who I could watch for hours longer than the surface-only charm of Shannon Elizabeth's Hustler-loving Czech exhange student. Alyson Hannigan (who does star in one of those TV teen show, but don't hold it against her) is another standout whose brief screen time does make sense for her character's payoff. But this is a movie about four guys (any writers want to pick up that gauntlet and make one about four gals?).Admittedly, everyone's high school experiences are no the same. "American Pie's" depiction did mirror my own to a degree that surpasses the last benchmark of well-received school days angst, "The Breakfast Club." It's a shame the R-rated comedy will turn off many of those bemoaning the lack of films about values and decency because "Pie" has those qualities proudly. It doesn't hurt it's also one f**king funny movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I absolutely love this film! Whether America was ready or not, a movie with this much likeness to the concept of sex in today's youth was LONG overdue. While many recent teen films such as VARSITY BLUES, JAWBREAKER, and even the happily-ever-after SHE'S ALL THAT have touched on sex in their movies, it has been only the tip of the iceberg of how us teens really are when it comes to sex.I am an 18 year old male, recently graduated from a small town high school where sex is an important focus of adolescents. For most of us, sex doesn't come that easy or smoothly, so people indeed needed somewhat of a reality check, which is adequately portrayed in this film. I highly recommend this movie to any adults who want a sufficient glance at sex in high school, teens who want a night of laughter (and a new topic of discussion), and children who desire their first peek at what's to come in the next few years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a season that has been saturated with nasty humor ("Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me" and "South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut" being the chief offenders), the lack of tact in "American Pie" is at least more honest and justified. This is a fair treatment of American teens, a good examination of their follies and their virtues and the hormonal imbalances that taint their relationships. It's also Eugene Levy's best film -- granted, that's not saying much -- and a springboard for Jason Biggs.A little too much dependency on bathroom humor and intermittent slumps in the writing put this at a solid 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really remember very little of this movie. Not because I wasn't paying attention, but rather because the writing was so light and fluffy, I never really got a feel for who the main characters were. This is a movie about events and actions rather than emotion or even thought. There are definitely some funny moments in the film, but I never really laughed out loud. I think that perhaps if I were a junior high student, I might enjoy the jokes a bit more. The film feels like an 80's teen comedy with a few sexual jokes thrown in. I liked the character of Stifler, the profanity spouting cretin that all of us have to deal with at least once in our lives. Eddie Kaye Thomas reminds me of a young Nicholas Cage in his role as Finch with a kind of lazy charm. The music is fairly standard for this type of film.I try not to go into a movie with any expectations, but this movie was really disappointingly average, sickeningly sweet, and unrealistic. The main characters in The Wood, a movie with a similar premise, are much more interesting, believable, and intelligent. Frankly, even the characters in Tarzan have more depth and personality. I only recommend this movie to those who enjoy shutting off their brains for a couple hours (not always a bad thing to do).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A movie about teenagers and sex. This is nothing new. It would be no surprise that this movie would spend it's opening week at #1. But would there be substance to PIE or just flakes. As it began there were a few laughs. I enjoyed the opening tube sock scene and the ordeal with the beer at Stifler's party but it didn't impress me. Funny yes,...substance no! There more I watched the more I was impressed. It defined the teenage male so accurately and comically while at the same time creating some substance. Oz, a jock, explores his sensitive side in chorus and falls in love rather than just lusting. Ofcourse there is lots of shallow humor but that can be lots of fun too. I was especially impressed by "Sh*t break's" scene with Mrs. Stifler...the "Mrs. Robinson" song playing (in reference to Dusitn Hoffman's 1967 movie "The Graduate" about his experience with an older woman ) blew me away! I loved that a movie like this would pay tribute to such a classic! All in all, great flick for the younger generation to enjoy mostly. I was surprise by the depth in this movie.

		<fullReview>American Pie stands out in my mind immediately as a "great film". The score was full of excellent music that plays along with the mood and the characters were three-dimensional and acted out a great script.This film is hilarious. Non-stop laughs are seamlessly combined with well-developed emotional content. You will never find yourself let down with anything that happens, the plot carries you on to each step successfully and beautifully. A big plus is watching as the characters develop and grow - as well as waiting to see what will surprise you next.As the ending approaches you may begin to wonder how the finale can top the rest of the movie. In the final climax you will laugh, you may cry, but you will not be able to leave for the bathroom. You will not be disappointed.The teenage-oriented, sex-crazed humor may bother some people. If you're looking for a love story along the lines of "10 Things I Hate About You", then you need to shift your expectations. Though the movie delivers well in story-development and romance, it is walked along with humor and surprise. Overall, this film has an excellent cast, great score, and plenty of good-natured humor which come together to produce a wholly entertaining and enjoyable experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I absolutely love this movie. With the last couple of movie seasons having been bombarded with some of the cheesiest we're-cute-teenagers-graduating-and-getting-ready-to-face-the-world flicks in years, I was psyched to finally see a movie that was hilarious, somewhat heartfelt, and didn't make me gag. Most high school movies have found it necessary to deal with the anxiety teens face when preparing to go to college, and have forgotten about their more basic concerns. As people get older, they forget about what it was like to fear virginity and getting laid at the same time. It was nice to be taken back to such confusing times for a chance to laugh at myself.One tiny editing mistake... when Finch enters the pool room and finds Stifler's mom, he actually pulls the door towards him and walks in. However, when Stifler breaks in on them and faints the following morning, he pushes the door in (thus knocking over the chair holding the door shut). Just thought other anal people might be interested in that little fact. :-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a movie!!!!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was exactly what i expected it to be...raunchy and absolutely hilarious! If you go to this movie expecting much else, you'll be disappointed. Not every high school senior thinks about sex that much, but many do. The people who made the movie said they wanted it to be realistic, and i will tell you that that is how many high schoolers talk and act. Not all, but many. So go see it! It is raunchy, funny and actually has a good moral under tone. And if your date has a sense of humor, it's an awesome date movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seeing all of these good ratings and reviews, I feel alienated speaking badly of "American Pie." Yes, the movie did have it's funny moments, but like someone previously stated, this movie should not be seen by its target audience. "American Pie" appeared to be similar to the much funnier and superior "There's Something About Mary," only it made feeble attempts at mimicking what was in "..Mary." Overall, this movie has its moments. Only problem with it is, there's just moments.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sure, its crude. Yeah, its juvenile. But its absolutely hilarious. I went to see it without having seen any movie trailers, and that made a HUGE difference. Everything was a surprise. After seeing the movie, I did watch a trailer, and was glad I missed it before. It gave everything away!Even if you have seen the trailer, go see the movie. It is fun</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the funniest movie of the century, maybe funniest of the year. Wait no, that was Wild Wild West.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of course for those of you people who don't get it, Wild Wild West sucked. That's why it's the funniest. Well, to American Pie....Austin Powers 2 had its laughs, but was not as great as i had expected. South Park was super hilarious. South Park beats American Pie. Because American Pie is full of preps. And has stupidly mushy scenes. That girl "OZ" liked wasn't that pretty at all. Sorry lady. Well, I laughed my ass off. I would see it again. I probably will. This movie will guarantee laughter. I never knew what "Lacross" was until I saw this movie. It is gross but hilarious.So what do I give it? An 8 out of 10. It lost 2 points for some stupid mushy scenes between preppy people. It just made me feel "Oh go is that? Yes that's Blink 182. 'The sellouts'". Can you believe a girl on MTV who likes N'Sync said "I like Blink 182 and the whole Cailfornia Punk scene"? Not not a scene from "American Pie" just a quote some girl said about Blink 182. Stupid poser.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>AT LAST, THE FIRST FRUIT OF THE SUMMER CROP OF MOVIES</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most emotionally true films of the year has arrived, dressed in the costume of gross out comedy benefiting from "There's Something About Mary's" raising the bar on semen jokes and other not-for-polite-company material. One of the biggest hurdles to producing a good film about the high school experience - which seems to be a bigger factor in determining character to the average American than college - is getting a handle on believability. With so many seemingly overwhelming forces at work (academic demands, budding sexuality, growing peer pressure), teens lead unacknowledged complicated lives. Also, it is the last time many will be truly unique individuals, before society and its media bombardment flatten out the rough edges. "American Pie" scores on getting it right.Starting with the casting, this is a film where the writers and director have shunned the "Hollywood version" with every decision they made. Instead of a cast culled from the best looking members of (fill in teen-targeted TV show here), these are the people I went to class with. The central quartet has only one member of better than average looks. Yet Oz (Chris Kline) is so aware of it that it makes him try awkward come-ons only Sean Connery as 007 could pull off. The rest look like any student you could pick at random out of a yearbook. The central character, Jim (Jason Biggs), is the goofiest looking. Which, of course, is what we all thought of ourselves in high school isn't it?The biggest surprise of "Pie" to the uninitiated will be that it's antecedents turn out to be not "Porky's" and rip-offs, but "The Waltons" and "Family." The four buddies learn that getting laid by the prom is not what they thought it would be. Each gets a different "life lesson" as they pursue unlike paths to that common goal. Those lessons give them and the viewer an unexpected warm-fuzzy feeling. In that regard, "Pie" will be a valuable political instrument for the next year. "Say what, Mr Kotter?!" Well, anytime you hear some blow-hard going on about decency and family values and decides to hold up "American Pie" as an example of Hollywood's moral deficiency, you'll instantly know he's full of s***.The only real deficiency is with a storyline centering on the four young men, the young women don't get much to do beyond interaction. Which is a shame, because it wastes the talent of Natasha Lyonne who I could watch for hours longer than the surface-only charm of Shannon Elizabeth's Hustler-loving Czech exchange student. Alyson Hannigan (who does star in one of those TV teen show, but don't hold it against her) is another standout whose brief screen time does make sense for her character's payoff. But this is a movie about four guys (any writers want to pick up that gauntlet and make one about four gals?).Admittedly, everyone's high school experiences are no the same. "American Pie's" depiction did mirror my own to a degree that surpasses the last benchmark of well-received school days angst, "The Breakfast Club." It's a shame the R-rated comedy will turn off many of those bemoaning the lack of films about values and decency because "Pie" has those qualities proudly. It doesn't hurt it's also one f**king funny movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"American Pie" is a movie that I happen to like tremendously. Some parts of it were funny. The overall context of this film deals with friendship and romance issues, in addition to the sex-related material. Although most of the actors have not been in movies before, I thought that they did a fantastic job of bringing their characters to life. I recommended this movie to all my friends and family. This movie is so wonderful that nobody should miss it! In my opinion, it is way better than "10 Things I Hate About You".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I had to use one word to sum this whole movie up, I wouldn't be able to do it. Words that come to mind are: hilarious, hysterical, raunchy, real and living. Since I'm still in highschool, most of this stuff is gonna make sense to me sooner or later. If I live it or don't live it, it's still funny as hell in the movie.The actors were great. After seeing Rookie of the Year's Thomas Ian Nicholas all grown up, I would keep saying "the rookie is finally gettin some play!" Well if you were there, it would be funnier to you. And if you had the mind of my friends and I, you would understand. Enough with the inside jokes, this movie is a classic. Whether you are in highschool now or graduated years ago, as long as you were at once a fun loving teen, I GUARANTEE you will love, laugh and cry for this movie. Well not sad crying but hysterical laughing crying. i'm out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Without a doubt, one of the funniest movies of 1999. I never laughed so hard at a movie since...well since "There's Something About Mary". This movie brought back memories of my days of high school romping. Every 5 years a movie like this needs to come out so people can remember what high, school, love, and sex was like when we were young. The acting was actually pretty decent, and these unknown kids did a wonderful job portraying high school teenagers looking for love. Would like to see a sequel with these guys in college. That would be interesting. Go see this movie now, before it leaves the theaters. Nuff said.Ace</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is one of the best comedies of the year!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Going to see American Pie, I was thinking of all the funny trailers on TV, and was looking forward to a good time. But the movie exceeded all my expectations, as not only was this a comedy, it was one to which almost anyone could relate, and see themselves in one of the film's characters. There are several unforgettable scenes, which will no doubt become classics, but the main objective of the movie, along with providing gut-busting laughs, is to present a message that one is free to make his own decisions and to disregard peer pressure. I'm not going to spoil the movie for those who have not seen it yet, because some of the jokes are funny only when seen for the first time, but the jist of it is: YOU HAVE TO SEE AMERICAN PIE if you like to laugh and are any kind of movie buff. It's also a great film to bring a date to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Imagine "Fast Times at Ridgemont High," but funnier and more poignant. This movie is about guys we all knew in high school (heck, some of us were these guys) and every line, every moment rings true. The buzz around this movie are, of course, the gross-out scenes, but what makes this movie work is how much you root for these four guys. You may ask "why I on earth would I care if these clowns 'get some' on prom night." You do because the movie accurately reflects that sex is on every teenage boys mind, all the time, while reminding us that it's really the women who control the situation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I originally went to this movie because I wanted to see Jason Biggs act. If I went again, it would be because I loved the movie itself. It's more than just a shock-show of toilet humor. It's actually full of lessons on life and love. I was pleasantly surprised at Oz(Chris Klein)'s transformation. I laughed and nodded my head at the heroes' mistakes. I could empathize with them. Although it's naturally a little exaggerated, being a comedy and all, it's pretty honest about what goes on in high school. And more than making me laugh, it made me think. It doesn't hurt that just about all the actors were stunningly good-looking either. :) I definitely recommend this movie for parents as well as teens over 16. You'll love it and learn from it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I decided to see this movie at the last minute, because "Eyes Wide Shut" was so long, the last showing at the theater was 7:45pm. I was not disappointed at all. This movie has laughs all 'round, most of them coming from the supporting cast, including Allison Hannigan's "Band Camp Geek", and Eugene Levy. The lines they say were as funny, if not more funny, than the visual jokes in the film. I've seen three high school films in a row this year, including "She's All That" and "Never Been Kissed", and this movie showed high school the way it is, rather than the way it should be. If you want a good sex comedy in the "There's Something About Mary" vein, "American Pie" is for you. Besides, who wants to see Nicole Kidman naked in some boring film anyway, when you could be laughing at sex!?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"American Pie" is a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful film. I saw "South Park" the same day, and "American Pie" totally blew it away. The first scene is can't miss, so don't get to the theater late. On the outside, this film appears to be a buncha horny teens vowing to get laid by prom night. It looks like a totally distasteful movie. But you know, this movie is very tasteful. It's better than "warm apple pie", as they said in the movie. Sure, it has it's gross scenes, but you know, it's all done in relatively good taste. Despite the appearance that the message is for teens to have sex as soon as possible, it's not. There is a message which lies beneath. Sex is not the most important thing in high school, but it sure seems that way. There is a nice message, which plays in near the end of the movie. If you like to laugh, and can take a couple of gross-out scenes, then take a look at "American Pie", the best film of the year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, things have really changed since the "Getting Laid" movies of my generation. Movies like "Porky's" and "Losing It" focus on the silly stuff that occurs when boys are trying to get laid. "Fast Times and Ridgemont High" showed the girl's point of view. With this movie, you get all that, along with (omigosh) actual relationships!Obviously the taboo of showing semen in a movie has been broken forever (thanks to "Mary"). But in spite of that, the movie has a lot of endearing moments, like when Jim's dad keeps giving him the birds-and-the-bees talks and catching him in the absolute most embarrassing masturbation situations.I think what makes the plot brilliant is how things turn so quickly for these five guys (counting Sherman) in the scoring game (or is it the game of life?).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This gross-out coming of age story is funny in spots, but it lacks the comic inspiration that made "There's Something About Mary" so outstanding. Most of the gags in "American Pie" are just gross without bothering to be funny (e.g., a kid mistakes a cup of urine for beer, drinks it, then throws up on his girlfriend. ha, ha, ha. There's also a scene in which one of the characters is shown having diarrhea in the school lavatory, complete with sound effects. The scene has no other reason than just pushing the envelope of movie grossness.). The famous "money scene" of the movie in which an apple pie is used as an onanistic prop was funnier when I read about it than when I actually saw it (the scene also owes a lot to Phillip Roth's novel "Portnoy's Complaint," in which the masturbation-obsessed title character has a go with a piece of liver intended for the family's dinner.) The young characters in the movie are appealing and that alone keeps the movie mildly enjoyable. The funniest scenes are those that are the least gross: Jim's Dad tries to explain the birds and the bees; Finch and his friend's sexy mom (who is like Mrs. Robinson on 'ludes) go about seducing each other (Mom: The scotch is aged 18 years, just the way I like them.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you can get a really big laugh out of toilet humor, and these 4 guys escapades to get laid, then this is the movie for you. I went to see this, and it was excellent. Yet, I'm in High School, and have a very simple mind. It starts out with these guys, who, after a party where the testosterone is in overdrive, decide to create a pact to get laid before graduation, and they decide that prom night is the lucky night. Each one has their own idea of how to get a hottie in bed. One draws to their sensitive side, another tries to get anything in any way possible, and is afraid. It goes on that through their "journey", there are trials and obstacles, and on prom night everything goes crazy. They each go with their dates to a party afterwards, and it is there that "It" happens. My favorite character has to be the band nerd (because I am one myself) who starts everything with something from band camp. We are too alike, and that really frightens me, but for the twisted and strange people of the world, this is our movie.</fullReview>

While many critics have unjustly compared American Pie's gross out factor to last year's There's Something About Mary, a film which rests squarely in the surreal and twisted category, Pie makes a good and solid argument that the fumblings of sexual awareness among teens is at once hideously awkward (parents discovering their son's masturbatory predilections) and uniquely mature (a girl realizing her suitor may not be what he seems). Some may carp that the ending satisfies all concerned just to tie up some loose ends but I think it really is a case of 'to the victors go the spoils.' Not everyone wins, not everyone loses, but hopefully everyone learned.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>TSA Mary was funnier. This was Porky's, Weird Science, the Graduate, and Fast Times at Ridgemont High, all rolled into one. I guess it's been a week since this movie's been opened in Silicon Valley, and this movie was actually sold out at the showing I watched. The laughs were very few for a packed house. Comments from the person I was with? She told me that the movie was just "alright for a matinee." Thank God I only paid for this movie at half the price.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>American Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American Pie is a masterpiece in teenage sex comedy and should be revered as a true throwback to the classic 80s comedies that you see every weekend on USA, TBS and TNT. Ten years from now, we will all be vegging out on our couches watching this movie on cable T.V. just waiting for the Internet scene, which in my opinion will be just as famous as Brad Hamilton pleasuring himself in the bathroom in Fast Times at Ridgemont High and Bluto peeking in to Mandy Pepperidge's window in Animal House.Not only is American Pie filled with memorable scenes that left me rolling in the aisles, but it also contains some of the funniest lines in movie history. How can anyone not appreciate a line like "One time in band camp, I stuck a flute in my p**sy."Much like Three O'Clock High, Weird Science and Some Kind of Wonderful, American Pie dealt with real high school issues. Not only did it make you nostalgic for your high school days, but it was also edgy and offered scenes that many directors would dare not show in today's super-PC world. In fact, they even had to edit the scene involving Finch and Stifler's mom on the pool table, since the actor who played Finch was only 17 years-old at the time of filming.As a lover of cheesy 80s movies, I'm glad someone finally made a movie to compete with the classics turned out a decade ago.</fullReview>

I laughed pretty dang hard. It's raunchy, yes, but not so childish and immature (like an Adam Sandler flick). That's why I was impressed and enjoyed it.

		<fullReview>I saw South Park last week, so not much surprised me tonight when I saw American Pie. The masturbation jokes hit right on the mark. We can all relate to it. There's really not much to say about the plot without giving away too many of the surprises, so I won't say much. The biggest surprise award goes to Alyson Hannigan, who accomplishes more than any other actor with her limited screen time. She does the same in Dead Man on Campus. As far as nudity, there really is not that much, but for those of you who go for that (and who am I to judge?) you probably won't be disappointed. The toilet humor midway through the film involving Finch is the only weak point in this fresh, funny, honest, smart, and often side-splitting motion picture. See it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>American Pie is a great comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I begin reviewing the movie, I would like to ask those of you who have panned this film for being juvenile, why something with sex jokes, or masturbation jokes, is automatically immature and unintelligent. After all these things certainly go on in our society and in the lives of teens today. Any subject, as long as the the way it is presented is clever, can make a good joke.Now, I have to say that this movie was hilarious, but it also had a lot of heart. The point of this movie was not to gross the audience out or to satirize teenage life, but to be a celebration of a difficult but fun time which all of us go through. These characters are not one-dimensional losers as in satires like Beavis and Butthead which attack the stupidity of the generation, but real likeable people going through an extremely tough time which all of us know about. The gross out jokes work so well in the movie, cause we all know they are true. All of us probably know someone who would masturbate with an apple pie to get a better feeling.The performances in this movie were mostly excellent. I especially liked Mena Suvari as Heather. Not only is she beautiful, but she seems destined to be a romantic lead in the class of a Meg Ryan. Jason Biggs and Eddie Kaye Thomas were brilliant as two awkward teens. Eugene Levy is hilarious as Bigg's awkward dad. Although she was not given much to do in the movie, I think that Natasha Lyonne could be the standout of this film. She is so great at playing girls with tough exteriors, like in Slums of Beverly Hills. In this movie, she steps up the attitude, and crudeness, giving some of the funniest lines in the script. All in all, I would say this is a great teen movie, up there with the Pretty in Pink's and Say Anything's of the late eighties. American Pie is hilarious not because of it's crudeness, nor is it insensitive towards women like Porkies, but because it shows in a humane way the insecurities of an everyday teen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They don't make them like this anymore. The most well-done comedy of the year!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Porky's" or "Fast Times at Ridgemont High," are two of the greatest movies of this caliber. American Pie, which does a great job in following suit, is one of the most refreshingly entertaining movies I've seen in the last several years. It contains many pranks as well as many schemes that backfire, and plenty of humor to get the politicians in an uproar. But I was very surprised at the fact that the movie carried many redeeming messages with it. IE, sex, although enjoyable and sometimes being the only goal of horny youngans, is not the most important thing in life, they only think it is. I know I'm not alone in my theory. Many of us were once horny teens who at the very least, THOUGHT about doing unspeakable things to simulate the act of sex. And if you laugh while watching this movie's depiction of this very point, put yourself into that category.Movies about high school have been on the lame side for the last 5 or 6 years. American Pie will hopefully start a rebellion against the "She's All Thats" of the world. I say this because I get offended when directors portray high school as this adult world where everyone knows the score and seems to be so organized and on top of things (ie Dawson's Creek, Beverly Hills 90210). Myself, along with most of the other 440 people in my graduating class (as well as the rest of the country's high shcool population) didn't know anything, now looking back on it.American Pie is a movie for anyone who was once a confused and curious teenager in high school, guys and girls alike. The bluntness of the humor may suggest it's only for men. DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE. Under all the bits and pranks, you will find an actual movie with loads of charm that is well worth your time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>American Pie is a great sex comedy. I would have to agree with another critic in saying that you can't truly appreciate this film unless you're past all that (ie., high school). I also think that you can't really appreciate this unless you spent all four years of high school in the 90s. This film plays on the "hang-ups" that are trademarks of the time.... the pressure to get laid, masturbation, the use of the internet and other technology, etc. The shock value in this film was amazingly high, which I thought is what made the film what it is. It was a great parody of what the general public thinks of high school nowadays.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most comments I have read about this film point out only the "gross-out" elements. What people seem to be missing is this is one of the most realistic films dealing with the subject of teenage sexuality. Yes, some scenes are juvenile. However, the film also portrays safe sex and realistic sex--not the usual "acceptable" Hollywood sex (Jack and Rose have sex after knowing each other for only two days in Titanic, where were the Puritan critics then?). It seems sex is only OK in films if it is glamorous and has no mention of condoms. As a 23 year old female, I appreciated the realistic portrayal of high school boys as I remember--horny and clueless. However, these boys do learn some respect for women, at least more than they had at the beginning of the film; and, the girls do not allow them to get away with their disrespect and juvenile actions. I think this is not a bad film for high schoolers, as it contains no violence and is actually quite entertaining.</fullReview>

I would like to see him do some more movies in the near future. This is some great Canadian talent we are missing.

		<fullReview>I have read the other reviews left by other users and professional critics. Most agree that this movie is funny however some disapprove of this movie because its vulgarity and because of its targeted audience. I believe that this movie is pretty vulgar but not to the point that it becomes non-tasteful and obscene. As far as the targeted audience of teenagers, I believe that this movie is suitable for any teenager 15 and older. The truth is teenagers today are pretty vulgar and so most teens can relate to many of the situation in this movie (at least most guys can). The issues dealt with in this movie have been discussed and acted out among teens for the longest.If you're against this movie because it's vulgar you need a reality check! If you have teens, then listen to their telephone calls, snoop though their stuff, check their computer, and I bet you will be shocked!The fact is that this movie just reflects teens today and what teens are doing today are the same things teens have done in the past! The only difference is today is a little more high tech! Besides, if you take away the vulgarity then alls you have left is a boring movie that promotes "good values", (a movie that no one would watch). With the vulgarity you have a funny, believable, movie that promotes "good values".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an all around great must-see movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An shockingly hilarious movie that may end up as one of the great teenage sexual angst films of all time. I was squirming in my seat laughing from the very first scene until the end. Beyond the sexual humor, American Pie contains sweet stories of teenagers finding love. Fabulous performances by the entire cast especially Jason Biggs, who is so believable as a sexually frustrated and confused teenager. Chris Klein is so charming, especially in his singing scenes. A brilliant movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is real life, my friend.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most movies that I see have the typical "Guy meets girl, they fall in love, and they 'do it'. Perfect as can be." But this movie ?... This is real life, my friend. One of the funniest scenes is when one of the guys attempts to make out with a woman but... fails. This movie is hilarious. It also shows that there are some guys out there who just... don't have the guts for it yet. Anyway, I loved this movie not because of the huge amount of comedy, but because it shows a story of four guys striving to get laid, which actually happens in everyday life. I give this movie a 10 !!! --Ross Edward Rogers</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was without a doubt the funniest movie I have seen since "There's Something About Mary". In every seen there was something to make me laugh, and not just a chuckle, but a full let it out blast. I wasn't embarrassed because the whole theater burst into laughter at the same time. And it had great music too, sometimes I found myself singing along, quietly of course. The bottom line is I think that teens should go and see this movie because it is great, but probably no one under 13 should be let in. I have seen 4 high school movies this year (She's All That, 10 Things I Hate About You, Never Been Kissed, and this one) and this was by far the best one. I know I will probably see this movie again soon because it was so good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A few words to describe American Pie: It is a fairly accurate portrayal of teenage life. It is not intended to impress the "critics" or to be clean. It uses the same language that many high school kids use and I believe most teenagers will be able to see their high school lives unfold on the screen before them. It essentially copes with the modern-day teenage life.</fullReview>

Some movies today the teens are all having sex but in this they show it as something that doesn't have to happen but will happen in it's own time.

A few are in there, but there are many more enjoyable ones.The plot is a little thin, I'll give it that. (I like a little meat on my plots ;) Acting is sufficient, casting is about on-target, and the whole thing is a little too long.But is it funny? On the whole, yeah. It's not sophisticated humor by far, and it's very much in-your-face, but a good number of the scenes had me laughing out loud. The biggest caveat is that I probably would have enjoyed it more if I was about 16 and still in high school.But male high school seniors as virgins? Proof that this is fictional. 4.0/5.0 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>American Pie could be simply described as the "There's Something About Mary" of 1999. It uses many of the same jokes about certain bodily fluids, flatulation, zit-faced losers and getting it on with an older woman. Needless to say, this film fully deserves its R rating as it goes full out in trying to get laughs and in its high sexual content.This film is funny, extremely funny at times, regardless of how it is done. By following the adventures of four graduating virgins, all trying to get laid, most films would not have problems getting the laughs. The final scenes of the film wrap it up nicely with some predictable and unpredictable happenings (Let's just say that I didn't expect to hear Mrs. Robinson in this film). Beyond the masturbation, pastry-loving and nude magazine scenes, one almost feels that the filmmakers are trying to end it all up with a Disney "be good" message, however, that is all taken away (Thankfully).The acting in this film is sub-par, but really does nothing to diminish the story. I also didn't care for the Oz - innocent choir girl relationship. How a hardcore, lacrosse playing jock could turn so soft so quickly is something only the movies could do. It also seemed that the gossipy redhead character was totally unnecessary as she added nothing to the film. The script was well written and the director created exactly what goes on for teenage boys at this time in their life. These facts combined with the abundance of comedy help to give this film such a good mark. Can't wait for the college sequel.Be prepared to be grossed out and laugh, because after all this is only a popcorn movie.6/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't believe he porked a pie! I saw this with my girl, who despises the recent proliferation of teeny-bopper films as much as I, and we had a ball. Though we both were nursing terrible hangovers, we laughed ourselves to tears throughout the film. I can't remember laughing so much at a movie while sober, and I don't think I've ever seen her laugh so hard outside of a pool hall. Though the film took the discovery and yearning for fornication to absurdity, it's best not to search for any profundity here. This is a fun film, so sit back and enjoy it. And don't worry when the film begins to recede into kitsch morality and sensitivity, for you are saved at the moment of finally dismissing the movie by the band-camp girl. This is an audience participation film, though, so watch it with a good one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Raunchy And Unexpectedly Sweet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The buzz on this raunchy teen comedy has been building for some time now, with some predicting it to be (and comparing it to) this Summer's "There's Something About Mary." While there's nothing blindingly original about the story, it DOES have its share of raunchy laughs and gross-out gags. And yes, it DOES have an unexpected sweetness and innocence laced throughout it similar to "Mary," but without that film's mean-spiritedness.The young cast is very good, especially Jason Biggs as the innocent and confused leader of the gang who all pledge to lose their virginity on prom night...he seems to be the one caught in a majority of the most embarrassing situations, but admirably seems to escape with his dignity intact. Eugene Levy is extremely amusing as Biggs' father, trying to impart wisdom to his son but at the most inopportune times.A cut or two above most teen comedies and not as irresponsible as you might gather by the previews. Very funny stuff!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was not the amazing comedy that it boasted to be. It was very funny and had the lewd humor to it that was expected from it's previews but it had more depth to it. An actual crafted plot. What really saved the movie for me was that at the end the boys realized that sex wasn't all as important as they were making it out to be and called the pact off - then all went and had sex anyway. I really liked the mini lesson on how you can never really prepare - it should just happen. The montage at the end was beautifully crafted. This is a funny date-movie. There are some pretty gross sections in the movies - but you'll see them coming, it's just waiting for them to happen is what it is all about. Eugene Levy was excellent in this as the Dad who wants to tell his son and seem cool at the same time. Although highly unrealistic at times the film showed some the morals that all movies about students should - I'm not going to say what they are - you'll have to find them for yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With all of the teen/young adult crap movies that have come out in past few summers (for example, Scream, I Know What You Did Last Summer), I went into this movie expecting to be highly disappointed. However, after watching American Pie in the Theather, my rib cage still aches from laughing as though the theater had been pumped with nitrous oxide. Rest assured this movie won't go to far into changing your view on the world, but its what modern comedy is all about, good old raunchy American humor. It mocks a stage in each person's life that is naturally awkward, the "first time", with such frankness and a handful of ridiculous comic anecdotes that you can't help but scream along with the other howling patrons in theater. Klein is supposed to be another Keanu Reeves, but frankly in this one movie as Oz he's proven to be a better actor. And Jim's antics throughout the movie could carry the movie if it had to.</fullReview>

But hey, it's the closest thing to high school I've seen since Fast Times At Ridgemont High.Jason Briggs delivers an astounding performance as the "awkward guy", and the other members of the cast are talented as well. There are a lot of unseen messages in this film, but the one that shines in the end is: It's not all about sex.I wouldn't recommend this film for kids, and it isn't a family-oriented experience, but I would suggest it for struggling teens in that stage where "virginity is EVERYTHING".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>American Pie transports us all back to the much easier time of high school when all we had to worry about was getting a date for the prom, your finals and what to do after high school. What sets this film apart from the other high school films that came out this year is the amount of time invested in the characters, especially the female characters. The four male characters seem to think they have it all figured out, much like most of his thought we did in high school. What we learn, as these guys do, is that life is not that simple. We watch them make their mistakes and laugh at them because we've all done the same things. We say the wrong things, make the wrong choices, but it helps us grow. In the course of this film, the four characters grow as people. Jim learns of what it feels like to be used, Oz transcends the role of typical jock and becomes something better. Kevin learns that there is more to a relationship than sex, and Finch, well Finch appreciates the finer things in life. The only one who really doesn't grow is Stiffler, only because he provides the role of jerk, and he does it well. The female characters are all smart, and they are more than pretty faces. Like their male counterparts, they think they have things figured out, and for the most part, they do. The one who really stands out is band geek Michelle, played with scene stealing gusto by Alyson Hannigan. All of her conversations start out with "At band camp..." and continue on from there. But, she's a lot smarter than she lets on and in a great scene we see just how clever this girl really is. I knew I was going to enjoy American Pie, I didn't realize that I would enjoy it as much as I did.</fullReview>

After the first few scenes, "American Pie" became a smart and downright funny picture and I became caught up in the characters (how often does that happen in a comedy?). The plot is surprisingly solid and, even more incredibly, relatively unpredictable, there are plenty of laughs, and, even though the ending is a little weak, I highly recommend this movie.

It's a very bad and quizzically likable movie--endearing mostly for its talented cast, a group of game, fizzy youths you wish you were watching in something else. The movie lacks the guts of my favorite eighties horny-teen movie, Boaz Davidson's coarse and then strangely lachrymose LAST AMERICAN VIRGIN (1982), but even the cloying stuff feels heartfelt. The best performances: Eddie Kaye Thomas as a pint-sized version of Aaron Eckhart in a Neil LaBute movie; Chris Klein, reprising his saintly jock from ELECTION; and Natasha Lyonne, reprising her mouthy malcontent from SLUMS OF BEVERLY HILLS.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, yes, I'm twenty years old and fell right into that minority of people who could honestly relate to this film. Not that I ever was in any of the situations, but...oh nevermind. But I thought that it was a great movie for people my age--sure, it was a bit overblown, but it was a comedy, remember that!! the truth is that kids do think about sex, and by the end of the movie they've made the subtle point that it's not all it's cracked up to be. sure, along the way they make it seem like the best thing ever, but in the changes in all the characters, the message is clear--kids may have hormones, but they're capable of real feelings and emotions. I thought the acting was great--I've seen a few people's comments on here ripping on the acting. All I can say is that these kids acted like real kids. I totally believed that they were people I could have gone to school with. As for some people's comments that Natasha Lyonne was the best thing in this movie, all I want to ask is why is it that so-called "film buffs" always denounce the acting of every teenager in a film like this, except the eccentric, anti-social one? Honestly. I understand that Lyonne really stood out in this movie, and she was good, but she was hardly the best thing in it. I hate to make personal comments about people on here, but I think that if you're too old to appreciate the accuracy and humor (yes, slightly overblown and disgusting humor, but high school humor) of this movie, you really shouldn't be commenting.Great job on this movie. The most fun one I've seen in a long time. 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny at parts, but overall very cliched.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was definitely better than that *other* teen sex comedy to which it's been compared ("Porky's"), but the funny bits just could not make up for the series of cliches and sight gags that it was. This isn't good, self-conscious potty humor of the "There's Something About Mary" variety; this is more along the lines of little kids snickering at hearing "poo-poo." Sure, there were amusing parts, but those were so contrived (as bad scripts tend to be), the laughter wasn't of the unstoppable sides-aching type. And really, the stories behind those gags were just so cliched (not even trying to do something new and creative with old cliches!) and boringly executed, I felt like I was watching a paint-by-numbers movie. If you want a really truly funny hilarious crazy sex comedy, try Woody Allen's "Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex but were afraid to ask." This achieves that racy NC-17-ness to which "American Pie" aspires, but with much more cleverness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great little teen comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In an age where teen comedies are often toned down in order to get the "audience friendly" PG-13, it's always nice to see a raunchy R rated teen comedy, I would have loved to see the R rated cut of "Can't Hardly Wait." This movie is hysterical in so many different levels and somehow still manages to show a little heart. You like these characters because they ARE you in high school. The entire movie, however, is stolen by Allyson Hannigan in her only big scene at the end. Quite a stitch! Gotta love Willow. A must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing bad to say</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sitting here and trying to write a review for this movie is hard to do.I'm sure there are bad things to say about this movie. You could say it's vile, disgusting, and offensive. I can't say that, though, because I didn't find it any of those things. Actually, I'm having trouble defining it period, as I am still a little overwhelmed by it. At the moment, I can say it is by far the funniest movie I have ever seen.The comparisons to 'There's Something about Mary' are relevant only because it brings you a new style of filmmaking, bringing you humorous after humorous moment. There are several kinds of brilliant films; ones that make you cry, ones that make you yelp and scream; ones that leave you feeling like you just had sex and the ones that make you laugh uncontrollably.'Pie' fits into the last two categories, no pun intended for the sex feeling. Maybe it's me, but when I left the theatre, I ran home. It was playing with Notting Hill, which I discarded for the opportunity to play preacher and call on everyone I knew, telling them to go to 'Pie'. The movie made has put a feeling of light-chested-ness in my body that hasn't gone away. The movie is just that good.The movie is this good because of the script. Like every single movie, a script is the end all of the sucsess of it. The 'Pie' script is like nothing you could expect, there has been nothing like it before. There have been comparisons to the John Hughes' and Porkey's films, but beyond the intial premise it is inaccurate. Because of the flexibility of the censors, and how much society is now accustom to, 'Pie' sets new standards and again stretches the lines of censorship. "Porkey's' and Hughes' films were made to be somewhat innocent. It apologizes for being racey. 'Pie' makes doesn't offer you one, and instead asks for one because you doubted it before you got in there.The next most important element of a good film is the actors. In all of the great films, we rememeber the actors just as much as the plot and the setting. Jason Biggs, the lead character, and our protagonist because he's always a loser, is dead-on. He plays Jake to the last detail; the shy guy in everybody's class. Chris Klien, who shone in Election, again shines here as a wanna-be sensitive jock. He commands such an aura, and easily gains sympathy and respect from viewers. The female actors are lead by a band geek Alyson Hannigan and Sex Therapist Natasha Lyonne. A somewhat rookie actress, Mena Suvari, plays a jazz ensemble goodie-two-shoes and interest of Klien. She is absolutely intoxicating, and her looks, even though she is not as attractive as Tara Reid or Shannon Elizabeth(both in the film, as Vicky and Nadia respectfully), draws people, at least me, to develop a crush on here. Lastly, Eugene Levy, the SCTV vetreran, brings a character to life that we can all say 'Hey, that's my dad!', in one scene or another.You could talk about the style of shooting, and other production notes, but unlike 'Saving Private Ryan', it is not important. The movie is meant to make you laugh. You are supposed to be impressed because it is so funny, not because you have learned something. The movie accomplishes this like Michael Jordan wins. It deserves kudos until there is no more kudos.Like Phantom Menace, go in with an open mind. Adam Herz, Paul and Chris Weitz, Jason Biggs, Chris Klien and Mena Suvari. Remember those names, as you will try so hard to forget this movie, but fail, because it so good.I guess I found something after all to say. I'll rephrase: Sitting here and trying to write a bad review for this movie is hard to do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I went to see the special sneak prevue, for the movie I knew It was going to be funny. I didn't know however, how much I was going to love that movie. Granted a lot of the jokes, are crude, but they made everyone in the theater laugh. That's what a movie is supposed to do, entertain people and American Pie did just that.It's more then just a bunch of guys trying to get laid. It shows how four very different types of guys come of age, during the last couple of months of school. It shows how important friendship is during high school and even though girls may come and go, friendship is a very important thing during your years of high school. The movie showed that. The movie was great, any on 15 years or older, I would suggest you go out and see this movie, because American Pie is a fantastic movie.</fullReview>

Not since Fast Times at Ridgemont High has thier been such an extrordinary look into the complexities of high school life. This movie truly reminds me of how my days in high school ended. If you can laugh at a tad bit raunchy joke then this movie will bring you to your knees. A young talented cast deserves credit for such a fine display of acting. The only sad bit is the portrayal of the sport of lacrosse. But since the setting is Michigan, we'll let it slide.

		<shortDescription>a hilarious documentary of teenage sexual angst</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I too saw the sneak preview of this delightful movie positioned around the quest of four high school seniors to get laid before graduation. If you think the premise is vulgar, then you may not want to read on, b/c this movie is not for you. Not only does it put There's Something About Mary to shame with it's liberal use of bodily fluids, but it surpasses it through its hilarious performances and unforgettable scenes. To put this movie in a nutshell would be to label it a documentary about teenage sexual angst. Needless to say, there are many things in this movie that resemble soft porn, minus the cheesy music and bad acting. The movie does do a very good job of displaying the different attitudes towards sex and quite possibly (this may be a long shot) love through its use of great characterization. Chris Klein, last seen in Election, brings another genuine performance to the screen, along with Jason Biggs, who's new to me but obviously a pro already, and Thomas Ian Nicholas, a wide-eyed poster boy for Clearasil. But the standout performance, although small, has got to be Alyson Hannigan as a naughty nerd who provides the movie with its most memorable shock...believe me, you'll know once you see it. Yes, the toilet humor is abundant, but the script is equipped with nonstop laughs and clever interludes. If you enjoy comedies and aren't embarrassed by the sight of naked women and masturbation, then you have got to see this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than some... worse than others...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I, like many of the other people who've commented on this flick, had high expectations going in. I was let down, but not as much as some people. This film is funny. Much more than most other films I've seen this year (but, I must say, that isn't saying much). And I'd also like to add, this is, again IMO, better than most 'teen flicks'.Now, here's my take on the flick... Masturbation plays a big part in here... This isn't bad, and the scenes, IMO, worked for comic effect without being too sick.The acting wasn't that bad, it could've been worse. A couple of the actors worked for me: Alyson Hannigan (She's funny, what can I say?), Natasha Lyonne (as always) and Chris Klein (of 'Election' Fame). Let me explain the last one... Chris Klein has played both of his characters he's had this far, well, vacant. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that he's a bad actor (or vacant for that matter)... I think it's intentional, that's why it works.And, my take on the whole 'teen flick' bit... This is a teen flick, plain and simple. However, I don't think this film is just for teen, adults can appreciate the humor too. Though it is sad that they'll probably think that the vacantness of the characters is an overstatement. Unfortunately, it isn't, it's more of an understatement.To conclude... all and all, this film is worth a look. Make that a look at matinee prices (don't blow $10 or $12 on it).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally, a true teen comedy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a year of- no wait, scratch that- in a decade of major league disappointments in the genre of teen cinema, Universal Pictures has finally delivered a flick that lives up to the standards of such raunchy classics as Fast Times at Ridgemont High and Porkys.American Pie is a genuinely funny film. While it seems as though most of the gross out humor is a blatant result of the success of There's Something About Mary, the laughs truly are quite original and not forced. The film is reminiscent of when John Hughes was writing in his prime in the mid-late '80s, back when teen comedies actually appealed to teens with true emotion and hysterics.While the script is very well written, the cast is really the driving force behind the film. American Pie would not have been half as funny had there been "IT" boys and girls such as Freddie Prinze and Jennifer Love in it. Actors such as Jason Biggs and Natasha Lyonne are the true stars to watch out for nowadays. The expressions, deliveries, and characterizations are priceless all around the board. Each individual actor expresses his/her character with a certain sense of pragmism and originality that it's hard not to like any one of them.I don't think I really need to discuss the plot or some of the best scenes in the film because they really have to be seen to be appreciated. Just make sure that while going to the local multiplex to catch the latest big budget filmmaking disaster of the '90s, you save a little room inside your cerebrum of entertainment to catch an outstandingly funny, smart, and emotionally satisfying flick that might not be sold out on two screens.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gross comedies, some work (THERE SOMETHING ABOUT MARY &amp; BASEketBALL), others don't work too well (AUSTIN POWERS 2 &amp; SOUTH PARK: BIGGER, LONGER, &amp; UNCUT). AMERICAN PIE is different, it's not a movie like AUSTIN or SOUTH that relies on it's gross humor to save the muddle script. No, instead the gross humor is a medium for a decent script that winds up working well, very well! The plot is about four high-school seniors (Jason Biggs, Chris Klein, Thomas Ian Nicholas, &amp; Eddie Kaye Thomas) who make a pact, that they are to lose thier virginity by the time they graduate. The idel time to "score" is on prom night, so all four guys are working and preparing for prom night. Oz (Chris Klein), a jock, joins the jazz choir to impress another choir member, Heather (Mena Suvari) and to show that he too can be a sensitive guy. Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) wants to give his current girlfriend Vicky (Tara Reid) the perfect moment while having sex. Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas), is acting very smooth and charming, trying to impress the entire senior female class with his outrageous rumors. And then there's poor Jim (Jason Biggs) a young man who is at his sexual peak, and has a crush on the foreign exchage student named Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth). From there on is a rollercoaster with the same equivalent as a Six Flags rollercoaster, of non-stop laughs and gross out jokes. How would I compare this to other comedies as thrill rides? AUSTIN POWERS 2 and SOUTH PARK are the scary "kiddie" rollercoasters. BIG DADDY is the wild, but not scary of the rollercoasters, like a medium thrill. ANALYZE THIS and AMERICAN PIE are the monster coasters of laughs. The ones that people wait 3 hours in line, freak out while on the ride, and want more! Well, that is what you get after seeing AMERICAN PIE, you want more! These young actors are all going to be famous, the same way AMERICAN GRAFFITI, FAST TIMES, &amp; DAZED &amp; CONFUSED made most of thier stars big. I'm sure 15 years from now, their will be a collector's edition similar to GRAFFITTI and FAST TIMES. This is the FAST TIMES for the 90's teens, but it also appeals to the 20 something crowd, like me. I really did enjoy seeing Chris Klein play the same type of person he played in ELECTION. Jason Biggs was very funny as the unfortunate Jim, who is unlucky most of the time. Tara Reid and Mena Suvari are both very good as the girls who are wondering if they are making the right decision. But the two I thought stand-out are Shannon Elizabeth and Eddie Kaye Thomas. Elizabeth is GORGEOUS, she will get tons of iternet hits by the end of the summer. And Thomas is both very smooth and calm, he's very similar to a calm David Schwimmer. People are calling this the PORKYS of the summer. It isn't PORKYS was very silly, immature, and cruel. The guys were sex-hungry idiots, and the girls were brainless sex objects. I would rank this film with the better comedy of 1982, FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH. Like FAST TIMES, it's full of laughs, and it has heart. PORKYS didn't have any heart, just cruel jokes. AMERICAN PIE will tickle the young adults funny bones the same way ANALYZE THIS tickled the adults and seniors funny bones. But this film isn't for those only under 30, I'm sure that older people will enjoy this film the same way they enjoyed THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY. Will the pre-teens will try to sneek into SOUTH PARK or go watch AUSTIN POWERS 2. The real men and women will be watching AMERICAN PIE, and lovin' it. Just like I did. ***** (out of *****)</fullReview>

Other than that, there's no true redeeming social value, which is all good and well because it's July. It's also funny much more often than not, and even sweet at the end.

		<shortDescription>Incredibly humourous and an honest look at trying to get laid in highschool.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American Pie is the funniest movie that I have seen in about five years. Something About Mary had me laughing, Big Daddy had me holding my sides, and South Park had me shocked but humoured. American Pie is heads and shoulders above any of these films. What makes this film so funny is not only its attempt to humour us, but its honesty in every scene. And that honesty can bring us back to what it was like to be there. So whether you lost it ten years ago, yesterday of even five minutes ago, you can relate to the feelings that this movie has.It is three weeks before the prom and four friends have made a pact to get laid before the end of prom. The four friends consist of a guy who has been dating a girl for quite a while but hasn't gotten past third base. Another is a shy guy that has problems doing his " business " at school because of cleanliness issues. A third is portrayed at first as the quintessential jock that just wants to use his athletic prowess to meet the ladies. And finally we have Jim. Jim is the guy that you see in the commercials. He is so sexually inept that when he tries to talk to a girl, he shies away before any words will leave his mouth. And when he has a naked girl in his room, he " blows it " twice, before he can get the prize.The most interesting situation was how the jock " OZ " grew in this movie. He started off as a typical jock. Then he meets a girl that he really likes. And suddenly he doesn't just want to have sex, he really cares about her and at the end when we see them together, it makes you feel warm. It is their relationship that makes you remember what it was like to really like someone for the first time.There are many other delicate and poignant scenes in the film concerning love. Kevin and Vickey's relationship is a tricky one because they both really like each other but she is not sure if she wants to take that last step. This causes some friction in the relationship, but when it is resolved, it is written so convincingly that you are happy for them.This film combines some true intelligence and romance with a wickedly funny look at the complexities of sex. And nothing is sacred here. They explore female and male oral sex. They talk in depth about orgasms and of course masturbation is a big topic in this film. And that makes it side splittingly funny and incredibly witty. American Pie really is a miracle. It was written by Adam Herz and this is his first film. And judging by his ear for dialogue and character, he will be around for quite some time.The one performance that I wanted to call attention to was Chris Klein as Oz. I wasn't sure where I had seen him before so I looked him up in the IMDb. And he was in Election. And he was great in that film too. But here he is honest and sincere in his performance and he lends credence to his character. He is very good in American Pie and I believe he will go on to do bigger things in Hollywood.So if what you are looking for is one hilarious film and you like Something About Mary (tripled) kind of humour, then this is your movie. If you don't like that kind of film, don't even bother to see this film. But you are missing a true treasure. Thsi film reminds me a bit of a combination between The Breakfast Club and Fast Times. So check it out. You will laugh and you will cheer when you walk out of theater. The only bad thing about this film is that it ended.One final thought is that you should really beware of the chicks in band that play the flute. ( Wickedly funny!! )Wonderful movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fast Times for the 90's?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw a sneak preview of this film, and it's difficult to try to place it. It is definitely unlike the recent slew of teen movies that Hollywood seems to be churning out. Why? Well, for starters it has characters who each and every person can honestly relate to, not simply the caricatures which are so frequently featured on screen nowadays. It has a couple of incredibly risque sight gags, one of which puts the infamous hair gel scene in "There's Something About Mary" to shame. But the biggest reason it stands out is that it reminds me more of the classic 80's teen films (updated in content for the 90's, of course) than any of the cookie cutter 90's teen films have...by far. This is "Fast Times at Ridgemont High" fixed up for a new generation. It unabashedly deals with teenage hormones and masturbation, and is unafraid to show it. Unlike the awful "Cruel Intentions", which tried to make teens appear over-experienced and sexy (failing miserably), "American Pie" beautifully illustrates the awkwardness and anticipation surrounding the loss of the big V and the trials of teen hormones and sexual frustration. I highly recommend. It'll have you rolling on the floor laughing, both from what's on screen and recognition of the humor of your own first time.</fullReview>

Universal Studios took a poorly-written, typical teen script and made it worse with hideous casting and lousy directing."American Pie" is a sadistic, mocking film that seems to savor the pain it is causing the theatregoing public, many of whom have been dragged to the multiplex by their dates. The humour is definitely of the New York City sewer variety, and this film's creators seem to be in a competition to outdo the morons who made "There's Something About Mary" and "Big Daddy" in terms of crudeness.This might just be a simple sleazefest if it were not for the absolutely hideous choice of actors. Trust me--these clowns make the brats at "South Park" look sensitive and deep. Natasha Lyonne, with her hair looking like she just stuck a finger in a light socket, and her whiny "I'm a goddess" performance leaving you wishing she had. Chris Klein, who was only cast in this film because the producers couldn't come to contract terms with a potted plant. Chris Owen, who is only suited for silent cameos, is given a speaking part. (Aaargh!) Alyson Hannigan, whose character swings wildly between slut and sweetie, is obviously way in over her head. And is it just me, or is the viewing public weary of hearing Tara Reid philosophize about oral sex? To make matters worse, we actually have to watch her head bobbing around as she performs it! Should we be forcing teenagers to watch such a disturbing visual image? It could turn them off sex forever.The best line of the movie--and the one you'll be repeating as you gaze into your wallet after the movie--is the one uttered by the jock when he wakes up in bed alone: "I was used!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Comedy...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you hear people telling you not to see this movie, just turn them off, walk away, don't listen. Some are going to say - "...the jokes are just tired...", "...too many sex and masturbation jokes...", and one of my favorites "...it just isn't deep enough; has no message...". For crying out loud, tell them to that people do have sex and they do masturbate. So why not put it on the big screen? Tell them that no matter how hard they will try to make sex and masturbation go away they will never succeed because they both are a natural part of a human life cycle. Sex, nudity and jokes sell - that's what American Pie counts on and it is right.The cast of virtually unknown actors gives a great performance and for those who only go to see a movie for "positive messages conveyed to the world" the film does even have one - at the end the characters realize that life is not just about sex. Some of them even fall in love with their movie partners (only to be separated later when they go to college, but that's a different story). So, please all you people who have no clue why you go see a comedy, get one or don't go. You have your right to have an opinion, but you're not necessarily right (at least in this instance). American Pie (and most other movies) is not meant to convey positive messages to the youth, scold people for having sex, nor encourage them to have sex. Am. Pie doesn't glorify sex, nudity, or alcohol, it simply points out the obvious - they are all there, right here, in our very lives. It's a comedy that is close not just to teenagers but to adults as well, because so many of both groups can relate... All the "message seekers" should try to see this movie with open eyes and stop being so "goody-too-shoes". For them, there's something about high school that they dislike and I am not going to elaborate here on what that is... Great Comedy...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>American Pie was the funniest movie of the summer. While its humor was as disgusting and inappropriate as any other movie released in the past years, it delivered with the laughs needed to make it not seem to matter. While I don't think this movie is appropriate viewing material for people under 16, I found myself laughing harder than I have in years. While character development and casting could be found as a small problem, overall the characters were much better casted and acted than any of the other teen flicks. American Pie was a real laugh, and the humor was as below the belt as it gets.</fullReview>

The laughs kept coming throughout the whole movie, and on many occasions I missed dialogue since the audience was laughing so loud from what just happened. I don't want to give away any of the plot, although it's not very complex. I saw this with 3 guys and 3 girls, and everyone loved it. Don't take kids to see this, unless you want to explain practically everything about sex... I won't be surprised if this movie does extremely well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A standing ovation "10" for American Pie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now you might look at the score I gave this movie and think, "This guy's on crack". However, let me explain myself. I rate movies on what I expect them to deliver and how they match up to those expectations. I expected this to be a teen-flick about sex that would be humorous at times, but nothing extraordinary. I was so wrong.This movie was so much better than any teen comedy I have ever seen - and easily in my top ten comedies of all time behind Clerks, Caddyshack, etc. The entire theater was laughing hysterically through at least 50% of the movie. The characters were believable - you know at least one person exactly like each of these characters. They have the high school male sex drive pegged (along with the guy talk). Eugene Levy could have been any of our dads - trying so hard to talk to his son candidly about sex, but failing miserably.Take my word for it. This movie is ten times better than "There's Something About Mary". My only regret is that I saw the Sneak Preview and have to wait a whole week before I can see it again. I don't buy any movies on videotape, but I already have a space in my cabinet reserved for this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to bed about two hours after coming home from a sneak peak of AMERICAN PIE, and my stomach still ached -- not from some of the gross-out bits, but from laughing so hard at them.The acting in this film is brilliant -- everyone plays their characters to a T. The fact that the actors had a good script helped, too.My only complaints about it are that it: 1) the first half is a little slow 2) at times, it becomes too much of a teen-exploitation, i.e. SHE'S ALL THAT, CAN'T HARDLY WAIT. But then again, this delves deeper than SHE &amp; CAN'T ... perhaps after a second viewing will I up my ranking of this film to 9.But, without question, this deserves to be high up on your Things To Do List.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very realistic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's about time high school is being portrayed as what it is. People talk about sex at high school, a lot. This film is highly realistic in that aspect. American Pie is the other side of the coin which is occupied by Saved by the Bell. Saved by the Bell deals with the homework, principal, SCHOOL related issues of a teenagers life, while American Pie deals with the sex, beer, LIFE related issues of a teenagers life.This movie is not as funny as There's Something About Mary, but it is better. When you watch Mary for a second time and know all the jokes, it just isn't a good movie. In Pie, there's a human side to the story which will pull you back to watch the movie again.Some of the comments here would lead you to believe this whole movie is about masturbation, but I can only recall two scenes (maybe 5 minutes tops) which dealt with masturbation in the entire movie. I did see a finished version however, so that may be why. Definitely a must-see if you can remember the LIFE related part of high school. 9/10</fullReview>

Around every corner, this movie surprised the hell out of me...I found myself hooked after the opening sequence...It was so damn funny and embarrassing. One other point that I would like to make about this movie, is that you see growth in all of the 4 main characters....the most in the jock, Oz...then Jim, the dork...then Shit-Break, Finch...then the only one w/a girlfriend. This movie wasn't all humor, and eventually showed you that sex isn't everything. At that point you're kinda like wow...neat, and it seems that the movie is over....but then it goes back to the hilarious, laughing your ass of humor. I was fortunate enough to see an early version of this movie, and can't wait to see it at theaters, to see if they changed anything...good luck, and you haaaaaave to see this movie!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>just another in a string of disappointments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every movie I've seen since Shakespeare in Love has been a disappointment, but this one is the worst yet. I really expected this to be memorable, witty - a satire skewering high school "values". instead it just reinforced every stupid idea and stereotype that I expected it to shoot down. ultimately, the moral: even losers get laid, and this makes them, magically, no longer losers; and, yes, sex is the be-all and end-all. The movie begins with a masturbation sequence that becomes the motif - and, yes, it's funny at first, but how many times can a father realistically walk in on his son, and how many different ways can the same gag be repeated before it gets stale? the majority of the kids in the theater with me hooted and screamed just as loudly each time, so i guess i'm in the minority, but i got very tired of humor in the form of simple gross-outs. Don't get me wrong - I thought Something About Mary was hilarious; but Mary had a good script, good acting, ingenuity, and an engaging plot. this movie has none or very little of the four (with the exception of Natasha Lyonne, who is above this movie the same way Jeneane Garofolo was above 200 Cigarettes). If you're looking for a good movie, forget this one. I'll offer an alternative - just as soon as I can find one myself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not only is this the funniest movie of 1999 (Austin Powers was good, but not this good), but you leave with a good feeling after watching it. All the performances were solid, given the material they covered. And even though the film revolves around teen-agers, I think you have to be in your twenties to truly appreciate the characters' take on their dilemma. What also impressed me was how the pop music in the background fit each scene accordingly in tempo and mood. Some people may be put off by some of the sight gags, but that's why it's rated R.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Four Young men explore the wonders and challenges of sex in this comedy about growing up. The story follows these men as they make a pact to loose their virginity before graduating high school and quickly learn that it is easier said than done.American Pie is a very raw and graphic film and can be disturbing at times. For most young adults the movie will come off as hilarious and good while most adults will find it repulsive and degrading. I sat in a theater between two other critics from another local media firm and a group of recent high school graduates. While one group cringed at the raw nature of the story the other cheered and yelled profusely. The movie completely butchers the idea of "love" and pushes on the idea of sex rules all. This movie will be a huge success among the young and a huge point of argument among the adults. If you have a week stomach i would not recommend this movie under any circumstances. On a scale from 1 to 5 tickets I would give this movie a 5 just because it depends on your age and maturity level whether you will like this movie or not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the film a couple of weeks ago at a test screening and I have to say that the negative reviews here are unfounded. Maybe the film isn't very intellectual and resorts to some "bathroom" humor, but I don't go to comedies to be enriched as a human being - I go to laugh. So far this year, I have not seen a funnier movie than "American Pie," and that includes "Austin Powers 2." When it was over, I actually felt satisfied - when's the last time you could say that after watching a movie? It's been a while. I don't see how these people can trash a film that actually delivers. Trash "Instinct," sure, but not this. Much as I hate to put money into the studio that gave us "Patch Adams," I plan to buy a ticket and see "American Pie" again. Seeing such a fall-down funny movie with a large, loud audience is an experience in itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's Something About....Pie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American Pie, which is trying to capitalize on the success of the Farrelly Bros.'s There's Something About Mary, does an excellent job of living up to its predecessor. American Pie tells a somewhat realistic, though very exaggerated, story of four high school seniors who make a pact to lose their virginity by prom night. The appeal of this movie, much like with 'Mary,' is not the story, but the gross-out comedy. And there is much of that in this film. Still, the story is not lacking, and this film does present a sweet tale of friendship and the troubles of adolescence. But the main reason to see this is for the great laughs and shock value, as it has plenty of both.</fullReview>

However, not only are the characters actually believable as typical teenagers, but the movie presents itself an a hilarious fashion. This movie contains some of the crudest jokes I've seen, but they all work, and it's actually plausible that teenagers might do these things. The acting and dialogue are questionable at times, but one thing is for sure--this movie is filled with non-stop laughter. For once a (teen) movie that is 1) realistic 2) filled with jokes that actually make you laugh out loud and 3) enjoyable for both teens and adults...just don't watch this with your parents. As a teenager myself, I haven't laughed this hard since There's Something About Mary, I don't plan to again all year.

		<shortDescription>No good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start out saying that (at the time of writing) I am an 18 year old American Male which from what I gather would normally be in the target audience. Watching this movie was not by my choice but rather my parents put it on when it was on TV.There are just so many things wrong with this movie I don't even know where to start. Basically the premise is that these four "boys" make a pact to have sex before graduating high school which is already extremely absurd. And the comment about penises unused is just plain nonsense unless they never urinate?Most of the scenarios are incredibly unlikely and just plain ridiculous. For example the scene where Jim convinced Nadia to change her clothes at his house and she just starts MASTURBATING in his bed. Really?? WHO goes into someones bedroom believing they are just down stairs and does that? Nobody. And what the hell was with the "Are you ready for a partner?" portion between Jim and his Dad?? The characters also had no depth or much defining characteristics and in general were just plain unlikeable. It was to the point that I often forgot who was who which is not a good sign for a movie.Another thing is I did not agree with the message that this movie was displaying. Basically just saying everything is always about sex and that it is all that matters in a relationship. Reinforcing the pressure for people to engage in that type of activity more or less as young as possible. I found the movie disgusting on many accounts because it was just too crude and found it hard to watch within the first 20 minutes. The part early on where Jessica says to Vicky "It's not a space shuttle launch, it's sex." is a perfect example of the wrong attitude.I had very few actual laughs (perhaps three in total) other than laughs of embarrassment rather than actually being funny. It would have been a pure bore if it were not so disturbing.And the ending was by far the worst. Although in some ways "Oz" was admirable for becoming more sensitive and caring but still unlikeable nonetheless. The sex scenes were nothing other than highly unpleasant to watch. And to top it off the part where Kevin(?) and Vicky decided they could not make it ended up making me sad. So at the end of the movie I ended up sad and disgusted from the previous scenes.Personally I don't want to end up feeling like crap at the end of movies.So to summarize: If you are looking for something funny or good or even decent. STAY CLEAR of this movie. It is not good.If you really want to see a "teen" oriented movie, at least watch something good like Back to the future.If you are looking for something funny, there are plenty of other choices that will give real laughs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One day , one ordinary American school, several of the same ordinary guys decide to lose their virginity . They decided to do it before the finish school . Business, so to speak, is not easy. Perhaps not everyone is able to do , because on the way to the cherished dream is a wide variety of obstacles.Initially , I expected to see in the " American Pie " is much worse spectacle. But the opposite happened . This movie I really liked . Such pictures as this shot very much, but it is the " American Pie " is considered the founder of the genre "youth porn comedy ." It already gives this film more flavor."American Pie" - it's really very nice , cheerful and funny comedy . Level vulgarity here , of course, rolls over, but the "American Pie " is forgivable , because toilet humor here is practically his chip if you want."American Pie" was the directorial debut for Chris and Paul Weitz . They are definitely a very successful debut in the movie, albeit with a rather peculiar film. Chris and Paul rented a very good youth comedy that really could become a classic.The main roles are played by Jason Biggs , Seann William Scott, Chris Klein , Thomas Ian Nicholas , Eddie Kaye Thomas, Mena Suvari , Tara Reid , Shannon Elizabeth , Alyson Hannigan . All fun played their characters, but the most memorable Jason Biggs and Seann William Scott.Subtotal: funny teen comedy and fun , and definitely a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Please try to ignore the negative reviews for this movie and just hear me out. This movie has captured the soul of my youth; I loved it as a teen and I loved it even more as an adult.This movie is an absolute must see and if you haven't seen it yet, this is going to be an informative yet spoiler-free review from a fan's perspective.The atmosphere, the hilarious one-liners, the appealing conflict, its strong character development, the witty writing, the inspiring directing of it all, the ideal cast who played believable characters (except for Vicky &amp; Heather, who are both one-dimensional, but the rest did an amazing job), these are the strengths that I hold dear to my heart.Our story revolves around the raunchy misadventures of four horny friends that are on the quest to get laid. Will they succeed? What tactics will they use to get the women of their choice in bed? What are their strengths and weaknesses? When is the deadline for getting laid? Which guy gets which girl? All of these questions will be answered once you sit down to watch this movie, after reading this.Every time I watch it, I wish my high school life was as spectacular as it's portrayed. The diverse characters enhance the experience of watching it. Of course, everybody knew a Stifler and the male audience can relate to Jim, our protagonist, and his struggles throughout his journey.I hope this review was helpful and if I could rate it higher than a 10/10 (10 out of 10), I would. Trust me, once you finish watching this memorable film filled with laughs and genuine fun, you will thank me!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Humour is lost on some people</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People tend to look upon American Pie as crude, misogynistic and crass. They scorn it because it reveres sex, and portrays what they call toilet humor and the decentralization of the American Youth. A lot of critics note that the movie focuses too much on losing virginity before college , rather than excelling in the academics to go to said College. What critics fail to see is that it is a movie designed for the open minded individual,and that no body really cares about "academics" with movies in similar vain to National Lampoon. People are too uptight these days. Demanding everything to be 'PC'. American Pie, may be lewd and rude, but it sure as hell is entertaining. Who can't respect the stellar performances of the four main characters. They all have different ways of achieving their ultimate goal, which lead to hilarious antics.One involves a web-cam, one involves an obnoxious jerk's mother, one pretending to love show-choir, the other trying to deceive his girlfriend. In the end of course they all achieve their goal, as in all comedies of the American Nature. Eugene Levy, commands praise as Jim's sex-crazed father, who supports his son's endeavor.

		<shortDescription>The definitive Teen comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really cannot praise this film highly enough. It may not be high-brow (understatement!) or particularly clever, but don't let that fool you. Unlike the increasingly tired sequels, the original American Pie, balanced a large cast of believable characters through some of the finest set pieces in cinema.The list of great characters goes on and on; "Jim" the main character, Stiffler, Finch, The MILF, Jim's Dad, Nadia etc etc. Every character has a purpose and they all given screen time so that we appreciate the situations that they face.American Pie reignited the Teen-genre and a whole new generation of gross out films like Road Trip, Old School etc owe AP a debt.If by some miracle you have yet to see this film go and treat yourself to the DVD - and laugh your nuts off whilst Jim and Co screw around, f*ck things up, and generally have a fantastic time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never really watched the whole thing until recently. I had always watched the second and third films from start to finish and enjoyed them. The first one is not my favorite out of the three but it still has the whole comic relief thing going on that I enjoy. It shows how all anyone can ever think of in Highschool is sex. No one wants to go to college a virgin. The young men make a pact that by graduation they will all have sex and not go to college a virgin. Jim is interested in Nadia, a young very attractive European girl and he finds love with someone other than Nadia,he finds love with the "band geek" Michelle. Kevin is interested in Vicky, a very attractive blonde that he has been going out with but who has never been pleasured. In hopes to "pleasure" her he calls his older brother that then tells Kevin in the library there is a "Sex Bible". Oz is interested in Heather and she is interested in him. Although Stifler makes rude obscene comments about the pairs relationship. She believe that Oz is another Jock who all he wants is to get in her pants, but the pair find love in an unexpected place at Michigan State singing competition. Finch really doesn't have an interest in anything but Stifler's mom. The M.I.L.F of the movie. They all achieve their goals of having sex by graduation after prom.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>O.k. my summary sounds pretty far-fetched but how many other teen movies have come out that have "defined a generation", launched the career of one of the biggest selling modern rock bands (blink 182), been voted the seventh funniest movie of all time and managed to strike a balance between hilarious and sincere? The answer is not many.American Pie really is one of the best teen movies out there. It has tons of laughs- e.g. the webcam- and features the definitive embarrassing dad- Eugene Levy who, in this movie, is one of the funniest people I have ever seen.Part of the reason it works is that it centres around four central characters, all of which have extremely entertaining stories. Also there's Stifler. Nowadays seann william Scott is pretty well known and the pie movies really helped launch him. Some say Stifler is one dimensional, but who cares, he's hilarious.Part cringe, part laugh, part empathy overall it really works. OK it's not really a 10 star film, but come one guys, it deserves a higher user rating than 6.8!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A 6.8 rating for this movie is ridiculously low...I don't think I've seen this much hostility towards a movie in quite a while. I don't remember the IMDb being the hotbed for PC, prudish people to spout their moral qualms. What is clear, however, is this: this post will do nothing to change people's minds about the movie, so rather than try to convince people that this movie was freaking awesome, I will attempt to sum up where the appeal is.The claims of some of its detractors are true. The movie relies heavily on crude humor (very much in the mold of Something about Mary, which also started off with a 1-star rating by some prude), but very accurately reflects the type of conversations that teens have. Example: Jim, walking into school, says to Kevin "I saw the Little Mermaid last night. That Ariel, she's so hot." C'mon, what 17 year old kid hasn't thought that? What sets the movie apart from others in recent memory, though, is the heart with which it is done. The accuracy in the conversations and the way the people deal with the issues that always arise during that time in a person's life is fantastic and, as a result, gives the movie-viewer a powerful sense of nostalgia for those days when the struggles of life seemed impossible, but were so fun at the same time.Who will like this movie? People who are young at heart, people who are wasted, and people who want to be transported back to a great period in their lives. Prudish people- pretension need not apply.As one prude worries, "in 10 years, I fear this may be a cult classic." Too late. Awesome movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, so I'm pushing 30 and I missed the big whoop about American Piewhen it released. I've just caught it on DVD, expecting to detest it,but to my amazement, it left me smiling.American Pie is primarily a morality tale, with the message that goodthings (eventually) happen to good people. This is not at all what Iexpected. People who were scandalised by American Pie should reallytake a look at the similarly themed classic Animal House, and askthemselves which one delivers a more wholesome message.American Pie is an effective, if slightly heavy handed comedy. Thescatological humour is unnecessary (and I mean that in a good way),but is fairly well handled. The delivery and timing of all the leadsis exemplary, even if most of them look a little long in the tooth tobe high schoolers.As to the "gross out" elements, they are only a little more extremethan in the crop of 1980's "bad kids" films, and are par for thecourse for the late 90's "There's Something About The Dumber KingpinWho Shagged Me" genre pieces. And looking back to my high school andcollege years, it occurs to me that, hey, it was *exactly* like that,drunken fumbling, body fluid mishaps and all.</fullReview>

What makes this movie very funny and popular is all the situations where the characters are confused.For example the situation of "Extra light beer". American Pie is the "father" of the newer films, such as "Road Trip", "100 Girls", and others. If you are a teenager, this is a must-see film for you!Don't miss it! P.S.

		<fullReview>I am a fan of teenie movies, I always love to watch them. Mostly, the stories are pretty similar, but somehow this genre has a certain appeal to me. Maybe because I never did something crazy in my teens? Who knows.Anyway, American Pie is really a good movie, a splendid proof that the teenie movie genre is not dead but alive and kicking, and that to portray teenagers in a entertaining way, you don't have to kill them all off (Scream, I know what you did last summer) or let them talk like old men and women (Dawsons Creek) - you simply have to let them act like what they are: Young people looking for the right way to do things, searching for their identity and - off course the focus of this movie - for their sexuality.While the story is certainly not all new, the way in which it is shown is really hilarious. There are some extremely well placed very crude, but all the more funny jokes, and the characters are simply likeable in their desperate attempts to loose their virginity. Highlights like the "rendez-vous" with Nadja or the blow-job scene with the not so politically correct disposal of the seminal fluid are simply too funny to resist.All in all an extremely well done teenager comedy which I recommend to every one who has stayed young at heart. Best to watch together with a bunch of friends to start a party! Laughs guaranteed!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny teenage flick but a little overdone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"American Pie" was a good way to confront important teenage issues. Some examples include sex, sex, and, uh, sex. "American Pie" was a pretty funny movie. It was great to see history in the making. I'm not saying that this was a really important movie, but it put fuel on the ever-kindling fire of dirty teenage flicks. Without "American Pie" movies like "Road Trip" and "Scary Movie" wouldn't even have been considered for production. "American Pie" didn't really pioneer dirty flicks, see the Farelly brothers for that, it did though provide a precedent for the already mentioned movies. Although "American Pie" was somewhat meaningful for pubis movie goers, it really was just an excuse for teens to see nudity. Some teens aren't blessed with Cinemax and Showtime, God bless those forsaken souls, and have to appease their carnal requirements. This film was just an excuse to provide a little bit of water, in the ever dry throat of teenage lust. Some scenes and situations were less than raunchy though, and showed the importance of relationship as more than just physical but it showed that mutual likeness can be lovely. Returning to the risque scene, some scenes weren't appropriate for most young teens even, and kids these days here and retell more dirty jokes than Rodney Dangerfield and Saturday Night Live writers combined.  So, if you're into raunchy teenage comedy, you'll like "American Pie." If you're a young teenager who doesn't know what snowballing is (very obscure term, see "Clerks", great movie, to find out you fledgling dirty terminologists) or if you're not sure what pea-braining is (I made that one up), don't see it. Wait till you see movies like "Dumb &amp; Dumber" or "Fast Times at Ridgemont High" (Just kidding, don't see that one!), and then allow yourself to relsih in the brilliance of vulgar teenage writers inspired by Southern Comfort and Bong Residue. If you're a parent screening the movie for a sleepover or something like that, pretend that you never heard about this film. Choose Wisely and Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a joke, right?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen some bad films, but this one walks away with the award. If I was part of the cast, I would be ashamed to have even taken part in something this ludicrous. If I was part of the crew, I would die mainly because I am too stupid to think of anything more funny-realistic-intelligent etc.What I would really like to know is how this film got an R rating. The majority of the viewers would more than likely be teenagers. I can't see any normal adult sitting through a movie that ruins the image of *some* good teen flicks. This was definitely not meant for teenagers. Any parent that allows their son/daughter to see this needs their head examined. Is this really what the film industry is becoming? I know that it used to be frowned upon if a married couple slept in the same bed. We're talking a while back, but you get the idea. If this is something that is thought of as quality movie making, I hate to see what's to come.Being a teenager, I really don't get why so many people my age found this sort of trash amusing. It had the typical high school beauties, lack of comedy (despite what MANY people thought), lack of intelligence, a terrible script to start out with, and poor casting overall. For those of you who found this sort of thing funny, what were you thinking? And I must ask, how can the same joke seem to be pleasing for the entire film? A couple of losers are dying to lose their virginity, yeah, yeah, yeah. Heard it before. The whole joke revolving around the pie incident is down right disgusting.There's nothing more irritating than watching a movie where there is not one normal face in the crowd. The cast is by no means beautiful, but it just so happens that the actress chosen to strip for the camera isn't exactly an old hag. And why did they even have to do that little stunt? In one word to describe the cast: un-talented. If the writing was supposed to be comical, mission not accomplished. The casting department needs some tips on how to cast actors and not just some twenty somethings that are supposed to be playing high schoolers. I can't repeat on how the movie lacked comedic writing, but I just can't get over how people actually laughed at this. The writing overall was awful. It was actually funny to think that something like this has an $11 million budget. What was Universal Pictures thinking when they agreed to make this? At that point, they must have been hanging on by a thread. The idea that a high school boy supposedly has sex with a pie is beyond words. It wasn't funny but very gross. The thought of a guy actually doing that is absurd. I wonder how many boys tried that after they watched this? The whole movie basically revolved around that one thing. You can only stretch it so far.Again, this film with little sex jokes and actions slipped in was very disturbing especially when it was allowed to be shown to kids that are waiting to do them. When I had heard about the apple pie, I thought that the film was in serious trouble. But then it got worse when I was able to see a little strip tease. How I wish this scene would have been skipped. I for one didn't particularly appreciate that. I mean it's only fair if they show a guy. Right? Everything else like the parts with Vicky and what's-his-name were also dumb.It's pretty bad when movies like this are made. All I can say is that lets hope no more teen, bottom of the barrel films will be made. If the makers and industry people are this desperate, save the money for when a decent flick comes along. Why waste the money and the movie goers' time?</fullReview>

I watched it a few times when it came out on video, and for the most part, it was equally as good. A lot of older people might not like this movie, but it is an excellent portrayal of high school students today and a laugh-a-second movie. Jason Biggs is great as Jim, but Eugene Levy and Seann William Scott have to be the funniest characters as Jim's father and Stiffler respectively. Nadia and Vicky are hot, and it's hard to believe that Thomas Ian Nicholas could go from pitching for the Cubs as Henry Rowengardener in 'Rookie of the Year' to orchestrating Sex Bible secrets as Kevin in 'American Pie' in what seemed like such a short time. If you liked 'Can't Hardly Wait', 'She's All That', or 'Porky's', you will like this ten times better. Probably my favorite movie; 9.5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is made for the 15-30 something crowd and seems to draw laughter out of everyone. What wonders me is why the 50+ are tearing this movie apart? I mean sure this isn't the subject matter that you guys grew up with, but times have changed, you can't deny that. Whats with you? Did you lose you sense of humor back in the 70s. Are things no longer found funny to you? A guy has two premature ejaculations in a matter of 2 minutes and your upset with this scene? 1st of all, come on this is funny to anyone, as long as you know what just happened, 2nd why are you upset with this scene? It's humorous to us. Some guy wrote that this movie shows how the younger society is going down the drain. Not wanting to get off the subject of movies, I'll keep my society opinions to myself. This movie is more about going farther with sex humor than before, not about our society getting worse. As society goes on, more and more stuff that was banned in the past is allowed to be aired. Law &amp; Order Special Victims Unit recently allowed the s-word to be said on t.v. So instead of saying society is wrong, sit back, laugh if you think it's funny and accept the fact change and time go together.</fullReview>

Lots of extra's including out takes and a version useful music thing. That allows you to play the soundtrack within the film.Great, watch it today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was one of the few movies where I got out of the cinema and still had to laugh - this and "Beavis and Butthead". I know, it's a matter of taste, but this movie IS funny, when you don't look too sharp... and it has certainly a deeper meaning, there are some beautiful real-love scenes in it. Really good movie! btw. The first movie I rated 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie goes much deeper than it appears.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before watching this movie, I thought it would be a lot like "There's Something About Mary;" overly crude, real in your face, with a lot of stupid acting characters in it. Somewhat enjoyable, but not as funny as others made it out to be. However, I was greatly surprised to find this an excellent teen movie. On the surface, there are the cruder aspects of teenage years: sex and bathrooms. But when you actually watch this movie, instead of dismissing at as a gross-out film, you will notice the excellent direction of the Weitz brothers, the small details that they put into each character that make them more than the caricatures so common in movies today. Every actor contributes to that effort by really getting into the mindset of a graduating HS senior. The maturing of each character is evident and encouraging. See this movie with an open mind, and you will be thoroughly entertained.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excellent cast of characters. Some of these kids, each of us will identify with. If you haven't seen this movie yet, WATCH it! 4 sexually deprived teenage boys, band together in a pact to resolve their virginity by prom night. The fun all happens on the way &amp; you won't believe how some of these kids "angle" to get sex. Jim leads the comedy meaning of "American Pie". The girls in the film are equally outrageous, so don't think this is strictly a guy movie. For anyone who lived through puberty, you'll definitely identify with this movie.

		<shortDescription>The best pie ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know what most adults are thinking when somebody talks to them about "American pie". They believe it's some stupid comedy only about young kids who want to have sex before graduating. Well, that's not what it is about. Indeed, there is much more to the movie than just four kids wanting to have sex. There is a story of relationships between friends as well as a big sports theme (lacrosse particularly). This is not only crude humor, it isn't slap-stick all the time. It has some very intelligent moments. The movie begins with a strong beginning. Jim (Jason Biggs) is jacking off in his room as he is watching an illegal channel when suddenly, without any warning, his mother comes in. This scene gives you a pretty good impression of just how much you will probably laughing through the movie. We then move on to Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) who already has a girlfriend, Vickie (Tara Reid), but have been at the same level of their relationship for quite some time now. There is also Chris (Chris Klein) who is a Lacrosse player and is too insensitive to maintain any relationship with a girl. And finally, there is Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) who is the fourth friend and doesn't try to hook up with girls that much. But when the four guys make a pact to get laid before they graduate, they all become enthusiastic. First time-directors Chris and Paul Weitz do a great job with "American pie". They seem to remember pretty well what their high-school graduation must have been like because the prom scene seems to be recreated in the exact same way it was for them. They also seemed to know exactly when to cut the comic scenes perfectly so that they don't put too much and turn their jokes into stupid jokes. Also to be mentioned as supporting actors are Sean W. Scott as Stifler, Natasha Lyonne as Jessica and Eugene Levy as Jim's dad. It's a great movie with great humor and I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

I didn't think they would find it as funny as I did, but they proved me wrong. They were in hysterics. I think it was funnier the second time.

		<shortDescription>A Very Satirical Story of Teenage Sexuality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like "There's Something About Mary", this is one comedy that would make you constantly say "OH NO!!" and chuckle really hard. But this time, it's about 4 teenagers who want to lose their virginity before their high school graduation.WARNING: SPOILER AHEAD WITH SOME CRUDE SEXUAL LANGUAGE. One the teenagers is Jim, perhaps the main character of the film because we've all seen the VERY PRIVATE side of him. The guy was a total loser on trying to score on the "Eastern European" chick, Nadia. First he makes a total a** of himself when he "tries" to get into a conversation with her at a party, only to laugh like a dork; then he "tries" to "experiment" with an apple pie, which he successfully does ONLY TO GET CAUGHT BY HIS DAD!!! I mean my God!!! What's wrong with this guy?? Is that typical teenage stuff? I doubt it. Well at least he succeeds into getting Nadia naked in his room, but then (while being broadcasted LIVE on the Internet) he ejaculates not once but twice before she could even get on him!! Oz, the jock, is probably someone we can all relate to. We all want to accomplish being with the person of our dreams (him joining the jazz choir to score with a cute girl), but then we end up getting dumped (Oz insulting her with the other jocks behind her back) and decided to "be ourselves" (Oz REALLY practicing the jazz choir solo for a contest); then perhaps that special someone may come along (her coming back to Oz, and then some [cough] more). Honest. All Kevin and his on-and-off girlfriend did was talk about sex. Only Kevin starts the conversation (and then some more) and she "tries" to refute that.The best one (and perhaps the funniest) was Finch. He was a total loser, but then he eventually scores with Stifler's (another jock) mom, whom the guys call a M.I.L.F. (Mother I'd Like to F***). Finch played this thing really smooth.There was a lot of realism in the story, considering the fact that it's teenage nature to explore sexuality, but very satirical (and raunchy). It's funny, fresh, and actually fearless (for filming some of the things that kids below 13 shouldn't see). A 10!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I heard this movie was really great, so I saw it and was glad I did. It's not as "shocking" nor as "repulsive" as I heard from many. I think this movie accurately portrays a teenager's struggling life and the situations that occur. All of the characters in this movie are funny, and likeable. The pie scene wasn't too explicit, but the implications were there. The DVD contains tons of extra so if you like this movie I'd highly recommend it. However, subject matter in this movie isn't exceptable for young kids, but I think 14 and 15 year olds can handle it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best summer film by far!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Four teenage boys vow to lose their virginity by prom night. That's it. No spin, no Dawson's Creek irony and no Shakespearean undertones, which is partly why it works so well. The rest of it is down to a screamingly funny script with brilliant dialogue and hilarious (often gleefully tasteless) situations, but one that also gives us believable characters while also giving us quite a serious message and ultimately being quite touching by the end. All the performances are top notch with Jason Biggs in particular revelling in his character's increasingly outrageous situations from screwing an apple pie while his dad walks to premature ejeculation while the whole school tunes in on the Internet and his '50s styled Dad very well used is nothing short of a creation of comic genius. From beginning to end, this priceless gem scores all hits and no misses, but it's Alyson Hannigan, as the geeky flute player, who with one line, steals the entire film.</fullReview>

I walked out of the cinema totally in love with the guys and still in tears from some of those scenes like the first sock scene, the pie scene and the music scene where Oz says "it came from the heart". The story line is very clever and everyone involved with the film should be proud. Ever since i saw it 3 days ago all the punch lines have been going through my head and all my friends keep talking about it and we laugh ourself silly. I loved it so much that i am going to see it again and again and as soon as it comes out on video i am buying it.

		<fullReview>This movie was one of the most funniest movies this summer! It included realistic scenes where-as some movies try to create something realistic, this movie actually does. This movie was about four high school teenagers making a pact to lose their virginity before senior prom. The outcome is pretty surprising too. The reason I say that this movie is so realistic is because it completely relates to teenagers today. Same problems, same way of thinking, etc. Some people say that the gross-out humor is what makes the movie bad, but in my opinion, it's what makes the movie fun. The reason that it's so funny is because it's gross-out humor. I know that this isn't "gross-out" humor but, it's the only example that I give. I remember that in one scene, they were at a party and this one guy, Jim, walked up to the girl that he liked and didn't know what to say so he just started to laugh with the girl and her friends and then walked away. He didn't even know what they were laughing at. Over-all, I think that this was a good TEENAGE movie. By,Ana</fullReview>

The thing that really drives the movie are the fantastic characters . This was a good movie. American Pie was so funny it was unbelievable. In one part Jim asks his freinds what third base felt like and they reply by saying warm apple pie then Jim waits a minute and responds with mcdonalds or home made. Some times the comedy is almost a little raunchy like when Jim's parents walk in on him masturbating . Overall though the movie is hilarious.</fullReview>

As Jason Biggs said in a recent Australian interview, "People like to be shocked," and I think if you want to be shocked, you should definetely see this movie.

I'll admit, I was mainly wanting to see Alyson Hannigan (Tell me, am I the only one here that watches Buffy the vampire slayer, for Willow? She's just such a cute character.) But she certainly doesn't turn out to be the cute little Willow character that we all know and love, which was quite interesting, and shocking to see. I was going to use the quote: "And this one time, at band camp..." but seeming someone else has already gone and done that, I won't... (Well, it would appear that I already have. Oh well, you get that don't ya?)Well, I can't help myself, I have to say it again..... funny, funny, funny, funny, funny.....And as the saying goes.... "If you only see one movie this year...." well who cares how the saying goes, see what ever movies you want to see, just make sure you don't miss out on this one......Truly a 12 out of 10 effort.Thank you for your time.Nick.</fullReview>

It's a smart, funny, coming of age film, that remains more true than any other teen flick. Most of the characters are real, and while some situations may be too gross to actually happen, you find yourself drawn in with all the characters in the end. The character of Jim, played by Jason Biggs, young, naive and inexperienced, is very well played. His questions about sex are questions that many kids ask, but questions that no other movie has put into action. Most kids these days are exactly like that, watching porn, reading porn etc. The character of Steve Stifler, brilliantly played by Seann William Scott, is a character everyone can relate to. A smart mouthed, good looking, popular, rich guy. In almost every school around, there is at least one person, who will remind you of Stifler. But in the end, this film isn't about condoning the losing of one's virginity. It's about realising that losing your virginity is not the coolest thing in the world. It's not something that everyone has to do before they finish school, and when it finally happens, you find out it's not all it's cracked up to be.

		<fullReview>American Pie is land mark in teen comedy history. It was a terrific movie with tons of humor and a good plot that kept you laughing throughout the entire film. It tells the tale of four young men in high school who make a pact to lose their virginities by prom. The movie centers around Jim, Kevin, Oz, and Finch. It follows their experiences and exploits, their trials and errors, and their triumphs and their miserable, humiliating failures. And we can't forget Stifler, enough said. This comedy is an instant classic with it's terrific toilet humor and amazingly funny potty jokes, from uncontrollable bowel movements in the girls' bathroom, to premature explosions in the pants, to drinking a pale ale, this movie's got it all. So, if you haven't seen it, go out to the nearest video store and rent it today.</fullReview>

Everybody does remember losing their virginity and while a movie that focuses on four teenage lads dunder-headed attempts to do just that before graduation rolls around might seem crass, this isn't so much a movie about semen jokes as it is about being a teenager, a sentiment I'm sure we can all relate to in some way.The storyline is simple, Jim (Jason Biggs), Oz (Chris Klein), Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) and Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) are sick to the back teeth of being sexually frustrated and make a pact to help each other like, make it with a girl dude by the time the end of school arrives - a standard racing the clock scenario that everyone who found themselves four months from University and still a virgin can surely relate to. Along the way they make a number of misguided attempts to achieve this which usually result in the luckless Jim suffering severe humiliation.Thus far, so very cretinous, but this is no Van Wilder: Party Liason by any stretch of the imagination. These four guys are not cardboard caricatures whose basic purpose is to serve up fodder for a string of smutty jokes, they are genuinely endearing. Jim especially is a lovable, bumbling clown that recalls the nervous, jittery idiot that all of us once were when first confronted by bare female flesh. Oz is a bit of a weak link as his story is somewhat clunky, but the rest of the lads are just as appealing and Kevin's rather sweet relationship with his girlfriend Vicky (Tara Reid before she set about destroying her reputation) is handled beautifully.Backing all this up is an equally strong cast of supporting characters. The girls that form the object of the boys lust are treated with similar dignity, rather than just being another line of bimbos on their way to exposing their breasts in a shower a la Porky's. Alyson Hannigan as the "not as geeky as she first appears" Michelle is hilarious, Sean William-Scott is a loud mouthed but ultimately rather charismatic oaf that everyone remembers, but Eugene Levy is the one who shines brightest. As Jim's good natured dad, he shows that parents trying to give their kids a nudge in the right direction can be just as witless as their offspring and he steals every scene he's in and pretty much the whole movie along with them.Sure, this may make it sound like American Pie is too clever-clever for its own good, but don't worry, there are plenty of bodily fluid jokes to keep the laughs coming, including one brilliant moment where a series of mishaps leads to Jim dancing naked on the Internet that had me clutching my sides in pain from laughing too much. This is still a gross out comedy, but it is a gross out comedy that has genuine humanity behind it and if you're in the right frame of mind, is the sort of film that evokes a real sentimentality for the time when raging hormones and adolescent naivety were an everyday part of life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"American Pie" is a teenage sex comedy that follows the plight of four high school seniors (Jim, Kevin, Finch, and Oz) who make a pact to lose their virginity by the time they graduate from high school and of course, their goal ends up being prom night.The most unlucky of the four is Jim even though Finch ends up having a pretty embarrassing experience in the girl's bathroom. Jim has a father that won't stop giving him advice regarding sex and shows him pornographic magazines and a mother who freaks out when he is caught watching "illegal channels". This character is also caught in several compromising situations from masturbating while watching scrambled porn on TV to being caught by his father having sex with an apple pie. The worst of which is blowing it when he has the chance of having sex with a hot foreign exchange student, which is something that the entire high school sees on the internet. Although Jim ends up losing his virginity on prom night, it ends up being with a band camp geek, who ends up using him. The funny thing is that Jim doesn't seem to mind at all. Overall, American Pie is a hilarious movie and may very well be the best of all teenage sex comedies. It definitely sets an example for those that precede it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie, by itself, is hilarious. It's funny for the younger set that can immediately relate to the humor that describes, at least on some level, the world that they live in and for the older set that can now sit back and laugh at the way that they were (or their friends were) when they were growing up.It's got a cast of younger actors who are truly hilarious and then they also throw in the father, Eugene Levy (sp?) to make things even funnier. His straight acting to the comedy around him is legendary, and he shows off his skill in this set of movies.As noted in my tagline, this movie is funny even if you only saw it and none of the sequels. But where this set of movie excels is in the fact that there are sequels. It shows not only that they can find fresh humor with all of the same characters (a winning point to this set of movies is that it appears that the entire cast returns each time) but that the characters can actually start to slowly show maturity throughout the films up until the American Wedding movie.See this movie if you want a good laugh, get all of them if you want to have a lot of good laughs and if you want to actually see the characters grow over time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>American Pie is an amazing picture in its way, its one of the funniest films ever shot. Its one of the only films that I have actually had to hit pause so I could catch my breath a breath properly again. The performances are actually quite good, something very rare in teen comedies. The direction is very good also each scene and character has its own feel, and is directed perfectly to the feeling. The story is raunchy and crude, but at the end also very good hearted. The screenplay is one of the strongest points, the dialogue sizzles, some of the most realistic I have ever heard. The look at a teenage life is also extereemly realistic, me being a teenager know this more than all the adults that called this crude, unfunny, and unrealistic. This is very R. rated, but so is the life of a teenager, sometimes even more than this film. I loved this film, and unless your even slightly closed minded you will to. If you enjoyed American Pie, you might also like National Lampoons Animal House.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>American dreams of idiotic teens</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I viewed the 'gasp' unrated version of the high school sex comedy which renewed interest in "Porky's"-style bathroom humor. My guess is the 'extra' scenes involve Nadia-the-foreign exchange-student's striptease while spied on by the Internet. But other than that, there's very little nudity or simulated sex on screen. In fact, just about all the risqué stuff happens off-camera: you hear various noises, someone bursts into the room, they gasp at what they see, but YOU don't see it. A famous early scene has a guy with a boner - but it's covered with a sock. All the bedroom scenes near the end when the guys finally get lucky are also demure, as the females are all strategically covered up. Then, of course, there's the infamous 'guy-making-it-with-a-pie' scene. It's just stupid. The entire movie is rather odd. It's almost like watching a TV sit-com show which contains some gross, raunchy ideas. All the kids, especially the males, look like they fell out of a cutesy '80s TV show. They all talk and act like kids from the '60s or '50s. Sure, they're obsessed with sex, but so were kids in the '50s. Then there's the requisite toilet jokes, including the 'guy-has-to-take-a-nasty-dump' scene (in the girls' bathroom, in this case). In the end, we have a typical coming-of-age tale. I suppose when you get to be a certain age (like me), you realize this type of stuff is recycled by Hollywood every 20 years or so. They hype it quite a bit, of course, and teens &amp; young twenty-somethings flock to it thinking it's something which has never been seen or done before. In a sense, maybe they're right. Kids today, like any day, don't believe anything valid existed more than 10 years back. Everything is NOW-NOW-NOW, with no thought to history (or film history). Ironically, it probably would have been better if everyone had forgotten that "Porky's" and its sequels had ever existed, but somehow or other, someone manages to dredge up the excrement of low-class material which used to elicit howls of laughter from brain-dead teens (now long gone) for the current masses.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My comments and feelings about this movie are best summed up by the sarcastic sentiments of Sideshow Bob from the Simpsons:"That was a well-plotted piece of non-claptrap that never made me want to retch."Where should I begin? I've never liked teen movies, but I decided to give this one a chance. Why? My friends, who normally have very good taste in movies, highly recommended it. Needless to say, I've never trusted their opinion on any movie ever again. While they sat, enjoyed the movie, and laughed, I rolled my eyes and checked my watch.Is having sex with a pie supposed to be funny? Are the raging libidos of a group of teen-aged boys a good focal point for a movie plot? It could be, if it weren't so poorly executed.After leaving the movie, and expressing my dislike, I was told that the movie was "for boys, and not for girls." If poorly acted, poorly scripted, horribly directed movies with boring and childish humor are for men and not women, then I'm joining a feminist group!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>..."American Pie" is the kind of movie for that kid in third grade who'd shout out "Sex!" because he thought the word was funny. Honestly, every joke in this movie is just a slightly different variation of shouting out "Sex!". Please, I don't call that funny, I call it elementary.The story focuses on Jim (Jason Biggs), Oz (Chris Klein), Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) and Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas), a bunch of teens who all vow to lose their virginity by prom night. They do this because Chuck Sherman (Chris Owen), an annoying loser, claims he lost his virginity before them. Unfortunately it is so obvious that Chuck is lying that anyone who was actually surprised by this near the end wasn't paying attention. Of course, it's hard to pay attention to a movie like this.The only thing worse than the movie though was the acclaim it got. A few years after it first came out I heard my friends (I use that term loosely) making the same vow. Unfortunately, these kids were thirteen. If "American Pie" is inspiring pre-teens to impregnate other pre-teens, and is famous for it, well, that shows you what kind of world we're living in.If you have any substance to your character than please, stay away, 4/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very stereotyped, comedy concerning the extremities of High School Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie a few years ago when I was around 14. I must say, I was pretty disturbed with some parts of the movie, especially since I saw this as a freshman in high school. Thinking back on it, it was a mostly an amusing movie with a weak plot. The main character in this movie, Jim Levinstein (Jason Biggs), is a senior in high school and he is urging his girlfriend, Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth), to have sex with him. In the end she does after the senior prom. Jim tries everything from giving her an orgasm through oral sex to sweet-talking/persuasion. This story is surrounded by the issues of Jim??s schoolmates, Chris 'Oz' Ostreicher (Chris Klein), Kevin Myers (Thomas Ian Nicholas), Steve Stifler (Seann William Scott), Paul Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas), and Chuck Sherman (Chris Owen). Jim and his friends make a ?°pact?± to all get laid (have intercourse) before high school graduation. All of his friends succeed, except for Chris, who ends up finding his ?°true love,?± Heather (Mena Suvari). There are many entertaining scenes, especially with Jim??s father (Eugene Levy), Jim getting caught many times doing?¦ erm.. ?°inappropriate things.?± It is a stereotyped movie that adds funny scenes concerning high school, senior prom, and sex. I??m sure some of this happens in the high schools around the US, but I??m sure that not all students have sex after senior prom, as this movie alludes.</fullReview>

Whoever casted this film did a great job. Jason Biggs and Seann-William Scott are absolutely hilarious. I think Mena Suvari stands out as doing the best job. Eugene Levy is hilarious as well.

		<shortDescription>Paul Weitz's American Pie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"American Pie" breaks all the rules, an explicit sex comedy that was a huge hit despite a then no-name cast and freshman director and writer. What else? This has no laughs, at all Four completely unbelievable high school boys decide to help each other lose their virginity before prom...no, not THAT way. Thomas Ian Nicholas is dating Tara Reid, but cannot bring himself to say "I love you." Eddie Kay Thomas takes a cerebral approach to gettin' some, hoping a rumor he starts himself will get him a mate. Chris Klein joins the jazz choir and meets Mena Suvari, but finds himself falling in love with her instead. The main character, Jason Biggs, is so desperate to have sex he pleasures himself with the title pastry and inadvertently posts his first humiliating sexual experience (with a foreign exchange student) on the internet. None of the high school students seem to have parents, except one guy's mom who ends up in bed with Thomas. Biggs' has the walking embarassment Eugene Levy as his dad. Levy was singled out favorably for a performance that is anything but funny. As a matter of fact, none of this is funny. I smiled at the beginning because Biggs was trying to see some scrambled porn while "wearing" a tube sock when his parents walk in. Other than that, nothing. Klein and Suvari have nice chemistry, and almost make this film half way watchable. While their romance borders on cute and sweet, it is still simplistic and stunted. I saw more loving emotions on "Family Matters" after Urkel hit puberty. I do not believe dumbing down my comedic tastes would have made this any better. I just do not think a guy drinking a beer with sperm in it is funny. I just do not think a guy running into a girls' restroom in an emergency because he was slipped a laxative is funny. I just do not think a nine year old kid jumping on a bed and saying the "F" word over and over again is funny. I just do not think this film is funny. Adam Herz's script is just "Porky's" turned up to its most disgusting degree. The characters' actions make little sense, and are put on screen to get the cheapest of laughs. Shannon Elizabeth's masturbation scene is a low point in this young woman's career...but I have not seen the sequel, either. Paul Weitz directs this as if his master plan was to drain all the energy out of every scene he pointed his camera at. On the other side of the camera, Tara Reid is five years older than Thomas Ian Nicholas, and looks it. The rest of the male cast is so interchangeable, I had to study the end credits to get character names right. After three years of hype, "American Pie" does not live up to even the lowest expectation I held for this- is it too much to ask for at least ONE laugh from a comedy? Go check your local listings, "Porky's" must be on the Fox Movie Channel again this month. This is the unrated version, and contains mild physical violence, strong profanity, female nudity, brief male nudity, very strong sexual content, very strong sexual references, and strong adult situations.</fullReview>

Yes, the film makers learned to make the other films much funnier but this is just terrible. Only a few key scenes are humorous but not much else. While the acting is good and the story is well written, there is not much else going for it. This is basically 70 minutes (not the whole movie was bad) flushed down the toilet. That one is much more funny. This was poorly made with bad writers. If you want a good American Pie film, go watch American Pie Beta House instead.I give American Pie a 3/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Serious and Legitimately Good Comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is the best teen comedy of the decade, hands down. It is like "Fast Times at Ridgemont High: The Next Generation." It follows a group of four different, but close high school friends: the geeky Jim Levenstein (Biggs), athletic Chris "Oz" Oztreicher (Klein), charming Kevin Meyers (Nicholas), and oddball Paul Finch (Thomas), who make a pact to lose their virginity before graduating high school, which prom being the last chance. Jim tries to score with sexy exchanged student (Elizabeth), Oz tries to make it with a straight-laced choir singer (Suvari), Kevin tries to win the trust of his girlfriend (Reid) whose relationship is ending, and Finch pays people to support a new reputation of his. Supporting characters include Jim's guiding father (Levy), obnoxious party animal Steve Stifler (Scott), band geek and Jim's last-minute partner (Hannigan), Stifler's sexy mom and Finch's last minute effort (Coolidge), sex expert Jessica (Lyonne), and wannabe cool Chuck Sherman "the Shermanator" (Owen). These other characters add to the hilarity, heart and memorability.Despite this movie being about sex and totally hilarious, the character development and chemistry are strong, and Kevin's and Oz's subplots are more dramatic than funny. So any super-conservative person would be surprised at the right mix of comedy and drama. The seriousness isn't sad or boring, it is there to strengthen the quality of the movie. Also, everything this movie has is realistic and relatable with the hard times of high school. So it may be about trying to get laid, but that is an aspect that nearly every teenager faces. As the guys get closer to doing so, they also learn lessons on love and adulthood. And since each friend is different, more lessons can be made and the movie gets strengthened even more. Without these strong dimensions, it would just be a stupid late-night comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first slice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ah the first time. In 1999, American Pie joined an elite club of teen comedies that would forever be remembered as classics in the genre. Not since Porky's, had a movie been as more outrageous as American Pie, and the fact is that the late 90's generation had a movie to sort of label them, but not in a negative way.The story follows a group of four teenage boys (Jim, Kevin, Oz and Finch), who pledge to lose their virginity, but things aren't as easy as they might seem. Jim is a bumbling buffoon who gets embarrassed talking to girls and listening to his father's awkward sexual advice. Kevin is dating Vicki, but has trouble balancing his feelings for her and his desire to have sex with her. Oz, after a college girl rejects him and gives him pointers, is looking to bring his sensitive side and ends up falling for Heather. And Finch finds a way to spread rumors about himself in school, but things don't turn out the way he planned.In all of these individuals, the raunchy, hilarious and sometimes even sexy situations will make you fall on the floor with laughter. However what I also love about this movies is that the characters evolve and actually face teen, and later adult, complications. As for this movie, it is my second favorite of the 4 movies, as American Pie 2 is my favorite. Still this first slice of pie, will always have a special taste for me. Rating 9,5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best films of 1999 - American Pie is a loud, crude and rude hilarious 90s comedy that revolves around typical teenagers....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a huge comedy fan, obviously i love this movie. American Pie is one of the funniest, most original teen comedies ever made - a laugh-a- minute comedy with some of the most likable characters ever. It sees Jim, Oz, Finch and Kevin - four typical high school teenage students who have yet to accomplish one thing; and it's an important thing (to them). That thing is lose their virginity. It all comes about after Kevin suggests they "make a pact" - a pact that they'll all get "laid" by prom. After the infamous inspiring speech, in which Kevin finishes with "We will get laid....", things start to get even funnier. Jim ends up making a complete fool of himself. Jim installs a webcam and a very beautiful foreign exchange student called Nadia asks if she can get some help with her studies; Jim, worried what to say, looks to both Oz and Kevin and they're like: "Yes! Yes!", without Nadia hearing as they whisper it, thus Jim says yes (resulting in Nadia being able to come round to his house for help). Jim gets interrupted whilst he's on webcam as Nadia comes in, therefore leaving it on without realisation. Jim says he'll be back (he goes over to see Kevin and Finch as they're hooked up to see what all is going on) and in a matter of minutes, Nadia gets undressed and starts performing ...... something sexual on herself (HAHA!) At this point, Jim, Kevin and Finch can barely believe it - they tell him he should go over there and more or less "seduce" her. Jim runs all the way back - and before he goes in, he prays that "this is the moment..." and says "please let this be it..." whilst nervously staring up at the ceiling. Jim's unaware that the webcams views actually go out to everyone in the high school (basically, he sent it wrong, and everyone can see what the webcam he installed picks up, thus everything that happens, they'll see!) Very worried and nervous, Jim blows his luck with Nadia...twice, and the result is him typically getting laughed at in school the next day. Overall, American Pie is one of the funniest, most hysterical and enjoyable comedies ever made. It's a proper classic. It actually gets better as you grow up, as you're able to understand much more things that are going on and that are happening in the film. Great characters, mild, yet good acting, good directing, very funny scenes and classic moments - American Pie truly deserves a strong 9.5, if not 10/10. Hilarious.......it never gets old.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first American Pie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"American Pie" is the first movie of the American Pie series and in this movie we watch four teenagers who make a deal to lose their virginity until prom night and before college. It's a hilarious movie in which we can watch how these four teenager are trying so much to succeed, we also watch their lives in school, parties and at home with their parents.I liked very much this movie because of the plot and the storyline and I have to say that I did not expected to like it. I also liked this movie because of the cast and their interpretations. Eugene Levy makes a really outstanding interpretations as Jason Biggs and Seann William Scott also do. I also believe that Tara Reid, Alyson Hannigan and Shannon Elizabeth make an also great interpretations.Finally I have to say that "American Pie" is one of the best comedy movies that I have ever seen and I strongly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great high school sex-romp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A group of high school friends try hard to get to the next level. When the guys find even the Shermanator got laid, the 4 friends (Jason Biggs, Chris Klein, Thomas Ian Nicholas, Eddie Kaye Thomas) vow to score before high school graduation. It's your basic teenage sex romp.It could have been so easily a nothing movie. But the friendship elevates it, and there are plenty of funny things going on. It doesn't get funnier than Eugene Levy as Jim's Dad. And these young actors are so compelling.Of course, Jason Biggs gets the big scenes. The Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth) scene is hilarious no matter how many times I see it. And the pie has all the people talking. Just like the shower scene in Porky's, this becomes bigger than the movie.And rarely does a movie leak into the popular lexicon. For MILF alone, I'm willing a add an extra point to my vote. And is there anything more adorable than Alyson Hannigan's "This one time, at band camp...."?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>American Pie more then movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many times I have heard positive feedback from my friends about this movie , but somehow it did not have time to see and even begrudgingly . But , having spent a half hour on the first part of the "American Pie" , I do not regret !Every moment of the film resembles the modern teenage society that young people care about these days. Each of the main characters I easily recognized himself and his friends. For this movie is a huge plus .The humor of the film at the highest level, the mass is very funny and amusing moments.Also worth noting is the incredible acting. Actors chosen perfectly. Hard to imagine that the role of Jim decides someone better Jason Biggs - relaxed and calm in dealing with friends, it is closed in conversations with girls. An excellent job with their roles , Chris Klein, Thomas Ian Nicholas and Eddie Kaye Thomas . But a separate credit goes to Seann William Scott , who gave the film a whole new mood.Many may think that the AP has attracted only by his vulgar jokes , but this is not the case. The plot of the film is excellent , it is not just the story of how the guys wanted to have sex, but about the fact that the world beyond that there is a real genuine love .I think my estimate is obvious : 7\10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crude But Incredibly Funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American Pie (1999) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Four high school seniors make an agreement that they're going to have each others back so that they can lose their virginity before prom night. That's pretty much all the storyline one needs to know and I still remember when this movie came out people said it was just riding on the coat tails of "gross-out" comedies like THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY but looking back on the film after all these years there's no denying that it's really one of the best comedies to come from that era. I think the film works best as a throwback to those teen sex comedies of the 1980s like PORKY'S and FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH. The movie benefits from some gross out humor but a film needs more than just that and what's at the core of this movie are some wonderful performances and a realistic story about friendships in high school. With that said, no one should be expecting some heart-warming moments because there really aren't any and that's a good thing. Instead we just have one outrageous set-up after another and yes the majority of them are in the vulgar manor. This includes having your parents catching you masturbating, streaming yourself and a girl via the web and of course the infamous pie sequence. One could be party a killer and say most of this would have been avoided had the character just learned to lock a door but that would just take away the fun. The movie goes for a lot of jokes but the thing is that most of them work. I'd say the only one that doesn't is a sequence involving a toilet but this is just a small portion of the film. Another major benefit is that the cast members are so good with each of them really making their character something memorable. Jason Biggs, Thomas Ian Nicholas, Chris Klein, Seann William Scott, Tara Reid, Alyson Hannigan and Shannon Elizabeth are all extremely good and help make the film. Eugene Levy also deserves a lot of credits because his reaction shots are some of the funniest bits in the movie. American PIE was obviously influenced by certain movies but it's never a rip-off and instead it just delivers a great, if at times disgusting, time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my review on American pie. This movie is a great comedy classic. It starts the birth of all teen and raunchy comedies. It has great comedic moments and hilarious actors and writing.The story line to this movie is very simple and straight forward. 4 friends who are in high school and still are virgins make a packed that they will all lose their virginity by prom night. Of course a bunch of wild antics ensue that keeps the audience laughing.If you have not seen this movie then you are not a fan of comedies nor movies. This movie has been out forever and is an instant classic. Good acting funny jokes, and partial nudity it will for sure keep you entertained.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fed up with their lack of success with the opposite sex, four teenage boys make a pact to lose their virginity before leaving high-school.In 1999, the teen sex comedy?a genre that had last flourished in the early to mid-80s?returned with a vengeance when American Pie became a runaway success at the box office. Directed by newcomer Paul Weitz, and featuring an almost unknown (at the time) cast, the film had 'em rolling in the aisles thanks to its no-holds-barred, gross-out humour. Masturbation; oral sex; premature ejaculation; diarrhoea; intercourse with baked goods; the accidental ingestion of baby gravy: nothing was considered off-limits to these guys if it had the potential for hilarity.However, what made American Pie particularly special was that, despite the fact that the film's humour consisted primarily of wall-to-wall vulgarity, it also managed to be kinda sweet in the process. The main characters, a group of likable high-school geeks who are faced with the seemingly insurmountable task of getting laid, are not presented as vacuous ass-holes with one-track minds, but rather as young adults who are simply coming to terms with the responsibilities and pressures of adulthood: something that most people have to deal with at some point in their lives.Of course, from a bloke's point of view, it doesn't hurt that the film also features some rather gorgeous women: Tara Reid is oh-so pretty; Mena Suvari is doe-eyed and innocent; Shannon Elizabeth is smoking hot (and nekkid!); and Alyson Hannigan is there for all of those who dig nerdy chicks. Something for all tastes, it would seem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A surprisingly original and occasionally thoughtful teen 'epic'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American Pie (1999)Rated R for crude sexual humour, nudity, language and sex referencesWhen watching such films, I tend to be critical and highly scrutinising, however, 'American Pie' is sort of a surprise. This is quite a good film and does have traces of originality and quality.While 'American Pie' includes your usually crude humour, pervasive sexual references and considerable nudity, it does stop and think at times, something that is extremely rare amongst films of this kind.There are some scenes of gross-out humour that will guarantee, what I like to call a 'laughing spree'. What makes 'American Pie' stand out from other dull, unfocused teenage movies, is that, apart from being extremely funny, cleverly written and having a well-suited cast, is the fact that it does show friendships, thoughts, differences in teenagers, without just being focused on meaningless nudity and sex all the time.This is a film for pure enjoyment and humour, a film that clearly demonstrates the thoughts of the average teenager, along with comedy, nudity and some American Pie.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Positive surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After having read some negative comments about this movie, I was positively surprised. It would have been easy to make a total fiasco out of such a movie, but this movie is well balanced and well made. The characters are likable and the acting good. Some of the gags are original, and I like the style of humour. It deals with teenage sexuality without overstepping the line for vulgarity and without being embarrassing. Another reason I liked it - and the reason for taping it - is that I hope it can break the barrier when it's my turn as a father to explain certain facts of life to my children in a few years. The movie shows teenagers that it's normal for everybody to be shy and awkward when first encountering love and sex, and that those who are bragging all over the place do it to project a false image. The movie shows what works and what doesn't work when looking for a girlfriend, and that certain pranks that go over the line can have serious consequences. It also shows teenagers that they are not weirdos if they have sexual desires or fantasies. That said, not everybody will like it. Certain will find the humour too gross. Others will find it too puerile.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Breakthrough Comedy for the 21st Century</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American Pie (1999, Dir. Paul Weitz) Jim, Oz, Finch and Kevin are four friends who make a pact that before they graduate they will all lose their virginity. The hard job now is how to reach that goal by prom night. Whilst Oz begins singing to grab attention and Kevin tries to persuade his girlfriend, Finch tries any easy route of spreading rumours and Jim fails miserably. Whether it is being caught on top of a pie or on the Internet, Jim always end up with his trusty sex advice from his father. Will they achieve their goal of getting laid by prom night? or will they learn something much different.Before 'American Pie' was released, the amount of sex comedies for teens was very small. Now, American Pie isn't just a breakthrough comedy for its many young stars, but also a breakthrough for sex comedies. The characters are so lovable and really make you feel connected to them. The casting choices were spot on. No other actors could possibly be imagined playing the characters. Everyone can relate to the characters in some way. There are some great lines in the film, especially from Eugene Levy, who is the best character of the series. There are some great gags which can look repulsive too. It's a fantastic comedy to watch, but not really the type of film to watch with parents. Only if they know what goes on in a teens life."Tell me he did not just get out the chair." - Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) "He got out the chair." - Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas)</fullReview>

I don't really understand it by the time, it was just a funny movie, when i see it again by the age of 16, i knew that this movie was the funniest thing i ever have seen. All the boys in the world have passed for this phase, that's why this movie is so funny, is not something weird, it's just natural, and the scenes are amazing unexpected but they are a possibility. I laugh since the beginning till the end... Since that time i saw this movie a lot of times and i still laugh of the jokes, even more... The actors have a nice performance, especially Sean William Scott in Stifler's role...that really brings a "thing" to this movie that no other have...Tiago</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A classic in its own right, American Pie is a hilarious sex comedy that is mostly true to life. While all of the sequels are much better than the first installment, the first one is not to be missed because it started it all. The casting is amazing, ...(read more)because without Alyson Hannigan, Jason Biggs, and Sean William Scott, the movie would not be anywhere near as good. The writing and the characters really draw you in, and things are real to life while also cleverly mocking teenagers and their way of thinking. The plot is highly original for when it was made--by now it has been copied and mocked numerous times. The movie is so easy to like, and, as stated before, all of the sequels are better than the first one. See this before this others because it's not disappointing in the least.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilarious Porky's style fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It certainly has a lot to answer for. The various duplicates Hollywood managed to fart out in it's wake - some pretty good (Orange County) most excremental (Van Wilder) - might force even the most easily tickled specimen to rethink American Pie's worth. I can safely assume most of them would still think it one of the best gross-out comedies ever. It it probably always will be that sub-genre's Citizen Kane.Whereas the likes of Animal House and Fast Times At Ridgemount High were more of an amusing observation of various deadbeats and juveniles, American Pie manages to find heart in it's characters. I still love John Belushi's impression of a zit, don't get me wrong. But I think American Pie's compassion is what gives the cake it's icing - that and Eugene Levy (I wish he was my dad :D). Jim (Jason Biggs)'s attempted conquest of foreign exchange student Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth) is certainly cringe-worthy but never crass. We like Jim. We want him to succeed. He's definitely somewhat of a dumbo, but not a complete fool. And for once the female characters have a healthy balance of sexual attitude, which in the past was mostly about guys trying to catch them changing.Don't get it twisted. This is a rude and crude comedy, with some great gags and a few stock characters that we didn't need. Some of the films worst moments involve Chris "make a table out of me now" Klein attempting to shed his jock image to reveal his sensitive side, which apparently involves joining the choir and then singing and dancing in the male showers. For all the gross gags in the film, this was certainly the most vomit-inducing. But apart from that there isn't much to complain about.Easily offended? Probably not for you. For the rest of us though, this is unadulterated hilarity, with a side order of sweet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie 3 years ago because I was only 7 when this movie had been released. This is an amazingly funny and amusing sex comedy that will have your eyes glued to the TV set. The other good thing is that it has no limits to it's jokes like other movies where you need to be careful of how crude the jokes are. The storyline is great with four teen-aged boys make a pact to loose their virginity by Prom night as they fail to do so and it sends a message across to the audience.Steve Stiffler is very different to the second and the third and as I was watching the First film for the first time in a long while Stifler's swearing seemed a little forced. Such as at the beginning, "Nova!!" "What's up dude?" "You coming to the Party tonight Ozzie you *beep* face?" seemed a little forced.A hilarious and amusing sex comedy with a great storyline is always something special.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>American Pie is a very funny and outrageous film by writer Adam Herz, with Paul Weitz expertly directing the properly cast actors. These actors include Jason Biggs, whose main character Jim Levenstein is one of the funniest and awkward teenagers I've ever seen on screen. Other kudos go to actors Alyson Hannigan as Jim's love interest Michelle Flaherty, Seann William Scott as Jim's funny friend Stifler, and especially the very funny Eugene Levy as Jim's Dad! This is definitely the definitive growing up story for the late 1990s generation. Be sure to not only watch this but the other two direct sequels. A hilarious romp at 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Funniest thing since Porky's!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the corniest movie I've ever seen since Porky's. Unlike Porky's, this movie is more up-to-date. Making a pact before graduation is usually common among high-school seniors. This was no problem for because I didn't have to worry about something silly about all this. Jason Biggs playing Jim really did his all when his character wants to get a girl, but his reluctance is crippling him really bad. Shannon Elizabeth is H.O.T. as Nadia. When she undresses in front of the web-cam, every guy in the theater will start drooling. Natasha Lyonne(The Slums of Beverly Hills) plays Jessica, the non-stop talking flute player. Alyson Hannigan(The TV version of "Buffy The Vampire Slayer") got into a really raw detail when she tells about the accident where her flute was stuck in her (AHEM!) That's graphic enough for me. The memorable part in the pie, Jim making out with cherry pie, no wonder food and sex is such a hot topic! HAHAHA! This movie is unbelievable, if you like Porky's this movie is a must!

		<fullReview>OK first things first. When I watched American Pie for the first time I didn't expect much at all... from what I'd heard it was a pretty dumb "gross-out" comedy that was every 15 year-old boy's favourite film but was highly over-rated. I was right in some ways.... some of the humour is a bit silly and predictable, and there is no doubt it was over-rated - this film is no classic. However, I found it surprisingly enjoyable. Most of the humour was actually really funny, and I found myself laughing a fair bit while watching the film (that hasn't happened since Team America ;) ). The film does get a bit sappy towards the end when it tries to push a few predictable messages about love, but it still carries through to the end well on the strength of the characters. Jim is lovable and sad at the same time, his Dad draws laughs every time he appears on screen, Stifler, Finch, Sherman and of course Michelle are great characters as well. However I found Oz and Kevin, and their respective girlfriends, rather annoying. American Pie is by no means a great movie, but I feel that it did well for what it was trying to achieve. I recommend that you give it a try some time, no matter what you've heard, its actually a decent film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched and loved this when it came out, I remember it being side splitting funny. Now re-watching watching it 6 years later while in my 30s I was pleasantly surprised that it hadn't lost it's charm, and the jokes were still funny. I didn't split my sides like I did the first time but that's often the case when you have high expectations. Yes much of the jokes are gross out, but not to the extent of the films that followed that really have taken it too far. The dialogue is well written and in many cases rings true from my experiences at high school. Tthere are very few jokes that miss the mark, and the sound track is great as well.

		<shortDescription>Great Gross-Out Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American Pie is a hilarious, raunchy comedy that will have certain people in fits.The plot is focused on a group of four friends: Jim (Jason Biggs), Oz (Chris Klein), Finch (Eddie Kay Thomas) and Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) and their sexual misadventures. All four of them make a pact to have sex before college. Enter the stupidity. Jim is hopeless with women, Oz has joined the choir, Finch is a loser and Kevin's girlfriend Vicki (Tara Reid) doesn't want sex. Along the way we meet Stifler (Seann William Scott), Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth), Michelle (Alyson Hannigan), Heather (Mena Suvari), Chuck (Chris Owens) and Jessica (Natasha Lyonne).This is a great comedy but unfortunately won't appeal to everyone. This is targeted at a younger, teenage audience. The acting is pretty good for a teenage comedy and the soundtrack is great. The humour is very raunchy. Things like a naked European woman broadcast over the internet, drinking sperm and laxatives. There is nudity of course and plenty of language but it is a very funny movie that most teens should find appealing.4/5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mostly satisfying slice of pie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, so it's not The Godfather or Gone With The Wind. It is what it is, and what it is isn't that bad at all. American Pie is a silly farce and if you're willing to turn off your brain for a couple of hours and just go with it you may well find it rather enjoyable. If you're looking for a "serious" movie with some deeper meaning, well then you've obviously come to the wrong place.The story, such at it is, revolves around a group of male high school seniors desperate to lose their virginity before graduation. But the story's not really the point, it seems as if the story's just there as something to fill space between gags and jokes. And there are plenty of gags and jokes, many tasteless, mostly funny. But even as we race from one joke to the next there is time to get to know a widely disparate cast of characters. Jason Biggs plays the central character of Jim, a mostly hapless type who finds himself on the wrong end of most of the jokes and gags. There's Chris Klein as the athlete, Eddie Kaye Thomas as the eccentric and Thomas Ian Nicholas as the seemingly normal one of the group. Outside the main circle of friends is the outlandish Stifler, played with perverse glee by Seann William Scott. Of course there are also the girls our boys are chasing. Tara Reid, Mena Suvari and Natasha Lyonne wander through but the two standouts are Shannon Elizabeth as foreign exchange student Nadia and Alyson Hannigan as geeky Michelle, two characters who will have a few surprises for the boys chasing after them. Also of note is Eugene Levy as Jim's dad. It's the only real adult role of any significance in the film and Levy brings his typical comic genius touch to the part.Anyone can do a teenage raunchfest but American Pie is something more. It's a raunchfest with heart if that's at all possible. We get to know and sympathize with these characters and watch them evolve over time. But we also get quite a few laughs at their expense along the way. Certainly American Pie will not go down in the annals of history as an all-time classic. But it's a funny, enjoyable, satisfying experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie had me laughing all the way through. It was just so funny. I wouldn't recommend it for anyone under 14/15, but it just is funny. It very typical of how most guys feel that are virgins. If you're looking for a laugh then this is the right movie to rent. It's just excellent. Words can't describe the brilliance of horny teenage guys. And hey this movie can be very educational. ha ha No but seriously do watch it. It's great &amp; wonderful, so GO Stop reading this &amp; go rent it now!! I said Now! Why are you still reading this I said to go rent that movie. And yet you're still reading I mean honestly people do you listen? :-D Go rent it. I promise it's worth it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this movie. I agree it is side-splittingly funny, though there are some more tender moments - etc when Kevin and Vicky first sleep together. The song' Sway' by Bic Runga is a perfect accompanying song to this moment. The entire soundtrack to this movie is great, I haven't bought it...yet. I also enjoyed how the film ended with Vicky becoming more independent and practical when she realised it wasn't going to work with Kevin - strong woman! It was also good how Oz remains a virgin, proving that this wasn't just about guys getting laid - there were also tender emotions and heart-felt feelings in there. This has everything - comedy, teenage romance, cute guys and girls...I really recommend seeing it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A funny accurate look at High School life for guys.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American Pie is one of the many great films of the 90's. It goes into the minds of high school teens and shows whats really goes on. With its awkward funny moments and lovable characters this is a must see. You can relate all the characters to you and your buddies back in High School. Although it has a very loose plot it makes up for it with its hilarious scenes of what guys think sex should be and how much they want it. I kept wanting more and it kept delivering more great humor. It also includes a good romance scene or two. I recommend this for anyone who likes their humor with some nudity and perverted actions. On the other hand it has some cheezy jokes and some bad displays of acting. Its almost hard to notice the mistakes in this film because you are trying to maintain control of yourself as your cracking up. Jason Biggs delivers a great performance as Jim Levetstein, the nervous guy who isn't so lucky with girls. I could relate to so many of the characters on so many levels, and i think you will too. 3 stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Aside from being an extremely funny movie, the friendship dynamic shown by the four main characters made this movie. Although #2 may have been funnier, the story line was much better. Sean William Scott as "Stifler" was by far the most humorous in the film, and should have had more face time. His facial expressions, tone and lines were all hilarious. He played the dumb jock/player perfectly. This was one of the best characters I have ever seen in any film. All four main characters were very good in their roles. Eddie Kaye Thomas as "Finch" was another great character. The dynamic between him and Stifler throughout the film were extremely entertaining. "Oz" was the most suave of the four, but lacked in the comedy department. Eugene Levy played the awkward dad very well. Although "Kevin" was somewhat annoying at times, his final scene with Tara Reid added just about the only drama element, and anyone who has had their heart broken can empathize with him. This film will become the next "Animal House" and be a required college flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>American Pie is the 1999 surprise smash hit comedy by director Paul Weitz. Jim played by Jason Biggs is one of the main characters and his inexperience with women leads him to experiment with warm baked goods. If you have ever wondered why this film has its title then lets just say that you will never look at an apple pie with a straight face again. American Pie is like a breath of fresh air compared to the recent high school based comedies, it is very clever.Jim's dad always seems to appear at the most inappropriate moments to embarrass Jim. His dad is also quite interested in teaching Jim about the ways of the world which adds a lot of humor to the film. Like "There's Something About Mary", American Pie is on of the few recent comedies that is funny throughout. From the opening "Illegal Channels" scenes to the climatic Prom, American Pie delivers. One way of judging a comedy is also by how funny it is when watched a few times. Well American Pie stands up to that test, as it is still funny after repeated viewing 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well rounded AND complete teen movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a huge fan of teen-comedy type flicks it's no surprise that i highly rate this movie.The plot is that of one which a 16 year old can highly identify with.Why? Simply because this film quite accurately depicts the life and behaviors of (perhaps ALL) teenagers.I recently read a comment made about this film (a negative one) and i found myself developing the image of an insecure 35 year old who had no fun at high school, irregardless of this, how can someone be watching "American Pie" for the first time in 2002...American Pie 2 was already released then...Behind the times, yes, perhaps.Overall to come onto IMDb and write a review of what IS a "CLASSIC" and the "STANDARD" for any teen movie to this date is just quite funny actually, i have met many types of people with all kinds of personalities and not heard one thing wrong or negative about this film.I do not believe in comparing one teen movie to another because each are their own films, with their own plots/sub-plots, one liners etc etc.But in order to accurately draw up some sort of conclusion and/or list of titles in order of the better, then this must be done AND as much as i love the "PIE" Series of films i have many other favorites that in my opinion don't add up to feel as fresh and funny as the "PIE's" but FUNNY they very much are.If you watch this movie and feel totally disgusted/disappointed/bored/sick/revolted/annoyed even, well think of this, MAYBE it's something to do with YOU and your personality, remember this IS entertainment, NOT REAL LIFE! If it were it would be totally boring.A lot of people (Peeete from UK for one) say the creators were being dishonest etc about the story and it's world far from reality!? What did you do with your friends at school? i agree there is a lack of real behaviors i.e bullying etc but if you take time to hear what the film-makers have to say you will realize you are out of your own depth, Adam Herz clearly states in the "making of..." that his school-life and friends had an "OMAGE" feel to it....The point i am making is MY SCHOOL felt like this....Yes some people hate each other BUT it's cast away in the shadows when you bring to light the "togetherness" feel everyone has.American Pie : Stifler is the (somewhat more verbal less physical) bully.It's all there for your "real world" eyes to see but when you directly compare this Flick to your actual life then YOU ARE OF COURSE GOING TO BE Disappointed! Comdeies are made for laughs, i laughed, a lot, therefore this is a pretty damn good comedy, i just wish that in the real-world where we all live more people could just let themselves go when watching a film of this genre, instead of getting all worked up over a movie about a dude who screws a pie :) ********* out of **********9 out of 10 because life just isn't perfect!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For people who rent a tape (or DVD) for fun, it is a great movie. I is tasteless, gross, it makes you laugh a lot, sometimes from good jokes and situations, sometimes from being nervous our grossed out.Unfortunately, some people go see films like star wars (or trek) and come out from the theater commenting how some physics laws were broken, or if a laser saber can cut -or not- a steel post. Movies are for fun, the spectator is expected to be in the mood for the fun the film can offer. American Pie trilogy is a great comedy, with all we can expect: some good acting among an average cast, some intelligent jokes among the obvious, and very good role playing: One could quickly learn to like (or hate) the characters. Even the people who watched the movies on their releases (with 2-year intervals), would remember the roles and the history in the very first scenes. All three films are happy ending, cheerful and light, and worthy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The end of high school is an awkward time. Some people don't know how to handle relationships into college, some people are just trying to get into college, but the most important thing to take care of is to of course have sex before you leave high school. Sooooooo important, well, at least according to American Pie, the surprise hit of 1999 that is funny, even if it's priorities are in the wrong place. I guess we do have to give the movie credit, it does feature high schoolers who are still virgins, something that few movies still acknowledge. Jason Biggs plays Jim, a confused teenager who does not quite play the whole social scene perfectly, but is an overall nice guy. His friends are Oz (Chris Klein), Kevin (Thoman Ian Nicholas), and Paul (Eddie Kaye Thomas), with a passing acquaintance with Stifler (Seann William Scott, in the role that made him). Stifler is that jock in high school that it was an honor to have him know your name. As prom day approaches, the stresses of the senior days of high school get to all of the friends and the comedy takes off from there. The movie does have a fresh look at how teens today deal with life, and does have crude comedy that is unthinkable, but you know what, I'm sure somewhere it happened to someone. Eugene Levy plays the father in a perfect role for him, he covers the uncomfortable parts of raising a growing boy well. American Pie is a funny movie about 4 boys trying to have sex, and if that sounds like entertainment to you, go see it already!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Steve Stifler is the franchise!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American Pie is a classic coming of age story about four boys who can't stand the idea of graduating high school as virgins. This movie contains a lot of crude sexual humour that is obviously not suitable for young children but it may come across the wrong way to certain non-open-minded adults. As most movies have sex scenes these days, this movie actually contains two oral sex scenes (although obviously no sensitive body parts are shown: no worries for the littluns, but why would they be watching anyway)?The film is low-budget, but the story flows well and the characters are down to earth (and so damn funny!) Seann William Scott is absolutely head-over-heals hilarious as the obnoxious Steve Stifler. If you own the DVD or VHS, you may want to rewind and view some of these priceless Stifler scenes over and over again:1.) Stifler asks if the boys are coming to his party.2.) Stifler greets Vicky, Jessica and Sherman at the party.3.) Stifler comments on Oz' failed attempt to hook up with a college girl (party).4.) Stifler has some pale ale (party).5.) Nadiavision (the monkey adds to this one).6.) Oz practising his duet in the showers after lacrosse and Stifler's response.7.) Stifler's revenge on Finch (Finch in the can).There are more, but those are all I can remember.Eugene Levy plays Jim's "open about sex" father. I felt that his embarrassing discussions with Jim were not funny to say the least (though they were intended to be), but some people liked them.Tara Reid is her usual "hot" self in this movie, and Natasha Lyonne looks good as well.The acting is not as horrible as people say. Chris Klein's (Oz) lines seemed a little forced in some places, but he made up for them with some of his other scenes.This movie can be watched over and over again and enjoyed as much as the very first time. If you enjoy sexual humour (which most of us do: some won't admit it though), this is the movie for you.This movie was followed up by two sequels that I'm sorry to say were not very good, but they are worth watching just to see what Stifler will do or say next.The unrated DVD of American Pie has a crapload of bonus features, so as Ferris Bueller would say:"If you have the means, I highly recommend picking one up!"</fullReview>

This movie is one of the best comedies I have ever seen, I watch this movie at least 3-4 times a year...That is a lot for me since football season runs August till February and then the 3 months of NFL Europe. The only thing I didn't like is Michigan State does not have a Lacrosse team, he could of said he wanted to walk on at Sewercuse or Maryland.

		<shortDescription>Great Movie, very funny sex comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this film when I was away from home staying alone in a hotel and decided to go the cinema for something to do. It was a 3 screen cinema and when I got to the desk they asked me what I wanted to see and I had never heard of any of the films. I chose "American Pie" at random and sat down with no idea what to expect - comedy, drama?Very quickly I was clutching my sides and laughing out loud. I may be an oldie (late 40's when I first saw it) and a number of other oldies clearly didn't like it and have labelled it a teen comedy. Well that is just what it is, but hilarious nonetheless. True it is a little crude in it's humour but if you are reasonably broadminded you will enjoy it. I just had to put something in to correct the views of the other oldie stick in the muds. Some of us have retained a sense of humour!The now famous scene where Alyson Hannigan reprises her geek role from the early Buffy series, but with a surprising twist, was pure magic, as was the "warm apple pie" scene with Jason Biggs.Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While this movie might be a very funny look at the very taboo subject of sex, I feel it is the right time for me to give my opinion on what was a very popular teenage film. This film had a cast that was extremely funny and a story that should and does appeal to many teenagers. However I am going to also throw some ideas to young people, that think sex is just a game or something which has to be dared, pressured or made a pact on in a group to do, to thus gain the greatest human conquests, of getting 'laid', (a term I totally disagree with).In this coming-of-age comedy, a group of friends at the end of their senior year make a pact to lose their virginity by prom night. In their outrageous attempts to fulfil this mission, they come to some surprising, hilarious and often touching realisations about themselves, their friendships, their notions of love, romance and their relations with the opposite sex. As the fateful date draws near, the boys wonder who among them will get lucky. More importantly, do they really want to do it at all?This story was very funny the first time I watched it, in a packed cinema. Yet as I have gotten a little older, my feelings on the movie and what it is about have changed quite substantially. Having the four main characters try to find glory with a girl has been done so many times, but then again I can see this film had some sort of originality to it. I did like the direction this film took, under the guidance of the Weitz brothers.The cast this film had, while rather unknown in talent, was extremely good. I enjoyed the role that Jason Biggs took on especially. To think that his character Jim was bagged for almost everything he did, it was even more courageous to act it. I remember in an interview, he said he had no problems doing the 'pie scene'. I am not sure I would have been so calm about it. Jason has gone on to do movies such as the disappointing Loser and a film called 'Boys and Girls'. The other obvious favourite in this film would have to be the gorgeous Shannon Elizabeth. She was very good as exchange student Nadia. The scenes she has with Jim are priceless, but alas of course he 'blows' the chance with her.Other members in the cast include the innocent Heather (Mena Suvari). She was a different member of the movie's group who stood out a little bit, and made the right decisions for herself. The better role the Mena has done would have to be in American Beauty, where she was a lot more liberated in what she did and said. Finch was played Eddie Kaye Thomas, and I can relate to the way his character is treated in American Pie. He is the supposed 'brains' of the group, yet outside of the classroom he was made a complete idiot of.The other standout role in this film (if you it can have such a thing?) would have to be that of Stifler (Sean William Scott). He was the bragger of the film, saying he can score with any girl he likes, which in reality is probably true. Why I don't know? Sean has also appeared in other films such as the crazy 'Dude where's my car', which I did not like, 'Road Trip' and in the tense thriller 'Final destination'.Yet we have other roles such as Vicki (Tara Reid) and her onscreen boyfriend Kevin (Thomas Ian Nichols). While Jessica (Natasha Lynne), the flute toting Michelle (Allison Hannigan) and Oz (Chris Klein), round out a pretty good cast. Yet the one person who was a little older in this movie, but still very good, was Jim's Dad (the hilarious Eugene Levy). He was so funny, that he could almost be my favourite of the whole film, with his adlibs just great.Yet this film makes a great mockery of something is meant to be so special. If people around the world try to lose their virginity, because others around them have, then I am afraid to say that sex has lost all it sacredness and value. Yet also think about what the consequences are of a sexual relationship. The AIDs virus is a deadly part of our society now, as are other STDs. Then what about unwanted pregnancies? They are common occurrence these days, which is a real problem. I am not so sure that this film worries about issues such as these, instead trading them in for a good laugh instead. Can people see where I am coming from?This film also reminded me a lot of films such as the totally funny 'Mischief', starring the gorgeous Kelly Preston. I remember reading that this film was based a little bit on Mischief. It also felt a bit like 'Fast times at Ridgemont high' and the brilliant 'Breakfast Club'. In that way I say that American Pie was good, yet it also had originality that it could only have.I have heard many people who loved this film, especially young immature teenage boys (who else but the silly looking boys hey?). Yet I met one girl who said that after one hour of viewing this movie she told me that she had to leave the cinema. I am not surprised by this reaction. As a Christian, I feel that sex is a gift that was given to us by God. Yet the general public abuses something so special by making it a very selfish act. We are not making love any longer, but sleeping around to get better names for ourselves. If people can not see that American pie does this to a very big extent, then our younger generation are more na?ve than I thought!CMRS gives 'American Pie': 4 (Very Good Film)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A funny and truthful teen flick (4/5)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every man is ashamed to carry the heavy burden of being a vergin. As men, we tend to think if we ain't getting, it won't come. It's this think that helps make "American Pie" an honest and brutely funny exploitation of what we'll go through to have sex. The story's about four friends Jim (the oustanding Jason Biggs), Kevin (Thomas Ian Nichols), Oz (Chris Klien), and Finich (Eddie Kaye Thomas). As the four approach the end of their senior year, they come to a horrifing realization: they may end up going to college as vergins! It's the taunting of recently defowlered geek Sherman (a smug Chris Owen) to force the boys into a pact: to lose their verginity by or at prom. So sets in motion the events leading up to the big night. Each of the four guys has there own scenario: Kevin is trying to convince long time girlfriend Vikki (Tara Ried) that he loves (and he's not lieing either!) and it's okay to have sex. Oz is trying to become a more sensitive guy, which leads him to "Goody, Goody, Choir Girl" cutie Heather (the adorable Mina Sivari). Finich manages to spread rumors throughout school that he is...um..."gifted". And Jim. Poor Jim. First, he gets caught watching porn, then he has an embarissing talk with his father (the brilliant Eugene Levy), onstintlly pines over forein fox Nadia (the sexy Shannon Elizabeth), And...well I won't spoil it. Then of course there's Stifler (Sean William Scott), Oz's jock friend who constantly torments Oz about Heather and Finich for...well, just for being "s*** break". But of all the girls in this movie, my favorite is band geek Michelle (cutie Allyson Hannigan), whose hand with her instament!Looking at all the charecters, its not hard to relate to any of them (for me, it's the shy, ackward, and neive Jim how I root for). And that's what makes this movie great: charecters. With the exception of Stifler, non of the guys in the movie are protraid as horny jerks. Instead, they are so caught up in the manly image of having sex, that they don't realize till the end that it may not that big of deal after all. In the process, we see two male charecters evlove from kids to men. Oz's realtionship with Heather helps him to put things in his life into perspective (the lacross/choir scene is the best example of this). Kevin's journey is to realize what it really means to "love" someone (i.e. Vikki). While Jim and Finich evlove as well, it's not with the same depth as Oz and Kevin. One of the film's highlights is the father-son relationship with Jim and his father. While these are at times halarious, they display the fathers mission: teach his son the real world of sex.Writer Adam Herz gives the charecters and story a sencere and truthful outlook on not just sex, but with high school, relationships, and growing up. But it's the Weitz bros. who close the ball game. Refusing to make a "Farrley Brothers Clone" of a movie, they don't try to make EVERY joke as discusting as possible (though some are bad). Also, they don't want it to seem that the whole world hates the film's heros. It wants the best for them and wants them to be happy, but they have to fall on their face once in awhile.I do have some complaints about this movie though. First, I don't like the charecter Jessica (Nastasia Lyonne). Yes, I know she severs as a confidant to Vikki, but she just doesn't work for me. Second, the charecter Michelle plays a big role in the movie, so why is she seen so sparingly? Finally, the film follows too many "Teen Flick" clichas (thankfully, those doppy cliches from other movies don't jump to the forefront too often).But in the end, I have to say that I loved "American Pie". It's a crude comedy with heart, and in ranks as one of my favorite teen flicks (right behind John Hughes' "The Breakfast Club")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sexy, Good American Fun...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If i'm in the mood for a sexy good time as far as film goes, then I know I can count on my copy of American Pie. It's the one movie that i've watched time and time again since it was first released on dvd, and have found it to be interesting each time I see it. Truthfully my all time favorite scene has to be Jim and Nadia in his bedroom, and her making him strip for the unbeknowest to her camera. This is the one film that can now be landmarked as an american treasure right along with the classic Animal House. Of course the two are totally different films, but good old natured fun in both aspects. Another thing I loved about AP was the ensemble casting. It's like looking at my own circle of friends that I went to high school with. That's another reason for my liking this film so much, just for the pure reflection of it all, and the overall genius in the humor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"American Pie" is certainly not one of my favorite movies; however, I will say that it left me laughing very hard."American Pie" is a crude movie and should not be seen by young children by themselves. The performances were nothing special but with the talent attached; "American Pie" gets the job done to my satisfaction.The best part about this movie is that the cast enjoyed &amp; knew what they were doing at the same time. I must give credit to the Weitz brothers for an outstanding and convincing job how high school really is.This is an humorous movie with an okay plot and average performances.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Certainly not the highest grade of comedy, but neither is it absolute grossout humor. In the first installment of this trilogy we meet the kids, this group of boys eager to lose their virginities by graduation. Now, while a little shallow in story, the characters carry it well, especially Biggs and Shannon Elizabeth together. Here we see a developed relationship of each guy and his respective girl, and there certainly is sweet romantic stuff, notably between Chris Klien and Mena Suvari. All in all, a defined guys night rental.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It is the defining teen/college comedy of the new generation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think anyone who writes a bad review of this film must think that they are 'above' this style of humour which the film uses.All I can suggest to them is that they eat a slice of 'humble pie' and realise that being immature is actually great fun!This is without a doubt the landmark teen comedy of the new generation. In the late 70's, Animal House was the one that officially started it all. Then, in the 80's, Fast Times at Ridgemont High was the landmark teen comedy. Then, in the late 90's, came American Pie. It took us into the new Millennium with two more installments which I would rate as highly as, if not better than, the original! Now, I am looking forward to seeing what the landmark teen comedy of the 2000's is!There is a pattern that seems to have emerged... Each landmark film makes at least one of its cast a star. Animal House made John Belushi a cult legend (and Tim Matheson also to an extent), Fast Times made the film careers of multiple actors who today are household names (Pheobe Cates, Judge Reinhold, Sean Penn to name but a few), and American Pie gave new found success to Sean William Scott (and also gave Jason Biggs some star status). And that is just a brief overview.Its a true comedy gem and it will definitely go down in the film history books with its name etched next to Animal House and Fast Times at Ridgemont High, among other classics.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I avoided this one as long as I could, finally a friend insisted that I watch it. My review?OK-it's not bad. I gave it a 6(and that was being kind). So yes there are some funny parts to this movie. You may laugh. And YES I thought the legendary "pie scene" was funny, very funny actually, and laughed along with millions of other people.However, that said American Pie is run of the mill, typical and not really a terrific movie. Hundreds of comedies are funnier and after seeing this, I can't say I particularly remember much about it or would have cared at all had I not seen it.It does have some funny moments and it isn't as bad as I thought it would be at all. The humor is there at times. But there are a lot of other teen comedies that are more genunely unforgettable. The single best comedy for young people is "fast times at richmond high." This can't come close.Like I said, It's not unwatchable, merely typical. Many Many better comedies out there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'American Pie' is one of those rare comedies that fools you into thinking it's a gross-out pointless bomb. But it isn't, it's actually filled with tremendous heart. Jim (Jason Biggs), Oz (Chris Klein), Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) and Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) are out to lose their virginity before their Senior year of High School is over. Along the way they get made fun of by Jock-Jerk Stifler (Seann William Scott) and seduced by forgien exchange students. While many gags are aimed torward teens the real stories lie in Kevin's difficulty in figuring out if he loves his girlfriend Vicky (Tara Reid) or not. And Oz's shedding his Jock persona and signing up for Choir to prove to Heather (Mena Survari) how much she means to him. The ensemble cast (which includes Natasha Lyonne and Eugene Levy) also makes the movie such a joy to watch In the end, the adolecent mischief and curiousity regarding sex becomes unlikely entertainment for teens that are going through it and adults who want to remember.RATING: *** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although the film has moments of grossout humour, AMERICAN PIE is actually quite a cute film with a warmth that some films of it's ilk has. Wisely focusing as well on the problems that some teenage boys face, and girls to that extent, it is a lot more enjoyable for that.Both Tara Reid and Mena Suvari manage to maintain a sense of dignity with their roles and don't allow themselves to be fazed too much by some of the more ridiculous moments on show.Sean William Scott does have a touch of the Jim Carreys about him, but he will be fondly remembered as Stifler. Eddie Kaye Thomas nearly steals the film with his portrayal of Finch with his laid-back manner.Good fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Male counterpart to the "chick flick"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American Pie should be taken out of the category of 'teen comedy' and to me, should be placed under a special video store category called "The Male Counterpart To The Chick-Flick." Most men can probably relate to the humor in the film in a way that only the most fussy or virtuous male could not. It is funny in a towel-snapping, vulgarity-spewing, sexual one-upmanship way, a real "guy" film. Studies show that most men think of sex approximately once every three minutes; this film reflects a compressed thought process in a man's late teens when the hormones are a-ragin'. Sex is fantasized about, idealized and bragged about (although often with no corroborating truth). Women can say, "guys, you just don't get it" at a For Women Only or Vagina Monologues get-together, but this is a film that mirrors what growing up from boy to man is about. The film stars Jason Biggs as the dopey, sexually naive Jim Levinstein, under duress to meet the deadline of losing his virginity by the end of prom night. Along with Jim are his three high school buddies, Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas), Oz (Chris Klein), and Paul (Eddie Kaye Thomas). These characters are symbolic of high school cliques; Kevin, good looking, popular; Oz, the jock; and Paul, the eccentric intellectual. The fifth wheel is Steve Stifler (Seann William Scott), a teammate of Oz's and son of a divorced mom, who has the run of the house, dad's money to burn and a mouth, well, worse than a sailor's. As true in high school, people gravitate to Steve Stifler's house (not to Steve, really, he's hunky, but an insufferable pig) to take advantage of his monied hospitality, endless weekend parties, and, for the testosterone-charged, a portrait of his svelte mother on the wall. The character of Jim's father, only known to the audience as Mr. Levinstein, is played by Eugene Levy. It is on the relationship between Jim and his dad that a supporting foundation is built for the film. What man doesn't recall in a profoundly agonizing way the "father-son" talk? It is remarkably performed by Levy. But he is a father who loves, and hugs, his son despite Jim's embarrassed protestations. Without going into a great deal of (unprintable) detail, the film centers around the pact between the four friends, and a typical teen male's challenges: uninterrupted masturbation, excelling at sports, the battle of peer pressure and self-esteem, partying and drinking illegally, and having a long enough relationship with a woman in order to make it on prom night ("trophy" dates gladly received). Of course, college is a given for all, it's only a matter of a few more months to enjoy freedom. The female roles, starring Tara Reid as Kevin's steady girlfriend, Vicky; Natasha Lyonne as Tara's older and sexually wiser friend Jessica; Mena Suvari as Oz's girl, Heather; and Jim's European exchange student and fantasy-of-the-month Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth), give the film added complexity. Alyson Hannigan plays the hilarious Michelle, the cultist music student; she ends up being Jim's date as a last resort. Paul Finch, Jim's scotch-swilling friend, starts a rumor about the size of his "equipment" in order to get a prom date, but is tripped up by Stifler. Finch attends the prom alone, but revenge is sweetly his. After the post-prom party at Stifler's cottage, the buddies gather round--revealing their stories. Sex turns out to be really just a part (although pleasurable part) of what makes the earth spin, a part of being a man, and in many cases, overrated. Welcome to the real world, men. American Pie was marketed as one of a multitude of modern "coming of age" teen films, yet was vastly different from the genre. Although the film remains true to form with sight-gags and gross-out sexual comedy, it veers off the formulaic path by a plot that develops relationships between individuals that are actually endearing to watch. If you are willing to sit back, relax and enjoy the ride, the nostalgia trip is well worth it. All faint-hearted need not apply.</fullReview>

I cant believe it only has a rating of 6.9! it should be well up there in the top 250!I personally rate this film as a perfect 10! It starts with a superb original opening scene were jim (jason Biggs) is caught "spanking the one eyed monkey"! This is hilarious and jims dad (Eugene Levy)only adds to the greatness of this scene. The story is set out by kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas)at Steve Stiflers (Sean William Scott) party. they all decide that their going to loose their virginity by their prom night. Theyre all soon paired off and prom night approaches after many more genius scenes including the "pie" and "father son chat" scenes. However things dont go according to plan but all seems to work itself out for themselves and they are soon toasting "to the next step" (American Pie 2)!This film is good for originality. It manages to include many different scenes that are excellent with huge comedy laughs and yet still manages to grab hold of its audience by having a good storyline that despite the laughs are believable. Even after watching this movie at least 20 times it is still just as funny and even possibly moving.</fullReview>

I mean, this IS the only movie where you get to see a guy arouse himself with a warm apple pie. Or another guy drink sperm-tainted beer. I fell out of my seat laughing in "the bedroom scene". It's a well done movie and one I have seen several times already. This is the teen sex comedy that actually is good. My advice. See it, don't regret it, and laugh at the stupid parts.

		<fullReview>This is the best comedy ever! Kevin, Ostreicher, Finch and Jim make a pact to lose their virginity on prom night. All does not go to plan at the start and their obnoxious but laugh out loud hilarious friend Stifler keeps making fun of and maybe hampering them. Jim is more intelligent than he is given credit for and he gets less luck than most fans would think he deserves, Finch is the eccentric one who thinks he is the most intelligent, Ostreicher is a jock but feminine and Kevin is the deadly serious friend of the group. There are so many funny parts in this film you have to go and see it. Great combination of sex and comedy. What sets this apart that it is a "nicer" comedy and if you see the film you will know what I mean. 9 out of 10. I would have give it a 10 only they deleted the best scene of the film with Stifler's wee brother coming out of the closet and Jim and Michelle are lying on the bed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>American Pie is an absolute hilarious film. chris Klein, Jason Biggs, Eddie kaye Thomas, and Thomas Ian Nicholas all make a pact to lose their virginity before graduation. This is a very creative plot. I have to say that the best scene is Nadia's "changing session" and more. It made me very VERY happy. All of the jokes are mainly sexually crude but very funny. The only odd thing about this is why nobody in a sexual situation ever locks the door for a little privacy. Tara Reid and Thomas Ian Nicholas never locked there door when they decided to cramp his tongue. Shannon Elizabeth didn't lock her door when getting dressed. Eddie Kaye Thomas and a mystery character didn't lock their door.Overall I loved this movie and I was surprised at the outcome of this. Rating 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Your basic teen sexploitation flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I basically agree with the previous commenter Dave, in that this movie comes across as an obvious teen sexploitation flick. Yes, agreed, it's gross, lame, juvenile, sensationalistic, vulgar, vapid, and... oh, never mind, you get my drift.But I do part company with the previous commenter in one respect, and that is that I don't believe any of this silly mish-mash as being "true", not for one minute. This movie, to my eye anyway, simply does NOT depict real true-to-life teenagers with their real problems (other than that most relevant one - getting laid before graduation) and real anxieties and insecurities. I thought most of the teens in this film seemed unrealistically sophisticated, and my "suspension of disbelief" suffered a fatal blow right from the opening. Hey, where were the pimples? (It's also supposed to be set in Michigan, but is obviously filmed in sunny Southern California, thus adding to more of the feeling of fakiness that I got from this movie. Geez, is it really so hard to get a cast and crew up to Michigan these days??).Be that as it may, it is an okay film as a parody of teen life, and even has some poignant moments in it. Just don't take it too seriously, and be prepared to be grossed out more than a few times (and for God's sake don't let your teenage son or daughter see it!!!:)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, as an avid Kevin Smith fan, and after reading some of the reviews on this tasteless, and relentlessly retarded movie; let me just say to those who compared this movie to the likes of "Clerks" are right and wrong. At least "Clerks" had a good point to it, and at least the grossest of the gross was off screen. And lets face it, theres no way in hell this movie can compare in terms of the script and the writing capabilities of Kevin Smith.The unfortunate thing about this movie is that it's true: High school students today are shallow, vacuous, and pretentious and only care about their own social lives. They may seem to care about issues and events that really do effect lives, but it's all a cover to appear much more intelligent than they really are.Even more unfortunate is the movie itself. I hate teen exploition movies. All it does is take the fears and thoughts of teens on dating, and turn into unfunny mindless jokes for cash and cheap laughs. Of course, the people who buy into these kinds of movies laugh at jokes like "Pen 15". I'll leave it up to you what your going to rent, but at all costs avoid this drek.</fullReview>

The film is upright hilarious and drop dead funny. I haven't seen the sequel yet, but I'm sure it's just as funny. Als, Jennifer Coolidge did a funny performance as Stifler's Mom. By the way, take my advice, because some people say that "Scary Movie" was better, but it is DEFINETLEY not.

It's great to see a "teen movie" thats so true to life. Most of the teen movies out there are sugar coated or they only relate to a minor aspect of teenage life. This movie came out after my senior year, and I saw it with a bunch of my friends from high school. Everything that happens reflects the way that guys and girls think. Besides being true to life, this movie is hilarious...everyone should see it. Forget about the rating, it is actually most suited for high school and college aged.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I guess it is funnier if you're American...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By "American", of course, I mean your attitude towards sex and sexuality is more tightly wound up than that of Fred Nile or Pat Robertson. It would be much easier to relate to this film under those circumstances than say, if you and your girlfriend were having threesomes with her best friend once a month by the time you were seventeen. It's a little harder to sympathise with the characters of this film if you happen to fit that profile.The saving grace of the film, of course, is the characters. In spite of them being pulled from something Pat Robertson might have read as a boy, they are genuinely sympathetic and easy to relate to. The dialogue during the prom lifts this film out from under the weight of gutter humour and gives it some kind of moral. There was definitely a sense of closure to the end of the film, rather than the usual disbelief that marred the sex comedies of the eighties. I guess this comes from the fact that the characters seemed to have genuinely matured and changed as a result of their experiences, rather than remained idiots.All in all, a genuinely enjoyable film with well-written, genuinely likeable characters who, in spite for their Americanisation, have shades in them that everyone can recognise. Now all we need is a film that combines the premise of this film with a more Fight Club sort of mentality. Maybe I should get around to writing that autobiography...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing the promos targeting the lowest common denominator ("just like warm apple pie" - gee I wonder what happens), I decided to avoid this movie like the plague. I figured you had to be under 17 in order to stomach the movie. I finally rented it because I was bored the other week and felt like watching some cheesy movies. I was expecting it to be this generation's "Porky's", and I was pleasantly surprised.I can't remember the last time I laughed so hard at a movie. All the lines and attempts the guys use to pick up girls are so cheesy, but you can see how a high school guy could actually try to use some of the lines/methods (... I said *some*). You don't have to be in high school to enjoy this movie (although it wouldn't hurt). You also shouldn't be expecting anything too deep. This is just a comedy about some high school guys trying to get lucky. If you liked "Ferris Beuller's Day Off", you'll like this. Although it's a better movie since it doesn't have all the situations that would never happen like F.B.D.O. does.The movies I watched in high school were all basically just made to show tits. This actually relies on humor instead of nudity (although there is some nudity). If you're looking for a good comedy, and not offended but the the subject of sex, watch this one. 10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just watched *American Pie*, the much-talked about blockbuster hit of the summer of '99, the year that many, many far superior movies came out.The Matrix. eXistenZ. Run Lola Run. The Blair Witch Project. Three Kings. American Beauty. Go. And those are just some of the ones I've *seen*.Highlights of *American Pie* include the presence of Alyson Hannigan, Natasha Lyonne, and Tara Reid having an orgasm. And scattered amusing scenes, and a couple good lines.But it's really not that funny, unless you find it funny. Sex can be funny, yes. *Sex and the City*, *Election*, and countless others have proved that sex can be done very humorously to affect me. I'm not going to try to analyze what they do, but I do know what *American Pie* does: It assumes that anything involving sex is inherently funny. A guy screwing an apple pie? Okay, kind of amusing, but the scene's a huge letdown since you basically see everything you could possibly see in the trailer. It's like the *Scary Movie* philosophy: People having sex is funny.And then there's the scene where the stereotypical jerk spikes the oddball's mochaccino with laxatives. Okay, now how many freaking times have I seen someone's drink spiked with laxatives for comic effect? I think I've lost count. It may have been a bit funny the first time, but it's not now, and we definitely don't need to see anyone on a toilet with repulsive sound effects. Is this the best Adam Herz could do? Perhaps my idea of clever is different from everyone else's.So *American Pie* didn't suck, per se. It had its moments, and I laughed more at it than I laughed at *Big Momma's House* (I think that made me laugh...twice), although I'm sure the filmmakers thought I would laugh more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(spoilers) American Pie is yet another goofy teenage comedy full of trashy sex jokes and idiot kids trying to get together with beautiful girls, and in the end, it works for everyone except that weird red-headed guy. I'm so sick and tired of movies like this, and if Sean William Scott had not been in this movie, there would not have been a single funny part in it. American Pie is an exploitative film that takes advantage of the vast amounts of immaturity readily found in modern audiences.I'll admit that I laughed at the movie, but it's the kind of laugh that lasts for seconds, and as soon as it's over, it's never funny again. You actually feel cheated because after you watch the movie you can look back and you realize how dumb the jokes really are. Except, of course, for the scene at the very end when Steve Stifler walks into the basement of his house after the party (`Mom? Shi*brick?!'). THAT will NEVER stop being funny.I don't want to give the impression that I feel that this movie was pounded out in five minutes with no thought and then thrown into production just to make money, because I realize that on some levels, maybe one or two, it is quality comedy. But on all other levels, make no mistake, this is fast-food cinema. It may be fun to watch, but there's no nutritional value.</fullReview>

It combines wretched humor, a contemptuous plot, and superficial characters without common sense. What's the point? American Pie is a rather embarrassing affair with its pathetic humor and minimum 'comedic' tone. I find it hard to believe its huge boxoffice success. The movie, however, had one bright gleam; Eugene Levy and Jason Biggs as father and son, whose performances were delightful.My conclusion is, after having suffered through the full duration, don't EVER waste your precious time on this film.

The school is clean and well-kept. Also, among the hundred or so students we see, a while two of them are minorities.This is a wierd film, when you think about it: a strange mix of There's Something about Mary, Animal House, and Stand by Me that just doesn't sit right, somehow. The whole story (if you can call it that) is pathetically obvious. If they let everything be about sex, that's one thing - but there's some abstract issues here the film wants to play in but doesn't really try to understand. Lip service is paid to "love", but everything makes more sense when the characters just want to get laid.The movie isn't all bad - there's some funny scenes as the main character (Jason Biggs) and his dad (former CTV star Eugene Levy) try to broach the subject of sex in a fatherly manner, but there isn't much else.</fullReview>

This film has many teen stars that will probably make it as good actors (New Jersey native Jason Biggs is in 2000's Loser already). Also, this film is the best for teenagers looking for a laugh after Austin Powers 2. The story is simple, but the scenes are expanded. The plot involves 4 seniors who want to lose their virginity by the end of the school year. What ensues is a journey that makes Dumb and Dumber look like The Winslow Boy. Pastry sex, lacetive dumps, premature ejaculation, the sex books and Eugene Levy provide the best parts of the film, and the romance provides the parts when we can pause from laughing. Because this film is one of the best comedies and films of the decade. A+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm almost 29 and will confess to being a massive fan of Bachelor Party and Animal House. Unfortunately these popular films, I believe, never got the credit they deserved because they were immediately associated with hundreds of other childish soft-sex clones. Obviously John Hughes came along upgrading the teen theme with some excellent comedy-dramas (Weird Science, Ferris, etc).There'd been a bit of gap in-between then and know and I was sceptical that this film could add anything new. Oh what the hell, I'll give this American Pie a go.About 4 teens trying to get laid and the hilarious antics they get up it to, culminating into some kind of growing up by the end, it was surprisingly funny, actually really funny. It was a nice way that an old idea was brought up-to-date using the tools of the nineties. The film didn't resort to just shock and stupidity it actually had some charm and whit about it.I'm sure this won't appeal to everyone, but even though I'm not a teenager I found this very funny and highly enjoyable. Probably the best comedy I've seen for a long time.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a great movie for people of all ages</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you think this movie is one that is only intended for the "hip" teen audience...think. This movie offers some great laughs and good acting. The cast is basically made up of unknown teen actors (except for Natasha Lyonne and the girl who plays Willow on Buffy). There are many great one-liners and it's packed full of hysterical situations. From reviews that I have seen of this movie, a lot of people are comparing it to Fast Times at Ridgemont High. I would say it's more like a Something about Mary about the teen dating scene rather than about thirtysomethings. Anyone who appreciates good comedy and gutter humor should definitely see this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Very Funny!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best comedy films I have ever seen. The first one beats all the other American Pie movies. The jokes are incredible. I was laughing so much, I thought that I would puke or I would suffer a heart attack from all my laughing. The acting was great. In my opinion, I thought that Jason Biggs and Thomas Ian Nicholas were the best. Jennifer Coolidge had great cameos as Stifler's Mom. The girls were very hot and they got my attention. The script is excellent, the music was just right, and this is a valuable piece for a large movie collection such as mine. I highly recommend this for people between the age of 15-40. Most adults after the age of 40 will think that this movie is horrible and won't be able to understand most jokes. I give this a definite 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THIS FILM changed my life!!!!! I come home everyday and throw on American pie and it never fails to make me feel great. In terms of film-making there is nothing to fault, fantastic acting, a hilarious script and inspired direction all add up to the greatest film ever brought down to earth from heaven. It truly is god's gift to serious movie-goers, such as myself, finally a film that does not talk down to individuals. I seriously think this film should be shown on a large screen in any country with social or political unrest and the light hearted comedy would really sort everyone out. I'm watching American pie on my telly as I write this thanking god that I have the absolute pleasure to be alive at the same time as such a masterpiece of film-making. It truly deserved its thirteen Oscar nominations as well as its prestigious "film of the millennium" awarded by the UN. Go watch it now and feel yourself grow as a person!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well Amercian Pie will probably be remembered as the best teen movie of the 90's. This movie introduced the world to Jason Biggs (Jim), Shannon Elizabeth (Nadia, the foreign exchange student), Sean William Scott (Stifler), and Eugene Levy (Jim's Dad). Eugene Levy is the dad that every son wished he had. Eugene steals every scene he is in and is just so lovable. Jim(Biggs) is like just about every teenage boy, he just wants to get laid, but some of the things he does are unlike every teenage boy, I won't spoil it for those of you that haven't seen it but it's extreme. Stiffler is the instigator of everything and as guys know there's one Stifler in every group of friends. Nadia is the hot foreign exchange student who Jim wants and she is willing to let Jim have her..but is Jim up to the task? At one point they are in a situation, that every teenage boy has imagined himself being in, in Jim's room.This movie is hilarious and goes to extremes for laughs. John Cho also makes himself known in this film as one of the MILF guys. American Pie is one of the greatest teen comedies ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>American Pie (and the whole trend of high-school comedies it started) can be described best Farrelly bros. comedy for adolescents. A constant barrage of vulgarity and cheap sex-jokes without an actual story to tell. American Pie introduces four desperately horny young men who make a pact. Before their graduation, they have to lose their virginity no matter what! To obtain this goal they're willing to go through all possible forms of public humiliations and mockery. Throughout the whole film, it is exclusively the male teenager who's portrayed as a filthy-minded creature. The girls in American Pie are sensitive, intelligent and generally considered to be the superior species, which is a pretty fresh and satisfying point of view. The films contains a few sequences that are notorious already?such as the `bakery-masturbation'-scene and ? oh yes ? the magnificent striptease by the gorgeous Shannon Elizabeth?American Pie is lamebrain entertainment in its purest form. The acting is overall good, with some new fresh faces as well as some veteran actors (Eugene Levy steals the show as Jim's dad). The jokes work, the screenplay contains some fun, memorable quotes (`It's not a space shuttle launch, it's SEX') and the creators DO know their classics! Just look at the terrific reference to `The Graduate' near the end of the film. You can easily skip both sequels though?more from the same, only worse. American Pie became a huge success and one of the biggest box office hits of the late nineties; while modest, intelligent little films from that same period are being catapulted straight into Oblivion. Cinema may not always be fair, but American Pie sure is fun!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Characters can make or break a movie, and this goes especially for "American Pie," a rude, crude, and downright raunchy film that would probably be considered one of the worst of the decade if not for the film's obvious love of its characters and their shortcomings and exploits. Some of the best of all comedies are so simply because they treat their characters with such loving affection - from works of comedy such as "Planes, Trains and Automobiles" to more dark and brooding comedies like "Fargo." Without love of characters there is a lack of respect, a film goes nowhere and an audience senses both and disregards it. A film like "American Pie" may not be the best of all films but I laughed, not so much at the gags but rather because the characters taking part in the gags seemed pretty darn infectious and sweet. Beneath the crudeness there's a heart - you just may have to dig through some waste to get there. The film lacks the honesty and realism of teenagers that made John Hughes' 80s films so appealing to audiences - this is more or less a routine sex-and-prom teen comedy - but, like I said, the characters make up for this. It's about four graduating teenagers - Jim (Jason Biggs), Oz (Chris Klein), Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) and Stifler (Seann William Scott) - who make a pact to have sex by prom night. Bring the whole family to this one - you'll have a ball! A pretty immature and borderline basic plot we have that is put to pretty good use through some crazy - though immature - antics. The title of the film is more than just a figure of speech. There's a scene where a foreign exchange student named Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth, not to be confused with Elizabeth Shannon of "Saturday Night Live") undresses in the Biggs character's room and *everything* is broadcasted across the Internet. I can't divulge into anything else because I'm writing for family websites. But let me say that if you think "Austin Powers" had a mouthful of innuendos, "American Pie" has that plus some. (It's sad to think that they had to guarantee an R-rating by inserting nudity and constant language - is the MPAA so ignorant that without nudity a film crammed with sexual innuendo like this would be PG-13?) We also get to learn the meaning of the word, "MILF." I really can't say very much about this movie, or even go into its plot any further. All I can say is that I laughed. I liked the characters. I liked the innocence of blunders; that the characters often do things and humiliate themselves but not on purpose like in some comedies. But what holds me back from giving this a great rating is that the content is a bit too strong even for those 17, which the MPAA finds a suitable age to view this (it makes promiscuity seem all the more nerdy; the characters never consider the after effects of their night of passion). It is a very typical and cliched teen sex comedy, in a way, which holds back my rating a bit. It is a pretty funny film, no doubt, but the basis and outcome are both very typical. It makes one laugh while at the same time wishing Ferris Bueller - an intelligent, resourceful, sneaky teenager whose mind was not cliched and always focused on sex - would return. Where's John Hughes when you need him? 3.5/5 stars -</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh Wow, was this bad!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was so hyped to see this film and when it was over I was completely in shock about how mindless this film was. I can see why younger audiences might like this film because there's really nothing to compare it to. As for the 24+ crowd, we've seen this before during the early and mid 80's. I hate to say this, but AMERICAN PIE makes PORKY'S seem like an AFI top 100 film. At least with the latter, there was more plot to it than just trying to get laid before a certain time period. I've seen a more developed plot in a haiku than AMERICAN PIE. And as for the humor, every joke you could see coming from a mile away. It seemed that filmmakers went to great lengths to set up every one of the jokes, even if that meant compromising the story, or lack of, with contrived elements to make the joke work. Wait ten years and watch this movie again and I'm sure you will have a much different spin on it.And for those of you who are comparing this to THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY... please don't! TSAM is such a better film because the humor seems very spontaneous, and the film is made by people who understand how to get a legitimate laugh. Timing, originality, and the element of surprise are the keys to making a funny movie. If you know the punchline before the joke is over, how is this funny?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is sexy and provocative, especially for Shannon Elizabeth getting on to Jason Biggs. Although sexuality and nudity are okay, but I do not think foul language is a good idea because what I saw the South Park movie is that those South Park kids should not see this foul language Terrence and Phillip movie. The reason I assure you that foul language is wrongfully uncalled which is my suggestion not to have that in other American Pie movies. Parents should not use foul language on their kids because it is wrongfully uncalled. I think foul language should be forbidden in future American Pie movies because as what Sheila Blofowsky would say "Because it is evil!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not sure why I rated this movie a 9 instead of 10 as it had me laughing from the opening moment to the last scene. The characters are perfectly cast, each with separate, distinct personalities reminiscent of some stereotype we all knew in High School. This film was written with a sensitive understanding what it is like to be in your later adolescent years and still exploring sex for the first moments. Clever, original, laugh out loud funny to a point you hate to see this great comedy end. Comedies are the most difficult of genre to do really well, but this one hits the mark.

		<fullReview>I saw American Pie when it first came out in the theater in 1999, and then, hadn't seen it again until very recently. Comcast Cable put the movie on Demand during this month, and I have watched it a couple of times, and fell in love with it all over again. As one watches the film, they can just sense what these characters are going through, preparing to leave high school, and venture out into the real world, and going away from each other. The movie is so much more than just about perverted guys trying to get sex, it is about relationships, timing, and a passage of life. I rank American Pie as one of my all time favorite movies, and, I feel, a must see, especially for ages 18 to 40.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Love This Film !!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here Are Some Facts...American Pie is a 1999 teen comedy film directed by Paul Weitz and Chris Weitz and written by Adam Herz. This was the first film directed by the Weitz brothers. The movie is centred on four boys who make a pact to lose their virginity by their high school graduation, and their subsequent adventures. The title refers to a scene in the film in which the lead character is caught having sex with a pie?earlier he was told that "third base" feels "like warm apple pie". It was a box-office hit and spawned two direct sequels: American Pie 2 in 2001, American Wedding in 2003. Singer Don McLean was credited for allowing the name of his hit song to be used as the title.This film ranked number 49 on Bravo's "100 Funniest Movies", and ranked number 32 on Entertainment Weekly's list of the 50 Best High School Movies. In 2000, readers of Total Film magazine voted American Pie the 6th greatest comedy film of all time.Since the conclusion of the American Pie trilogy, featuring the courtship and marriage of Jim Levenstein and Michelle Flaherty, the American Pie name has gone on to be used as an entity similar to National Lampoon. The American Pie entity has spawned three spin-off films: American Pie Presents: Band Camp, which was a direct to video release in 2005, and American Pie Presents: The Naked Mile was released on DVD in December 2006. The next film, American Pie Presents: Beta House will be released in 2007.</fullReview>

OK in some bits it is crude but this is aimed at a teen audience so teens do not really care if something is crude because it is normal in their lives. The characters and actors are alike in ways and the directors really worked hard with them to get the audience a real experience of teen life.Basically you have gotta group of teens who all want to get laid on prom night. You basically watch them make these plans and watch as they all go wrong. Sit back and enjoy but really they should have stopped after American pie 3.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poop- and sex humor doesn't get any better than this!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Out of all the teenage comedies we were bombarded with the last couple of years, this one is by far the best. The comedy is cruel and perhaps predictable but the execution of it is perfect, thanks to the actors and the characters they portray and some excellent spot-on timing.Really what makes "American Pie" superior to other teenage comedies are the characters. There are lots of characters in the movie and all are well constructed, crazy in their own way and simply fun to watch. On top of that their dialog is very good and highly realistic and believable. Although I normally hate it when some teenagers are being played by some twenty year old, I had in this case no problems with it, simply because all of the actors fitted their roles like a glove. I especially liked Jason Biggs and Seann William Scott. But best role of the movie was played by Eugene Levy as Jim's dad. Quite honestly one of the best and most hilarious movie dads ever created!Most of the jokes and dialog are cruel and is mostly about only sex and poop but it works surprisingly hilarious, with as a result some hilarious classic comedy moments. Of course the apple pie sequences has already become a bit of a classic but I even liked the whole web-cam strip sequences with Jason Biggs and Shannon Elizabeth even better. Yes, I even liked the poop humor with Eddie Kaye Thomas as Finch in the movie. There are truly some hilarious sequences in the movie that are perhaps at first sight a bit lame and predictable but all perfectly timed and performed by the actors. Poop- and sex humor just doesn't get any better than this! Plus it also has a good morale in it that works out in the ending without ever getting lame or too over-the-top.A teenage comedy classic, that works in almost every way!9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

One thing I hated most was the nudity, especially when Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth) was pleasuring herself on Jim's (Jason Biggs) bed. The reason I found this was because she had no top on. In my opinion, this movie had very funny humor, even though it was vulgar at times. Another raunchy part was when Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) was in the toilet. The thing I liked most was the prom. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, "If I ever have kids of my own, I'm not going to let them see this movie until they're grown up."

The actors give the story life- particularly Jason Biggs, who plays the lead of Jim. He makes nerdish &amp; nervous teen guys seem pretty nice :)Sean William Scott showed his comedic worth in this movie...he steals the screen with his portrayal of Stifler.Definitely has some gross moments- who could forget that 'toilet' scene?Good value for money.

		<shortDescription>Probably the best of the teen comedies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is pretty much the film that started the whole trend of making teen comedies with a lot of sexual jokes and gags, and definitely one of the best. Any teen will be able to identify with the situations and the characters, at the very least to some degree. The plot is very good, and it moves along at a pretty good pace; sort of laid-back, not too quick but not slow either. The characters are all well-written, very real and even though some of them are cliches or stereotypes, you can identify with them and understand their actions in the different situations. The actors all perform well, I didn't really think any of them did a bad job portraying their respective characters. I think the script was very well-written, it allowed for some extremely funny scenes(of course, there were also some right-out disgusting scenes, this is an R-rated teen comedy after all), and most of them were pretty true to life too. The humor was very good, and had an excellent pace and timing. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys teen comedies, and aren't easily offended. Especially teens will like it, and identify with a lot of it. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Author's Note: I saw this movie at the behest of a friend who thinks I haven't seen anything good. "Cameron Frye, this one's for you!"While comedies are not my forte (I do not believe in the purpose of devoting a whole movie to that purpose), this movie only solidifies my hate of the modern Hollywood machine. I'm certain if John Hughes ever watched this he'd be thinking, "You know, I was competing against the same crap 20 years ago."American Pie's biggest blunder is that it relies too much on insulting the intelligence of the audience in exchange for breaking ground. This is what made such movies as Fast Times at Ridgemont High and Breakfast Club superior. What makes such things as Monty Python and Dr. Strangelove so ENORMOUSLY superior is that they don't think the audience is stupid enough to walk into their movie to begin with.The ultimate victim is the so-called "heroes" themselves because they are cardboard prop-ups of the typical American high school teenage. What are they thinking about besides sex? Not only is this unrealistic, but it insults every other stereotype throw into the mix. I am certain that if MTV executives got ahold of this movie they wouldn't change anything about it.Overall, there you have it folks. An insulting, degrading, and outrageously stupid movie. With so many better flicks out there (try CLERKS instead) it is a wonder why you should waste your time with this. Stick with Fast Times instead. 0 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A True Classic!! Original and very, very funny!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I nearly p**sed myself every time I watch this movie. I think that the cast is flawless! I guess most people either love or hate this movie. The movie's crap to people who can't stand the raunchiness, and great for people who enjoy it. At any rate, this movie will definitely go down in history. What a funny comedy! 5/5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There is a lot more purpose to this movie than some people think</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"American Pie" doesn't sound like much because of its simple premise: four guys(Jason Biggs, Chris Klein, Thomas Ian Nicholas, and Eddie Kaye Thomas) enter into a pact to lose their virginity by prom night. Now it's only natural that this movie would be immediately dismissed as another dumb sex comedy, but I believe that "American Pie" is much more than that. Now I'm no expert, but I believe that there is a lot of hidden subtext here. One of the scenes that I want to focus on, is the scene where Jim(Biggs) and Nadia(Shannon Elizabeth) are in his bedroom. Now since Jim had walked in Nadia, she probably felt embarrassed and wanted to see the opposite effect on him. When it's finally time to get down to "business", Jim by this time is so nervous that he n**s his boxers. Nadia is then about ready to leave. Jim desperate and realizing that this may be the only chance he has with Nadia, starts to bring out the porn. Nadia forgives him and they start to go at it again but then Jim blows his second chance. I believe that this is probably the most important scene in this whole movie. I say this because I think it was meant to show how nervous some people may get about first-time sex. Now just because Jim had blown his big chance with Nadia, does not mean that she will think any lesser of him. I mean after all, it was their first time doing anything together. Now another part, which is the case of Sherman(Chris Owen) a.k.a. "The Sherminator". Sherman is so sure of himself, that many people including our four heroes, think that he can score with any girl he meets. This is wrong and this ultimately leads to his timely humiliation at the prom. Strangely enough, his whole "Sherminator" act is only able to successfully attract the attention of one lucky lady(try to guess who). Third is the case with Stifler(Seann William Scott). Now I'm sure we've all known of at least one Stifler in our lives. My definition of someone who is a "Stifler", is a person who only lives to party, have sex, and makes fun of those who can't; Stifler-"see you guys in the 'NO F*****G' section". What girls see in him or how he's even able to get girls is beyond me. Fourth is the rapidly evolving dating relationship with Kevin(Nicholas) and his girlfriend, Vicky(Tara Reid). We know that these two have been going out for quite some time. Kevin is quite anxious to move to another base. As he says, "enough of this b-job bulls**t". Vicky, feeling unappreciated that she probably can't please her boyfriend enough, dumps him. Kevin then has to resort to "Kama Sutra: The Book of Love". He begins reading the stuff in the book is eventually able to win back Vicky. Fifth, how many of you have ever tried to change the way you act just to win a girl's heart? I'm sure some of you have and Oz(Klein) is doing just that. After the fiasco with Oz's first date, he begins to see things in a different light. "You can't try to win a girl over by repeating cheese-ball lines" says his date. Oz then takes this into account and after entering into the pact, he spots a young choir girl(Mena Suvari). So Oz signs up for chorus just to win her heart. At first he's just doing to get to her but then true love comes into play he finds himself vying for her affections. He is eventually able to win her over but not by his physique or duty to the pact, but by his determination to find true love. Sixth, is the minor situation with Jim and Michelle, the band geek(played by Alyson Hannigan). Michelle- "this one time at band camp..." you know the rest. This relationship here is probably one of the higher aspects of "American Pie" because it goes to show you that you can't just put a label on anybody no matter how weird they appear to be. Sure Jim ends up regretting his decision to sleep with her, but in the end, he'll really thank her for it and he will be glad he did. Lastly, dear old Finch(Thomas). Isn't it strange the things that we do out of desperation? Now are you beginning to see what I've been getting at? This movie is showing us how our sex lives have or may turn out to be like. Not all of our encounters will turn out to be total disasters and we won't end up doing it with baked goods(hopefully). Some of us may turn out to be a "Sherman" or a "Stifler" or maybe some us won't turn out to be anything at all. Some of us may have to change our personalities completely to just to win a girl's affections. Some of us may end up having to resort to extreme measures to get what we want.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Raunchy, silly, poor excuse of a movie, but entertaining in spots.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "American Pie" in July '99 when it first came to the theater, something I rarely do anymore with DVD and "home theater" at my disposal. Anyway, I remember clearly, when the lights went on at the end a young lady looked around and told her boyfriend, "Look at all the old people in here." I was one of "the old people." This week my wife and I saw the highly mutilated version, sanitized for TV, and it is only a shadow of the real film.Simple plot - 4 friends make a pact to lose their virginity before graduation from high school. That thin thread motivates all the situations that follow. The movie is bad because it depicts "SEX" as a somewhat frivolous activity that all boys, and many girls, spend much of their free time thinking about. That's my real gripe about films like this, it cheapens relationships and gives already confused teenagers and young adults more motivation for immoral behavior.Still, there are a few genuinely funny scenes. My favorite is the extra-powerful laxative that results in the kid going quickly, but into the girls' restroom. The internet video of "Nadia" changing and getting sexy in the boy's room. The "sex talks" between son and father. The "contaminated" beer on the nightstand. Mom and dad coming into his room while we was getting off on watching scrambled porn on TV. There are a few sweet moments at the end, however the film overall has a very flawed message and in a generous mood I rate it "4" of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A future classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In twenty years, this movie will rank as a classic of cinema. Just like "Fast Times at Ridgemont High" &amp; "Sixteen Candles", the movie is ageless &amp; timeless. Its my favorite movie of the year by miles - saw it with my Mother, who is crowding 60, and we were still laughing in the lobby on the way out of the theatre. An extremely entertaining movie that you'll love, if you'll allow yourself to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a laugh.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American Pie is one of those films that you can watch from start to finish, without feeling bored or wanting to fast forward it. From the start of the film where you see the main character bumbling dork Jim, try hopelessly to get the girl he likes to notice him, to the finish in which Finch gets the girl nobody in there right mind would expect, the whole film is one gigantic chuckle-fest.Laugh it up as you follow the four guys, Jim, Kevin, Finch and Oz, and feel pity and amusement as they make a pack to loose there virginity before prom.One of the highlights of this film is the hysterical Stifler. Most of his sentences include swearing, and he thinks hes god gift. But not everything turns out the way he plans. And thats all I'm saying about him ;) Anyway if you like rude jokes, stupid situations and teenage comedies as a whole, then check this film out! The king of all teen comedies, with a marvellous second and third film as well! ****/*****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well, I finally watched five minutes of this movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, a definition to start things out. Cliché, yes, but let's do it anyway.Courtesy of Webster:TRASH things that are no longer useful or wanted and that have been thrown away: a container where people put things that are being thrown away: something that is very low in quality Full Definition of TRASH 1 : something worth little or nothing: as a : junk, rubbish b (1) : empty talk : nonsense (2) : inferior or worthless writing or artistic matter (as a television show); especially : such matter intended purely for sensational entertainment (3) : trash talk 2 : something in a crumbled or broken condition or mass; especially : debris from pruning or processing plant material 3 : a worthless person; also : such persons as a group : riffraff I watch this forced, horrible movie during some pointless sex scene where everyone is watching via a webcam. Yes, they existed apparently in '99.I did this because I always feared my mind and heart would be corrupted if I saw Eli Mathenial - the sweet kid from The Iron Giant - is something that is, well, probably not as raunchy as it would be today.I finally worked up the courage and tried to find him among the endless dreck of teenage actors. Dreck is also trash, btw and I was a little younger then him when this movie came out, so I'm not looking for him for THAT, people. Well, I spotted the young lad... dancing around in imitation of some nerd trying to get horny via a webcam his older brother is letting him watch.I'm aware he's a kid, but he's smarter then this. More talented. Have you ever seen the Iron Giant? Don't get me started on the headache that is Fast and Furious 1 thru 87 or the mess of Riddrick or whatever the h... it's called.I should have looked at this movie years ago.Eli, you son of a bitch. Don't tell me you were just a kid. BS.Something as pure, innocent and true as the Iron Giant should be upheld as the wonderful, heartbreaking, core-rocking masterpiece that it is.I have a sense of humor and it's not always a nice one. So I'm not a prude. I don't care if this movie has heart, who let's their ELEVEN-YEAR-OLD brother watch porn?I'm so glad Eli never made more movies - do not look up his others, dear God - he could have been totally ruined.I have no patience when it comes to harming something or someone so dear to my heart.Go burn your copies of American Whores and buy a copy of the Iron Giant instead. Make THAT a remembered, treasured and beloved movie instead.For anyone affiliated with this movie... BURN IN HADES, CRETINS.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typical Teen Film That Feels Like the 1980s All Over Again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1980s ran rampant with two types of genres: the slasher flick and the teen flick. Of course both genres are just plain awful with very few exceptions across the board. "American Pie" feels like 1984 all over again. This is a mildly amusing film that is fueled by sexual tension and ignorance as four young men (Jason Biggs, Chris Klein, Eddie Kaye Thomas, and Thomas Ian Nicholas) vow to lose their virginity before graduating high school. The target date: prom night (big surprise). What follows are gross-out jokes aplenty with silly situations and crazy outcomes abound. While "American Pie" is not a very good film, it does try to send messages about youth, sex, and love, but ultimately falls flat on its face. This film also launched the careers of many of its performers (Mena Suvari, Shannon Elizabeth, Seann William Scott, Natasha Lyonne, Tara Reid, and Alyson Hannigan), but as with this film their credits are unimpressive to say the least. Eugene Levy is good as Biggs' clueless father, but the youths rule this film and that is not necessarily a good thing. 2.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A raunch rage of sappy humor...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>..."American Pie" is a ridiculous and vulgar High School coming-of-sexual-age comedy. A pathetic cinematic endeavor, this senseless string of vacuous gags and situations is not for the jaded or sophisticated and will play best in frat houses and college dorms or to audiences with a similarly unfettered sense of humor. The number of shelves the video occupies at Blockbuster is a reminder that "popular" is often synonymous with "mediocre".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>American Pie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before this film the successful teen movies were from John Hughes (Ferris Bueller's Day Off, The Breakfast Club), and then they got crude and gross in Porky's and National Lampoon's Animal House, this was a much needed return to the genre that combined all the elements into a modern box office hit, from director Paul Weitz (About a Boy). Basically in East Great Falls, Michigan, four high school friend, awkward and sexually naive Jim Levenstein (Jason Biggs), lacrosse team player and assumed jock Chris 'Oz' Ostreicher (Chris Klein), confident student Kevin Myers (Thomas Ian Nicholas) and sophisticate Paul Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) all share something in common, they are all virgins. At the party of swearing and sex-obsessed Steve 'Stifmeister' Stifler (Seann William Scott), geek Chuck 'The Sherminator' Sherman claims to have lost his virginity, so the four friends make a pact that they will lose their virginity (consensually) before they graduate high school, and the prom is the last opportunity to do it. Kevin tries to convince his sweet girlfriend Victoria 'Vicky' Lathum (Tara Reid) that they have been together long enough to take the next step, but she sometimes wonders if he is just with her for sex, and gets advice from knowledgeable Jessica (Natasha Lyonne). Oz joins the jazz singing choir to find a girlfriend, and he gets the attention of Heather (Mena Suvari), she does find out his reputation, but he wins her back, especially when he leaves an important lacrosse game for a choir competition, and specifically for her. Jim gets embarrassing advice from his Dad (Eugene Levy), masturbates a apple pie (he was told third base was like "warm apple pie"), and he attempts to get with Czechoslovakian foreign exchange student Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth), and he puts his attempt on web cam for the whole school to see, as he prematurely ejaculates twice. Finch meanwhile does not seem to be making many attempts to find a girlfriend, he is found out to have paid Jessica to spread rumours about his sexual reputation and get a date for the prom, but Stifler has revenge putting laxative in his drink, leading him into the girls' bathroom, and come out humiliated and dateless. At the prom Kevin and Oz have their dates, Jim was forced to ask flute playing band geek Michelle Flaherty (Alyson Hannigan) as his date - she also apparently hadn't seen the internet video, and Finch is alone, the pact may be dwindling, until they overhear that Sherman lied about losing his virginity, taking pressure off the boys. It is at Stifler's post-party can fulfil their pledge, Kevin and Vicky in the upstairs bedroom, who afterwards break up because of college differences; Oz and Heather in the dock house, after he confessed the pact and realised his true feelings; Jim and Michelle in the young Stifler brother's bedroom, Michelle confessing she did see the video and is surprisingly aggressive; and Finch alone strays into the basement and meets Stifler's Mom (Jennifer Coolidge), she is attracted to him and they have sex on the pool table. Jim, Oz, Kevin and Finch have breakfast together the next morning and are all happy that they fulfilled the pact, and they toast to "the next step", and it ends with Jim dancing on web cam for Nadia, with Jim's Dad peaking and walking away dancing embarrassingly. Also starring Molly Cheek as Jim's Mom, Lawrence Pressman as Coach Marshall, "AM To PM" singer Christina Milian as Band Member, Justin Isfeld as Justin - 'MILF' Guy #1, John Cho as John - 'MILF' Guy #2, Eli Marienthal as Matt Stifler and Casey Affleck as Tom Myers. The cast of young adults are all suited to their parts, Biggs as the likable fool, Klein as the jock wanting to change, Nicholas as the wannabe nice guy, Thomas as the slightly weird Corinthian, Scott as the obnoxious foul-mouthed womaniser, and Levy as the embarrassing father. The film is full of just right balance of stereotyping, and it invented and popularised the term MILF (Mum I'd Like to F***), the characters all have their own great qualities, the story is one you can easily follow, and the slapstick and dialogue jokes all work fantastically, it is certainly one of the best teen movies ever made, a must see comedy. It was number 10 on The 100 Greatest Sexy Moments for the Internet broadcast, and it was number 7 on The 50 Greatest Comedy Films. Very good!</fullReview>
