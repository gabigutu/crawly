		<shortDescription>One king hell of a movie for HST fans.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a huge Hunter S Thompson fan, but I was feeling very weary of this film since it has been shelved for almost a year now. I attended the world premiere last night, and I can report with absolute sincerity that if you loved HST's work, this will not disappoint.The one problem many die hard fans of the book may have is with the character of Sanderson. In the book Paul Kemp and Sanderson represent the dueling persona's of Hunter, one being a cutthroat athletic type, the other being the booze-hound anti-authoritarian. In this film, Johnny Depp plays more to the character being a young HST and combines the characteristics of both into Kemp. Some may have a problem with this, but the movie is stronger for it as you are only rooting for the protagonist while giving the story a strong antagonist, a necessity in filmmaking.In my eyes, this is Bruce Robinson's best work on screen to date, Johnny Depp is absolutely awe-inspiringly believable as a very young and constrained Hunter, and the cast could not have been more dead on. I'll be seeing this several more times in the theaters in the coming months.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Movie That Johnny Depp Intended It To Be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's important to remember why this movie was made. It is for Hunter S. Thompson. That was really Johnny Depp's main focus. His goal is never to make the number one movie. He doesn't want to be a box office star. He wants to make movies that mean something to him and that is exactly what he did with The Rum Diary.With that said, he made a beautiful film for his late friend. He played Hunter S. Thompson so wonderfully and stayed true to his character. Johnny honored his friend in the best way that he could, and did a phenomenal job in my opinion. Aside from the film's purpose, if I had gone to see this with no knowledge of it's back story, I still would have enjoyed it. It was funnier than I was expecting and there was romance throughout. I was definitely interested the entire two hours. It is worth the price of a ticket because as usual, Johnny Depp delivered.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I adored the novel, The Rum Diary and as an aid worker I related to many of the character's struggles. Although the film does stray quite a bit from the book itself, I think it's a perfect homage to Hunter S Thompson. The language still reeks of his Gonzo fury writing and manages to transport the audience into a drunken rant, as well as secretly educating them on the struggles of a free press. It had me laughing out loud on more than one occasion, as well as the packed out cinema that I viewed it with. I rated this movie a 9 and the last film I rated that high was The Shining. I personally think this film was perfect. The leading actress/actors were perfect and the supporting cast phenomenal, especially Giovanni Ribisi. The only problem with this film in my opinion is that if you are not a fan of the gibbering, artistically nervous tone of most of Thompson's work, this film may be too heavy for you. Although it's easier to follow that Fear and Loathing (which scrupulously stuck to the dialogue from the novel Fear and loathing), many would find the dialogue bizarre.Personally I loved every minute of this film and think it's already truly underrated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>bad representation of an amazing book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you have had the pleasure of reading the great book from Hunter S. Thompson, "The Rum Diary" this film is not for you. And even if you did not read the book, this film lacks drama, cinematic style, character arcs, a hooking intro, and satisfying end. I am not sure if the writer/director Bruce Robinson spent the time to really READ the book. It's a DARK comedy, not a lighthearted love story. Hunter S. Thompson (played by Johnny Depp) was very depressed at the time, getting wasting, working minimal amounts, and having sex with any Puerto Rican girl that was interested. None of this was portrayed accurately in the film. One key factor that Bruce Robinson screwed up was eliminating the character of Yemon, which was crucial in the book. Instead this Robinson combined three characters into two, which isn't true to the book and does not work on screen. Another factor missed was the bar Al's which played a big role in the book. This was the local bar in which all the works at the newspaper went to everyday and got wasted at. Besides the two lead characters in the film, all the workers were alcoholics and Robinson failed at exposing the working environment of the newspaper.The ending of the book was tremendous; the boss Lotterman has a heart attack and dies when he thinks one of the employees was going to beat him up. Instead of using this great ending handed to him, Bruce Robinson steered away from that and it fell flat at the end. All in all, when adapting a book like "The Rum Diary," you have to stay true to the heart (balls) of the story. Bruce Robinson missed the dark tone of the book, did not develop the characters and the environment to its fullest extent. On top of that did a terrible job of exposing the beautiful landscape of Puerto Rico, shooting everything much too tight not allowing the viewer to get a true feel of the surroundings and native people. Instead of wasting your ten bucks at the cinema sit down relax and read an amazing book by Hunter S. Thompson, "The Rum Diary."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lacks Coherency or Flair</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film begins with main character Paul Kemp (Johnny Depp) waking up in a luxurious hotel room in Puerto Rico after a heavy night of drinking. After chomping down a few aspirin, Kemp stumbles into the editors office of the San Juan Star and is given a dead end writing job. After a few chance encounters, Kemp becomes the center of intrigue and corruption while consuming copious amounts of alcohol."The Rum Diary" was originally a novella from the twisted mind of Hunter S. Thompson an eccentric journalist and novelist who in addition to smoking, snorting, injecting, drinking every drug, alcohol and carcinogen known to man, managed to change the face of journalism by calling it as he sees it. His writing can repel and enchant with equal measure and has a breakneck spontaneity which is rivaled by its frazzled incoherency.Incoherency would be the best word to describe this film. The story lacks any kind of focus jumping from a love story, a corrupt land deal, drunken antics, workplace politics and racial tensions. Watching "The Rum Diary" was like talking to a drunk grad student; little flashes of genius may linger but after what seems like four hours you realize you're talking to a drunken idiot and looking for the door.Thompson's other work adapted to screen shares a similar inconsistency but say what you will about "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" at least it was interesting. Director Bruce Robinson seems unsure behind the camera trying desperately to balance themes and while Terry Gilliam threw spaghetti at the wall to see what sticks, Robinson compensates by drawing out its screen time and keeping the camera-work and editing as dull and uninspiring as possible.The films only saving grace is the inclusion of Giovanni Ribisi as a cirrhosis addled, syphilitic cohort who takes LSD while listening to records of Nazi propaganda. His arguments with the Star's head editor (Richard Jenkins) provide some of the few precious moments of humor.The epilogue appears while Johnny Depp sails into the horizon explaining that while its the end of the story "...its the beginning of another." I would have liked to have seen the other story. At least by then the sardonic wit of Thompson was finally present.http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rum Diary (2011)If you're looking for the craziness of later Hunter S. Thompson, you'll find shreds of it here. In a way this is a more cogent movie than say "Fear and Loathing?" but it's also a bit prosaic beneath the wilder stuff that peppers the surface. Johnny Depp stars and runs the show in his usual strong if uninspired way as a new, hard-drinking reporter with a failing English language newspaper in Puerto Rico.There is a true surface here that's pretty amazing--the cars, the low down rot of the apartments, the racism between the rich white Americans and the indigenous Puerto Ricans. The depth you might expect and want here is slim, however, even though all the pieces are in play for a great drama--a charming troubled writer in a land filled with prejudice and violence and great natural beauty. It pushes the clichés too hard, and it's generally agreed (even by Thompson) that the material is weak and "rambling." The movie doesn't rearrange it enough to make it work.You can in a way watch this for those surfaces, if you don't need too much more. There are several secondary characters who do their best to be a bit insane, including Giovanni Ribisi as a drugged out waif of a reporter, something like what Thompson himself might have become later in life. (See of course the Depp in the imperfect 1998 "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" for a sense of the famous freewheeling selfish addled sometimes brilliant Thompson.)The director here also adapted Thompson's book and if he gets the credit for the nice ambiance of the film he also gets the burden of how clunky, choppy, and sometimes slow it is, even with such exciting material. It's not a horror, it's watchable, but you'll flag here and there. Even the end, without giving a thing away, is a bit deflating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Plot Summary Now if your the sort of person that needs a definitive story line and thick plot to enjoy a film then this probably isn't for you. Its more a 'fly on the wall' view of a young journalists struggles in a failing newspaper. Paul Kemp(Depp) is a young man trying to make his way in a new place, making new friends and enemy's along the way.What I thought of it I wasn't sure what I would think of this film, I new it has some great actors, such as Johnny Depp and Giovanni Ribisi, but the concept of the film was a strange one. I was pleasantly surprised, the director Bruce Robinson has done a great job with this film, which was always going to be a very tough job being adapted from a novel by Hunter S Thompson and technically having next to no strong plot.The film itself is stunning, the locations are amazing and well shot, and the editing style and shots work brilliantly with the type of film and more importantly with Johnny Depp, who has a massive screen presence in everything he does, including 'The Rum Diary'.This film has everything I want to see in a good movie, strong characters, great sets and brilliant comedy, along with meaning. It really makes you think about society and life nowadays and how primarily, nothing has changed in the way the world goes round and the sort of corruption and manipulation that still goes on today all around us, as it did back in the fifties, only less obviously.On a lighter note, this film is hilarious and great to watch more than once, there is something rather satisfying about watch a man drink huge amounts of high octane rum and have to deal with the consequences the next morning, something that makes you happy its not only you.Summary In all I thought this was a very enjoyable film for anyone to watch and have a good laugh at while loving everything about the characters. The acting is scintillating and exciting.I highly recommend this film to all, one to watch ..... 7/10 Stars*</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Rum Diary film review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Rum Diary is a drama conjoined with elements of playful humour, based on the self entitled novel by Hunter S. Thompson. The film boasts one of the most critically acclaimed actors Johnny Depp, who is joined by other noticeable stars such as Aaron Eckhart (The Dark Knight), Giovanni Ribisi (Gone In 60 Seconds) and upcoming beauty Amber Heard. Depp himself is familiar with Thompson when incorporating his novel Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas onto the big screen in 1998. With this in mind we were certain to expect elements of surrealism with maybe the odd drug usage now and then. The story is set in the 1950's and follows Depp through the character of Paul Kemp who moves to Puerto Rico as a journalist who is in search of work, a good story and possibly something more. With his new job comes new friendships, utter absurdity, vast amounts of alcohol all topped off with a blonde bombshell.The Rum Diary displays beautiful visual strategies in stages throughout the narrative. Being based on the island of Puerto Rico the camera work certainly fetishises the beauty of the island in the same way in which beauty Chenault (Amber herd) is captured. Her blonde hair and blue eyes offer the same satisfaction as long stretching beaches and deep blue oceans. The visual strategies are very creative and often juggle between states of mind that Kemp and others alike are under. This being most apparent in a scene between Kemp and co-worker Sala, when experiencing an unknown drug, which is taken as eye drops. Similar visuals between this scene and ones in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas can be matched, and anyone who is familiar to this film knows that experiences of intoxication are to be had. The hazy and slow motion camera work have been closely thought out to create these effects over us, the audience, as we are able to be a part of these actions.One thing that I have been highly impressed with is the script itself; people have mentioned that The Rum Diary has not lived up to expectations and could have been better. However, this is not my personal opinion and I will offer a different outlook on the matter. My expectations of the film were not high due to these reviews but I am an individual who likes to make my own assumptions. The storyline offered, in my opinion, intriguing characters that all offer special characteristics in the narrative. They have been well thought of and are strong and understood rather than being weak or pointless. Moberg, played by Giovanni Ribisi, is a violent, black mailing, alcoholic who works in the newspaper with Kemp and Sala but rarely shows up to work and on the odd occasion he does he is drunk. The character is built to represent the pointlessness of the newspaper and seems to have worked out what Kemp has yet to learn already. His far fetched logic and actions all add up to a comic effect in the story which present light relief to a dramatic storyline. Scenes involving Voodoo witches and Nazi uniforms add to the surreal yet humorous conventions The Rum Diary offers.As I mentioned, my expectations of The Rum Diary weren't at all particularly high but because of this aspect I think I enjoyed the spectacle more and was pleasantly surprised. The storyline keeps on going and I was never left with the feeling of it dragging on but left wanting more, which the film could have easily done without becoming numb. The characters are entertaining as well as fresh and the surreal aspects certainly are not typical in everyday Hollywood blockbusters. The film is defiantly worth watching in terms of its originality as well as the comical moments and strong storyline.Defiantly a film worth seeing and remembering. You don't have to be under the influence to enjoy this ride</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Drear and Loafing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By the film's intentional anti-climax we learn that Hunter S. Thompson, who wrote THE RUM DIARY about his stint as a journalist in Puerto Rico in 1960, would go onto better things, taking on all the "bastards" he let slip by in his youth.The problem is, there's none in this movie worth troubling over, or for the audience to root against. Which means Johnny Depp's Paul Kemp (Thompson with a fake name) has nothing for an audience to root for: other than he's a popular actor that played a pirate who loved rum, and so does this character. (Every time Depp mentions drinking, he's practically winking at the audience.) Doing the same Walter Cronkite mumble from FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS, Johnny's performance is so low-key it hardly registers at all. His porky photographer sidekick Sala (Michael Rispoli) has more interesting and memorable qualities since he's sloppy and somewhat humorous. But in this film, there's a lack of anything meaningful beneath the surface... which is an existential odyssey misadventure, sort of... yet it sporadically plants a political flag; but other than clips of Nixon, or shots of poor people being exploited, there's nothing substantial to hold onto.The "plot" has Kemp hired as a journalist at a fledgling Puerto Rico newspaper, with the task of making the country seem like an accessible tourist trap, and then conned by a millionaire to be his propagandist ? a man who seems nice at first, but has his eyes on turning the gorgeous exterior into a real estate landmine. He has a sexy girlfriend who Kemp lusts after, leading to a brief romance more lacking in chemistry than the film does purpose.As a Thompson fan, and having read his posthumous novel, it's a understandably difficult work to base a movie on. Making it that much more annoying when cinematic clichés ? like the scruffy underdogs battling the greedy rich guys, or a drug trip that too easily propels a creative edge ? are shoved at the screen: turning a subtle book never intended for publication into a ponderous film trying way too hard to make a point: whatever that might be.For More Movie Reviews: http://cultfilmfreakreviews.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Booze Induced Reality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read the book and this movie holds true to the voice that Thompson writes with - this is what makes the movie works. Depp's role, unsurprisingly, mimics his portrayal of Hunter in Fear and Loathing (only with less drugs, not counting alcohol).The movie can, realistically, be summed up in one "revelation" Depp's character has with a rather unusual counterpart. Throughout the film we see examples of the opulent lifestyle of few and downtrodden livings of the many. What Depp confides with his "friend", allows us to use what we have learned up to that point in the movie and chew on for the remainder of the movie, is this - the banks hold the wealth while leaving us (and the starving children) to stare at empty brass plates hanging on their front doors. Whether you agree with it or not, this is not a stretch to compare with the "occupy" movement settling into America and around Europe today.This movie is good. Much like the original book, this movie doesn't try to entertain the viewer; it allows the viewer to sit back and follow along as one man experiences a lifetime of ups and downs in a matter of weeks. And be prepared to go out for a drink afterward, you'll need it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Underrated Movie.....Give it a Try !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After all the bad reviews, I thought long and hard about watching this, but then respect for Bruce Robinson, and Johhny Depp took over, and I had to watch it. The movie turned out to be really great, the acting was very good, from everybody, the less colorful actor in this was probably Depp, but in relative terms of course, its just, he didn't bring anything new to the table, but all the other actors were a blast, Michael Rispoli was awesome, a great friend in the movie, just one of these roles that you watch it and want to go chill and drink few rums with him. Giovanni Ribisi is just great as a drunk journalist, lately, every role with him I saw, its just pure magic. His role is a bit controversial, or at least as Johhny said in one of his European interviews defending this film, few aspects of the film are not made for the American audience, I guess you have to watch the film and judge for yourself on this one. What else can I say, I was surprised, very underrated movie, don't go in expecting Withnail &amp; I or Fear and Loathing because those movies are masterpieces in their own right, and its very hard to make something similar to them (especially Fear and Loathing) but this film definitely comes close in its atmosphere, pacing, and friendly feeling to Withnail &amp; I, so don't go in expecting it to be Fear or Withnail, but keep in mind the charm is there. Give it a try and you will not regret it. "_"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all I must say The Rum diary is one of my favorite movies of all time. But in order to really understand it, you need to know some background on HST 's life and work. This is not Where the Buffalo Roam nor is it Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, it's not even comparable. Paul Kemp is the young Hunter, fresh journalist beginning his career in Puerto Rico. Movie contains a lot of Hunter's views and ideas which we can see when he writes subjective about the real situation in Puerto Rico instead of writing unimportant news like some rich old couple going bowling, he writes about poverty and lives of regular people. Some scenes are a bit cheesy but the movie is still brilliant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny and intelligent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A big commercial flop, this intelligent comedy was dismissed by the critics and ignored by the public, and yet I must say that I quite enjoyed it. It is based on a novel of the same name by the late journalist Hunter Thompson. Johhny Depp stars as Paul Kemp, an alter ego of Thompson (Depp had already played a character based on Thompson in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas). Set in 1960, as the movie begins we see Kemp arriving in Puerto Rico in an alcoholic haze. After an interview with Lotterman, its editor, Kemp gets a job in an English language newspaper there that has seen better days. Kemp becomes pal with two other alcoholic reporters in the paper, the crazy Moberg and the cynical Sala. These three are soon living together in a decrepit house in San Juan and are involved in a series of humorous adventures. The closest thing this movie has to a regular plot is when Kemp is contacted by Sanderson, an enigmatic businessman (Aaron Eckhart, who is great). Sanderson introduces Kemp to various businessmen and politicians and wants to recruit him to write a puff job in the paper so that an island that serves as practice range for the military would be available for the construction of hotels. Sanderson has a very pretty girlfriend, Chenault (Amber Heard), who soon tries to seduce Kemp. Kemp eventually wants to write about the various corrupt plots he learns in the newspaper, but he is vetted the very cynical Lotterman, who doesn't want to rock the place, and instead thinks the newspaper should do soft pieces. I'm not telling anything more about the movie, but it makes for a pretty entertaining film. It's intriguing to me that the movie was not well received, perhaps for some it has too broad a style for a comedy, given the subject matter. The great recreation of the era certainly helps.</fullReview>

He writes for a failing newspaper, get's involved in a conspiracy, has an exciting love interest. His view on the social situation of the Island and the tensions between the locals and the expatriates provide a good background to his adventures. The drunk antics of him and his colleagues provide entertaining intervals and are strangely interconnected with the rest of the story line. A believable protrait of a small scale corporate/governmental conspiracy is portrayed. The characters are interesting and slightly comical figures. All in all an entertaining movie for those who have taste for originality and attention to detail.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strangely flat and lifeless. Depp should stay away from vanity projects</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Johnny Depp's vanity project The Rum Diary - 'vanity project' for that, at the end of the day is all it is - is based on a novel of the same name by Hunter S. Thompson Depp is said to have found among Thompson's belongings after the writer's suicide. The novel, completed in 1960 wasn't published until 1998 and, well, you have to ask yourself why. If the film of the novel is anything to go by I suspect it was simply because it wasn't very good. But as I have never read it, I can't tell you either way.Mediocre novels have been turned into great films by great scriptwriters and directors. Unfortunately on this offering Bruce Robinson isn't one. Or if he is, he this is one occasion when he hasn't pulled it off. (Robinson made his name with his semi-autobiographical film Withnail &amp; I, and I have to admit that didn't do too much for me either.) Depp has previously dabbled in Thompson's work with Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas. That didn't come off either, which suggests to me Depp has something of a blind spot where Thompson is concerned. And this is Robinson's first film as director in 19 years. That, too, should tell us something, and possibly something not particularly complimentary.The film itself is oddly old-fashioned, in storyline, cinematography, direction and production. In the hands of another director Thompson's rather slight story might well have been turned to gold. Here it remains base metal. Almost everything about it, from the soundtrack to the dialogue, from the 'plot' to the humour - it has been billed as a comedy - is flat and lifeless and, well, mediocre. This kind of schtick was churned out weekly by journeymen writers and directors until the digital age changed what the punter wanted to see. Depp, it has to be said (and this is a personal view) always has an attractive screen presence even when the film he's starring in is third-rate (and I have seen him in some real clunkers - Blow comes to mind).Amber Heard has virtually no role and I simply did not buy the romance between her character and Depp's. Michael Rispoli, Giovanni Ribisi, Aaron Eckhart and Richard Jenkins (who was excellent as the penny-counting hit-man's paymaster in Killing Them Softly) turn in workaday performances and do the best of a bad job given what little they had to work with. Situations which, I'm sure, were intended to raise a laugh do nothing of the kind. I really did want to turn off halfway through but held out in case it somehow went from second to third gear. But it didn't.Sorry, Johnny, perhaps you should get better advice and listen to others rather than your own gut.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As others have observed, it is not useful to review this movie on whether it follows or not the book that inspired it. We are reviewing a movie, and my opinion on any movie is shaped by these questions: "Is is engaging? Is it moving without pandering? Is it cinematographically driven? Do I learn something from the story? Do I feel smarter after watching it? Did I root for any character in the script? Is it entertaining in an intelligent way?" I must respond yes to all of that for Rum Diary. The script did suffer from too fast- or too flat- an ending, but it kept me engaged throughout and up to the last 3 minutes. There were comic moments, moments of beauty, and a very realistic thread. The atmosphere is superbly rendered: I could feel the sweat and the threats, and I could relate to the politics at stake. The plot lives by the Oscar Wilde line quoted by the Johnny Depp character at some point: "Some people know the price of everything and the value of nothing." I subscribe to that line, rooted for our lost journalist to find his way, and I enjoyed the escape for 90 min into a lush tropical 60s landscape.</fullReview>

The only thing the book and film have in common is that the book made me want to drink rum for breakfast and the film just drove me to drink! The film should not carry the same name as the book. Positives about the film... Depp's sunglasses, the fiat 500, that's it - two. 'The minimum length for reviews is 10 lines'... goodness without padding a review of this film is impossible. Conclusion: please read the book, do not waste ?2.59 on eBay for the DVD (free postage).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Inspired Cast can't help a Messy Plot,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Rum Diary is a decent movie with a good storyline and a talented cast. The films plot is all over the place and it is certainly hard to follow at times, the characters are quite strange and sadly not likable enough for me to have any bit of care for them. The cast is very good and Johnny Depp certainly delivers a great performance, like he always does, but they simply weren't enough to help this movie become anything memorable or really worth watching. It had a lot of potential, but the Rum Diary mostly let me down and because of that I can only recommend it if you ever see it on television and have some time to kill. An author moves to Puerto Rico hoping to develop a more commercial writing style, but he instead gets mixed up in local politics. Best Performance: Johnny Depp</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While this was not a poorly made film, it lacked a sense of purpose. It is about a made-up writer (that they falsely lead you to believe was a real man) who moves to Puerto Rico to get a job and is a drunk. What else is it about may you ask? I'm not altogether sure. It was not completely incoherent, but the storyline had no focus. It jumped around and quickly left one topic, idea, or narrative just as soon as it introduced it. Towards the end right when you think Paul Kemp had an ambitious cause, it was over. With the cheesy line "this is the end of one story and the beginning of another" they leave you to realize that you are in the same place as you started. Nothing had really happened at all or had been accomplished. I did enjoy the performances by all of the actors, but this fact was dampened by distractions of the plot that lead to nowhere. In the end it all just seemed pointless and without reason.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even the great Johnny Depp struggles to save this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Rum Diaries is based on another of writer Hunter S Thompson's books. Depp originally played the man himself in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and gained many fans, much kudos and critical accolade in the process. Therefore, it was fair to say that when people found out that Depp would, once again, be playing Hunter S Thompson, they expected more of the same.How wrong they were.Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is a trippy, drug-fuelled, crazy, chaotic mess that only the talents of Terry Gilliam at the helm could really bring to the screen. It was mad and it worked. However, the Rum Diary falls at the first hurdle for being as far away from Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas as is possible to get.First of all, it's described as an 'Action/adventure/drama/comedy.' That is a clue as to another of its failings. It has no idea what it wants to be. It borrows elements from all of those genres, but can never quite decide which one it wants to be and ends up being none of the above. There's not enough action, not enough comedy and no real drama. As for 'adventure' - I would describe an Indiana Jones film as an adventure. The Rum Diary is NOT Indiana Jones.Johnny Depp is a master at playing larger-than-life characters, yet his version of Paul Kemp is pretty flat. The other characters all seem like they're just about to start being wacky, but the camera cuts away before they can truly shine.Johnny Depp will always be one of the great modern actors of our time and The Rum Diary will do little to dampen his appeal. He just had an off day/film (or two off days if you've seen The Tourist). The Rum Diary just isn't interesting on any level. Too long. Too slow. Too unsure of itself. And when it does show signs of promise (and there are the occasional flares of the Depp/Thompson we want to see) it's too little too late.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/</fullReview>

Often rage starts with one or two observations, than a casual invite that allows integrity an opportunity to peer into a sub-culture of corruption and deceit.Of course, when the dust clears, little has changed, save one thing, the protagonist, a budding writer with 10 years of flops, finds a voice.And although that voice might be a small know nothing from no where, it grows to a volume of proportions no one could have anticipated, consuming all those it was crossed by in its past.There is little reason to fear Hunter S.

		<shortDescription>A labor of love for Johnny Depp who came to know Hunter S Thompson very well.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me the backstory was even more interesting than the movie. In his younger days Thompson wrote the manuscript for "Rum Diary" but it had been left unfinished and unpublished. In more recent years Depp discovered it in Thompson's basement among other things and through a collaborative effort with others trimmed, polished and published the book. Now it is this movie, a very interesting one.It is set in 1960 and Johnny Depp as Kemp is a struggling author who goes to Puerto Rico for a newspaper job. He gets hired then finds out he was the only applicant. The newspaper wasn't doing that well and the office morale wasn't particularly high. As Kemp gets around he gets into the social circle of Aaron Eckhart as Sanderson, a wealthy man with a pretty young girlfriend. Kemp is smitten with the girl, and tolerates Sanderson. But Sanderson and his associates are putting together a land deal, to build hotels and a resort, not totally above-board. They hire Kemp as a writer who can help them make their case look favorable. We never really get into the real estate deal, it just provides the reason for the scenes that come after.Kemp's sidekick is Michael Rispoli as news photographer Sala. He must be a New Yorker, I kept imagining I was hearing Danny Devito in "Romancing the Stone." He was a good addition to the story.Very pretty Amber Heard, who looks a lot like Scarlett Johansson but prettier and more refined is Sanderson's girlfriend, Chenault. Her face was very familiar as I saw her this season on the now cancelled TV series "Playboy Club" as one of the bunnies. She is a good enough actress and with her looks I think we will be seeing her in more roles.Befitting the title there is a lot of rum-drinking in the movie, plus some cock-fighting, nude swimming, and sailing. While it is not autobiographical the fictional Kemp is certainly quite close to the author's own character. Depp is of course quite good. The critic Ebert has a very fair and accurate review.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie is an ovation to Hunter S. Thompson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am surprised to read some of the "negative" reviews here from people who apparently read the book but seem to have misunderstood it (at least partially). To understand the book it is important to know that Thompson's writing style -GONZO style- does not necessarily intend to achieve accuracy, it is written without claims of objectivity, it mixes personal emotions with actual facts and is often written in the first person for that same purpose. Having said that, just because in the book is semi- biographical and the protagonist's voice is in the first person does not mean that Thompson intended to represent himself thru Kemp but in fact he was both KEMP AND SANDERSON (Kemp's alter ego). When Thompson wrote this book he was only 22yro, he had indeed lived in Puerto Rico and worked there as a journalist but a sports' journalist. Thompson was a writer struggling and thriving for success (which is represented by Kemp's character) but he was also very athletically inclined, ambitious and coquettish with the seduction that easy money, life and crookery may bring to the table (which is represented by Sanderson's).I think the movie represents all of this very well, you feel at one moment the desire and ambition and want the private beach house, the amazing set of wheels and the very polished girl and the next moment you feel the disgust with the tourists, the compassion for the poor, sympathy with Kemp's insubordinate personality and a sudden rush to self destruct with drugs and alcohol all meanwhile you get a good laugh for all of this is illustrated in the movie with great comedic beauty. Lastly the cinematography and scenery are beautiful and the acting was great and who better to do Kemp's character than Johnny Depp who was a close friend of Thompson and whom in fact paid for Thompson's funeral services, this movie is Depp's extended ovation to his close friend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'The Rum Diary' (2011)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think many people walked away from this feature disappointed, not only because they were half expecting 'The Rum Diary' to be a drug-fueled odyssey in the same manner that 'Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas' was, but also because the film's fire burns out towards the end, and leaves with practically no climax whatsoever. But for some reason, I feel the ending was pretty appropriate. Thompson's books usually weren't linear in any way, and half of the "action" of the story usually took place inside of his head. Whereas 'Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas' was a truly faithful adaptation of Thompson's book, 'The Rum Diary' seems to have more conventional items everywhere, in every scene. We have our protagonist, Johnny Depp, the nice guy who turns into the antagonist about half-way through our feature, Aaron Eckhart who I always feel does a great job. In one way or another, I feel that one day Eckhart will be well remembered for his performance here, even if it is dressed in a terrible cult fashion.In all honesty, I have seen every part of 'Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas' at least once, but I have never once sat and watched the entire feature from beginning to end. Something always ends up becoming a distraction, if you know what I'm saying. However, I had sort of the same problem with watching 'The Rum Diary', I wanted to write a review for this days ago, but I had to cradle my own hangover for several days, and I feel that Depp summed it up for me, himself, and the rest of the audience somewhere near the ending there where he goes "I'm never drinking alcohol again". Of course that's not the case for me, and we all get the idea right away that it isn't the case for Depp (or Thompson, or Kemp, or whatever you wanna call him) either.In creating a linear tale out of Thompson's drunken memoirs, they of course have to give him a love interest, also. I haven't read the book yet, but I truly doubt any semblance of Amber Heard's character appears there, and even in the film she is slightly attractive -only slightly- and her character is pretty shallowly written. This really doesn't take too much else away from the rest of the film, as she doesn't have too much else to do with it either way. This must be why some people walked away disappointed: the fact that they tried to make a linear story out of something that wasn't linear. However, I feel the film works as a comedy far better than 'Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas' ever did. Michael Rispoli and Giovanni Ribisi's characters had me laughing out loud at least a couple times, and let's not forget Richard Jenkins who fits his role perfectly. It is these three players that probably give the audience the most enjoyment out of the whole thing.I'm happy with Bruce Robinson's finished product, even if the ending was rushed, even if the LSD scene could have been omitted, even if it might come off as slightly boring to some, I'm glad they took a different approach to this film, rather than trying to make Thompson's character extremely eccentric, and present us with another drug festival on screen, this polished feature moves merrily along as a tale of Thompson's early misadventures in Puerto Rico. I haven't been the biggest Johnny Depp fan in recent times either, and I had my doubts, but I was very pleased with how he pulled the early Thompson off, without overplaying himself. I can't wait for the next Hunter S. Thompson screen adaptation, and I would be more than happy to see Depp portray him yet again. I'm hoping for a "Hell's Angels" flick, myself. =) THE RUM DIARY -----8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are 2 kinds of reviews that can be done for this movie. First, by those who have read Hunter already and second by those who choose to know Hunter after watching this movie. I am the second type. I haven't read any of Hunter's books and hence a pure movie critique this! A sensible movie well made by director Bruce Robinson. Johnny Depp central role of Hunter Stockton Thompson is totally justified. This is the kind of cinema any movie lover would want to cherish. What impressed me first is the different and detailed perspective of Puerto Rico by, should I say, a mainlander? The movie goes in it's own pace never to appear slow. But what influenced me most is the fact that this movie is so close to reality even to the present day and a pretty practical closure. Somehow, it made me happy. Now, I am in bit of a hurry to jot this down, as I need to watch more Hunter movies.</fullReview>

His love for the man and his work and ideals shine through in everything he does.You won't be chattering like a raccoon or watching patterns on your eyelids after watching this but you should at least have spent a hundred minutes or so in the presence of an amazing cast presented beautifully in an idyllic setting.I thoroughly enjoyed it. 8/10</fullReview>

This is a great story that mixes comedy, romance and drama into an enthralling plot which engages the viewer from the very beginning to the very end. Depp is a master of his craft, a rare actor who can make you laugh or make you cry. I won't give anything away here, but this is a movie not to be missed. I give this one 10/10. The support cast are simply perfect and compliment Depp in his role as a journalist come novelist yet to find his own voice as a writer. The script is sharp and the story moves along nicely with little or no superfluous moments. This movie didn't make a big noise in the cinemas but is surely worthy of five stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A shambolic story about a shambolic man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paul Kemp (Johnny Depp) joins a newspaper in 1960s Puerto Rico and, from there, he befriends a seedy photojournalist. becomes involved in the affairs of shady businessmen, is attracted to a self-indulgent young woman, drinks far too much far too often, and gets embroiled in sundry other misadventures of one sort or another.I understand that this is based on a recently discovered largely autobiographical book by the late Hunter S. Thompson, and has been produced as a labour of love by Johnny Depp (with whom Thompson was friendly before his death). I know very little about Thompson other than that he was prone to overindulgence in artificial stimulants of one sort or another, and arrived at a premature death by his own hand.It is directed and written for the screen by Bruce Robinson, who was also responsible for Withnail and I, a film which I have so far managed not to see but which, I am aware, concerns a pair of dissolute individuals who wander around getting involved in various misadventures as a result of overindulgence in artificial stimulants of one sort or another. I think I see certain broad themes emerging. In praise of this film, I can say that it seems to summon up its time and place very well, the performances are good, and Amber Heard is gorgeous There is some amusement here and there, but this is not a comedy, and most of the humour was used in the trailer.On the negative side, however, it appears to me that it is perhaps a bit too faithfully adapted from the source. If the source book depicts a life where someone lurches drunkenly from one shambolic crisis to another, where the events are not necessarily connected to each other and don't necessarily matter very much in any event, then it has been adapted very well. The narrative flow here is sequential, but pretty random. In short, the film is a mess and this is probably because Thompson's book is a mess, and that's probably because Thompson himself was a mess. One admires Depp's commitment to his friend, but it hasn't resulted in a very good film.This was disappointing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The perfect movie for the times we're living in.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although set in 1959-1960, the movie is still very pertinent to the world 50 years later! A lot of the same types of things go on today. There are a lot of important messages, and a lot to be gleaned from this movie if the viewer is keen enough to look beyond the surface.The movie has a lot to say about honesty and corruption, rich and poor, wealth and poverty. Thompson was way ahead of his time, but, after seeing how the world turned out despite his efforts, it makes the viewer wonder. I found it interesting how the movie showed a different side to the 50's and 60's; the side you never saw on the news, on the television, or in the paper. The side you never saw on "Leave it to Beaver."The movie demonstrates how we get complacent in our sheltered worlds being fed just the information we are allowed to have, and being led around by the nose to debate which political party is the best when, in fact, the wealthy of the world are pulling all the strings, and taking no prisoners. The movie can leave viewers feeling hopelessly devoid of power, but also motivated to pay more attention, and encouraged that people who aren't afraid to point fingers still exist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Captain Jack Saves, 'The Rum Diary'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoiler ALERT!!! Spoiler ALERT!!! This is a wild and crazy story about a drunken journalist who goes to Puerto Rico; stays drunk, and leaves drunk. If I spoiled it for you, you can thank me for saving you some money. Mr. Depp, as always, is great fun to watch and is very entertaining. I have never seen a movie Johnny Depp has ever done that I did not like ? until now. I know ? I know, we must all bow to the altar of Hunter S. Thompson. This guy is a journalistic icon and a heck of a party animal. I mean his actions and writings introduced, 'The Beat Generation', to the rest of the populace ? oh wait ? that was Jack Kerouac, and NOT HST. Hmmm, let me see what useful thing DID Hunter actually do? Oh yeah - that's right, he was a political hack, 'Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail'; and a junky-vandal in, 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' (and I DO know these are all 'fiction', but these stories are 'loosely' based on the life of HST). I understand that the book, 'The Rum Diary', is supposed to deal with some of the fears of aging and from what I see in other reviews the movie completely missed that mark. Am I surprised ? not really. Do I care ? not really. Honestly, I never had an interest in Mr. Thompson but I will respect those who hold him in high esteem. I do not. For me, he just sounds like an emotional journalist who got spitting mad when sheep-le did not fall into his way of thinking. I think money would have been better spent on 'Big Sur' or 'On the Road', these bits of fiction changed generations?and the main character was not drunk ALL the time. Anyways, (my opinion only) mediocre would be too generous for this film. There is no subtle attempt to hide the movie's alignment with present-day progressive agendas. When a movie is thrown into the face of presumably ignorant movie goers - it tends to kick humanity under the cinematographic bus.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Rum Diary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been waiting for the film adaptation of The Rum Diary to be released for quite some time now. I am a big fan of writer Hunter S. Thompson and his books, articles and films made from his writings such as Terry Gilliam's 1998 masterpiece Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. Over the past several years I kept hearing that different people were attached to do The Rum Diary movie, but people would back out and just when it seemed like the film was ready it would be delayed. Finally it has been released and I can easily say that the film exceeded way past my expectations of it. I own The Rum Diary, but it has been several years since I have read it and till I watched the film, I could not really remember all that much about it. Basically just minor details. This is not because it is necessarily a bad book, but when I read it, I think I found that I liked a lot of Hunter S. Thompson's other writings considerably better. Fortunately for me the film translates really well to the screen and has given me a whole new admiration for the book and the film has easily become one of my favourite films of this year. The story just briefly takes place in the 1960's where an American writer and journalist named Paul Kemp, goes to Puerto Rico and gets a job at a rundown and failing newspaper as a writer. There he befriends some of the others who work at the paper and gets involved with a shady character named Sanderson, and also falls for his girlfriend Chenault. Throughout the rest of the film there is a lot of humour, despair, eccentricities and a lot that I absolutely loved. When the film version of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas came out, it was really divided by critics. Some absolutely loved it and others hated it with a passion. I can safely say that if Fear was not your film, you may still like The Rum Diary. Fear was all about having a good time and partying and seeing all the freaky things that came out of it. The Rum Diary is a much more subdued and low key film in that regard. There is drinking and some partying, but not a lot and it is not the focus of the film. The focus and main message that The Rum Diary was trying to get across is the decline and failure of the American dream, politics, greed and human nature. It is told in somewhat a bitter way, but it is making a point here and is making it loud and clear just as revved up and ready to go as any of Hunter S. Thompson's writings. The thing is the characters in the film know of this decline and it comes to the point where they try and do something about it, but there is no values, ethics or things left to save. The film at times is a beautiful looking film and at other times very bleak, drab and ugly. I say this in a good way because it really strikes home the conditions the writers are talking about and further adds to the message it is trying to convey and also show the lifestyle of where they are living. The Rum Diary is not all hopelessness and despair either. There is a good amount of fun to be had here as well. Some of the supporting characters are so out there and wonderfully unique that they made me laugh out loud several times. I really enjoyed the chemistry and forbidden love of Paul Kemp's character and Chenault, and found it really added tension and other interesting elements to the film. That acting here by everyone is superb and there is not one weak performance in the bunch. The film has the look, feel and style of Thompson's gonzo style journalism and his blunt way of saying things. It strikes home a message that some may already get and others perhaps not. It is important, but remember that there is also a lot of fun to be had here as well. This film is destined to become a cult classic because unfortunately it is doing poorly at the theatres. If you are at all a fan of Thompson, cult films, or just anything different I highly recommend you give this film a try. One of the year's best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Confused Narrative</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Somewhere towards the end, the narrative of Bruce Robinson's The Rum Diary loses faith in itself.Up until this happened it felt so much more episodically close to its' novel adaptation, fast paced and fun but at a certain point the actors involved in The Rum Diary sort of start coming out of their characters.Just an assumption, but Robinson's nostalgia for Terrance Gilliam's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas must have been what forced him to gradually break away from his commitment to his own linear narrative. Throughout the first hour and a half we didn't have Hunter S Thompson narrating this story. And I don't think Robinson realized that until the last thirty minutes of the feature.In Fear and Loathing Gilliam made a commitment to exploiting the drug abusing nature of HST. But Robinson couldn't do that as much in The Rum Diary and I think he wanted to, badly because that's what the last 30 minutes told me.As much as Robinson wanted to make this journey through Puerto Rico hallucinogenic the novel he was trying to adapt didn't call for it. And all that from Fear and Loathing is probably what really inspired Robinson to direct The Rum Diary in the first place. So toward the end it's kind of like Robinson thought 'wait, we still haven't shown them enough surrealistic hallucinations narrated by Thompson so he tacked on another thirty minutes of a possible story line.Up until that point we almost got somewhat of an authentic autobiographical epic of the late author obviously told from the perspective of someone besides. But that also meant by this point it was too late for the director to just suddenly turn over the narrative to Johnny Depp from behind the type writer of Thompson.At this point I began to feel like the words coming out of Johnny Depp's mouth were not the words of HST.If this was supposed to be a close adaptation to the book it didn't feel that way in the end.</fullReview>

I remember some flashes of brilliance in Thompsons early novel but of course they're not featured in this film.Why? Because the director Bruce Robinson who apparently used up all his directorial firepower in "Withnail &amp; I" chose to pursue a disjointed and haphazardly crammed vision of this book or even HST himself. I'm a huge fan of Thompson, so don't give me this "If you're a fan of HST you'll love this" crap, which is probably just marketing on IMDb.The comedic elements don't work. Neither does the love story or the rest of it for that matter. Depp, who normally can add some depth to even the most mundane and disposable idea seems lost in this one, which he probably felt was an obligation to Hunter.When the going gets weird, the weird turn pro goes the saying and this proponent of the weird sez: this movie sucks.</fullReview>

I'm not sure?From watching interviews with Johnny Depp ? on Newsnight of all places ? you would think this was a political film about 'truth' in journalism. The film only really hints at this, however, focusing more on the fun and wild aspects of the time in Puerto Rico.The whole film, therefore, feels a bit like a precursor to something that never comes, with little real depth or intrigue. The style also disappoints, expecting more from 'Withnail and I' director, Bruce Robinson.More a Twitter feed than diary, this entertains on a basic level, but I can imagine that this isn't the hugely insightful piece that Hunter S.'s fans would have craved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A review for people who don't know about Hunter S Thompson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm one of the uncultured folks who never read a word of Hunter S. Thompson in my life. If that describes you, too, then read on.The appeal of this film is geared toward the cult following of HST, capitalizing on the quirky "Fear &amp; Loathing in Las Vegas" vibe that Johnny Depp created for the character. Apparently Depp was HST's friend in life, so we can expect a respectful, if not accurate, portrayal. Who knows if that's truly the case, but the Depp character is very likable and unique.The character comes across as intelligent, always seeming to understand things 1 level deeper than everyone else; however he never comes across as condescending, judgmental or cynical. That's the real beauty to me. For example he can sit and listen to his friend, a drunken Hitler fan, say some pretty racy and racist things, and he doesn't say a word. But in that deer-eyed look that only Depp can do, we feel the comedy of the awkward situation without feeling the bitterness of, say, someone rolling their eyes or sighing in exasperation.It's that innocent-yet-worldly approach that makes his performance such a treat to watch. The opening scene sets the character's tone for the entire film: he awakens in a hotel room looking like he had just spent the night drinking a small bathtub of booze. The locked mini bar has been ravaged as if by a pack of crazed ferrets. The room service guy stares in disbelief as Depp says, "I avoid alcohol" and then with that boyish smile "when I can." What can I say, that had me rolling right off the bat. The whole movie is somewhat low-key like that. There are no big punchlines, pratfalls or sight gags, but there are some absolutely classic moments like that which make you feel like you're part of an inside joke.The story itself? Well here's where I do know something about the book: many things were changed, and the ending itself was watered down. But it's still entertaining with a message: it's the story of a lone crusader who uses the power of journalism to battle the corrupt commercial powers invading Puerto Rico. I have to admit that the ending left me a little unsatisfied but not because it was weak. I didn't like it because it sorta injected a clichéd, Hallmark-channel-type scene when this film is certainly not Hallmark-channel material. But really that was just a 30 second scene, and aside from that I thought the film was well presented.Of course there will be comparisons to Terry Gilliam's "Fear &amp; Loathing" which established the HST-Depp character and his surreal adventures. Hardcore Gilliam fans might be offended by the mimicry, but I thought it was well played in the same way I enjoyed Peter Hyams' film "2010" which was a fan-doomed followup to Kubrick's untouchable "2001"."The Rum Diary" doesn't have quite as much surrealism &amp; quirk, but it certainly has its fair share. There's a psychedelic drug-induced line about a man's tongue that had me in stitches. I won't spoil it, you gotta hear it for yourself.If you're a casual fan of "Fear &amp; Loathing" (or maybe even a hardcore fan, who knows), if you like early Depp characterizations like "Ed Wood", if you like existentialist comedies about people who seem to be adrift in their own isolated world with their equally outcast friends, you might want to check this out.WARNING: One thing I didn't care for was the way it glorified cockfighting (all the characters seem to enjoy &amp; profit from it). But at least there's no blood or mutilation shown, and the American Humane Association did monitor film production. Still it might be a little unsettling for people who don't like depictions of animal abuse.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved the book, but this movie sort of let me down; it was more of a tribute to the man Hunter S. Thompson rather than his talent as a writer. Thompson wanted to write good fiction before he became one of the best known journalists in America. There were lines in the movie that weren't in the book but based on interviews Thompson did in real life. I mean, if you want to do a biographical film then write an original script rather than taking a work of fiction and entwining it with the real life figure. I wanted to see Paul Kemp, not Hunter S. Thompson as Paul Kemp. I don't mind it when adaptation's aren't faithful to it's source, just as long as the spirit of the story is still there. The spirit of Rum Diary was lost in it's translation to film by substituting it with a simple tribute to the journalist Hunter S. Thompson. Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas still stands as the best adaptation of Thompson's work thus far until another filmmaker gets on the saddle of Thompson's beautiful prose and rides wild.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The rum diary' is a film adaptation of Hunter S Thompson's popular novel of the same name. Having never read the novel, my opinion of the film tuned out to be pretty shallow. Perhaps I should have done my reading prior to to seeing this. Perhaps it would have changed my perception. I happened to discover this movie when I was looking for an Amber Heard film I hadn't seen. I'm a sucker for noir thrillers So I decided to give it a go. Amber Heard was looking sultry and attractive more than ever, so I guess one would not resist. Those who are fans of Amber will be hugely disappointed as she barely has anything to do besides flaunt her sex appeal. This is fine if you admire eye candy on screen.The main premise involves a journalist from New York who takes up a journalist job in Cuba. He joins the local newspaper. In the meantime he is approached by a a real estate developer played by Aaron Ekhart who approaches him with a profit proposal and to become a business partner. He accepts it. However Depp falls in to trouble being drunk with the local authorities and Ekhart gets him bail. However trouble begins when he revokes his bail and makes Depp go on the run after Amber has an unexpected encounter with the locals at the local bar. Depp decides to expose Aaron's shaddy business deals.The film has a noir appeal. Unfortunately in terms of plot there is little to offer the viewer. The plot involving the hotel resort on the island could have been interesting if it had been developed further. The 'romance' and 'comedy' sub plots shadow it badly. It is a pit it wasn't at the centre of focus. Giovanni Ribsi gives good comic support and Amber Heard sparkles in the little regular intervals. Her tan seemed overworked. The film has a slow pace, but it is advised that one has to concentrate sustain interest. Johnny Depp gives a good restrained performance. Bit it is a pity that the script didn't give him the opportunity to show his true potential. My other complaint was with Ekhat's character. It seemed selfish for him to place the blame of Amber's rape on Depp. Approach this film with caution I suggest. It was slightly below my expectations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film has elements of what could be great. And fails at every chance. It is a Hollywood version of Hunter Thompson. Depp, who is genius at "Fear and Loathing" is horribly miscast here as Paul Kemp. He is not Kemp. The man who plays Sala is just, blah. Director Robinson seems to try and channel "Withnail &amp; I" but really doesn't strike a chord with this film. Perhaps Hollywood snuck in and did its usually job of ruining a good picture.What do I base all this on? The wonderful book. Read it? You will see this film doesn't even seem to attempt to capture its wonderfulness. I hate comparing books to movies, but in this case, it's just not even a good movie. Moberb doesn't even seem like the Moberg from the movie. Chenault seems nailed as a character. Otherwise, blah.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hunter S Thompson is an iconic figure in the history of journalism. This early work as far as I can tell keeps closely to the book and flaunts the usual conventions with a brash confidence. This is the history of Thompson 'finding his own voice' through unconventional means. Alcohol, drugs, love and immersion in an alien culture with liberal sentiments. This last addition of Puerto Rico, with the ensuing uncomfortableness of being the same nationality as the corrupting elite, unable to speak Spanish and expected to peddle dross news for the tourists is formational in the 'voice' formation. Whilst critics suggest the film is incoherent, meandering, unfocused with flashes of brilliance, what do they expect? This is Thompson at his core, all of the above with generous lashings of acerbic whit, anarchic thought structure and conflicted belief system, oh and awareness of this and more. For many the uncomfortable aspects of his writing repulse in the way that aspects of THompsons own psyche repulsed him. What Thompson refused to do is censor this shadow giving it as much free reign as his transcendental passages. This work is great and a beautifully shot homage to an iconic voice sadly missed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Somewhat based on the book of the same name (written by Hunter S. Thompson), the film strays quite a bit from the book, yet still maintaining the luster and/or voice that is Thompson. Although, as a whole I was bit disappointed in the execution.I thought Depp and Rispoli made a great duo. Ribisi held his own with his crazy character, adding just the right at just the right moments. I feel the camera work and editing could have been raised to a higher level ? as I feel it could make the film more enjoyable. The story itself seemed a little haphazard in a way, with lots of dueling plot points ? none of which seemed all that risky for the characters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In quasi-colonial 1960s Puerto Rico a drunkard journalist Kemp (Johnny Depp) embarks on his new career path as a 'Madame' horoscope column writer in the local Star newspaper. Despite his odious inhibitions fits right in with the rest of the employees of the decrepit paper, such as Sala (Michael Rispoli), who cock-fights in his spare time, or the incessantly high syphilis-ridden investigative mess of a journalist Moberg (Giovanni Ribisi). Enticed and mainly motivated by money Kemp accepts to enter into allegiance with the shady businessman Sanderson (Aaron Eckhart), who aims to takeover the seaside to build opulent hotel resorts. The situation complicates when Kemp falls for Sanderson's protégé Chenault (Amber Heard), thus creating a risky triangle.Hit with a chaotic mess of "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" mixing with "The Quiet American", Bruce Robinson delivers a movie, which fails to juggle all involved moving from slapstick (including an absolutely priceless scene with Depp and Rispoli attempting to drive a rundown car together) to more engulfing political themes, basically not managing to follow through on either. Thus rampaging through genres with a somewhat insincere crew of protagonist manning a more heavily laden theme boat (moving through comedy antics, entering into love story territory, whilst flirting with grand issues of power and politics). Based on the autobiographic novel of eccentric drug-snorting booze-binging journalist Hunter S. Thompson, attempts are made touch too many subjects, thus delivering a movie as freakishly incoherent as some of the writings of said author. As drunken a movie as the title suggest, it is unfortunately a plain mess, but nonetheless one not without its splendid moments and scenes. Floating into the sunset Kemp promises another story - hopefully one with more artistic cohesion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A reporter, ideally, is supposed to seek out and expose the truth. If you can't find the truth or your superiors don't it want it published, make it up. At least that's the preferred method undertaken at The San Juan Star in this bizarre comedy based on the novel of same name.Paul Kemp (played in typically off-the-wall fashion by Johnny Depp) is a novelist whose greatest work of fiction was the resume which got him a job at the Puerto Rico periodical. Determined to show the real living conditions outside the beach houses and five-star resorts, Kemp (Depp) experiences and recounts tales of dive bars, cock fights, and poverty among the local population. It becomes clear to him that his employers were looking for something they can print in a brochure, as opposed to the facts. While trying to satisfy his employers, Kemp encounters a local businessman by the name of Sanderson (played by Aaron Eckhart) after a chance encounter with his much younger fiancée Chenault (played by Amber Heard). Sanderson has a proposition for Kemp and Chenault proves herself to be intriguing, unsatisfied, and just out of Kemp's reach.While the accent's gone and the surroundings are meant to be gritty rather than supernatural, Paul Kemp is played here as though he's Jack Sparrow in a suit and tie for most of the film. He's perpetually inebriated and skates from one 'dangerous' situation to the next without as much as a scratch. And while the later portions of the film seem to build toward some dramatic confrontation, what Kemp and the viewers are left with is disappointment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Armed for battle, with a bottle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rum Diary was a poorly understood, and therefore poorly received film. Too many people seemed to expect a sequel to the chaotic, celebrity-strewn" Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" (1998), Johnny Depp's first tribute to Hunter S. Thompson. But that unwatchable mess was directed by the creatively incontinent Terry Gilliam. Rum Diary was written and directed by the author of Withnail and I, Bruce Robinson. So it has a point. It isn't Gilliamesque fan letter to America's champion of mind- and mood-altering substances; it's a tribute to Gonzo T. as a courageous, erudite, and principled, if undisciplined, journalist. And a lot of talent went into it.Richard Jenkins is masterful as Lotterman, the editor-in-chief; he's so good, in fact, that he almost steals scenes from Johnny Depp, a feat accomplished previously only by Al Pacino as a mobster and Bill Nighy as a lobster.And Jenkins' newsroom employees are played by character actors in Jenkins' rarefied league. From the bottom of the rum bottle up: Giovanni Ribisi as Moberg, a bearded, , Hitler-obsessed has-been so close to self- destruction that he distills "470 proof" alcohol, useful both as a libation and a weapon. He's a voice for Thompson, as they all are: "This country was built on genocide and slavery. We killed all the black guys over here and then we shipped in new black guys of our own. And then we brought in Jesus like a bar of soap."Michael Rispoli as Sala, the staff photographer and a cockfight aficionado who knows the territory (Puerto Rico) inside out, and is assigned to show Kemp (Depp) the ropes. "Do not confuse love with lust, nor drunkenness with judgment."But it is Depp, and his respect for Thompson, that keeps this movie on the rails. Kemp is also dissolute, of course, and though still young (Thompson was in San Juan his 20s), was already firmly on the road to self-fulfillment: he was discharged by the army because he "will not be guided by policy." Unlike Moberg and Sala, Kemp is only beginning his career. He's cynical, and a slave to his weaknesses, but his moral compass reads true. Watching Nixon on television: "How long can this blizzard of shame go on?" Watching American tourists in Puerto Rico: "Beasts of obesity. Asses that wouldn't feel an arrow. The great whites. Probably the most dangerous creatures on earth." And, watching Amber Heard's character for the first time as she and Aaron Eckhart have sex in the ocean (they are the corrupt ofays he's investigating), he acknowledges with comic simplicity how well he understands his poor impulse control: "Why did she have to happen?"The movie drags a bit, especially when the obligatory blond swimsuit model, Amber Heard (a rather interesting young actress-- an atheistic and bisexual Texan), is on screen because her character proves to be nothing but window dressing. But little else disappointed me. (If I knew that they left so much as a minute of Jenkins on the cutting room floor, I'd be homicidal; but I don't, so I'm not.) "Rum Diary" has comedy, morality, and enough realism to seal the deal. The dialog itself, knowing and literate and performed by Depp as his decade-long friend Thompson, deliver at least a shadow of the soul of Hunter Thompson. And the ending, which many found insufficiently climactic, was just right, in my view. Kemp/Thompson had his career forged in the heat of Caribbean corruption, and was sailing back to America, ready for both the bottle and the battle.</fullReview>

Although its is not a political movies it does show the features Also the presence of Aaron Eckhart, Giovani Ribisi and Amber Heard was very good casting. Aaron Eckhart always being able to charm and make evil look good as he did in many movies including Thank You For Smoking. Giovani Ribisi's performance was also great taking the role of a drunk who is wasted all the time and Amber Heard who played the role of a seductive, glamorous women very well.In conclusion the movie is good, worth your time, again not the best but definitely not the worst.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like my title suggests, I think this movie had lots to offer, and had the potential to be an amazing film. I'm a massive fan of Johnny Depp, and it was him that drew me to this film. Depp himself was fantastic as the seemingly disgruntled and fish- out-of-water Paul Kemp, and he very cleverly personified Kemp's shift in attitude throughout the film. The litany of supporting cast, including the equally brilliant (but seemingly stuck in the character rut of hidden bad guys) Aaron Eckhart and the stunning Amber Heard served to tie everything together. Also, being an expatriate living in Dubai, I can really empathize and laugh at the money behind the real estate industry.All that said, the movie just needs to BE SHORTER. It dragged on after the 90 minute mark, and I wish Bruce Robinson had taken some more creative liberty with the script and removed some of the more pointless scenes, i.e. the drug scene.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unconventional bad trip with lots of alcohol, drugs and woman in a broken paradise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be honest, this movie is quite empty. It lacks of an addicting or coherent story. The shy romantic intrigue is not convincing or emotional at all. There is a lack of tension in many moments of the movie that has quite a couple of lengths. On the other side, the ending is quite sudden and leaves the viewer on a rather bad note. You won't know what ultimately happens to the characters that have been introduced in the movie apart of the line that the alcoholic and unconventional journalist Paul Kemp will continue writing and telling the world the truth and marry the woman he has met in the movie.Despite all these flaws, I somehow like this movie for its very unusual style. The locations are very colourful, for example during the vivid Carnival celebration. The movie also portrays a critical view of the poverty in Puerto Rico, the clash between lazy and corrupt American businessman and tourists and the aggressive and desperate local population as journalist Kemp and his mate Sala get in a fight with the local population and the police in a cheap restaurant. Some characters are quite weird and ultimately interesting for that single reason as the deadbeat alcoholic journalist Moberg who's always trying out new drugs, thinks he has only one week left to live and listens to Adolf Hitler's speeches on vinyl. The movie has many hilarious slapstick moments and a couple of surprising scenes when Kemp and Sala try to save the latter's car or what is left of it.That's why ultimately feel torn apart concerning this flick. It's definitely quite artistic and has a certain unconventional charm that feels like a fresh breath of air in Hollywood. The whole thing feels like a humorous and not very well structured bad trip. The story is quite redundant and the ending a big letdown. I actually enjoyed watching it but would not purchase a copy of this movie or watch it twice. I'm torn apart if I should give this six or seven points but as it's a quite unusual experience, I slightly tend to the more favourable rating in the end. People that like humorous bad trip movies or the acting of Johnny Depp and Giovanni Ribsi should though check it out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Johnny Depp is one of the planet's biggest and best actors. And normally when he does a role, he has a reason. And you can pretty much assume, if you know him well enough, that he did The Rum Diary in honor of Hunter S. Thompson, his former roommate and friend who committed suicide years ago. Depp previously starred in a classic called Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, which revolved around two drug addicted friends, basically, just doing drugs.Also, i'm sure you can see why he did Rango. The Rum Diary is the latest film he did, despite his cameos in Hugo and Jack and Jill, and nobody went to see it. Why? Depp is in it. Fear and Loathing was popular. Was it because they were too used to seeing him playing a weirdo? America takes Depp for granted: If he plays Jack Sparrow, everyone will go. If he plays a murderous barber, not that many will go. Depp is a revelation, and such a great actor, that I can sit through anything he's in.Most likely a passion project, Depp plays Paul, a journalist who travels to Puerto Rico for a new job. While there, he gets caught up with a land tycoon (Aaron Eckart) and his sexy fiancé (Amber Heard) and digs a hole he may not be able to get out of.The Rum Diary takes on a new topic: Drinking. What I like about Thompson's stories is that there was never any morels. Paul could've been completely hammered (he was, judging from the opening scene) and he never learned anything. The Rum Diary is an occasionally hilarious, but overall enjoyable film, even if it does slightly drag on. I was a little disappointed by the lack of drugs.What made Fear and Loathing such a great movie is just how out there it was. The Rum Diary improves on that film in the sense of story, but it's missing the craziness that Fear and Loathing lived for. But there was one moment that I basically waited for the whole film, and didn't disappoint. It also stays true to Gonzo's basic storytelling, nearly every word that comes out of everyone's mouthes is pure Gonzo. I say see it.B</fullReview>

Thompson (which is based loosely upon Hunter's life), and starring his close friend, Johnny Depp, would be offbeat, maybe even weird, and include drugs and massive amounts of alcohol. You would be correct.While this fare will not appeal to many, it succeeds on a level that melds the outrageous with the sardonically funny . . . not unlike watching a near train wreck. I found myself alternating between holding my breath and laughing out loud.The acting is excellent, Ribisi continues to push his resume envelope, Amber Heard is a knockout in every scene, Aaron Eckhart is the handsome heavy, and Rispoli often challenges Depp in the more-weird category.Now available on DVD and (pay) cable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Where the Buffalo Roam" and "The Rum Diary"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Sixties were an era of extreme reality. I miss the smell of tear gas." - Hunter S. Thompson Hunter S. Thompson came to prominence in the 1960s, when he wrote about his experiences as an embedded journalist within the Hell's Angels motorcycle gang. He then reported on various national election campaigns and began to popularise a form of "Gonzo" journalism. Part journalism, part memoir and always written in the first person, Thompson's style of Gonzo typically mixed observations, emotions and facts with wild exaggerations and bizarre humour. "Some people will say," Thompson said, "that words like 'scum' and 'rotten' are wrong for Objective Journalism, which is true, but they miss the point. It was the built-in blind spots of the Objective rules and dogma that allowed Nixon to slither into the White House in the first place." In blurring the lines between fiction and nonfiction, Thompson thus sought to convey a deeper truth. To shake up the status quo. Objective journalism, he believed, controlled by mega-corps, interest groups and which hid a firm political stance behind a guise of apoliticism and neutrality, "is one of the main reasons," he said, "that American politics has been allowed to be so corrupt for so long."Unsurprisingly, Thompson was influenced by the anti-establishment prose of Beat writers; he was hostile to the powers that be and viewed them all as the populace's enemy. In 1968 he'd witness the infamous police brutality beatings outside Chicago's Democratic Convention. Disillusioned, he'd start seeing even the Democrats as an arm of imperialism and violent repression, both at home and abroad. "The Democratic Party has never recovered from that convention," he wrote. "It is a wound that still festers." In 1970 Thompson would run for sheriff in Aspen, Colorado. Here he passionately campaigned for the legalisation of drugs, though all the while his pen continued to spit scorn at public figures, presidents and politicians. "How low do you have to stoop in this country to be president?" he wrote of Nixon, a man he'd routinely describe as a murderer, pig and idiot.Slowly, however, Thompson would grow disillusioned. Spotting the right-wing trajectory of all US parties, he became more and more convinced of his own irrelevance. He turned to drugs and alcohol, became increasingly demoralised and attempted to hide from an American political reality he found increasingly ugly. "He was impassioned to make the system work, and make the system good," his first wife would say, but it's precisely the mistaken and futile belief that the "system" could "work" and be made "good" that contributed to Thompson's demise. He'd commit suicide in 2005, shooting himself one month after George W. Bush's second inauguration. His suicide note read: "No More Games. No More Bombs. No More Walking. No More Fun. No More Swimming. 67. That is 17 more years than I needed or wanted. Relax. This won't hurt." Released in 1980, "Where the Buffalo Roam" is a semi-biographical comedy. Drawing from several of Thompson's works ("Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail", "The Great Shark Hunt", "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" etc), the film stars Bill Murray as Thompson. Murray perfectly mimics Thompson's distinct mannerisms and style of speech, and the film is fittingly wild, anarchic, undisciplined and irreverent, but director Art Linson is too much of a novice to make things work. The film plays like a bad Altman movie.Still, "Buffalo" captures a certain spirit. It's a David vs Goliath battle, albeit one in which David, like the buffalo, seems doomed to extinction. Perhaps the film's best sequence takes place in a courtroom, where we see early signs of later Anti-Drug Abuse Acts. Some of the more overtly racist pieces of legislation, such acts routinely lead to the handing out of 5 year sentences to those in possession of 5 grams of crack cocaine. In order to spend the same 5 years for possession of powder cocaine, though, you'd need to be caught with 500 grams. Why this 100:1 discrepancy? Because expensive powdered cocaine is the drug of choice for upper-middle class suburban whites and white-collar bankers. Crack, meanwhile, is all black baby. In other words, the scales are calibrated to persecute based on race and socio-economic status. There are two sets of rules, one for those with power and social capital, and one for the rest. We see this even today, with cases spiralling around figures like Bradley Manning or even Aaron Swartz, the guy who committed suicide when faced with 35 years in prison for downloading academic articles, a crime apparently worse than any law breaking Wall Street CEO, Blackwater executive or corrupt politician. Dissent is tolerated up to a point, but once you trespasses upon the sacred turf of corporate profits and military power, then action must be taken.Better than "Buffalo" but less interesting and more conventional is "The Rum Diary", which stars Johnny Depp as Thompson. Set in Puerto Rico, its another David vs Goliath story, Thompson and his band of oddball outsiders waging wars against criminal-capitalist cartels, indifferent civilians, standing up for the little guy, and attempting to turn a sell-out newspaper into a weapon of righteousness. Significantly, Thompson and his fellow prose warriors are either drunk, stoned or outright insane. They live physically in one period of time and mentally in another, ahead of their time and therefore incompatible with it. Directed by Bruce Robinson, the film's beautifully noirish, sexy and structured as an old, classic noir mystery, though such a cosy and familiar tone is perhaps unbefitting of Thompson.Strangely, both "Buffalo" and "Diary" end on a note of optimism. They pine for days before today's moribund liberalism. Terry Gilliam's "Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas", in contrast, is explicitly about defeat, his Thompson reduced to just another hedonistic consumer.8.5/10 - Worth one viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's nothing Gonzo about this slapstick romcom</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Along with his Beat generation forbear Jack Kerouac, Hunter S Thompson is one of the most beloved and fetishised figures of the American counter-culture. He is rightfully remembered as the father of Gonzo journalism and a significant prose stylist. Yet all too often Thompson is enshrined purely for his alternative lifestyle.While he was a life-long experimenter with drugs, and firmly opposed Nixon's anti-narcotic propaganda, Thompson also critiqued the 1960s psychedelic movement's misplaced belief in the transcendent power of hallucinogenics. His most famous work, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, is as much a mournful reflection on the counter-culture's failings as it is a roller-coaster ride through the drug-addled mind. Nevertheless, along with the likes of Timothy Leary and Allen Ginsberg, Thompson has been appropriated as an icon of decadent drug-fuelled rebellion.Terry Gilliam's 1998 fun and faithful retelling of Fear and Loathing has cemented the figure of Thompson into our cultural consciousness. Yet, as enjoyable as it was, the film heavily indulged the depraved image we have of the man. The Rum Diary, a new adaptation of one of Thompson's early prose experiments, attempts to deflect his cool image and reassert him as a valiant figure who railed against the muddy American morals of his time.The film tells the story of struggling novelist and alcoholic Paul Kemp (Johnny Depp), who gets a job at a Puerto Rican newspaper, the San Juan Star, writing horoscopes and covering bowling championships. Read primarily by ignorant holidaying Yanks, the newspaper purposefully rejects any content about the great social injustice which takes place outside of the holiday resorts. At first content to lay low and drink rum with his fellow degenerate writers, Kemp suddenly stumbles upon a horrifying story and decides to defy his editors in order to speak the truth.Although director Bruce Robinson sets out with the best of intentions, The Rum Diary manages to obliterate any trace of Thompson's idiosyncratic style, by turning his novel into a glossy hybrid of a buddy movie and a romantic comedy. For a considerable amount of the film, Kemp is either getting into slapstick drunken scrapes with his chubby sidekick Bob Sala (Michael Rispoli), or lusting after saucy love interest Chenault (Amber Heard). These scenes rob us of any real insight into Thompson's early artistic development, and the film ends up resembling a slightly more sinister version of The Hangover.On occasion the focus drifts back to Kemp's fight for journalistic truth, but this comes off as rather corny and sits awkwardly alongside the film's goofier set pieces. At points, Kemp starts philosophising about the moral bankruptcy of Nixon or the poverty in the villages of Puerto Rico, but soon he is launched into yet another zany scene.A friend and disciple of Thompson, Depp lived with the writer in preparation for his starring role in Fear and Loathing. As with Raoul Duke in that film, Kemp in The Rum Diary is a fictionalised version of Thompson. Here, Depp offers a similarly off-beat, yet affecting performance. Indeed the scenes in which Depp is given some space, away from the cheap gags, to channel his old friend are particularly captivating. However, while his informed Thompson impression brings some measure of validity, it only highlights the film's failure to bring the novel to anything but fitful life.Following the success of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Thompson felt incredible pressure to live up to the persona he had created for himself. He would often say that, when asked to give interviews or public lectures, he was unsure whether the people wanted to see Thompson or Duke. Now, 40 years after Fear and Loathing was published, Thompson continues to be thought of as a hedonistic caricature.While The Rum Diary attempts to challenge this image and reclaim the man from the legend, it only recasts Thompson as the romantic underdog in an inane comedic drama.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing and dull.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The unfortunate thing about Hunter S. Thompson adaptations is that his novels were simply not meant to be movies. There are a great many things you can get away with in writing that won't translate to film, even in the care of the most brilliant and enthusiastic directors and actors available. So the director faces a difficult conundrum before the film is even shot; do you gut the source material in order to make a good film, or do you stay true to the novel and risk turning it into an incoherent disaster? There's very little middle ground here. Unfortunately, The Rum Diary chooses to remain as true to the original as possible, and predictably fails as a movie. It has a few funny moments and a few interesting lines... and that's about it. The plot is shallow, as are the characters. You never reach a point where you feel fully invested in the story or the protagonists; they're all just people doing things. The 'bad guys' are bad essentially because we're told they are, and ditto the 'good guys'. The audience is never given any opportunity to really draw their own conclusions; the rich dude who wants to open a hotel is 'bad', and the drunk journalists and natives are 'good'. I was never really clear on any of the reasons though, although Johnny Depp's character seemed to be pretty sure of it. It comes off as lazy storytelling, but really it's because the director didn't want to take liberties with the book.The cast did a good enough job with the material; Depp always does good work, and the supporting actors were up to the task as well. Although Amber Heard was out of place in the ensemble; the only reason she gets any work whatsoever is because of her apparent eagerness to walk around naked on camera. Not that there's anything wrong with that of course (ahem), but her looks exceed her acting ability by a factor of ten. Honestly, I didn't enjoy the film very much at all. I tried to get into it in the first half, but after an hour it had completely lost me. I would only recommend it to die-hard Hunter S. Thompson fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mildly Funny Adaptation of Thompson's Early Work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never been more than a casual fan of Hunter S. Thompson. I've read "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" and I began reading about his account of the time he'd spent with the Hell's Angels, but that's the extent of it. The most I've seen of Thompson come from movies based on his material and the special features that give us a glimpse at the man behind the tales. I'm mentioning this so that those reading my comments here in an effort to decide whether the movie is worth watching will know that I'm not a hardcore fan and I haven't read the novel on which the movie was based. When I sat down to watch THE RUM DIARY, it was purely as an audience member with a passable knowledge of Hunter S. Thompson. So was it a great movie? The answer is a resounding "meh". It's not a bad movie, but it never much rises above passing entertainment that will probably fade from your memory within hours of watching it. Based on the semi-autobiographical novel from Thompson, the movie follows Paul Kemp, an author who hasn't published a single book and moves down to San Juan to join it's failing newspaper for a change. A borderline alcoholic, Kemp immediately fits in with the burnt out employees of the floundering publisher in a town that appears to run on rum. Seeing his potential, local businessman Sanderson approaches Kemp to join him in a hotel investment deal but Kemp spies the opportunity to say his piece on the commercialization of the former island paradise.I know it's been mentioned countless times by this point but I feel that I should remind people considering watching this movie for the first time that they should not expect another FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS. This is a pre-60's Thompson, before the drugs and constant psychedelics. With the exception of an out-of-place scene in the middle of the film where Kemp and his friend/photojournalist Sala acquire some LSD, this isn't the Thompson you're looking for. He's drunk, sure. 450-proof rum will do that to you. But this isn't a head-trip film. It's a pretty straightforward comedy/drama where Kemp finds himself involved with rich men and decides he wants to expose them as the animals they are. The movie gives an interesting glimpse into the early days as Thompson as he developed his gonzo journalism. The problem with the movie, for me, is that it feels confused as to what it's actually about. For the first act of the movie, it feels as if the movie will focus on Kemp's time with the San Juan Star and his time at the failing paper. Then it shifts gears and Kemp's dealings with Sanderson become the focus for a while before it shifts again and the final act of the movie meanders along until the end credits take over. The movie as a whole doesn't feel coherent and the focus feels like it's all over the place. Fun movie? Fun enough. But an engaging story? Again, meh.The blame for the movie's mediocrity doesn't lie in the casting, that much I can attest to. It's well known that Johnny Depp was a good friend of Thompson before his death and, if anyone can give an ideal performance of the man, it's Depp. There's hints of Raoul Duke in Depp's performance but it's subdued. Depp's performance is great but the real attention-stealer in the movie is Giovanni Ribisi in a minor supporting role as Moberg, the paper's crime and religious affairs "correspondent". Moburg is permanently fried from the vast quantities of rum he's imbibed since arriving in Puerto Rico and his hobbies include listening to his old Hitler speech vinyls and visiting the local voodoo priestess. The man is a total riot in every scene and, when combined with some qualities of Sala (Michael Rispoli), you almost see similarities with Dr. Gonzo. The rest of the cast is filled out with some great performances from Aaron Eckhart, Richard Jenkins, and the beautiful Amber Heard. Still, it's not enough to make this movie anything more than a passing interest. Those who aren't familiar with Thompson's exploits probably won't give it a second glance. The movie has some good laughs as Kemp and his associates engage in their drunken adventure but the movie just didn't flow well and I never knew what the end goal was meant to be. Maybe it's just that Thompson's original novel wasn't really prime for a film adaptation, but I don't see it being anything more than mild entertainment for a lazy afternoon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor story telling, and an even poorer plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is about an alcoholic journalist who takes up a job with a failing newspaper in Puerto Rico.The first scenes of Johnny Depp in the hotel room and in the job interview are funny and entertaining, but quickly turns downhill and do not recover. It shows unsympathetic characters drinking alcohol non-stop. the tension between Sanderson and Kemp is inadequately detailed, while too much emphasis is placed on the character's irresponsibly hedonistic lifestyle. The pace is slow and simply does not ignite any interest for the viewers. By the middle of the film, I have lost all interest already.The story telling is so poor. The plot is told in an unclear manner. For example, does Sanderson stop his deal with Sanderson because Kemp brings Sala to the deal? Does Kemp expose the so called property scam because of his integrity, or just for revenge to Sanderson for calling off the deal? The film tries to make Kemp so righteous, but this is not in keeping with the way he acts in the rest of the film."The Rum Diary" is a misfired attempt on mixing drama and comedy. It makes me wonder what exactly the point of this film is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never seems as funny as it should be, or as enjoyable as it could be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After being fired from his job at Time magazine, the late Hunter S. Thompson applied for a job at The San Juan Star newspaper, a job which he did not get. Bruce Robinson's The Rum Diary is one man's interpretation of what might have happened if Thompson received that job. The result is a mixed bag, motivated by great performances, but halted by a hokey mix of vignettes.Hunter S. Thompson was one of the most admired journalists in the business, coining the term "gonzo journalism." Gonzo journalism is defined as one man's personal experiences, where style, wording, sarcasm, and narratives are compiled together to create an article on an issue. I do not use that style of journalism, obviously, but I certainly can admire it. Much like how I admire Thompson, for being daring, courageous, brave, and his own soul. He's one of my "loose role-models," one I don't follow religiously, but always have looked onto with an eye of satisfaction. He's a divine character, who always seemed to play with people's heads in a unique, respectable way.And now, here's The Rum Diary, based on Thompson's novel, written in the 1960's, and finally published in 1998. In Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Depp played Thompson when he was strung out on drugs and insanity. Here, Depp plays Paul Kemp, who channels Thompson's calmer, more controlled side. Kemp is a journalistic drifter who sets up shop in Puerto Rico, where he works for The San Juan Star newspaper writing horoscopes.Kemp begins to drink. A lot. Hundreds of miniatures, glasses of wine, rum, beer are consumed. He is a smoker, but this he didn't discover drugs at this point, so that makes Fear and Loathing a prequel. It also isn't long before he forms a mutual liking for a woman named Chenault (Heard). Chenault is married to Sanderson (Eckhart), a businessman trying to lure Kemp away from his job at the newspaper to use him for his own plans.In the meantime, there's Bob Sala (Rispoli), another alcoholic journalist, whom agrees to let Kemp live with him in his rundown flat, also inhabited by the annoying and unpredictable Moberg (Ribisi). Kemp and Sala enjoy a number of antics, some producing a few laugh-out-loud moments, others sneaking by without a chuckle. Again, this is a movie where the characters invent the plot. They aren't faced with one.There never seems to be any conflict or moral in the story when it seems like there should be. Sure, one could say that Kemp is in a bind, deciding between the loyalty to The San Juan Star or going along with Sanderson's plan, but that is too subtle and overlooked to be the main conflict. If it is, it's pretty lukewarm and underdeveloped. The film, also, becomes way too sidetracked with directionless instances with the supporting characters. I'd like to say that I was not only giving character traits to Moberg earlier, but I was reciting my personal feelings for him at the same time. Man, talk about an unwanted character. He isn't funny and every time he shows up on screen, he almost derails the current scene or steers it into a cinematic pothole.Depp is wonderful and clearly has a lot of respect for Thompson and his career, but this is the second time a film based on Hunter S. Thompson's antics has been made, and the second time one has proved to be a point of critical indecisiveness and a financial disappointment. Many fans have expressed dismay to the novel's adaptation on screen, and even though not having read the novel, I can see the immediate challenge of putting a story about another man's journey through hysteria and alcohol on screen, and doing it in a broad, mainstream way is even harder. The Rum Diary never seems as funny as it should be, or as enjoyable as it could be. It's basically a minor step up from hearing one's journeys you didn't experience. It's only funny if you've been in a similar situation, or have endured the same one being discussed.Starring: Johnny Depp, Aaron Eckhart, Michael Rispoli, Amber Heard, Richard Jenkins, and Giovanni Ribisi. Directed by: Bruce Robinson.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You have Johnny Depp in high quirkiness. A gorgeous woman in Amber Heard. A film devoted to the late journalist Hunter S. Thompson, who died in 2005. The story is set in the 1950s; Paul Kemp(Depp)is a New York journalist and yet successful novelist that is tired of the humdrum life he is living. Kemp decides to go to Puerto Rico, where he takes a job with a political, but unmotivated rag of a newspaper. The editor(Richard Jenkins), a booze-hound much like Kemp, assigns him the horoscope column and random tourist reports. Paul ends up rooming with an aging reporter, Sala(Michael Rispoli),who is definitely edging the end of his career. Paul sees both those that live in luxury and those that endure poverty and actually ends up making a business deal with a shifty businessman named Sanderson(Aaron Eckhart)and falls in love with his beautiful fiancé Chenault(Heard). It doesn't take long for the shaky business deal to spoil and the newspaper to hit the skids. Kemp leaves Puerto Rico a more experienced man. There is some awesome scenery, but a story line that won't appeal to all. Right before you start giving up on this movie...enters Miss Heard; a damn good reason to stick around. Also in the cast: Giovanni Ribisi, Julian Hollaway, Marshall Bell and Bill Smitrovich.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Little Bit of "Rum" Goes a Long WayMany of Hunter S. Thompson's books are gonzo journalism gold, from "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" to "Hells Angels". This latest film adaptation focuses on Thompson's early work. "The Rum Diary" explores some of Thompson's early exploits as a young journalist at a ramshackle newspaper in Porto Rico during the 1950's.The main character in the film is Thompson alias, Paul Kemp. As an avid fan of Thompson's work, Johnny Depp eagerly signed up to portray another variation of Thompson. He plays Kemp with the same slick monotone voice he used to portray Raul Duke in "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas", minus the cigarette holder. Like "Fear and Loathing", we see little character development from anyone in the picture. The film is a variety of beautiful booze soaked set pieces. Kemps exploits are entertaining but feel like mere diversions.The pace slows as we learn of a real-estate plot headed by a tycoon named Sanderson, played with pompous glee by Aaron Eckhart. Kemps floats along as a ploy of this plot. When he finally decides to step up, the audience feels hung-over from all his long winded shenanigans. Kemps tryst with Sanderson's girlfriend (Amber Heard) is the most interesting part of the film but is also very slowly developed and suffers from the films pacing. While "The Rum Diary" is a much more watchable film than "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas", it lacks the bits of greatness that can be found in "Fear and Loathing". The film takes its breezy time working a story that never really develops. By the time the credits role, the eyes of the audience are as bloodshot as Kemps, unless that really is conjunctivitis.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Rum Diary is too sober</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Film adaptations are tough. Adapting a Hunter Thompson book is even more so. I haven't read the book so can't say how much it stays true to it but something tells me that the story has been tinkered upon to fit the Hollywood mold. Last 20 minutes of the film is a total let down. Before I get to that:The film has some amazing moments. Johnny Depp is completely in his element, blurting out insightful dialogue with total nonchalance in a way that makes those thoughts even more hard hitting. Besides, it's a relief to see him without a pirate/period barber/fantasy freak costume. The sets, locations, costumes, characters.. everything reeks of decay and that helps you enter the Hunter Thompson world instantly. Thompson wrote this book during the start of his career a phase when he was either getting fired for stupid reasons or trying out exotic substances, in short, he was stumbling through life. Much of this movie is in the same vein and that's refreshing to watch. It's a pace which allows you to breathe and take it all in. It makes you not care about where the story is going, you just want to be there in the moment. The restaurant sequence where Sala refuses to budge without having his steak and end up running for his dear life was the best of the movie. Few movies nowadays dare to take that pace because they are scared senseless that the audience will run away before the next action sequence.The restaurant sequence and many such lackadaisical digressions demonstrate that Kemp (much like Thompson in his early days) was willing to go where fate takes him rather than worrying about how he's going to change the world. Yes there was this desire to find his voice, 'I've got no voice. I don't know how to write like me', he goes. But going from a degenerate journalist to a man on a mission to save nature before you could say 'Gonzo' was too much to digest. Add a forced love story to the mix and it's a buzz-kill. And the closing line which says 'end of one story is the beginning of another' is just the kind of spoon-feeding many don't need. This is a story written by a man who bent all rules in the sacred book of journalism, Depp and Co. could have bent some too by refusing to force a meaning in the madness we called Thompson.www.AbhishekBhatt.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will start by stating it's not Fear and Loathing homage and sadly has nothing in common. I am not HST fan and mostly not familiar with his writing so i can relate to the movie from the..well movie point of view. The location and the 50's spirit is about the only two good things you can find in the film. the most amazing scenery and the attention to the little details really throw you back to the 50's and there is something really addictive in it for some reason which, in my point of view, what kept me seating and watching it to the end. The story line / editing is not well connected, sometimes it seem as if some scans couldn't fit anywhere else so they were forced into certain points just to say they are there(The Shower, the boat after the carnival,the drugs.. and some more). As for the comedy aspect of it, it seem you need to be really intoxicated (Rum anybody ?!) in order to find the comedic spots, they simply don't work or ,again, are in the wrong places. The main supporting actor ("Sala" by Michael Rispoli) isn't contributing anything to the main figure (Depp) which himself does not deliver, even to a Depp fan like myself. Watch the film only if: 1 - you miss the 50's. 2 - You like nice cars. 3 - you have nothing better to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Rum Diary begins well, but eventually veers off into a dull disappointment. Giovanni Ribisi as Moburg is probably the sole highpoint of this film. Johnny Depp's portrayal of Hunter S. Thompon's semi-autobiographical protagonist, Paul Kemp, is just a flatter, less intriguing, rendition of his Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas counterpart. If you are expecting anything like Terry Gilliam's masterpiece you will be gravely dissatisfied. Bruce Robinson's directing lacks the intensity and passion, which is omnipresent in Thompson's writing. However, as many will agree, the film adaptation always palls in comparison to the novel, so Robinson is not entirely at fault.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hunter S. Thompson manuscript written in 1961, published in 1998 at the suggestion of his good friend, Johnny Depp. During a night of drinking, a pact was made to publish the manuscript and make the movie. Sadly, Thompson took his own life in 2005. Easy to understand why Depp felt the need to honour his friend, 'and see The Rum Diary made as the author intended'. There would be no more 3:00 am drunk, rambling calls made to Depp's home. You may recall another film they put together, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. This story of journalist Paul Kemp( Johnny Depp ), who escapes New York for Puerto Rico to work at The Daily News, a corrupt English speaking paper. Employees all drunk to varying degrees. This newspaper does not report on the deplorable conditions of the Puerto Rican population, but rather on human interest articles for American tourists. Wealthy American businessman, Sanderson (Aaron Eckhart) threatens to develop, destroy, swindle Puerto Ricans. ( Forward thinking by Thompson, he wrote this in 1961.) Thank goodness Kemp and Sanderson do not share the same values regarding this hotel development scheme, but they share something more personal..... the beautiful woman Chenault ( Amber Heard ). Voodoo magic, cock fights, hallucinogenic drugs and a lot of rum keep the story moving, there are some funny scenes. Dull overcast cinematography should have been addressed, as well as underdeveloped characters. A good movie, which could have been even better.</fullReview>

As for Amer Heard, the less screen time she gets the better. It's beyond me why she has been cast in the first place. It's obvious her talent lies with another movie genre with a more visual focus and very little dialogues. A most disappointing experience.

		<shortDescription>A tedious and uninteresting experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas employed an exuberant style and surrealistic images in order to capture the prose from novelist and reporter Hunter S. Thompson (1937-2005), interpreted by Johnny Depp with a febrile energy. The result was one of the most hypnotic film experiences I have ever had. That's why my expectations before watching The Rum Diary were excessively high, and in retrospective, it was a mistake to expect "Fear and Loathing 2: Puerto Rico". Instead of that, The Rum Diary is some kind of tedious prequel in which we meet Thompson (or at least his alter-ego "Paul Kemp") during his first days as a reporter on a strange land, immersing into his vices and trying to use his literary voice with a humanitarian objective...if the drunkenness and the girls leave him enough time.I haven't read the homonym novel on which The Rum Diary is based, but I have read enough material from Thompson in order to know that, in effect, what he writes tends to be diffuse and entangled. In that aspect, the same thing is reflected on The Rum Diary, because the screenplay drifts for long whiles, dividing its attention between unconnected scenes and unnecessary sub-plots. However, Thompson's prose was enough colorful in order to invite us to keep reading; but that aspect is lost in this film, so The Rum Diary immediately degenerates into a boring parade of scenes lacking of any interest or energy. Depp brings a solid performance in this film, but that's not enough to rescue it from the tedium.So, I can't recommend The Rum Diary. As a comedy, it isn't funny; as a romance, it lacks of any credibility; and as a "tropical thriller" (to call it on some way), it lacks of any suspense, coherence or a structure to exploit the struggle made by the rebel reporter against the corrupt businessman. And as a biopic, I didn't find enough introspection into Thompson's (I'm sorry, "Kemp"'s) personality in order to leave the cinema with a better understanding about this controversial writer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Rum DairyIt's guaranteed any diary kept by Rum is bound to include intimate details on its relationship with Coke and lime.And while this dramedy doesn't dish on which accoutrement made the best lover, it does divulge how Rum only leads to trouble.As a last resort, a codependent correspondent, Kemp (Johnny Depp), takes a post writing for a newspaper in Puerto Rico.His presence immediately attracts local entrepreneur Sanderson (Aaron Eckhart) who is looking to put a positive spin on his redevelopment of the island.Obliging at first, if only to be near Sanderson's fiancée (Amber Heard), Kemp's disdain for the shady shark forces him to finally take up a position in his prose.Based on Hunter S. Thompson's book, The Rum Diary does have amiable characters and gonzo situations; however, its inattentiveness towards its focus erodes away at both.Besides, who can afford "distilled" alcohol on a journalist's salary?

		<fullReview>To appreciate the quality of this rambling little film that is actually based on an episode in the life of Hunter S. Thompson the following biographical information is helpful: 'Hunter Stockton Thompson (1937 - 2005) was an American journalist and author who wrote The Rum Diary (published in1998), Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1971), Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72 (1973), The Curse of Lono (1983), and Hell's Angels: The Strange and Terrible Saga of the Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs (1966). He is credited as the creator of Gonzo journalism, a style of reporting where reporters involve themselves in the action to such a degree that they become central figures of their stories. He is known also for his lifelong use of alcohol, LSD, mescaline, and cocaine (among other substances); his love of firearms; his inveterate hatred of Richard Nixon; and his iconoclastic contempt for authoritarianism. In 1960 Thompson moved to San Juan, Puerto Rico, to take a job with the sporting magazine El Sportivo, which folded soon after his arrival. Thompson applied for a job with the Puerto Rico English-language daily The San Juan Star, but its managing editor, future novelist William J. Kennedy, turned him down. Nonetheless, the two became friends and after the demise of El Sportivo, Thompson worked as a stringer for the New York Herald Tribune and a few stateside papers on Caribbean issues with Kennedy working as his editor. While suffering a bout of health problems, he committed suicide in 2005 at the age of 67.'In the film version of Thompson's autobiographical book, Paul Kemp (Johnny Depp) is a freelance journalist who finds himself at a critical turning point in his life while writing for a run-down newspaper in the Caribbean under toupeed editor Lotterman (Richard Jenkins). He is accompanied by the staff photographer Sala (Michael Rispoli), the drunken staff writer Moberg (Giovanni Ribisi) in his discovery of the many wonders of Puerto Rico, not the least of which is a group of entrepreneurs lead by Sanderson (Aaron Eckhart) - who happens to be living with the stunning Chenault (Amber Heard) who Paul is attracted to - and a series of disreputable business men bent on 'touristifyng' a neighboring island. Paul is a drunk and finds innumerable distractions and challenges as he tries to worm his way through the playing field of lost souls.The story is Hunter S. Thompson all the way and Bruce Robinson has adapted Thompson's book in much the same way the novelist communicates: Robinson also directs. Depp, as usual, manages to make the strange lead character not only interesting but also ingratiating. The supporting cast is solid. The film gets off track many times, but as pure entertainment it is a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours watching Depp create another memorable character based on life! Grady Harp</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I haven't read the book, but this was sublime...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard about the Rum Diary, I must admit, I did have premonitions of my enjoying it. I am, like many people here and who watched this movie, a big fan of 'Fear and Loathing', so I did expect that this would be a hit. Having said that, I was nervy that this could end up being 'Fear and Loathing' in the Caribbean, but luckily those thoughts were soon dispelled. The Rum Diary is, so alluringly, set against the backdrop of the beautiful island of Puerto Rico. In a non-commercial sense, it should have no problem in sustaining it's identity as simply that, 'a beautiful island'. This is where the dramatic irony of 'The Rum Diary' is instantly and beautifully portrayed; A disgruntled and angry local population and a series of journalists whose aspirations of being well revered have drowned in a sea of rum and whatever else they can get their hands on in this part of a serene archipelago.The characters come together in such a seemingly natural way. At no point whilst watching this did I even feel the slightest bit of disdain for any of the cast, all whom assimilate into their roles very well and let the excellent script portray their characters ultimate purpose. Michael Rispoli and Giovanni Ribisi (massively underrated in my opinion) play the duo of debaucherous newspaper employees who have been on the island too long to continue to have any living sense of the reasons they were there in the first place. Aaron Eckhart plays the suave, property developer who opitimises the persona of the corporate world and potentially the destruction of the island utopia which he calls his home. His girlfriend, Amber Heard, who I would watch this movie time and time again for, simply due to the fact that you will be hard pressed to find a more gorgeous woman grace the screens in any movie theatre over the course of the next year (she plays free-spirited woman trapped in a relationship role so very well too). Then of course, Johnny Depp, who brings his own natural charisma and understated exuberance into the melting pot and fits in perfectly in this entourage as the new journalist, struggling in his career and at last chance saloon. His character clearly has a sense of moral duty which he manages to preserve, even through the litres of rum which are consumed. The desire he has to fight for what he believes in climaxes in the feeling that he really is an inspiring protagonist who can be adored by everyone.Overall, fantastic film, well worth the watch... Maybe it's because I'm a sucker for a paradise island or a sunset but this film is now one of my favourites of all time. Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Transporting experience &amp; good acting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a transporting experience both in time and place. Really captures the atmosphere of a Caribbean island 50 years ago. The experiences of a journalist in Puerto Rico makes an exotic and interesting movie. It's well filmed with good cinematography and locations in the town and on the beach. It's a semi serious movie with some social commentary about poverty exploitation imperialism racism etc but not too much too make it heavy. Some light hearted moments too. It's a movie about experience not violence or very good or bad guys. The alcohol and drug taking by the journalists might be a bit off putting for some so it is a grown up movie. The actors are good. Supporting cast are well suited to their roles and act well. Giovanni Ribisi is convincing as a drunken reporter. Aaron Eckhart is good is a businessman involved in developing the island. Amber Heard is stunning as the love interest. She has a special beauty from Old Hollywood that you don't find much on screen now, the type that one could fall in love with at first sight. It's good to see Johnny Depp without strange disguises and he looks young still - maybe a bit fresh faced for an alcoholic reporter. He does a good job. Overall see it for atmosphere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Rum Diary: Love Letter from One Icon to Another</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you come across someone like Hunter S. Thompson you do either one of two things: allow yourself to be drawn into his hyper-vivid world of words and violent expression or you can run screaming. When Johnny Depp took on the role of Thompson for the epic drug trip Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Depp not only went willingly inside that world, he became its new champion, vowing to carry on the legend after what everyone knew would be the inevitable death of its creator. While Depp hasn't tried to transform himself into Thompson outside the silver screen (thank god, I don't think another human being could ever contain that level of energy) he has attempted at length to let people know who the real man was, the forever beating heart behind the literary lion.The Rum Diary reports the semi-true story of Paul Kemp (Thompson's pseudonym for this tale), a struggling novelist looking for his true voice, mostly in the bottom of various bottles of alcohol. He finds himself in Puerto Rico working for the local paper, The San Juan Star, where the publication was already sounding the death knells, but he tries to make the best of it by making friends with locals and criminals alike. Finding himself embroiled in a land grab scheme and madly in love with another man's fiancée, Kemp fights to keep himself on the right side of his own ethical boundaries. The pressure may have crushed some men, but instead it only crystallizes his purpose in life.There is a message in the film, but before we get to that, let's take a look at the package the message is wrapped in. Most people will remember Depp from his first foray into the mind of Thompson and likely come to the theater expecting more of the same drug-fueled insanity. That would be a dreadful mistake. With only one mildly hallucinogenic scene in the entire film, this is largely a straight forward story, with only a mild level of drunkenness in comparison to Fear and Loathing. While there is an inordinate amount of rum imbibed by nearly every person on screen, the core is really two love stories, one between Thompson and his femme fatale, the other between Thompson and his writing. Depp smoothly portrays the deeper and more thought-provoking side of Thompson, but I imagine many audience members left feeling disappointed by the absence of sheer lunacy which they have come to recognize as Thompson's foremost personality trait. Aaron Eckhart is seamless in his white collar criminal role, pillaging the pristine land of South America for the richest of the rich businessmen, but what is missing is a catharsis or closure to his storyline. By the time he turns, back to the camera and walks away, it lacks any real sense of importance. The other main role goes to Amber Heard (recently seen heading the now defunct TV show, The Playboy Club). She steals Thompson's heart (both on screen and in real life, she went on to become his wife, one of them) but her on-screen counterpart fails to really bring anything to the table except her looks. There was a wild impetuousness which helped frame the character, but it got old as the film ran on.Now that we have firmly stomped some some of the reasons for this not being a wild success, let's look into what is really done well here and where the true heart lies. This is less of a traditional story and more about the formation of a moment in time, the moment where Hunter S. Thompson became the raging, unafraid, unabashed lunatic of the literary world. What you witness on screen is a depiction of the moment when he finds his real purpose, his true voice, and for a fellow writer like myself, this is a awe-inspiring and beautiful thing to see. The character ponders halfway through the film about where he is in his life as a writer, lamenting that he has not learned to write like himself yet. For aspiring writers there are few things more painful and frustrating than that. It is the key to our literary lives and once Thompson found his, he didn't just walk through the door, proud of his accomplishment, nay, he kicked the door off the hinges with a size thirteen and told everyone else in the room (past, present and future) to get the hell out of his way. There were few like him before and I imagine there will be even fewer after.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Acting, Everything else lacked.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The acting was good, actually great, by Depp, Heard, Eckhart, Ribisi, and several of the other characters did a great job. It probably isn't any of their "best" performances (except maybe Ribisi) but the culmination of all of them acting well was pleasing. I saw where someone else started a thread to nominate Ribisi for best supporting actor, I concur. The plot and direction of the movie was horrible. The overall message was understandable, but its an overused message that could have been much more cleverly portrayed.Many of the better parts of this movie are in the trailer. And any movie like that is just a failure.I haven't read the book so I will not be able to judge how well it followed the book, and may be missing some of the important details due to not reading. However, this also means I'm not some biased Hunter S. Thompson fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why is the rum gone?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'THE RUM DIARY': Three Stars (Out of Five) Johnny Depp stars in another film adaptation of a novel from Hunter S. Thompson (after also starring in the 1998 cult classic hit 'FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS'). This one is from a book Thompson wrote in 1961 but didn't get published until 1998 (I've heard with help from buddy Johnny Depp). The book, like it's film adaptation, went through several turnarounds and holdups (with many rejection letters) and Thompson had given up on it until it finally saw publication. The film now finally sees the light of day as well with Depp once again playing a journalist, loosely based on Thompson, this time struggling with alcoholism and depression in Puerto Rico in the 1950's. It was written and directed by Bruce Robinson, who hadn't helmed a film since 1992's 'JENNIFER 8'. The cast also contains the likes of Amber Heard, Aaron Eckhart, Michael Rispoli, Richard Jenkins and Giovanni Ribisi all playing colorful characters inhabiting another Thompson like world. It's not nearly as quirky, funny or creative as 'FEAR AND LOATHING' but it has it's moments. If you're expecting something similar though you're bound to be disappointed.In the film Depp plays Paul Kemp, a journalist recently fired from his job in New York who's also became disillusioned with life and especially America. He travels to Puerto Rico and takes a job at a paper called the San Juan Star, ran by a man named Lotterman (Jenkins). Kemp takes up drinking rum heavily and befriends fellow employees of the paper: Sala (Rispoli) and Moburg (Ribisi). He also falls for a very beautiful but unavailable woman named Chenault (Heard) and becomes involved in unethical business dealings with her fiancé Sanderson (Eckhart). He spends his days drinking, discovering drugs and attempting to remain an honest reporter while dreaming of a better life and continuing to stumble through his daily encounters.The film, like 'FEAR AND LOATHING', is pretty aimless and lacks any real rhyme or reason. Which is fine by me but I just didn't find it interesting or involving at all. Depp gives it his all but I found his character kind of distant and unrelatable. The film also lacked any strong comedy or a great amount of strikingly quirky moments that made 'FEAR AND LOATHING' so memorable (although it has a few of them). To say it's slow paced is an understatement and for the first time in several years I had a really hard time staying awake for the film's entirety. Especially in the film's third act, which rambled on seemingly endlessly to an excruciatingly painful effect. I do admire the film's boldness and uniqueness all the same though and Robinson does a pretty decent job of capturing the right atmosphere. I've heard his script is nothing like the book but I've always supported an artist's right of creative interpretation (which Thompson was also a big supporter of and defended a filmmaker's right to change a film's source material, including his own work). Despite my issues with the film and strong dislike to certain aspects of it I have to acknowledge that it is a well made movie (in some ways) that could very well please the right viewer. It just isn't me.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOH74YX2UKA</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE RUM DIARY: The RUB-BISH diary seems more appropriate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To begin, can someone tell me why was this movie even made ? A wastage of 2 hours. A shining example of how to ruin a nice novel.Coming to the story, well there isn't any story.. No plot, only rum, cigarettes and some paper sheets sum up the movie. There are no words to describe a nothing film. Well, I ll try.Johny Depp comes from NY to Puerto Rico to become an aspiring journalist. He joins one of the newspaper firms that is sinking. One of his colleagues offers him a messy house and they all live in that messy house with no water but with rum/alcohol/cigarettes. The newspaper firm is shut down. HE then meets Sanderson who lures him to write a neat article trying to fool people in pursuit of building a hotel for some 50 houses on a lone island.Chenault is Sanderson's gf who is attracted to Johnny and that blows up his last chance of making money. A cock/hen fight has been shown as a way to earn money and pay off bills/fight against people.Even an actor of the caliber of Johny Depp couldn't save this one. AVOID in caps.PS: I hate the critics/reviewers who gave this movie anything more than 1/2 on 10 .This is the MAIN reason I wanted to write reviews.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Rum Do</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE RUM DIARY is a loose adaptation of Hunter S. Thompson's auto- biographical account of alcoholism and journalism in Puerto Rico, which sees the boozehound hack taking on a dodgy bunch of American capitalists. There's the usual problem with adapting HST books: nothing much happens. Sure, there's the drug fuelled insanity, but if you bother to read closely you realise that most of that is happening in Thompson's head. To a random bystander all you have is a spaced out man goggling aggressively at various authority figures. Hence you get a film where not much happens. The usual HST tropes appear: fat drug buddy, Nixon hating and drug abuse (alcohol here). In true Baby Boomer style the self-centred protagonist gets a fig leaf for his bad behaviour by protecting the 3rd world natives from the inevitable villainous WASPs. There's also plenty of local colour - angry locals, apathetic locals, racist locals, cock-fighting locals - some nice looking beaches, a cursory romance (Amber Heard, a plastic doll) and a few 'wacky' characters who are never as funny as they ought to be. The script isn't good enough, the direction isn't sharp enough and jokes that were funny in the trailer are left abandoned to flounder on their own. Inexcusably, it simply isn't very funny.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rambling film based on a long unpublished Hunter S Thompson novel is just okay. The story of a writer going to Puerto Rico to work on a newspaper and being faced with hypocrisy and corruption, not to mention lots of alcohol plays like a prequel for everything related to Hunter Thompson that follows......and thats the problem this film is kind of like being trapped in an amalgam of every Thompson story you've ever read. Whats worse every character seems not to speak with their own voice but with Thompsons with the result that outside of the few women, it's simply a bunch of differently dressed Thompson clones talking to each other. It grows tiring real fast and even as the plot spins out more and more there is a sameness to it all.Its not bad but it's nothing special either...and a little goes a long way</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. I suppose we are to give Hunter S Thompson the benefit of the doubt. Some of his writings are historically invaluable and models of brilliant writing. I doubt many would include The Rum Diary in that category. Director Bruce Robinson (Jennifer Eight, Withnail and I) does the best he can with enormous help from Thompson's friend and biggest cheerleader, Johnny Depp.The film plays as an autobiography supposing Thompson's character Paul Kemp (Depp) would have been employed in 1960 at the San Juan Puerto Rico STAR, a newspaper run by English speaking Americans trying to report in Spanish speaking land. The editor is Lotterman (Richard Jenkins) who just wants simple human interest stories that the tourists will enjoy. When Kemp arrives, Lotterman asks him what kind of drinker he is. Kemp replies "the high end of social". A greater understatement may never have been uttered. Kemp, and of course, the real life Thompson ingested liquor at a pace and volume greater than a marathoner takes in water.Kemp finds a drinking buddy in Sala (Michael Rispoli) who is the paper's photographer. He is drawn into a shady land development plot by Sanderson (Aaron Eckhart), an American looking to capitalize financially by raping the undeveloped beach front land. He needs the help of Kemp to "sell" the project to investors, tourists and locals. Not surprisingly, Kemp's vision is a bit cloudy and he screws this up while also turning the head of Sanderson's lady, Chenault (Amber Heard).Depp does a standout job as Thompson again (Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas) with his speech pattern and ever present sunglasses. The feel of the 1960's is on display with fashion and autos, but this one just didn't do it for me. I suppose the message from Thompson here is that he did what he always envisioned himself doing ... he went hard after the establishment bad guys and brought them down hard. However, this story rings a bit hollow and there are just too many missing pieces and too many holes.</fullReview>

Sincerely, i never thought i will get so much disappointed by a movie these days. And i also never thought bad movies like this would be allowed to premiere at this latitude of film history.

I know you have to change somethings from a book to a movie, but the only thing this movie shares with the book is the name. If you know nothing about Thompson you might like it, but if your at all a fan of his work you will hate this movie. I'm glad he's not alive to see this garbage that his name was tacked on to. Now the heart seemed to be in the right place, but they left out so many good parts and replaced them with crap. And where was Yeoman? A huge let down for any Thompson fan.

I felt that I watched a drunk Captain Jack Sparrow wander around Puerto Rico for nearly two hours only this time no accent, cool costume or special effects courtesy of Disney. There is almost zero story line to this film and you can forget any character development. Not to say that every film has to be indie it's making and cause you to have an emotional experience, but this film wasn't even entertaining. We basically watch Johnny Depp go from one drunken escapade to the next. I have much respect for many of the well known actors in this film and why they would chose to star in such a film is a question I'll never have an answer to. After an hour and forty five minutes I couldn't stand anymore and had to excuse myself from the theater.

		<fullReview>"Rum Diary" is a retro movie made in the style of all too many films from the early 1970's; the "heroes" are smug, slacker, inconsiderate slobs, but because they talk the talk of peace and love, we are are supposed to overlook their cruelty to individuals and boorish behavior. The kind of movie where the good guys are people that in the real world, you wouldn't want living next to you, or even sitting next to you on a bus or plane. Even with the great Johnny Depp, and a $5.50 seniors' rate ticket , this movie was almost a total yawn. It was so bad,that the ushers requested that we leave our cell phones on.Or at least I wish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very, very disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, I understand that for die-hard Johnny Depp fans, this is probably something they have looked forward to and can enjoy. While I enjoy the actor's performance in general, the movie as a whole is very, very disappointing.It's a little hard to give a proper review on a movie that has, well, no real direction to the very sequential (I wouldn't call it "linear" because it's got too much randomness for it) events occurring in it. If not true to its title, it seems like whoever wrote the script or the book it was based on in a drunken stupor, going from one "adventure" into the next and shambling and swaying through it. There is no real binding plot, no "larger picture" that is interesting enough to be captivating, and it seems tied together with a far-fetched, almost haphazard thread to try and give it some semblance of coherence.As said, the main actor's performance is enjoyable, which is a plus, but otherwise I wouldn't recommend it. A giggle or two, maybe, and suitable for in-flight entertainment or afternoon TV, yes, but not for much if anything else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fear and Loathing Rum Diaries.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rum Diary (2011): Dir: Bruce Robinson / Cast: Johnny Depp, Aaron Eckhart, Michael Rispoli, Amber Heard, Giovanni Ribisi: Based on Hunter S. Thompson's first book, here we have career seen through the lens of alcohol and narcotics. Johnny Depp play journalist Paul Kemp who awakens in Puerto Rico to start a job with a failing magazine. At first he is reduced to stories regarding overweight tourists at bowling alleys but before long he is addressed to draw favor for a scheme involving the building of a hotel on an island off Puerto Rico. This is Depp's second performance as Thompson after portraying him as Raoul Duke in the underrated Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. Here he is drawn out on alcohol where humour plays a part, but he grows suspicious when the poor are degraded and the rich only dominate. Arron Eckhart plays Hal Sanderson, a crooked businessman who seeks Kemp's services. He mistreats the poor but bails Kemp and Sale out when the two land in court after erupting a mob at a restaurant. Michael Rispoli steals his moments as magazine photographer Sale who allows Kemp shelter in his broken down residence. Sale is involved in cock fighting for cash and his push start vehicle becomes one massive sight joke. Giovanni Ribisi also surfaces as a lowlife reporter strutting around dressed in rags. The big disappointment is Amber Heard as Sanderson's girlfriend Chenault who is basically a romantic tease for Kemp, and her behavior renders her less than sympathetic. It is another bizarre observation through the eyes and liquor glass of the great writer himself. Score: 8 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Haven't seen this movie for a while but pulled out my DVD and watched it tonight. What a great film. It is what I like - a film based on story and character, not special effects. It's a crazy drunk fueled journey with a lot of crazy alcohol fueled people. What a story. It's got a protagonist, an sultry blond, crazy support characters, and a real plot and a story in a cool setting. Johnny Depp rules as a quasi alcoholic reporter who hangs out with another crazy alcoholic (Michael Rispoli) and the notorious Moberg. (Giovanni Ribisi). It's fun, it's crazy. You can't make this stuff up. The supporting cast is beautiful all around including Richard Jenkins as the over the top editor (Lotterman). Throw in a bunch of crazy Puerto Ricans and you've got a lot of great character. Some of the scenes are absolutely hilarious. "What are you doing? "I just realized how much I like you?" "What" "What am I doing? Are you kidding? There's something wrong with the axle.!" Great film. Laughed my head off for most of it. Johnny Depp really brings this character to life supported by a really class group of supporting actors. Five stars in my book!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(62%) A solidly made, funny (sometimes very), yet still somewhat rambling, and beneath the surface it's a little hollow. Johnny Depp is fairly well cast in the lead, and uses both his good acting ability and comic timing in equal measure, and with the strong support from the likes of Aaron Eckhart, Richard Jenkins, the greatly underrated Giovanni Ribisi, and an oddly too beautiful Amber Heard all helping to make this a stronger film than the quite limited material has to offer. Despite this being a good twenty minutes or so over-long, it never really fails to either entertain or amuse. Overall a worthy watch, but nothing that really needs to be seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mostly amiable comedy drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bruce Robinson directed the acclaimed cult movie 'Withnail and I'; Johnny Depp starred in the (also celebrated but, in my opinion, virtually unwatchable) film adaptation of Hunter S. Thompson's 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'. The idea that the former should direct the latter in another of Thompson's stories, 'The Rum Diary', is this either inspired or drearily predictable. In fact, it hasn't turned out too badly, a comedy drama with both elements handled reasonably well, although the story lacks real punch, the central character leaves it with a certain sense of moral purpose, but until that point, the plot basically ambles along for incidental entertainment value only. As with 'Fear and Loathing', a brief excerpt from Thompson's own writing is lent to the film to imbue with moral seriousness at the appropriate point (and it's strange that in both movies, moral seriousness is what the reprobate Thompson is quoted to invoke). Interestingly, this was Robinson's first film as a director for 19 years and as a screenwriter for 12; for someone so out of practice, it's not a bad effort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Johnny Depp's Homage to His Friend Hunter S. Thompson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Labor of Love, Johnny Depp's Homage to Offbeat Journalist and Sometime Novelist Hunter S. Thompson is Affectionate, Warm, and at the Same Time Desperate. The Novel was Written Early in Thompson's Career when He First Discovered Alcohol and the Need for Journalistic Integrity (that defined the writer's output).Those Expecting the Hallucinatory Visuals and Bombastic, Outrage of Terry Gilliam's and Johnny Depp's Take on the Author's Most Popular Work, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998) will Most Likely be Disappointed. Critics and Moviegoers Reflected This Resulting in Poor Box Office and Scathing Reviews.The Strength of the Movie are the Words, the Dialog that is Filled with Insights and Rhetorical Rage. Almost Every Scene is Riddled with Entertaining Oratorical Observations. The Look of the Movie can't be Faulted as the Beauty of the Island is Contrasted with the Dehumanizing Poverty. The Cast is Outstanding with Bravura Performances from Michael Siboli, Giovanni Ribisi, and Richard Jenkins. Amber Heard is the Eye Candy. Aaron Eckhart is the Capitalist Villain, a Role that is Not Very Demanding.Overall, it is an Offbeat Movie that Does Not have Wide Appeal. Thompson Struggled for Wide Appeal, While Maintaining His Integrity and Never Quite Got There, at Least Not Until Very Late in Life, as He Gained Respect and Admiration as a Cult Figure. The Wordsmith was Given High Tribute by Depp as He Strove to Get the Unpublished Novel in Print and the Movie Made.It's an Odd Film that Most Likely will Gain in Reputation in the Coming Years when Expectations aren't so Knee-Jerk Concerning the Long Awaited Novel and Movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fear and Loathing in San Juan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had been thinking of Hunter S. Thompson intermittently throughout this film, but told myself it was just because Johnny Depp had been in "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas". I don't like reading fiction so I was blissfully unaware that this was actually a Hunter S. Thompson novel until I checked the WWW afterwards. Should've been obvious with the constant drinking, smoking, the drug element, and the general sense of amoral people bumbling through a shameful comedy of extremes.So fair play to them for bringing this to the screen - Hunter S. Thompson was a very interesting character. That said, on a purely personal level, I didn't care for any of the central characters in this story - choose from a moralistically gymnastic ingrate, a narcissistic wannabe mover n' shaker, a big-hearted but dense sidekick, a deeply confused alcoholic tramp, a parasitic whore ... not people I'd want to bump into if I visited Peurto Rico anyway. But I'm probably missing the point here given the context of the story. I'd guess(and it is only a guess) that he was trying to reflect some of the characters he'd mingled with during his time there, the brash and naive exportation of all things American to a foreign land(that's been screwed over so many times by your country that you ought to approach the situation with some measure of respect or at least delicacy), and the subtle forces in play that pull the strings and maintain the inequity.Whatever his inspiration though, given the set of available characters and events, what you end up with is a booze-soaked stumble through the grotty interpersonal relations and business dealings of the main protagonists. It didn't do a hell of lot for me. I give it points for realism - i.e. not the predictable Hollywood ending where the good guys sock it to the bad guys and order is restored to the universe. Overall though, I simply didn't enjoy the story much.Oh one notable highlight was a love making scene that was spectacularly pole-axed by one of Hitler's speeches playing on the record player in the background. Nice touch.Story aside, I liked the look of the film - it definitely conjured a certain older style and flavour - possibly what Puerto Rico was like around 1960, I don't know I wasn't there, but definitely something.The acting is decent enough - I like Aaron Eckhart and Giovanni Ribisi. The fat sidekick was pretty good too and I guess the girl was OK though she had a vacuous part. I should probably say Depp was good but he seems to pull the same stuff out of the bag of tricks in so many films, it's hard to tell if he's really acting any more.Would I recommend this? Probably not in all honesty, unless you've got nothing else good on your list.Oh and as a fairly esoteric footnote, definitely do not watch this if you're trying to give up smoking or drinking! Yup - I'm an idiot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As the publicity says , nothing in the movie is in moderation-- especially the drinking......There's plenty of boozing boozing and more boozing.........And there's drunks raising hell everywhere and not paying their drinking bills.....There's even a shot of drunks filling their mouths with alcohol and then spitting it out forcefully on a lighter to create a ball of fire coming from the mouth..........And getting hauled up in courtroom for that..........Only to vomit in front of the judge !!And there plenty of fast cars and one even faster woman......Yeah , the woman.....A red hot blonde who smoulders fire from head to toe..........And she lights up every scene she walks in.....Dancing with free abandon in parties.....Taking her clothes off for men.....They call her Chenault in the film .Hell ,there's even Adolf Hitler's voice bellowing as a old gramophone player suddenly cranks up....Ooops !! I forgot to add the cockfights adding to the entertainment....Everything for everyone....For a person who does not drink much like me , watching chinaal( )...err...Chenault itself was worth it.....But for those who get a high just watching others drink and raise hell.....well ,this is the movie for them.....And what about the story ??Well , Johnny Depp is a journo who lands in Puerto Rico in the 1950s and amidst all the boozing ,uncovers a scam there....But the story leads nowhere and the ending is disappointing.....Verdict--If you are not bothered about the disappointing ending , then its good for some laughs .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While this is again based on Hunter S. Thompson (a novel of his), do not expect this to be as mad as "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas". Quite the opposite is the case. This movie is pretty straight forward, when it comes to story telling and characters. Madness ensues from time to time, but it's not the main factor of the movie. What it does create is a beautiful setting, with some beautiful scenes and nice/decent story to go along with that.Johnny Depp is on form, though you (or at least I) might miss his OTT performance from the already mentioned other movie. You have a lot of good actors in this and it feels mostly right, but there is something missing here, to make it truly outstanding.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sad and disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>They say that The Rum Diary is based on an little-known, eponymous novel by Hunter S. Thompson, but about the only thing that the movie has in common with a Thompson novel is that the protagonist drinks a lot. This is a tepid, sluggish film that isn't quite the rabble-rousing, iconoclastic story it desperately wants to be. Johnny Depp made a fine Thompson stand-in in the otherwise-disappointing Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, but here he's so sedate that he might as well be channeling Judge Reinhold. Depp plays American journalist Paul Kemp, who's sent to Puerto Rico to work on a third-rate newspaper in the late 1950s. The paper's run by the devious Lotterman (Richard Jenkins), who warns Kemp against drinking to excess. Kemp falls in with a kindred spirit in photog Sala (Michael Rispoli) and a necessary damsel-in-distress named Chenault (Amber Heard). He's quickly recruited by an ex-newspaperman named Sanderson (Aaron Eckhart), who wants Kemp to write up glowing brochures for him and his monied pals, who hope to exploit a neighboring island for tourism.At this point, you may be assuming that the Sanderson and newspaper angles will connect. That's a reasonable assumption, but the connection is nearly superfluous. It just plain doesn't matter; we wind up with two story lines that diverge and converge when the plot demands they do so. Kemp and Sala have wild adventures, such as ducking out on paying for a meal when they think they're going to get killed, but their adventures aren't anything new, and neither actor rises above the mess to make lemonade out of the sour script.I waited patiently for Depp to go into Jack Sparrow mode, wherein he just chucks his lines out the window and elevates the proceedings. Didn't happen. You could have cast Eckhart as the journalist and Depp as the bad guy and it would have made little difference. Speaking of Eckhart, hasn't he done far too many of these smarmy, elitist roles? We get it, he makes for a good-looking cad.The movie tracks as if a child wrote it. If you're looking for some subversion, forget it. Even the ending seems like it's from a cut-rate, bargain-basement thriller. I haven't read the novel, but if this is how Thompson's early work played out it's a wonder he got anything else published (as it was, it was published late in his career despite being written decades earlier). Every character is written thinner than tissue paper, and all Depp can do is raise an eyebrow or, more likely, a glass. It's a sad movie that aims low and doesn't quite reach that pinnacle. It does get some points for pretty scenery, though (such as Amber Heard).</fullReview>

We're in Puerto Rico in the 60's at a newspaper where truth don't get published and where the American dream is the only truth. The local population is unsatisfied and so is many others - but we only scratch a bit in the surface. The only story, that really matters in the movie is the story of a journalist...see it if you want some caribean views from the 60's and looove JD - otherwise find an other movie...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must state from the outset that I've been a fan of HST since I was a teenager and came across Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.The Rum Diary was an excellent novel and does translate quite well to the big screen. However, there are number of elements of the film that come across as disjointed and leave the viewer with a slight sense of the film not quite reaching the heights it could have. The cast are excellent and Bruce Robinson does deliver a good little movie, but it isn't the great movie a lot of us where expecting. For me, that is a shame. Not a show- stopper, but a niggle nevertheless.I enjoyed it, but as a die-hard HST fan, as well as big fan of Mr Depp, I just didn't get the feeling that the movie was "complete". Difficult to express, but it just seems to fall short of expectations.The qualities of the production are excellent and the acting is superb, but I, personally, found it left me wishing for a bit more.I guess if you hadn't read the (semi-autobiographical) novel, you'd be OK with the movie, but my OH (Spanish) came away with the same impression and she's not read any HST.Overall, a good movie and worth a deek, but not the sort of film to leave a lasting or compelling memory.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable to see, but lacking depth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From a cinematic perspective, "The rum diary" may capture the viewer's attention, the setting in Puerto Rico, with a good 1960 reconstruction of the island, full of vivid colours, makes it an enjoyable product for the eye. The handling of the story, however, leaves much to be desired: Johnny Depp probably felt the movie as a personal tribute to his friend, the journalist Hunter Thompson, but his character remains in a way unexplored and the story itself seems unaccomplished, mainly for a a foreign public who does not know much about his life and experience. So, on one hand we find true laughable moments and characters (Ribisi as Moberg is simply great), which please the viewer, but at the same time distract from what could have been a more concerned rendering of a committed and tormented writer, and create a sense of mess, mainly in relation to a story of both real estate and human exploitation. Was the intention just to create an enjoyable product, well, it is, but to the detriment of a more serious and involved approach to a character and to a dramatic story. I cannot say I did not like the movie, as i told before, the setting was pleasant and the actors are good interpreters, but I also felt it lacked some expected depth, or at least there was some confusion between comedy and drama.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Recently, all Jhonny Depp movies are lame. So lame that it makes me question myself how much is he earning from them. But let me guess: too much.Jhonny, at least ain't interpreting that bad, actually, he's different from the other movies, so, don't expect the same poker faces, because here Depp really does his job. After the main character, interpreted by Depp, Giovanni Ribisi also makes a great interpretation of a drunk that I really think he could have been selected to do Kemp's role.This movie photography, at least, is "lookable" almost all the time, even in a dark scene, what in my opinion is the biggest problem when watching a movie, because if it is too dark, you can't distinguish a thing, and if it isn't dark when it's supposed to be dark it will look like From Hell (2001). Then, except by a single and short moment, we can understand whats going on.But now is time to talk about the bad. And it is the Script. It just refuses to develop. Stars somewhere and goes nowhere. And besides, it expends more time on movie externalities (you can call them "side quests") than the "main quest" itself, what makes us ask "why are they doing this, anyway?". Of course I know it is based on true history, and this is a good thing, mainly for the funny moments it presents us (just like that car scene), but if a film is based on a true story, this story must be presented in a way we can easily understand whats going on from the beginning to end. And I couldn't get all the message watching it once, then I've had to come back some parts to understand the whole thing. This reminds me a little of "The Informant", what I've had to watch twice from the beginning. Probably I'm dumb. Who knows...Since the plot is a huge part in any movie, when I don't' like, I take 5 points away, what means everything else is great.Watch and see if you agree with me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had very low expectations of The Rum Diary. I am not a fan of Fear and Loathing, have never been able to get through it. Hunter S. Thompson wants to be insanely obscure just for the sake of it and this is why I figured The Rum Diary to be some bizarre attempt at being artistic. However, as it turns out I liked it! The characters are shallow, narcissistic, alcoholics...but guess what? Sometimes that works! It reminded me of sort of a twisted version of The Great Gatsby. Although the film is set in the sixties, it doesn't really use that setting as some period films would. In some strange fashion the film is essentially a coming of age film for middle aged men. Its sort of a wild weekend that you're looking in on and there is definitely some style to the film.This sort of role was tailor made for Johnny Depp who prides himself on being weird for the sake of being weird. His performance as Paul Kemp carries the film very well. He's the kind of guy you want to party with and he has dreams to accomplish but gets caught up in the wild world. Michael Rispoli has a very similar character to Depp but what really makes this film fun is the two of them together. They have strange but excellent chemistry together. Their mishaps together are funny and bizarre and just fun to watch. Again its like partying with two wild guys. Aaron Eckhart is our Gatsby so to speak. He's rich and free spirited and has some wild business plans and doesn't fit the lifestyle that Depp and Rispoli have going on. He does a good job but is very dry compared to the other characters. Amber Heard is beautiful and sexy but that is her sole purpose to the story. The chemistry between her and Depp is good enough but its a lust filled relationship that works for the story. Giovanni Ribisi has a small role but it is fun in a drunken annoying sort of way. I feel like he's trying too hard in the film. Richard Jenkins also deserves honourable mention because I really like the guy and he has a good but very small role as Depp's boss. His exchanges with Ribisi are hilarious.So The Rum Diary boils down to this...very little substance, a drunken wild ride, some great laughs, shallow characters but somehow reasonably memorable and entertaining. For whatever reason I think the film works. Maybe that's the whole point. Director Bruce Robinson seems to be a cult favourite and artistic in his style, this is the first film he's directed in 20 years. I think The Rum Diary is in danger of becoming a cult favourite someday down the road and I'm okay with that because as hard as it is to explain...I enjoyed it. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Puerto Rico is my favorite place on the earth's surface, so of course I was going to see this film. To represent the San Juan of 1960, I guess the filmmakers had to choose their locales carefully so as not to include any modern changes in facades and skyline because I kept seeing the same streets over and over again. As for the undeveloped island used by the U.S. military that figures in the film's plot--sounds like Vieques, but looked more like Culebra. Does anyone know where those scenes were filmed? I also thought I saw Luquillo beach at one point--any filming there? Lastly, were the shots from Carnival on St. Thomas really filmed there? But most puzzling to me were all the vintage cars used in the film. They were in mint condition. How did they get those automobiles to the island? Were they already there? Or are they the junkers from Cuba, repainted?!Inquiring minds want to know.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fear and Loathing in Puerto Rico</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If Hunter Stockton Thompson never existed, it would have been impossible to invent him. His was not a name known to me until I came across Bill Murray's faultless portrayal of the anomalous journalist in the relatively unknown 'Where the Buffalo Roam' (1980). Eighteen years later, in 1998, Johnny Depp further immortalised the man in Terry Gilliam's surreal 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas', still a cult film. It's hard deciding the definitive impersonation. Both portrayals hit the bull's-eye dead centre. Like other A-Listers (Sean Penn, Benecio del Toro), Depp was a close friend of HST's, right up until he blew his brains out in 2005 at the age of 67. To keep his friend's spirit alive, Depp has pledged to film other HST works. In this film, directed after a long hiatus by Bruce ('Withnail &amp; I') Robinson, Depp returns to the preternatural mind of HST, albeit as HST's quasi-alter ego Paul Kemp, a down-and-out freelance journalist. Kemp travels to Puerto Rico in 1960 and is hired by a moribund newspaper. He arrives at a time when the USA is colonising every scrap of land it can and the people are in revolt against their tyrannical government. The paper's editor, Lotterman (Richard Jenkins) is cynical as only an editor can be. He lectures Kemp on how futile it is to be a crusading journalist in a place like Puerto Rico. 'Nobody gives one fifth of a (you-know-what)', he explains. Happiness is all the people want, not gloom. Kemp's remit, therefore, is to cover ten-pin bowling, the thing the locals most crave. Soon Kemp meets Sanderson (Aaron Eckhart), a slimy character who entices Kemp to write propaganda articles in support of his plans to turn an unspoiled paradisiacal beach into a tourist spot. Other key characters are Sala (Michael Rispoli), the paper's photographer and Moburg (Giovanni Ribisi), the office degenerate, who's succumbed to a life of drugs and alcohol. Every scene he features in he steals. It's his best and funniest role to date. Both follow Kemp around because he's the new blood, but probably also because he's Johnny Depp. They get themselves into all sorts of mayhem, sometimes of their own making, other times unprovoked. The set pieces are exaggerated, for sure, but developed in a just-about believable way.The love interest is Chenault (Amber Heard), who redefines the adjective 'beautiful'. She is Sanderson's toy girl, but (understandably) has the hots for Kemp. (Depp, by the way, is almost fifty, but still looks like a walking CK ad. And he can deliver a joke.) When the newspaper is on the brink of becoming obsolete due to poor sales and exorbitant expenses, Lotterman allows Kemp to attempt to expose Sanderson. To raise money to print the story, Sala suggests using El Monstro, his fighting cockerel, which they get blessed by a witchdoctor. This scene alone is worth the price of admission.Whilst unfaithful to the source material (a long-unpublished ? until 1998 ? book by the late 'Doctor'), 'The Rum Diary' has enough of the man's wit and repartee to make any criticism superfluous. Depp gives us a less eccentric HST than the one he gave us in 'Fear and Loathing'. Unlike many recent American comedies, the film's set pieces aren't consecutive, which allows jokes to come at the right time without producing a sense of overkill. Witticisms are hilarious: 'Blackheads like Braille', 'You are a waste of human sperm', and my favourite, 'This is a drug so powerful, they give it to Communists'.Hunter S. Thompson has got to be an actor's dream part. There's something about the man that makes you want to impersonate him. It could be his distinctive voice. That mumbling, maundering manner that is hilarious to caricature and see people respond to. I'll be honest, even I went through a phase of impersonating him, and I'm thinking of doing it again.www.moseleyb13.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Are they not complimentary?" - A Review of "The Rum Diary"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film of which has held onto my anticipation since filming in 2009 and has combined the great Johnny Depp once again with the also terrific Hunter S. Thompson's writing is The Rum Diary, released on October 28th, 2011. The film lived up to and beyond my wildest expectations of a crazy journey into the mind of a journalist, Paul Kemp, as he discovers love, betrayal and rum. The Rum Diary, written for the screen and directed by Bruce Robinson is a captivating work of art that provides in itself, a moral value of heart. The film also stars Aaron Eckhart, Michael Rispoli, Amber Heard, Richard Jenkins, Giovanni Ribisi and Amaury Nolasco.ACTING: 10/10 The acting in this film is similar to 1998's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. A blend of random hijinks and serious conversation keep this film in check with the bitter taste of the world and the humorous side of human error that comes with it. Johnny Depp is flawless as Paul Kemp and the other performances are top notch, also notably Giovanni Ribisi's role as Moberg, a drunken Hitler admirer with odd beliefs.MUSIC: 10/10 The music of the film is well performed to match with the tone and timing of the setting. Every piece is designed to help drive the story and the characters' thinking. Not one track fails to leave the scene with an overlapping treat to the ears.PACING: 10/10 The film is lengthy, but paces well. Each scene is well done and the film never drags on to great lengths. The crafting and editing of the film helps bring the story to life in a great blend of performance and flawlessness.WRITING: 10/10 The writing is the top notch performance that I had expected. Well written scenes and dialogue place the film among the tops of 2011 and with it, brings many laughs and provides great emotion into the hearts of the audience. This is truly a Hunter S. Thompson adapted piece.OVERALL: 10/10 I walked away from the film wondering about the "bastards" of life and what I could take away from the film. The experience led me to the wanting of making a crafty project of similar proportions and has captivated me. There isn't one bit of the film I didn't enjoy and as a young man, I would recommend the film to anyone over the age of 18, as the film does have some crude humor and language, but all of which add to the story.Review by Kale Slade</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A big step up from Loathing in Vegas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Rum Diary is a more grown up and intellectual approach to the life and writing of Hunter S. Thompson. its an alcohol induced bender into the struggle between journalism and corporate corruption in San Juan, Puerto Rico in the early 1960&#x2032;s. While Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998) was just a drug induced haze into a weekend of nothingness in Las Vegas. The styles are very similar. The substance is miles apart.Depp plays the Thompson character named Kemp who takes an ill considered job as a writer for the failing newspaper run a guy named Lotterman (Jenkins). Lotterman gave up his journalistic ideals years ago just to survive and eek out a living in the cesspool of 1960&#x2032;s San Juan. Kemp makes friends with a burnout writer named Moburg (Ribisi) and Sala, the news photographer (Rispoli). Kemp is then bribed to write good stories about an upcoming commercial resort being promoted by local kingpin developer named Sanderson (Eckhart). Does Kemp take the easy money and cash in on his limited morals and ethics, or expose the corruption?It takes a long while to get there but along the way Kemp falls for Sanderson's young well kept girlfriend named Chenault (Heard). This set up is almost identical to the way Gordon Gecko (Michael Douglas) pulled in the young Bud Fox (Charlie Sheen) and enticed him with Darien Taylor (Daryl Hannah) in the original Wall Street (1987). Kemp finally resolves to do the right thing despite always being drunk and hungover. But the point is? The real point probably died with Hunter Thompson assuming there really was one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hunter S. Thompson - straight, no chaser, and one of Depp's best in years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Rum Diary - as "straight-forward" a Hunter S. Thompson adaptation as we're ever likely to see - which means it's damn good, and damn understands what the goddamn Hunter S. Thompson was getting at with his work as a whole, even as this is a sort of prequel to his life and work in general (see for example the introduction to LSD and the disgust at Richard Nixon in the 1960 Presidential debates on TV). It may be a little hard not to compare it to Terry Gilliam's Fear &amp; Loathing film from 1998, mostly as it's Thompson again given life by his Hollywood-alter-ego Johnny Depp (and oddly enough has not seemingly aged a day since then even as he's now in his late 40's, good God man what well did he drink from I want it!) But where Gilliam's film was a madcap, grotesque cartoon on the American dream, this takes a mostly more sobering approach, with Dariusz Wolski's cinematography giving Puerto Rico a pretty and pretty dirty look (as, one supposes, it should be) and Bruce Robinson being a wonderful director of actors (being once one and director of one of the great comedies about actors and those on the outside looking in, Withnail &amp; I) it takes on a different shape altogether. Obviously it will attract that group of fans as, frankly, I'm one of them. I can report that this is a film that gives a lot of awesome respect for Thomspon's work (having, ironically, not read this book but most of his others it seems to capture a lot of his thematic concerns in general well enough too), and makes up its own risks as it goes along.It is, again I should stress, a more conventionally shot picture, shot-reverse-shot, not too much crazy lighting, only one very noticeably deranged special effect, which makes up one of the uproarious moments of the picture (hint: They give it to Communists!) And yet there's some daring here and there, and some of my favorite moments of the year are in this picture.For example, Robinson takes the time amid the plot - which is mostly concerned with Depp's disillusioned journalist covering astrology bullshit at a local paper that's going under while tangled up with a shady businessman played by chin-dimple magnet Aaron Eckhardt - to take his sexy co-stars (Depp and Amber Heard) in a sexy red corvette on the road. It's one of those dangerously erotic scenes where it's mostly about how the actors look at one another, and how they look at their bodies, and then the car speed goes up more, and more, and more... and then THERE'S A DOCK! They screech to a halt, and the shot helicopters away from them into the ocean... and the shot doesn't stop at the point one expects it to. And the two stars get out and look out at the ocean, feeling what exactly? It's one of those moments in movies one goes to the movies for.Lastly: Giovanni Ribisi steals his scenes, which is absolutely stunning since I don't think I have come away feeling that in so many years of watching him in films. He comes in much the same way Ralph Brown does in 'Withinail', as a grungy, whacked-out supporting character, but who will leave a damn-BIG impression (particularly in this case as he asks for venereal disease examinations in exchange for drugs and plays records of Hitler... you know, FOR FUN!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Quite The Return To Form I Was Hoping For From Depp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>10 years Prior to this Johnny Depp was one of my favourite actors. Then came the character of Captain Jack Sparrow, and with it came endless sequels every couple of years, and (aside from a few roles like "Finding Neverland" and "Sweeney Todd") uninspired performances in average movies (The Tourist) Now he probably doesn't even rank in my Top 10. Based on the novel of the same name by Hunter S. Thompson, I was hoping this would be a return to form. "The Rum Diary" started off well with Dean Martin crooning "Volare" over the opening credits. But whilst not quite a return to form, it has some good moments and Depp's heart is clearly in the right place, in what is clearly a passionate project for him, based on his close friends work. But I think Hollywood got in the way of him making a great movie. Michael Rispoli, Aaron Eckhart, Giovanni Ribsi, Amber Heard and all give good solid support to Depp, but my main problem comes from the direction, which is uninspiring despite great source material.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was just a convoluted mess with no direction. What were we supposed to get from this? What was the point? Spare me the high-brow crap that Hunter S. Thompson was some sort of visionary writer...I think this is a case of the Emperor not wearing any clothes...I found myself looking at my watch many times because I got bored. The only thing that kept my interest was that Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands are my favorite places in the world. So it was fun seeing them drive through Old San Juan. But other than that...yawn.Anyway, for 2 hours I watched a semi-comical, semi-preachy, semi- mystery, semi-love story mess. This movie was kind of funny in parts; had they made it into more of a comedy, it would have excelled. This movie was overly preachy, which was annoying. This movie was also kind of a mystery and a love story, but those elements pretty much fall off the map.I did find it ironic that they were bemoaning the loss of jobs at the newspapers while also being totally shocked that the hotels would employ thousands of people...Here's the thing; the Caribbean thrives on tourism. Yes, tourists can be nasty; i know I hate seeing the stereotypical American tourist barge his way into a local restaurant, being rude...but what I have found is that every nation has these types of people...they are used to the Disneyworld type experience where everything is on display for THEM. But tourists bring in the money...without tourists, the Caribbean is just a bunch of third world islands with real way to improve themselves. The resources on most of the islands are sparse; on the larger islands, the climate and terrain often conspire against large-scale agriculture for anything but sugar (hence the huge rum industry). Yes, part of me wants to keep all the beachfront property pristine...but tourists don't go to the islands to watch a city street.The best the islands can do is control the development and prevent eyesores...some islands do this better than others. I'm sure a lot of the locals resent having these fat Americans come down and "ruin" their homelands, but again...money has to come from somewhere and most Caribbean islands cannot exist on their sparse industries.So all that said, I felt the film's stance against tourists was misguided. I would not have minded that as much if the rest of the movie had an actual plot...but it didn't. I suppose Depp needing to "find his voice" was the point but...really? Avoid this film...you can find something better to do with your time...Read a book about the Caribbean...read a book about authors...just don't watch this movie</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have no idea whether powerful art requires pain in the creator. I suspect not. But it is an unhappy fact that the actors that I appreciate must be seriously incomplete when not acting. Sean Penn and Robert Downey are the most interesting living (male) actors in my universe, but Depp comes close.We all need a story to live in, to come home to and what fascinates is how focused these stories seem to be. You don't need to identify with a token being to adopt their story, and I would not say that Depp *identifies* with Thompson. But then Thompson himself was reaching for something, someone beyond. So when Depp strives to be in the smell of the Hunter, it is the smell being hunted ? scents all the way down.For a very long time, Depp has publicly admired Thompson and performed what rituals a powerful actor can. Among them is this film, which I come to as something in between reading an interview wherein Depp presents his target narrative and a film intended to have agency as an independent story. As a standalone film, it is an utter failure ? excepting a few lines and fewer images. The intended mood is never attained. Of all of Gilliam's failures, the one success he had was the ability to create the man's trace or order through fog (in 'Fear and Loathing').But I will still recommend this, because the man openly carries his persona to his successful roles. Neither we nor he know just what that persona really is. But we do know what he wants it to be. Winona is long forgotten.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>there is too much going on this movie and it seems that they had too much respect for the novel to change it for the movie. in most cases that is considered a good thing, but in this case, it was a mistake in my opinion. there are too many minutes of this movie that doesn't serve any kind of purpose, if you taken out 50 minutes out of the movie we wouldn't miss it. because they chose to show that 50 minutes, i don't know what the main focus of this movie, is it the politics, is the love interest of the writer, is it never sell your soul kind of stuff? I don't know and that is a problem. the other reason why they couldn't deliver can be that they were worried about the box office. it is a very good project to go more experimental with(like fear and loating in vegas kind of thing) but got stuck in between or maybe johny depp got to involved with the project and wanted to make his late friend seem like a hero. however in my humble opinion, this is a story of a loser at the time, so adding heroic poses, charismatic look to the character and achieving completely nothing in the end seemed forced. so despite the whole crews' incredible performances as actors, this movie is 5 out of 10 for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is simple: this movie is good, but has some concerns for certain audiences. Being 17, and just getting into watching rated R flick without parental consent, this movie was something different. This movie was rated the way it was not because of violence or nudity, but rather foul language and drug references. Set in the 1950's, it was a movie which did not appeal greatly to me possibly due to the fact that I think in a more 'modern' manner. Another point of significance is the lead actor, Johnny Depp. If you are a Johnny Depp fan it is highly likely that you have already seen this movie, but for those who are attracted to this movie due to the lead, you may want to think twice before you buckle down for a view. The story drags on in my view and it is a simple reiteration of events; there is not much surprise to the viewer neither an incentive to think about what is going to happen next as the movie is one that tells a story than creates one as it progresses. The title and the movie have less in common than I thought, but possibly makes sense from a different perspective, one that I am unfamiliar with. Not worth a watch, especially due to the duration of the movie, unless curiosity lingers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delightful setting and music, but never really gripping</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A movie starring Johnny Depp is always interesting. Not all of them are good, but that's because we have such high expectations of him. I think, when it comes to acting, he has met these expectations once again. I consider him one of the greatest actors today, and this movie is no exception. It was a treat to watch. The film takes place on the beautiful, tropic and somewhat idyllic (on the surface) Puerto Rico of the 50's. As said in the film, the island is practically owned by the US. People go there to escape the problems their country is facing, say, the Vietnam crisis. They escape reality and drown themselves in sweet sorrow, enjoying the wonderful weather, lovely palm beaches and lots and lots of rum and other alcoholic beverages. The perfect example of the capitalistic and commercial imperialism of a monster called profit, being one of the key problems in the plot.So far, so good. I enjoyed the setting, the lovely, somewhat classic scenery of a world of living the good life. The music matches everything. I absolutely loved the entire score, it has some lovely relaxing jazz music, making you want to lie down on the beach and sleep.The story however, wasn't carried out that well. It was clear, alright, but it took off rather late and even then, it was mostly about drinking rum and facing the subsequent hangover. It wasn't exciting, there wasn't a lot of action, not many moments to leave you on the edge of your seat, breathlessly hoping for relief. Not once was Kemp (Johnny Depp) really in danger. It was however, clearly stated as an action-comedy. Alright, it was funny at times. But Depp's wit isn't carried out as much as in, say, Sleepy Hollow or the Pirates quadrilogy. He is much more of a normal man, trying to make a living on an island which appears to be fresh, but is rotten on the inside. Yet, the rather disappointing execution of the storyline cannot leave me concluding the movie is boring and dull. It was fun to watch, it gives one that laid-back feeling of satisfaction, thanks to the great music and the beautiful places. But if you really want action, then, no, I am sorry. I, however, am not that picky and will settle with whatever the movie turns out to be: Easy and fun, beautiful at times, but not that gripping. It was certainly lovely to lose myself in beautiful weather, blue skies, a cool drink and those nice beaches they have over there. Especially in Holland this time of year, with its dreary dark weather. Ugh. [7/10] Give it a go! It's fun and hot and it won't scare you!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Without knowing anything about the back story I could go into this film with a completely open mind. The film had Johnny Depp in a role he again did well in as the journalist who sees a powerful man's plan to make the ultimate resort on an island. He is certainly believable as an every man in this sense. Most of the times it is difficult to really envisage him as this sort of character but he does it fairly well here. I however thought that Aaron Eckhart was better cast where in the rest of the characters we see who portrays more than the characters themselves. Amber Heard was well Amber Heard and she never managed to really develop a chemistry with any characters and really didn't make the role her own. Pacing wise it felt like some scenes were longer than they should have been and possibly could have focused elsewhere. There were some great laughs mostly involving Depp and Michael Rispoli as Sala most notably the driving scenes in the beginning of the film. It is not always comedic and does manage to balance the comedy with the seriousness even though it doesn't always feel like authentic seriousness. The film follows a formula I cannot speak for the novel but this film just feels like it comes and goes without too much of an impact. I wish I could talk more about it but it is just that. It comes and goes and that is about it.</fullReview>

Chaotic though this portrait may be, it delivers the goods - superb cast and superb portrayals, a lot of heart. You still cannot solve the riddle that is Chenault, who is so pure and naive.

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: The Rum Diary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems like Johnny Depp can't get enough of the works of Hunter S. Thompson, who had been credited for and popularized the style of Gonzo journalism which makes no qualms about being objective, and tells a story with the reporter put into a first-person narrative. Thompson's novel Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas had been adopted for the big screen and had starred Depp, and now Depp turns producer in bringing yet another Thompson novel for the cinema, which is not hard to tell why the character of Paul Kemp had appealed to him.Inspired by Thompson's real stint which found him in San Juan, Puerto Rico in 1960 to write for a newspaper that's facing the worst of times, the story deals with a series of events from the minute Kemp lands in the country and throughout his stay, getting in touch with the various characters from within the newsroom, such as editor Edward Lotterman (Richard Jenkins), photographer Sala (Michael Rispoli) and Moburg (Giovanni Ribisi) the perpetual drunk still on the newspaper's payroll, to activities outside in the pristine beaches of San Juan, with shady businessman Sanderson (Aaron Eckhart) and his gorgeous girlfriend Chenault (Amber Heard), which Kemp takes a liking for.For starters, his editor dislikes Kemp's drinking problem, a problem that seems to perpetuate itself amongst all of Kemp's newsroom friends, since the editor is of the advice that the drink will ruin one's career, starting Kemp off with the horoscopes section of the paper. For Kemp, being in the island is but an escape while waiting to write that great American novel he aspires to, but distraction comes in the form of Chenault, and especially when Sanderson ropes Kemp in on a shady deal that requires extreme discretion because it's frankly, thinking out of the box in order to make an obscene amount of money through unscrupulous tactics.The deal is for Kemp to be the grouping, made up of corrupt politicians, ex military men and brokers, and to churn out articles in their favour to boost the real estate chances that they had set their sights on, and being in the loop of things exposed a lot of shenanigans behind the scenes that Kemp is clearly uncomfortable with, if not for opportunities to be close to Chenault. And in between he had to content with the lack of water, trying hard to stay sober, and dealing with the plenty of rum and drugs that come their way.And speaking of which the vices here happen to serve as the highlights of this rather deadpan film, if not for the moments of drunkenness and perpetual high no thanks from the overt consumption of recreational drugs that lift the narrative and its characters into the heights of fun-filled insanity. In some ways, like Kemp, the narrative fumbles and sprawls its way through like a tourist taking pictures of everything just because he can and not because he finds beauty in the subjects, and so The Rum Diary has the same effect of trying to cover everything, yet almost always abandoning things halfway and finding no real meaning other than to have everyone in a drunken state of anxiousness during its climax.It's a good story nonetheless, with cast members really chewing up their roles in extremely carefree fashion, but Bruce Robinson, out of the game for some time, clearly found it a struggle to try and piece things together tightly and deliver something that's truly engaging. Strictly for Johnny Depp fans.</fullReview>

You can see through most of the bad guys, and you love the good guys, I think this is a comedy, not a drama. Have to confess I hated the female lead.

		<shortDescription>Rumming On Empty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A comedy with no laughs, a mystery with no suspense, a story without a point. Even for Hunter Thompson, that avatar of wasted potential, "The Rum Diary" seems an unworthy tombstone.Today the late Thompson is celebrated for his drug-fueled explorations of the darker side of the American dream. "Rum Diary" is interested in an earlier version of the guy, before he pioneered what was to become known as "gonzo journalism." Johnny Depp, Thompson's real-life friend who previously played the writer in the film version of "Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas," is back for seconds, this time as a thinly disguised, somewhat younger Thompson (though Depp is much older here than he was in "Vegas") trying to find his voice amid the greed and hypocrisy that is Puerto Rico during the Eisenhower administration.I have to say "Fear And Loathing" was the last movie I ever walked out on before it was over. There was no danger of that happening with "The Rum Diary," a far more linear and somewhat larkish film which captures Puerto Rico in all its sunny splendor. The problem with "Rum Diary" is that it goes nowhere and takes nearly two hours to get there.Thompson, or rather Kemp as he is called here, arrives in Puerto Rico well hung over and hoping to get a job at the San Juan Star. Lucky for him no one else wants the job. Puerto Rico is a dead end, it seems, of interest only to greedy capitalists who want to despoil its natural assets for easy bucks."It's a reluctant part of America," explains Kemp's editor, Lotterman (Richard Jenkins). "It's like an England with tropical fruit."What does that mean? I don't know, except writer-director Bruce Robinson is English, and maybe he thinks his country is too much under America's shadow and wanted to say something about it. This kind of inside- baseball treatment permeates "Rum Diary," especially in regard to the Thompson legacy. Time and again, we are reminded that our hero is to grow up and become a journalistic legend, making the "bastards" pay with his fearless, forthright prose. Nothing we see in the movie backs this up, though. He gets a job writing marketing copy for a shady developer, but before anything can happen, he's out and that's that.The movie just moves around like that, giving us a scene of Depp drinking, a sunny vista, and an attempt at humor that doesn't connect with either the light-as-margarine story or our funnybone. Much of the laughter is centered around Moberg, a rage-filled alcoholic journo whom Giovanni Ribisi plays with a terribly distracting accent and a flip hauteur which doesn't become him. Whenever the story lights on Moberg, I heard a grinding sound in the back of my brain.Speaking of bad acting, there's also a woman for Thompson/Kemp to fall in love with, played by Amber Heard with the sort of shallowness that often comes with beauty as rare as hers. Whether she is raped on a dance floor or throwing herself at our penniless protagonist, one never senses there's anything more on her mind than how she will look in the next close-up.Depp doesn't help or hurt himself in this movie, except as executive producer. Kemp is too nebbishy and insignificant a character to warrant our interest here, whatever it is he's supposed to grow into. I liked Michael Rispoli's grunty turn as Kemp's sidekick, and no one can enter a room with more aplomb than Aaron Eckhart. But couldn't his character have been given more to do than play the role of our token hated capitalist?Capitalism is ultimately the bad guy in this movie, and there are moments when you get a sense of purpose. At one point, Kemp offers a worthy insight: "Human beings are the only creatures on Earth that claim a god, and the only living thing that behaves like it hasn't got one."I'm not sure if the line is Thompson's or Robinson's, but it's very good. Unfortunately, there's a lot of sitting around waiting for such choice nuggets, something which could sadly be said of Thompson's post- 1970s writing career. "Rum Diary" looks pretty, but turns out pretty pointless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To the fans of the book: spare yourselves the pain</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been a fan of Thompson's writing for quite some time. When I discovered the Rum Diary, it was like peering into his early genius, a novel with a raw unapologetic style way ahead of its time, a novel sticky with sweaty, drunken, crazed tension throughout.I'm absolutely gutted about this adaptation, gutted. It feels like the director missed the point of the novel completely, re-arranging the characters' roles and adding scenes seemingly at random. I can understand there are times when the director has a vision that he wants to pass along, but I struggled to find any semblance of that in this movie.What we're left with almost feels like a rowdy vacation movie, a watered-down story that only loosely follows the script of the novel and completely fails to convey any of it's spirit. I'm not only disappointed, I'm also quite angry. For shame!</fullReview>

We actually had no idea that it was a book turned into a movie until we did a research because we are really not happy after wasting almost 2 hours watching this film.Yeah, we had some laughs about a couple of times, but still, it did not satisfied our boredom. It is like we are waiting for something interesting to happen, a twist or something tragic to build up or intense up the story. All and all, it's no fun watching this film, the funniest scenes are already showed on it's trailer and that is much about it.. It lacks fun and interesting stuff that most viewers would expect for a Johnny Depp film. Disappointing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First Thompson movie you don't need drugs for.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hunter S. Thompson is a writer that I have never really understood. Perhaps he speaks from a different age or perhaps I don't use enough drugs to really get in touch with his message. This story was probably the most coherent of all of the movies that have been based on his work. This story was his first book but it was not published until later in his life.I really got the sense that this was his first character that received a call to arms to fight against corruption and people who abused power. As a movie it was not bad. I enjoyed seeing the younger version of Thompson; I think he bases his main characters on himself. I look back on it and I was surprised that it was a complete and understandable story. I liked the journey of the character but it did not speak to me as a viewer. This movie receives a yellow light.For more on this review go to http://fatsamuraireviews.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

As a casual fan of his work, I still enjoyed the movie.As a film, it had all the things most movie buffs look for: the acting was very good, with some great direction by Bruce Robinson, who also did a nice adaptation from Hunter S. Thompson's novel, and it's backed up by wonderful locations and some great music.Johnny Depp is especially good in the film, playing Kemp opposite a nice turn by Aaron Eckhart as Sanderson. Some of the characters differ a bit - not overwhelmingly though - in tone from Thompson's novel.In retrospect, even if you're not a Hunter S.

		<shortDescription>No Real Plot or Climactic Point</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While there were some interesting moments in The Rum Diary, the plot did not develop any climax during the entire film. In fact, much of the footage wound around a depressing cycle of excessive drinking, wasted lives, and characters who had no one in the World who seemed to care about them. Even worse, the film leaves the audience in a state of not really caring about the characters. Johnny Depp is a formidable actor, but this was definitely not one of his best roles. My wife fell asleep on my shoulder, less than 20 minutes into the movie, which pretty much says it all. We both love going to the movies, but we really had to strain ourselves to find moments in the film that truly held our attention for any length of time. Some of the scenery of the Caribbean islands in the film offered beautiful glimpses of a life that the characters unfortunately, were not able to truly appreciate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For someone who is not a Depp fan this was not good. DO NOT expect Fear &amp; Loathing type greatness. More like "Tourist" I say C+</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Do not confuse love with lust, nor drunkenness with judgment." Journalist Paul Kemp (Depp) has moved to Puerto Rico in order to start over. Getting a job with the local paper he meets a varied cast of characters. During his conversations he begins to discover things about everyone. He now is left to decide weather to use his writing for good for him or others. I have to start by admitting that I am not a Johnny Depp fan. To me he plays the same type of character in almost every movie. There have been a few of his movies that I do really like though. "Fear &amp; Loathing" is one I happen to like so I was looking forward to this one. If you go in (like I did) expecting the same type of movie you will be disappointed. This is more comparable to "The Tourist" in the way that ten minutes in you lose total interest in the movie and only keep watching because the girl is hot. Depp fans may love this but I did not. Overall, a movie that most Depp fans will like. I give it a C+.</fullReview>

Thompson and loved the novel,"The Rum Diary," you will hate this film and be sorely disappointed.What a waste of talent! The film is ruined by a truly bad script. Bruce Robinson took a delightfully edgy, profoundly cynical novel by Hunter S. Thompson and turned it into a pointless main plot obscured by unresolved secondary story lines.The scriptwriter's research on Puerto Rico was embarrassingly incomplete. Thompson's original observations were sarcastic, biting and to the point. Robinson's were inaccurate and anachronistic. The story is set in 1960. References were made in the film to cruise ships and casinos. Cruise ships as they are known today were not coming to Puerto Rico in 1960, and there were no casinos in Puerto Rico in 1960.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reporter Paul Kemp (Johnny Depp) takes a job in Puerto Rico, and falls for Chenault (Amber Heard) the girl friend of Sanderson (Aaron Eckhart), who has plans to build hotels on the part of Puerto Rico the US Navy is currently using as a bombing range as that lease is soon to expire. Sanderson hires Kemp to write the brochures to lure other investors. I tried very hard to find some entertainment value in here. The movie was actually shot in Puerto Rico and all I saw were tree lined beaches, poverty laced living conditions, a cock fight, one road that ran along the beach lines, a red corvette, and one modern gated house belonging to Sanderson. No other buildings were shown -- government or otherwise -- no hotels, no casinos within the hotels. I realize the year was 1960, but still??Oh, I did also see many, many 1955 to 1957 Chevrolets, which answered a question I always had: where did they go?I tried very hard to find some reason I continued to watch as I was not being entertained. Nothing was happening. There was a lot of drinking, smoking, some drug use and language at times. Main character Kemp seemed to be stuck in neutral. He wanted to write, but was only given horoscopes to deal with probably because his editor knew Kemp was an alcoholic and couldn't be trusted with anything else. Kemp finds himself a part of a secret group of Sanderson investors who want to build hotels on land that may soon be available to them. Kemp is sworn to secrecy regarding this venture but later has a falling out with Sanderson.I tried very hard to determine what exactly Kemp would do in order to make some sense of all this. He had a plan to expose Sanderson for taking advantage of the citizens of Puerto Rico. However, nothing comes of this as the newspaper Kemp was working for goes under and there was no way to get the story out. What to do? What to do? So what was the point? If this was entertaining, I wouldn't have been too concerned, but it wasn't.I tried very hard to find some humor in here and, If there was any, it flew over my head. I tried very hard to like this movie because I like Johnny Depp. He and the supporting cast were fine but the script was underdeveloped and didn't go anywhere. Or maybe, in this sort of autobiographical story, by author Hunter S. Thompson, nothing actually happened to write in any diary and make a movie out of.The only thing I did like was that, when he drank, Johnny Depp's character didn't act like Captain Jack Sparrow channeling Keith Richards.

I loved him in Edward Scissorhands and as Capt. Sparrow. In the beginning of Rum Diaries, he was leaning towards the direction of an outlandish character, then the character became more serious. Confusing! Also, there was Giovanni Ribisi's character - weird, quirky, strange....There were a lot of elements that were intriguing on there own, but this movie never really came together. I sat there the whole time hoping there was some ultimately redeeming value and it was not just another waste of 2 hours of my life.Bottom line: It was bad enough that I would never recommend it, but it was interesting enough to make me look for the book....if it exists.Off to Amazon!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Puerto Rico Derby is Decadent and Depraved</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No comparisons to Fear and Loathing people, to get this out of the way first. That film hallucinated Hunter and the American Dream from inside the Dream, with utter contempt and amused rejection, this is about a young Hunter trying to crack the shell of reality and still looking to be himself - strangely portrayed as more pensive, more restrained and mature, presumably all part of inhibition that is about to be shattered. He was 22 years old at the time.If you don't know, this is based on a long unpublished novel from his short tenure as a journalist washed up in Puerto Rico and is handled entirely in gonzo terms that he later styled, so a semi-fictitious account but which derives its journalism from the writer having written himself in the thing and trusting the eye to distort honestly. A comic-book romp about real turmoil.So we get to know about the makings of the person we know. He discovers another fervent mind that mirrors how we would grow to learn the cartoon Hunter persona: unconventional, erratic journalist ravaged by booze and drugs. He picks up LSD and hatred for Nixon. He picks up a love for fire-engine red convertibles. He picks up what would be the love of his life. And he leaves again Puerto Rico now ready to be one of our most feared gonzo novelists.So for all intents and purposes, we're led to believe it all starts here. How? The main idea is that he's tasked to write on behalf of the Dream and big corporate interests, while independently getting to photograph chaos and madness on the streets. And it is important, if there is any truth in the ramblings of an addled world, that both these exert their seduction, the Dream with money and vulgar luxury, the other with danger and lascivious rhythms from the tropics. The movie ride is alternately one of callous whimsy and foreboding that gets words inside of him.Both these will eventually need to be sublimated into the craft, if it's ever going to yield words that can change the world. The search is for an image of some purity that reconciles these opposites. A voice that sounds like himself.Now this is more than fine material and could have been our Year of Living Dangerously with the cosmic tug between law and lawlessness recast as deranged vaudeville. But for one thing, that Fear and Loathing immediately asserted: a structural center. Gilliam's film was wholly issued from and always centered in deranged mind. We got to see things by what hallucinatory traces left in the ether.This could have been issued as any one of these things: a report being written back in a dingy room, snapshots captured by a camera, stolen TV time from across the street, a cockfight, a sweaty dance in a blues concert, a spell in a voodoo ceremony (dedicated to Baron Samedi, the erratic deity as another mirror for Hunter). Threaded around any of them, our search for a primal image could have been framed as writing, film, dance, music, magic, and hopefully all these things conflated in the discovery. Alas, they are tossed helter skelter and one after the other so you'll have to imagine a better film. Imagine Herzog had done this. Even better, imagine Ruiz.</fullReview>

Combined with the passion and love brought to screen with Johnny Depp's acting in this role - as well as the rest of the cast - I certainly imagine Hunter raising a glass to the entire cast and crew with a big smirk on his beautiful, weathered face.

		<shortDescription>almost underrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching Johnny Depp in action is always a holiday for movie fans. Depp is one of these actors who can hold a film by himself, and in fact he does exactly this in many cases, included here. The problem starts to show up when the principal reason for seeing the film is that Johnny Depp is in it, and not much more beyond. The Rum Diary is a film that Depp wanted very much to make, it is based on a true story - the one of journalist and writer Hunter S. Thompson - set in 1960, by the time the history of the Americas was taking a turn. However it is also mostly a film for Depp's aficionados and another proof that true stories or biographies do not necessarily lead to good films.The dry story in The Rum Diary is very much about the profession of journalist, and about fighting personal daemons in order to be a true professional. A young journalist takes a job in Puerto Rico, a job he finds out soon nobody wanted to take. He is a drinker and befriends another journalist who is an even heavier drinker and the wrong girl owned by a local tycoon. He discovers soon that one cannot drink as much as he can or wants, befriend beautiful women, write good stories, and be honest at the same time. One may ask what is wrong with this story and why it fails to draw the attention although it has all ingredients of many other successful stories about journalists, corruption, exotic Caribbean islands and their fascinating and dangerous culture. Moreover, it is a true story! Well, this may actually exactly be the problem. We have already seen so many movies (some of them good indeed) inspired by such a true story, that when it is brought to screen closer to what it really was, it looks unsatisfying and deja-vu.The good things - some very good cinematography and a rendition of the 1960 Puerto Rico which is both realistic and colorful. Then we have Depp - of course! The not so good thing - a story that does not really decide what it wants to be - political thriller, retro-history, comedy, with an anti-climax ending. For folks like myself unfamiliar with who Hunter S. Thompson was, this film does only tell an unconvincing story about journalism in exotic Puerto Rico. Director Bruce Robinson made a very promising debut in the 80s, another couple of movies soon after, and then stopped making films for almost two decades until this one. His fans may have expected more from his come back after such a long waiting. Good acting and sure hand in camera and cinematography cannot compensate the weakness of the story. What was supposed to be the strong point of the film eventually ends by being its weakest link. 'The Rum Diary' may raise in time to be better than the commercial failure it was on screens, but less than what it could have been with a better story to support the theme.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film has its faults but I can't help feeling the previous reviewer has missed the point slightly. This is one of those journalistic backwaters where sweet FA happens and the focus of interest is actually in being and living there, nothing else. Like so many expats that choose obscurity over fame, remoteness over being at the heart of the action, the paps in this film revel in doing as little as possible, dawdling from day to day like snails playing a board game on a wall calendar, and generally hoovering up as much booze, sun and sex as possible. I've met expats like this, and they're probably a dying breed by now, most of them having become extinct by virtue of their cirrhotic lifestyle and bacheloresque failure to procreate. That said, this movie is a kind of snapshot, frozen in time to a particular era, like any road movie in fact - only this one ain't going nowhere, nor is it meant to. There are some great lines in it too, but what else would you expect from a film based on Hunter S. Thompson, surely? I've only seen the film once but definitely plan a reunion sooner rather than later.</fullReview>

This film is a proponent of the old saying "truth is stranger than fiction" because it's desperately in need of some strange. Instead of weirdness in the plot, there's certainly weirdness in the dialogue with a number of abstract mumbles and rants. Depp has made an art form of playing quirky and kooky characters, so he delivers. But the stand-out performance is by Ribisi, he takes nuttiness to new levels. The cinematography presents the "tourist brochure" look of Puerto Rico, not the "travelers guide" look. The film has no signature score, soundtrack or editing style and most of the blame falls on the shoulders of writer/director Bruce Robinson. The last film Robinson directed was in 1992, the nineteen year hiatus is clearly evident in this flop of a flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Rum Diary finds Johnny Depp and director Bruce Robinson treading ground that feels just the wrong side of familiar. Both have done the booze/drug addled adventure before, and both have done it to greater effect. Though he's as watchable as ever, Depp's on screen relationship with Amber Heard fails to click convincingly and he could be accused of being on auto pilot. It is however the supporting cast that give the film its energy, with Michael Rispoli injecting an effortless charm, warmth, freshness and authenticity. Though it's an enjoyable affair with some very funny moments, The Rum Diary remains, on the whole, a largely forgettable experience. www.second-take.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a very good somewhat prequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So this movie is based on a novel by Hunter S. Thompson who was a journalist in real life. And is a person that Johnny Depp was fond of, Thompson made his own ideal of Journalism called Gonzo Journalism. Which is a very unique form of journalism, I can't really call it ingenious but it's unique. If you seen the movie "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" this is in someways a prequel to that and the origins of the character Raoul Duke although the character's name in this is Kemp. The story in this isn't as difficult to follow although "Fear and Loathing" didn't really have a complex plot. This one actually has somewhat of a coherent plot even if it isn't that great and takes a bit of will power to pay attention to what is going on somewhat. The story takes place in Puerto Rico and it's about a alcoholic journalist who is also a failed author who tries to do his job in Puerto Rico while falling for the fiancée of one of his client. The problem with this movie is how boring Johnny Depp's character is when acting very normal in most cases, sometimes it can work but not in this one. One of the reason why his character worked in "Fear and Loathing" is because of the crazy and wackiness of his character which doesn't really apply here most of the way through. In this his character cares about his circumstances and the people he is surrounded by. The plot in this is just flat out boring and it's difficult to pay attention to. I haven't read the novel this movie is based on but I hope it isn't as bad as this movie. Or maybe it's good in written form but not as a movie. This won't have a cult following either and it isn't a shock that this movie is a box office flop. This just isn't a movie that will reach out to wider audiences and like most trailers they put all the quirky scenes in the trailer cause the rest is boring.4.3/10</fullReview>

I mean those vintage Chevy's are to die for. Period. This flick might start slow but hang in there. You will not be disappointed. And hay its not entirely fiction.

		<shortDescription>A movie that'll leave you craving for more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've often noticed that if I find myself humming the tune from a movie, chances are I liked the movie; this is certainly true of The Rum Diary. I've been playing 'After All', the Frankie Miller song, frequently lately. The movie based on Hunter S. Thompson's novel, by the same name, was a very pleasant experience. The cast was a pretty good reason for me to want to view the film. Johnny Depp and Giovanni Ribisi are two actors whose work I rarely don't enjoy, unless they do an outright commercial flick (Depp said in an interview with Larry King that he does the occasional commercial stuff so he can be free to do projects he truly enjoys); I find both actors adept at performing demanding characters and they did not disappoint me. Depp plays the alcoholic burned out journalist who has given up on everything but drinking; that is until he has a taste of ethanol made from discarded filters used in the making of rum (Puerto Rico is well known for its rum distillers), a favorite drink made by the characters of Rispoli and Ribisi. Needless to say, Depp plays his part with gusto. The title, as you can guess by now, was most appropriate.Ribisi practically steals the show with is lesser part as Moberg, a man with strange fixation with Nazism, perpetually high (on 400% proof alcohol or other illegal and even rarer substances) has-been journalist. There are two extended scenes with Ribisi that are positively hilarious: The first? He asks Michael Rispoli and Johnny Depp to look at his penis to check the source of his discomfort, neither of whom want to, then Depp acquiesces in return for a little bottle of what turns out to be LSD (according to the reaction we later observed); Depp responds to Ribisi's question "Is it the clap?" with "It's a standing ovation!". The other extremely funny scene with Ribisi is when he recommends to Rispoli and Depp to consult a voodoo priestess to enhance their chances of winning at a gambling scheme of theirs; the consultant is a hermaphrodite, garbage truck driver by day and voodoo priestess by night.The movie is not a comedy per say, but it has many very funny moments and the dialogue is just so witty, it's hard not to like it; you notice that right from the start. Michael Rispoli, in the role of Sala, is just perfect as a character who has given up must hope and tries relentlessly to convert Depp to his way of thinking. If you don't like Aaron Eckhart, you're in luck because his character is one you can't help but despise; I like Eckhart and I did despise his character. The sensuous Amber Heard, love interest of Depp, was well cast in the role of Chenault, just as Richard Jenkins was in his role as the Editor of the near defunct paper (it shuts down in the end) where the three main characters work.From what I read on Hunter Thompson, I understand Depp's desire to play that part. See the movie or read the novel and you'll agree with Depp. I certainly do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gonzo takes Puerto Rico.. a savage trip to the heart of a great book.. a film that didn't really work.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a huge Hunter S Thompson fan and given the amount of time it has taken for The Rum Diary to finally reach the big screen and the calibre of the people involved with this film, Johnny Depp and Bruce Robinson, I expected a lot from it. Johnny Depp who despite his pirate shenanigans is adept at playing off centre characters (see another Hunter S Thompson adaptation, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas or the fantastic Ed Wood) was a perfect choice for the role of journeyman journalist Paul Kemp, as was Bruce Robinson as director, Robinson having directed Withnail &amp; I, a film which is at least slightly connected to the Hunter S Thompson mythology via the artwork of Ralph Steadman (which both Thompsons books and the Withnail &amp; I cover art share). I've always felt that the chronic drunken hedonism of Fear and Loathing worked as a perfect companion piece to the chronic drunken hedonism of Withnail &amp; I. So Bruce Robinson should have worked out perfect as director of The Rum Diary.Johnny Depp having been very close friends with Thompson from the mid 90's up until the writers death by a self inflicted gunshot, would know intimately what The Rum Diary called for. So what went wrong? Well the Rum Diary is a short, punchy novel that is in turns a story about a man trying to find out who he is in a place that is rapidly changing. While his story unfolds amid drink, sex and depravity loosely held together by a newspaper reporting career we have a fun, funny and unusual ride. It's not quite autobiographical, but it feels that way. It's not a perfect book (Hunter S Thompson was purportedly only 22 years old when he wrote it) but it's original and it's a great read. What we have with the film is something that strays too much from the source material, makes a needless composite of two characters and adds and takes away scenes and plot points seemingly on a whim. The film is an oddly paced shambles, it doesn't know what it wants or what it's trying to do as it moves all over the place tonally, from OTT drink and drug comedy (Sala and Kemp have some genuine Cheech and Chong moments which would have been hilarious if Cheech and Chong hadn't already been THERE and done THAT a lot better) to a half hearted love story, and never reaching the beautiful poetic highs that are so indicative of Hunter Thompsons writing. Given that The Rum Diary was mooted to be in production on and off for ten years and die hard fans have been patiently waiting for this film, to get something like this which seems to shout from the rooftops that Bruce Robinson has lost his touch, and even Johnny Depp couldn't save it is just a massive disappointment. I was more than willing to fall in love with this film and the changes from the original book are just baffling. It's beautifully shot, but that's all the praise I can give it. As much as it pains me to say this, you should just read the book and leave the film. If you want to see a brilliant, sincere and faithful interpretation of one of Hunter S Thompsons books, see Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. Gilliam NAILED it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Rum Diary, Indeed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The problem, as I see it, is this: how much Hunter S. Thompson is in his alter egos, Raoul Duke and Paul Kemp? This funhouse aspect is exacerbated by having Johnny Depp starring in both roles. Are we meant to take Paul Kemp as an embryonic Raoul Duke/Hunter Thompson? Then the scroll at the end of the movie is half prophetic ("He became a reputable journalist" or words to that effect), and half nonsense ("they married and lived happily ever after" or words to that effect"). These are deep waters...I have never read the novel upon which this film is based. While many inferior novels have become the basis of excellent screenplays, my fear is that this is not likely to be a novel I will ever get around to reading; if a superior screenwriter such as Bruce Robinson produced this disjointed a screenplay, then the novel must be very disjointed, indeed. The film, narrative weaknesses aside, offers several rewards: the cast, headed by Depp, is worth watching, the cinematography is stunning, and there are some wonderfully funny set pieces in the script. Among the cast, Michael Rispoli does a bang-up job as the press photographer Sala, who is very much a proto-Dr. Gonzo. Aaron Eckert is very effective as the smooth heavy, Sanderson. And Giovanni Ribisi is brilliant as the degenerate reporter Moberg, who comes off as a strange conflation of Withnail and Gollum.Unfortunately, overall, this just wasn't quite as good as the sum of its parts, and inevitably suffers in the inevitable comparison with FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Leaves you wanting more gonzo behavior</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Rum Diary was hugely anticipated on my part for quite some time now. As a fairly big fan of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, I was more than a little excited to see Johnny Depp jump into the shoes of Hunter S. Thompson once again. But there were a few snags along the way. For one, the film has been sitting on the shelf for over a year. We also didn't have any sort of trailer, TV spot, or even production images until a few months ago. We had a summary and a rather impressive looking cast to fall back on. Part of me knew this wouldn't be quite as gonzo or extreme as Fear and Loathing, but an even bigger part of me really wanted it to be. In the end, it just wasn't meant to be and The Rum Diary is just barely on the better side of decent.Hunter S. Thompson took on several different personas over the years in his writing. Regarding the film adaptations of his works, Raoul Duke, who Depp portrayed in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is the man Paul Kemp, who Depp portrays in The Rum Diary, eventually becomes. So it's kind of obvious from the start that The Rum Diary won't be as erratic as Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. In 1960, Paul Kemp goes to Puerto Rico to write for The San Juan Star and meets Bob Salas (Michael Rispoli) the newspaper photographer and Edward J. Lotterman (Richard Jenkins) the editor. In addition to Moberg (Giovanni Ribisi), who has pretty much drank away the majority of his life. While Kemp struggles to write a story Lotterman is happy with, he begins to pal around with Bob and eventually runs into Sanderson (Aaron Eckhart), a man who knows how to make money on an island that doesn't seem to have any. Kemp gets into a few business discussions with Sanderson and falls in love with Sanderson's girlfriend Chenault (Amber Heard). Writing becomes the least of Kemp's problems as he struggles with an overbearing alcohol addiction, a domineering urge for lust, and the unfathomable ways he finds himself getting in over his head in nearly every situation.I feel like Johnny Depp has lost whatever it was that made him interesting years ago since I haven't particularly cared for one of his live-action films in years. Blinded by pirates and consistently working with a particular Gothic director from Burbank, California, Depp has been stumbling around in mediocre territory for quite some time now. I was hoping he'd at least show shades of his performance in Fear and Loathing and I suppose he did. Paul Kemp was a man who's much more together than Raoul Duke was though. His mind isn't quite as polluted with mind-altering substances as Duke's was. Depp is obviously tapping into the same character and seems to do what he can with the role, but it isn't really a noteworthy performance. Giovanni Ribisi felt like he stood out much more, but that was more than likely the purpose. Moberg is the most interesting and laugh-out-loud character of the film. He's so far gone that a simple intoxicated hand gesture or head movement speaks volumes of his character. While The Rum Diary attempts to be its own film, the eyedropper scene is probably the closest you'll get to Fear and Loathing nostalgia.Unfortunately, the movie felt like it didn't really find its footing until its second half. Upon seeing Fear and Loathing, Thompson was quoted as saying that the film would have been nothing more than "a series of wild scenes" without Depp's narration. That's one of The Rum Diary's biggest problems. While we do hear the inner thoughts of Kemp while he's writing or while staring into a lobster tank, The Rum Diary feels like a hackneyed series of crazy events strung together. It could best be described as quirky or semi-eccentric up until the cock fights begin, but it feels rather ho-hum in its execution. Bob Salas looks, sounds, and acts like a watered down version of Dr. Gonzo. There are all of these wild and bizarre occurrences happening around every turn and about two dozen memorable one-liners being spewed like wildfire, but no performance really sticks out above the rest and you seem to be just along for the ride rather than being sucked into it. The Rum Diary almost comes off like a watered down version of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.The Rum Diary is full of Johnny Depp breathing fire, voodoo, countless laws being broken, hangovers, riots, alcohol, and chicken, but it's all wrapped up in really dull packaging. There's some good writing in there; some that spoke to me as a writer. Its mundane line delivery is nearly forgotten about in its second half where things pick up and are borderline hilarious, but everything good going for the movie is forgotten about in its extremely disappointing ending. Considering all of its flaws, issues, and miscues, the logical side of me is wishing The Rum Diary would have stayed on the shelf.</fullReview>

Its the life story of a writer trying to be a journalist and find a way to write. The movie was so slow to reach a point of interest, I kept waiting and waiting for it to get to the point; it didn't. At the end of the movie there really wasn't any closure. We don't see him getting the girl, we don't see him nailed the bastard, we don't see him writing as a writer. We get him stealing a boat and floating of into the sunset with a byline telling us what happened. Absolutely ridiculous. Johnny Depp once again is extremely strange and lacking in interest. The only character I was interested in was Chenault, and that's just because how sad she was, and how you as a watcher was hooked by her beauty and mystery. But as a character I found her and everyone else, flat and uninteresting, there was very little change in anyone. All flat and static. Waste of time and money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rum Diary was an interesting movie that tells the story of a writer at a crossroads in his life who flees to Puerto Rico in 1960 to either find something better in himself or get lost in a river of rum.Johnny Depp goes a good job as a failing novelist who takes to journalism for the San Juan Star in hoping that writing something will help him ultimately succeed at writing novels. Depp is captivating in every scene, as his character falls into endless trouble but inevitably finds ways out. Ultimately, the chaos around him helps Depp's character find focus and purpose.Michael Ribosi does an outstanding job as Depp's sidekick and American guide to Puerto Rico. Ribosi's character survives on rum and the occasional hamburger. Despite his character's self-destructive nature, his character adds warmth and humanity to the film.I initially went to see Rum Diary for its setting in Puerto Rico. I have lived in Puerto Rico and visited many times. The rural settings accurately depict the rural Puerto Rican lifestyle even today. And the beauty of the island and Old San Juan is captured nicely throughout the movie, albeit less than I hoped.The Rum Diary is a captivating look into a fascinating and flawed character in a unique time and place.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The problem with people these days is that they need a protagonist, they need an antagonist. Is that what we've become? A society that so dearly needs a clear good and bad guy? We need a movie to yell at us what it's trying to get across? Reading all the reviews about the lack of focus, or not strictly adhering to the book, I might have a bad impression if I hadn't seen the film already. Thank the lord.It's an amazing film, one that cannot really be taken apart, one that's hard to talk about in specifics. It's an art film, and like all forms of art, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. The Mona Lisa means something different to me than it means to most people, and the same idea applies here. In the film, I see way too much real life in the performances, I see realistic conditions, and the whole thing is a great ride. It's believable, it's got some funny moments, Amber Heard looks...... good.. to say the least... and when I left the theatre, I wondered what I had just seen. I thought about it for a while, formulated a sort of opinion, but then realized I got something out of it most people wouldn't; it spoke to my life.Like I said, it's an art film. Go see it, and see what it says to you.</fullReview>

Its a story of a man that within the 1 hour and 45 minutes odd running time of this movie almost remains sober for 15 minutes of running time, almost bangs the hot chic and almost pulls of a coup of sorts. This movie is about the various ways Johnny Depp's character Kemp gets high, stumbles his way from one situation into another and in the end.. achieves nothing of consequence. If you went into this movie looking for an insight into the becoming of a great journalist, all you will see is one man finally (almost) kicking his drinking habit and picking up a steady job. Essentially this movie was made for Johnny Depp. There are some movies that will remain with you even after you leave the hall. This is not one of those movies. I would advise you to give this movie a miss as you won't be missing much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Slow, But Immersive Experience Into the Life of Journalist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The slice of life experience of a journalist for a moment in Puerto Rico in the sixties was slow, teetering on boring, if one expected actions, thrills, and the "continous" fast-paced American mainstream movies of today. Instead perhaps, this narrative, pictorial immersing version of a journalist is better viewed or sensed in the manner of a patience developed from smoking pot. This more balanced and informative and visceral look at both the politics, the human elements, of chance meetings (such as in Lost in Translation,2003) resembled in some ways a carefully edited drama reflective of China Town (1974) and a more sedate, less dramatic version of The Year of Living Dangerously (1982). Unlike The Year of the Dragon (1985), Rum Diary uses more of the mundane appearing photography shots that have more substance under the surface and a more restrained, less overly dramatic approach to allow the audience the opportunity to notice the details, to feel the various images wash over the brain that eventually end up as a consistent totality of greed, integrity, sensuality, and human development. Johnny Depp brings is own sense of charm and humor in a more quiet but befuddled demeanor, without brash grandiosity. The movie is a difficult fusion of drama, comedy, and dialogue that is uneasy, but apparently successfully bound together into a intellect whole. Within this movie is a matured sense of a script, plot, narrative, and message along with the experience of a poor, corrupt country.</fullReview>

In the end I could only say if you don't have a good face for Holly movies you must know how to act and how to dress yourself (Unfortunately, my dear, Bruce Robinson, you know nothing of them!!). The whole story is based on a kidnap/murder, which is rather comical than being a thriller. The music scores are pathetic and I must add the songs are not required in the movie at all. And specifically I just don't want to discuss about the storyline because there wasn't any real story behind, it's all real CRAP! Nice try Bruce Robinson. Not a bad shot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Padded with drawn out escapades that end in depressing reality over riotous antics.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Autobiographical films are generally only as intriguing as the person they're based upon. With notoriously rebellious writer Hunter S. Thomson at the heart of The Rum Diary, one would expect an equally wild and reckless romp through Puerto Rican culture. Sadly that's not the case here, and while the characters are appropriately deranged, the debacles they wade through are often padded with drawn out escapades that end in depressing reality over riotous antics. At least Thompson's surrogate Paul Kemp has his epiphany and seems to understand the profound connection between the starving children scavenging in the streets and the money-grubbing capitalists exploiting the land. Too bad he doesn't let us in on his revelation.Based on the experiences of renowned journalist Hunter S. Thomson, The Rum Diary follows Paul Kemp (Johnny Depp) during his time in San Juan, Puerto Rico where the newspaper reporter must contend with bizarre colleagues, debauched businessmen and unending nights of intoxication. While writing for a publication on the brink of collapse, Kemp bonds with booze-loving photographer Sala (Michael Rispoli) and drug-addled columnist Moburg (Giovanni Ribisi) and is soon approached by investment big shot Sanderson (Aaron Eckhart) to participate in a shady property scheme. But Kemp has his eyes set on Sanderson's sultry girlfriend Chenault (Amber Heard) and endless evenings of inebriation.The Rum Diary isn't an incomprehensible mess, but it is a collection of drug and alcohol fueled misadventures that essentially lead nowhere. It might as well be ungraspable for all the pointless activities going on, especially with a conclusion that emphasizes the fractional nature of the story. In fact, had it followed a less linear, more visually outrageous path, it could have amounted to a more rewarding, creative and untamed venture in the same vein as films it is stylistically and/or thematically reflecting ? the works of Gilliam (Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas in particular), Kubrick, Aronofsky, and the theatrical adaptations of Charles Bukowski's writing.The only truly interesting fragment of the film is the idea that it sometimes takes unusually crazy mishaps to inspire writers to find their voice. Bad decisions and bad company are influenced by unnamed hallucinogens and never-ending rum, stimulating Kemp into unveiling the corruption, politics and unbalanced distribution of wealth in Puerto Rico. Unfortunately, the audience isn't given much of an opportunity to sympathize with the poverty-stricken locals, or to loathe the excesses and crookedness of the rich ? and Kemp isn't even granted an on screen victory. The focus seems to be on Depp's facial twitches, low, trailing off voice and fleeting expressions, and the eccentricities of his supporting players. Rispoli, Jenkins and Ribisi are stupendous in their roles, delivering multilayered dialogue, double entendres, cynicism and deep observations on the unprintable qualities of easily ignored truths. The acting all around is sensational. Humor finds its way into the majority of the screenplay while romance is hinted at and adventure is dabbled in, but many will disapprove of the movie ending without an ending.- The Massie Twins (GoneWithTheTwins.com)</fullReview>

Paul rooms with Sala, an ageing and equally alcoholic reporter, in a rundown flat.Sanderson, a wealthy entrepreneur, hires Paul to flack for a group of investors who plan to buy an island near the capital and build a resort.His loyalties face challenges when he and Sala get in trouble with locals, when a Carnival dance enrages Sanderson, and when the paper hits the skids......It's so not cool to react negatively to a film with Johnny Depp, based on a book by Hunter S. Thompson, because FALILV was so awesome, right? And this is my fear as in to why this uneven movie is rated so highly, people are scared to critique because it will make you different to society, exactly what Thompson was trying to get across.Back to the movie, it tries really hard, and for the most part, the film works. Depp and especially Ribisi are as watchable as ever. It's just when you see the rest of the cast trying kooky for kooky sake, the film becomes unaware of it self deprecation.At one hand, the film is trying to be a satire on assaulting the senses, but becomes to smug and tries to be too clever for it's own good.It's a waste, because a lot of time has been spent on the locale and the production, the film looks as good as Depp, but in the end, it's shallow, pointless, and rather boring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on the novel of the same name by Hunter S. Thompson, this movie was entertaining and well-balanced. This movie introduces you to Paul Kemp (Johnny Depp), who is an itinerant journalist that left New York for an opportunity to work for a newspaper in San Juan, Puerto Rico. I actually liked this movie even though it was a drastic change from past roles that I have associated with Johnny Depp. This movie was not an action movie like the Pirates of the Caribbean movies, nor a drama or thriller like Finding Neverland or The Secret Window. However, Johnny Depp doesn't disappoint in this movie and puts on a believable performance to keep you entertained throughout the entire film. As you may have seen in the previews, Paul Kemp's love interest Chenault (Amber Heard) is very easy on the eyes and also gives a bit of flavor to the movie.I would expect that an older demographic is going to enjoy this movie. The story may appeal directly to the baby-boomer generation and those of us who know a bit of what was common in that area. The movie is worth seeing at the theater if you are a fan of Johnny Depp and are looking for a good movie that will tell you a story without the use of action, suspense, or elaborate computer animation (although there may be one scene in there, just for good measure).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the preview screening for this flick at the Hounthorne's Cinema in Monaco with different directors, producers and people involved in the business of making films.well, The movie has a great selection of actor for the different characters, every one of them deep and with certain story that involves them with the main plot, a professional journalist that finds the subject of his life by accident, and his passion for searching makes him find the right answers for his work.exceptional film location, soundtrack, environment and a very enjoyable experience for people who loves suspense, mystery and drama adventures PD: If you enjoyed the movie Zodiac(2007), you will love this Title too</fullReview>
