		<shortDescription>whacked-out comedy with a lot of laughs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`Austin Powers in Goldmember' provides us with an hour and a half of inspired silliness. Not all of the film's elements work equally well, of course ? a seemingly common occurrence in even the best of comedies ? but this third in the series of popular spy spoofs generates more laughs than almost any other movie released in 2002. Prime credit goes, of course, to Mike Myers, who both co-wrote the screenplay and inhabits no fewer than four of the movie's main characters. By this time, Myers has become so adept at his characterizations that watching him at work and at play here provides one of the prime pleasures of our viewing experience. Also in attendance are the usual suspects: Verne Troyer as Mini-Me, Michael York as Basil, Robert Wagner as Number 2, Seth Green as Scottie and Mindy Sterling as Frau Farbissinia. Folks added to the brew this time around include Fred Savage, Michael Caine and Beyonce Knowles as Foxxy Cleopatra, a bad-ass soul sister brought back from 1975 ? Afro hairdo and all - to help Austin rescue his kidnapped father and prevent Dr. Evil from yet again trying to destroy the world (this time by using a giant meteorite to melt the polar ice caps and flood the earth).Co-written by Michael McCullers and directed by Jay Roach, the film has the good sense to throw caution to the wind and give Myers free rein to indulge himself in his own brand of inspired lunacy. The film starts off with a deliriously clever and funny opening credit scene in which many of Hollywood's biggest names make surprise, good-natured cameo appearances. That sense of unbridled fun carries through pretty much the entire film, although there are, as to be expected, ideas, bits and jokes that seem less effective than others. As with the two previous films, this `Austin Powers' suffers from the unfortunate tendency to both repeat and explain too many of its jokes. Sometimes you do find yourself wishing that the writers would put a bit more faith in the audience to get the humor the first time around. Still, there seems to be much less of that in this particular episode, and there are plenty of laugh-out-loud moments to more than compensate for the occasional ? though not all that frequent ? clunker or lull that manages to sneak its way in there from time to time. `Austin Powers in Goldmember' wallows a bit overmuch in the sordid moments, the gross-out gags, the locker room and bathroom humor that have become, alas, the hallmarks of the modern comedy. In short, this is probably not the film to take the family to see if your family includes impressionable children and/or easily offended adults. The sexual and scatological meters run into the red zone rather often in this film. Nevertheless, `Austin Powers in Goldmember' works well if you enjoy a comedy where the actors seem for once to have been actually having a fun time while making it. Their infectious joy spills off the screen in a way that it doesn't in movies like `Mr. Deeds,' `Men in Black II' or, perish the thought, `The Master of Disguise,' to name just a few of the comedic bombs that have been foisted upon the unsuspecting public this summer. In contrast to the makers of those films, Mike Myers knows how to deliver the goods and, in the process, give his fans their hard-earned money's worth. Reserve us a seat for the next installment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Austin's Anatomy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While the first two Austin Powers films in this comedic series concentrated on spoofing the late '60s/early '70s, James Bond movies and concentrated on female anatomy in the process, this one was centered on penises. I kid you not. (Hence, the title, a play-on-words from "Goldfinger.") I watched this film twice, within two weeks of each as I showed a friend the second time. The first time I thought it wasn't as funny overall as the other two Powers films and was a bit too raunchy, especially for the PG-13 rating which is ridiculous. After the second viewing, I changed my mind about the comedy (not the rating): it is just as funny if not more than the other two.A couple of the scenes were hilarious, although very crude in spots but some of the crudeness is what makes it funny. However, most of time I laughed more at the many subtle double entendres and all the double takes by Mike Myers, who plays at least four characters in here...all of them very well.It's goofy, stupid and nothing spectacular but definitely fast-moving and entertaining. If you've seen the other Austin Powers films, you know what this basically is going to be, humor-wise.Beyonce Knowles, who played the female lead, didn't have the beauty or body of Heather Graham or Elizabeth Hurley, stars of the other two films, but she isn't bad. There are numerous cameo appearances in here, starting right off the bat with Tom Cruise.Overall: sick (again) but funny (again.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I LIKE GOOOOOOOOLD....member.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I can describe this movie in three words, I would say, "Shagadelic, baby, yeah!" Mike Myers, the comedic genius who made the phrases, "Yeah, baby" and the word "Shag" famous is back again in a movie that is superior to the Spy Who Shagged Me.While the original Austin Powers is better, this movie focuses on intellectual jokes. Many of the people I know who didn't like it, knowing them, it was probably because they didn't understand it. There were a few references to movies even outside the James Bond series. I even remember one instance where Dr. Evil was speaking as though he were Hannibal Lecter in an obvious Silence of the Lambs reference.Beyoncé Knowles has proven to be a worthy actress. I don't see what the problem is with singers doing some acting, because singing is a form of acting... But I digress. Beyoncé had a couple of punchlines, much like Hurley and Graham, but once again, Austin's babe is just there for Austin's (or in this case Mini-me's) sex jokes.Goldmember was one of Myers' most creative villains. As simple as lines like "I LIKE GOOOOOLD" and "I am from Sweden. Isn't that weird?" sound, the delivery makes Goldmember a one-of-a-kind villain, and I find him to be even better than Fat Bastard.Myers also cleverly planted some special appearances in that movie, and when he does, they do draw laughs.I will not compliment the end of this movie. While it was an unexpected plot twist, Goldmember could have done better without the scene they closed the movie with, especially since this is supposed to be the last movie of the series.If you watch one movie this year, watch Star Wars. If you watch two, watch the Godfather... but if you watch three, watch Braveheart... Ah, hell. We all see more than 3 movies a year. Just fit Goldmember in there somewhere!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK- but the worst out of the three</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be brutal, this movie is cynical. I mean, Mike Myers is a funny guy, but this constant rehash of old material (see the radar jokes, the shadow-on-the-wall, the father-son misunderstandings) is just a bit worrying and suggests Mr. Myers has run out of ideas.There are some classic moments in the movie, like the beginning sequence, and the shadow-on-the-wall sequence involving Mini-me, but the whole thing stinks of self-indulgence and money-making rather than originality or passion.I felt myself, straining to laugh throughout the 90 minutes or so I was in the cinema, and I SO wanted to love this movie as I loved the previous two installments. Mike Myers is funny, and Beyonce Knowles is surprisingly good too, but Michael Caine isn't given the right material to shine and the Osbournes cameo verges on the pointless.Good, but not your best effort. Austin Powers 4? No thank you</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The gold is a little tarnished</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first Austin Powers film was so fresh, zany, charming, witty and unique. It took some time for many people to catch on (hence it's legendary video rental record), but it was dazzlingly, mesmerizingly adorable. The sequel came out and rather tarnished the prior film by either dumping or revising various story elements and especially by taking a turn towards the crude and vulgar. Still, it had it's share of interesting moments and laughs. In this third installment, the goodwill is almost completely gone. What remains is a hopelessly indulgent, often foul and unfunny conglomeration of "jokes" and gags, many based on bodily functions or other off-key subjects. That is not to say that the film doesn't still deliver quite a few laughs. It's just that by now, the whole enterprise seems very worn and familiar. There are several truly funny sequences in the film, but mostly it is saved only by some surprising and "right on" star cameos and the fresh appeal of Knowles. The (typically) ludicrous plot kicks off with Powers having to rescue his father (Caine) from the title character by travelling (too briefly) to 1975. Then the whole parade of series characters is involved in either starting or stopping the world's total destruction. Myers is undeniably brilliant at creating various characters and giving them each a voice of his own. He succeeds in creating these people who seem real unto themselves. Unfortunately, he also is bent on catering to what has to be a 13-year-old boy target audience with endless, endless potty jokes and gross out gags. Some of them are very amusing. Some of them are just gross. After a short while it becomes overkill. Knowles (who is certainly no "actress") comes across as very attractive and surprisingly charismatic on film. Her character is mostly decorative, but she serves the purpose very, VERY well. Her take-no-prisoners attitude is refreshing, even if she is continuously shown being kicked in the face. By now, Myers is so much the whole show that previous supporting cast members (Sterling, Green, Wagner, York) can barely get a word in. Who knows how much of their stuff was cut in the hour-plus of leftover material, but certainly plenty of Myers was left in. It's hard to imagine the lengthier cut because this one seems interminable, even with the bright spots. The opening sequence is brilliant. The character named Dixie......hilarious full name. Other creative and funny bits occur throughout, but the film can not escape it's pall of crudeness and alienating self-indulgence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>About as good as the second</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While this is still not as funny as the first one, it's still worth watching. It has a load of recycled jokes from both of the earlier films, and a little too many references to the first, in my opinion. It's not entirely bad though, after a slow start it kicks off and gets very funny, very quickly. Most of the old characters return, with a few new ones too. The plot is pretty much the same old deal from the first two, still spoofing old Bond movies. The acting is still pretty good. The characters are more colorful in this one, I think. More developed, perhaps. The sexual crude humor is still there, and is better here than in the second movie, I think. The first is still the best, but if you only see one of the sequels, I recommend you see this one. I thought the twist-in-the-end was pretty lame, but it didn't entirely ruin the movie, as it didn't seem totally out of character or totally unbelievable. I'd recommend this to anyone who liked either or both of the first two movies. The humor is mostly the same, and people who enjoyed the first two will most likely also enjoy this one. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tarnished "Goldmember" Still Shines</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mike Myers returns for the third installment of his "Austin Powers" franchise. In "Goldmember," he comes full circle with the histories of Austin and Dr. Evil. Myers again plays shagadelic secret agent Austin Powers, his arch-nemesis Dr. Evil and horrible henchman Fat Bastard, and now also a new bad guy, the Dutch hedonist Goldmember. I found this movie hilarious and outrageous! It had a lot of crude humor, like Austin hiding behind Mr. Roboto's fountain. But there was also a good amount of self-parody. The best scenes included Dr. Evil's prison rap video, and the suggestive subtitles in Mr. Roboto's office. The several cameos were also enjoyable, especially Ozzy Osbourne pointing out the joke carried over from "The Spy Who Shagged Me." The scene with Godzilla and its copyright was a relevant joke, considering the MPAA's temporary ban on the use of the title "Goldmember." I did have a complaint about the continuity. The difference in Austin Powers' trademark "choppers" was noticeable. And although I'd have liked an explanation for the absence of Felicity Shagwell, I'm glad she was not revealed in the movie as a fembot! Anyway, with this third installment, Austin Powers goes out with a bang!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The weakest of the series, but Myers still has his mojo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After thoroughly enjoying the first two Austin Powers movies, they were daft but enormous fun, I watched this third instalment. I was disappointed admittedly, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. The plot takes the whole meaning of daftness to a whole level, so some of it verges on ridiculous, and while Mike Myers is brilliant as Austin and Dr Evil, he overdoes it as the Dutch villain Goldmember and the cameos are very hit and miss. That said, the sets and costumes are still wonderful, the soundtrack is groovy and the script is comedy gold with the cool catchphrases, bad-taste buffoonery and surreal slapstick. In terms of supporting performances Beyonce Knowles is a knockout as sexy and sassy Foxxy Cleopatra and Michael Caine is a dentally-challenged delight as Austin's dad. Seth Green is also fun as Scott Evil. Overall, an inferior sequel, but it was still a lot of fun, with Myers still having his mojo. 7/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Myers does an excellent job as different characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was a late comer to the whole Austin Powers craze. I passed on seeing the first two after seeing the trailers for them, I automatically figured they'd be dumber than dumb. I only saw this movie because 12 hour work shifts get really long and we have a t.v. here at work... so what are you gonna do?? This movie was hilarious. I was never really impressed with Mike Myers from his Wayne's World lore, but he certainly impressed me in Goldmember. The irony of it all is that the funniest things about this movie were the characters Mike Myers played besides Austin Powers. Austin Powers was humorous and had his place, but Fat Bastard, Dr. Evil, and Goldmember were a riot. This movie was a great mix of subtle humor and in your face comedy. This movie propelled me to see the prior two, but I don't think they were as funny.Goldmember was excellent, and definitely a top comedy in my book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay so this film has been reviewed at the cinema already, so I'll save the story details. I won't even mention the great opening sequence or the truly hilarious turn by Sir Michael Caine. Although both are highlights of the film.Lets just get straight to the DVD. And what a great DVD it is. I wasn't the biggest fan of the film, but history has taught me that the Austin Powers DVD's are always a top buy.Take for instance the special features. The deleted scenes, as with the second Austin powers DVD, shine through and present a series of cut sequences and gags which are, quite frankly, funnier than 90% of the scenes in the films. It's odd but these collections of gags seem almost to work better by themselves and show how strong, when stripped down and without the need for a story, Myers creations are.On top of that, after the almost 15 mins of deleted scenes, is a very funny selection of outtakes, showcasing Myers talents at their best (Dr Evil/Austin Powers) and worse (Fat Bastard/Goldmember). Simply hilarious.The rest of the DVD ? documentaries, scene break downs and music videos are good also and prove how much the medium of DVD can shine when time and effort are taken with it.If your not a fan there's little here that will convince you otherwise, but Austin Powers fans will rejoice in this DVD. It the words of the man himself "Yeah, Baby, Yeah!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tired, sad, unfunny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you howled (as I did) at THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME, stick in the DVD and watch it again. The experience will be far better than seeing this "new" film made up of old gags. The theory seems to be that if several poopoo, teetee and fart jokes were funny, then ten times more of them will be ten times funnier. Uh-uh: it works in inverse proportion. The sole laugh-out-loud I had from this film was a piece of stock footage of a chimp falling out of a tree. The jokes telegraph themselves from miles away, the dialogue is horrible, and the plot...wait, what plot? On paper it would seem like a brainstorming session that no one bothered to write a first draft of. The shadow bit from SHAGGED ME is repeated, as is the bit with Dr. Evil's space ship/satellite/whatever being misidentified as giant body parts, and lots of other bits are rehashed as well. How in God's name is this getting the reviews it's been getting? Has our sense of humor sunk to such a dreadfully low level that we chortle at lists of euphemisms for male genitalia? To their credit, the audience I was with didn't laugh much either. Maybe you can't fool all of the people all of the time. I'd love to see word of mouth kill this puppy in the coming weeks. Ooo. Bad. So very very bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Third time's not Golden, baby</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've said this before, and I'll type it again: only see this Austin Powers sequel once.While Austin Powers in Goldmember has its moments, such as the terrific opening credit scene (the best so far,) they are so few and far between making some of this movie's unbearable.I didn't heed to my own warning, and this is the second time I've seen it. But, then, I don't like to write reviews on movies I haven't seen in awhile. This one being almost 7? years.This time out, I got tricked. After being somewhat disappointed in Austin Powers: The Spy That Shagged Me ? comparatively speaking to the brilliant Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery, I was pumped up after the now-established opening dance scene. And I thought this would bring the series back on track. Unfortunately, it only goes straight downhill after that.Austin captures Dr. Evil immediately in this chapter, but learns through a Hannibal Lecter/Magneto meeting that another Mike Myers's creation, Goldmember, is on the loose to cause havoc. Austin must race, literally, back in time, this time in the 1970's, to thwart Goldmember's plans. Back to the year 2002 he goes and everyone's where they're supposed to be situated to make an Austin Powers movie.A few things have changed: Austin's dad (Caine) plays an important role, Scott becomes more evil while the always-scene-stealer Mini-Me loses some and more history of Austin and Dr. Evil's past is revealed.Sure, the movie has its moments. Some parts I did laugh out loud. But for the most part, it was definitely getting stale, the jokes recycled and the newest, uh, member, Goldmember ,was unbearable to watch. Yeah, I know a lot of humor is gross-out jokes, but when he eats his skin (sorry, I never caught that spoof/reference) it's beyond nasty.Again, it's worth maybe one viewing, but I have to almost say skip this one and pray, if they make a part IV, they'll attempt to reboot the series back to its hilarious roots. At least come up with some new jokes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Goldmember is an outrageously average film, with poor jokes, poor writing and dreadful product placement. Lets face facts, the Austin Powers movies have been average, they ain't no laugh riot. The great thing about the Spy Who Shagged Me was of course, the introduction of Mini-Me. So what could be funnier, than to have this character be hit, fall over and generally be funny to look at. Beyonce Knowles suffers from a dreadful script in which she utters 'sugar' at every given opportunity to prove that she is from the '70s. Goldmember and Fat Bastard are dreadful characters, and the scenes with the 'mole' are extremely painful to watch. As for Dr. Evil and Powers, same old jokes apply of course. Just seems to me the Mike Myers has run out of ideas, and by adding a new character for him to play as the cameos do not hide that this a poor film. Austin Powers fans will love it i'm sure, but this is franchise too many. I'll be interested where Myers goes after this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A buffoonery on "Goldfinger"!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That no one but Mike Meyers could pull off the role of Austin Powers is made amusingly clear in the opening scene, which must be seen to be appreciated. To those who have cringed through one or more of the James Bond films, finding them obnoxiously sexist, chauvinistic and crass, the Powers films are deliciously over-the-top burlesques of that genre, even if some of the gags are relentlessly sophomoric. Scatological humor is pervasive, especially of the soiled underwear, urinating and farting variety. In one of the latter the character adds the comment, "Even stink would say that stinks," and in another case, focusing on a bare behind, we get the tired old yawn, "I always thought you were crazy but now I can see your nuts." Note that is "your" and not "you're," and juvenile puns of that form do tend to blemish the script at times. Even so, most of the pranks are original, and it's a mindlessly fun film to watch. Meyers is a comedic wizard, and he is supported at every turn by an outstanding cast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A weak but satisfying entry in the Austin Powers series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Austin Powers series is like my movie comfort food. Just throw it on when I'm feeling down and my day just gets better and I enjoy them all in slightly different measures. Goldmember is thus far the last movie in the series and it is easily the weakest film of the bunch, but it still packs some warranted laughs.Good: The cast for the part gets it right. Myers again is great as Powers, Dr. Evil, Fat Bastard, and now Goldmember adding his own personalities to each one and it is impressive to watch. There's plenty of stand out jokes here as well as some quotable lines. The casting of Michael Caine as Austin Powers' father is a stroke of genius.Bad: While there are plenty of good jokes here that stand out, it is the weakest film with a good chunk of the rest of the jokes not working. Some of them are essentially recycled from the last two movies and don't strike the same chord. The middle section just kind of slows down and it becomes meandering after a while. Beyonce is fine, but she doesn't stand out much like Hurley did in the original or even Graham.Overall, while it is an average comedy sequel, if you enjoy the Austin Powers movies, there's still stuff to enjoy here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Austin's still got his mojo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When films series reach their third instalment, many bolts and nuts start to come lose . However this is not a case with Goldmember which shows us that Austin Powers still has his Mojo. The horny spy is back. He may of lost some of his freshness but there no doubt he still delivers. If anything gold member is possibly the best instalment in the series.Mike Myers is still great as Austin powers. Just like the last two, he does the usually stuff you come to expect that's including making you horny. Micheal Cane also makes an appearance as Austin's dad which to me, was brilliant. The gags are what you expect from Austin, as one or two gags are reused from previous films but despite this they are still hilarious . Basically, Goldmember is everything you expect. Dr evil, his evil henchman, Mini me, Fat bastard, scotty are all still major characters.Now when it came to beyonce being Foxy, Mr Powers sexy partner, i was on the fence. Beyonce to me, wasn't the best choice but then again, she just there so that Austin can still crack a rude joke now and then. The arrival of The Dutch was flat. seeing as he plays a big part in the film, he is easily forgettable compared to other characters. Even though the gags still make me laugh, they are easily associated with the gags from the previous two films as there only several of new, unique gags.Goldmember is another proud entry into the series which still shows that Austin is still groovy and has got plenty going for him. Despite reused gags, he can still make you laugh out loud which makes me come to the conclusion that Austin Powers is now one of movies biggest icons and after watching him for over four hours now on all three films, I don't care if i watch him for another four hours in new material because Austin always delivers and Goldmember proves this The same goes for Dr evil, i hope i'll still be here when he up to destroying the world for the hundredth time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>He Loves Only Gold</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most of the cast of the first two Austin Powers films return for this third and latest Powers creation, Goldmember. I say latest and not last because I think with sufficient interest and the possibility of a good box office, Mike Myers could possibly be induced to revive Austin Powers and all the characters he created in the three films.Powers is back with his opposite number Dr. Evil and his henchman from the Spy Who Shagged Me, Fat Bastard and in this film he creates a new and even more sinister international villain in Dutch master criminal Goldmember. So named because he leaves the male members of his male prisoners painted gold, dead or alive. The members and the prisoners that is.Well if stealing Austin's mojo in The Spy Who Shagged Me didn't stop Powers, maybe kidnapping his father will. So Michael Caine enters the general mood of hilarity in Goldmember as Mike Myers father Nigel Powers who is kidnapped and taken back to the disco era of 1975.If you remember Powers was cryogenically frozen as Dr. Evil was in the first film and then sent back to the sixties. Now he gets a chance to experience the Seventies and things are wilder and crazier in the disco era than they were in swinging London of the Sixties. Myers gets some help from American agent Beyonce Knowles as Foxy Cleopatra, but with his mojo going full blast and the fact that Dr. Evil doesn't want a rival in the evil business, Powers gets the job done.Seth Green gets to shine a bit more in this film as son Scott Evil who finally looks like he's coming into his own as a worthy successor to head the Evil Empire.Altogether Goldmember is a nice Shagadelic experience, really groovy baby.</fullReview>

It goes over many peoples head and they see it as dumb and corny and they don't have reality of what the movie is doing.It is corny and dumb but with genius and Mike Meyers is a genius at comedy and in my opinion this movie is the pinnacle of that genius.All of his movies lead up to this, his last great movie. I loved it! This movie is all over the place. From a very good musical in the jail to peeing next to the statue.From the incredibly funny fight scene with MINI ME to the scene with Fuk Mi and Fuk yu.Very very funny! The Goldmember and Fat Bastard scenes are classics to watch for years to come.I stated in an earlier review that Step Brother with Ferrel was my second favorite comedy. but I would have to switch that with this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would have given this film a 10 if not for the very sophomoric, gross-out, so called humor. I'm not a fan of feces eating, urinating in another's mouth or multiple penis jokes. This film does have enough other goodies to make it worthwhile and a lot of fun. To fully appreciate this gem, I recommend viewing it on blu-ray DVD. You will get awesome sound and crisp, sharp and extremely colorful visuals. This is one of the most colorfully dazzling films ever. The songs and music score are fabulous, the sets are eye-poppingly flamboyant and excellent, the costumes sparkle and shine. Many of the jokes are hilarious, the story is clever and Mike Myers playing 4 different roles is amazing. The cast in this series has always been perfect and a lot of fun. The only drawback for me was way too much toilet humor. A little of that stuff goes a long way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still Fun after 3!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Austin Powers: Goldmember is noticeably different from 2 and 1, yet the fun remains the same throughout! When Austin Power's Father is kidnapped in 2002, Austin must travel back to 1975 where he is being held by the aptly named Goldmember. Austin teams up with the Hip Foxy Cleopatra who travel through time to piece together the puzzle with Mr. Roboto, Fat B*stard, Goldmember and Dr. Evil, and try to foil his evil plot. But that's not the only trouble Powers faces, for throughout the movie Austin must deal with issues with dad, who was a neglectful father in childhood.The comedy is of a slightly different style, while instead of the classic slapstick style Powers comedy Goldmember uses pop-culture references and current events to leave you in stitches, including Getting Down with Brittney Spears and Rapping with Dr. Evil.I highly suggest this movie to anyone who wants a good laugh and enjoys some good old family fun!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>with the second Austin Powers film. Say you have $10 and you're trying to decide whether you should go see this movie or buy a quart of cheap Scotch. My advice? Buy the Scotch; at least when the Scotch is gone you'll be drunk and the next morning you won't remember anything. Avoid this, and any Austin Powers move you get near, and you'll be fine.(Note: this is in now way an advocacy for the abuse of alcohol and should be take as purely illustrative of how bad this movie was.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Third film in and still fresh and funny. Huge achievement in itself.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This third instalment in the Austin Powers series is yet another lively and colourful trip around the madcap imagination of creator Mike Myers. Although many have brought Myers to task for repeating gags from the previous films, there's enough new material and characters to keep the good ship Powers sailing happily through it's 94minute runtime. As was the case in the previous Powers films, it's the eccentric Dr Evil who generates the bulk of the laughs and he's joined this time by the title character Goldmember, a 'freaky-deaky' Dutch roller-skate enthusiast with a penchant for eating his own peeling skin. Also joining the fun is pop sensation Beyonce Knowles as Foxxy Cleopatra, Austin's obligatory female companion. Knowles is pure girl power and has good presence and energy in a role that mainly limits her to reacting to gags. The film starts with it's usual burst of energy, but what makes this introduction stand out is a series of inspired cameos by a selection of Hollywood A- listers. But the icing on the cake in terms of casting has to be the inclusion of Michael Caine as Austin's estranged father, Nigel Powers. Not since Sean Connery showing up as Indiana Jones' dad in 'The Last Crusade' has a an actor felt quite so right for a part. Caine clearly relishes the opportunity to have fun and it really shows. So, and with great credit due, Myers and his team have done the impossible and created yet another funny addition to their hit series. Sure there's repeat gags, but when this much fun is being had, it's better to just get swept along</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Little Bit of a Let-Down...but..still funny !!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This, the third installment of the Austin Powers series--energized by the very hilarious Mike Myers--is a little bit of a letdown. It did not have the same energy as the two installments that preceded it, and--despite the addition of some good cast members...it would seem that Myers started to run low on gas with this one ( or as Austin would shout after a photo session: "I'm Spent !!"). Beyonce had good screen presence as the composite character "Foxxy Browne", an obvious throw-back to the so-called "Blaxploitation" flicks of the 70s. Myers even drives a "Pimp-mobile" and dresses in the fashion of "Super-fly". But, there is no on-going romantic connection with Austin and Foxxy, and that is a bit of a bummer...especially after having seen Austin feed directly off the energies of Vanessa in flick one, and Felicity Shagwell in flick two. To-day's audiences are more accepting of an interracial on-screen love affair than ever before, so I am wondering why that was not written in as part of the story. But it hurt for Austin not to have an on-going relationship so that he could engage in his usual bravado concerning his "Mojo". (If Muddy Waters is watching from Blues Heaven, he is laughing his head off at that !!) "Goldmember" is a character based on "Goldfinger", and Mike has to play four roles in this film...quite a bit of work...maybe he got in over his head trying to balance Austin, Dr Evil, Fat Bastard, and Goldmember. I have to say that Goldmember has some habits that really grossed me out, and he is one character that I am not especially fond of, though he is funny more often than not. And then there are some twists...Mini-Me defects to MOD, Mike Caine comes aboard as Austin's father, Scott loses his hair...sometimes I think the film wants to take itself seriously...and it is not the kind of film that should take itself seriously. The utter reckless abandon was not there, and the comedy seemed to be a bit more forced and more contrived than before. And, of course, Myers seems to have run out of steam at certain points. I can watch the first two films over and over...they are incredibly funny...but Goldmember, I have watched only once or twice. It doesn't do for me what the first two films do. But it does have funny moments, and I would recommend it, though not as highly as the first two.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A horrible mix of bad acting, unfunny jokes, a plot that makes the Mario Bros. Movie look like Citizen Kane and some of the rudest and most pointless scenes ever. I saw this movie expecting something funny that would spoof the excellent Bond series but what I got was more how I imagine an adult film to be. You wouldn't know it was supposed to spoof James Bond as nothing Bond-like is present. The characters are boring and remarkable but not in a good way. The jokes are corny and are just vulgar. If you haven't already been cursed by its awfulness then skip this movie at all costs.I recommend this movie to someone that enjoys stuffing their face and then going on fairground rides a million times eventually being sick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not another sequel "Possible spoilers"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in 1997 Austin Powers came out and well it did good and the box-office and in 1999 the cheesy sequel appeared out of nowhere.Then there was this travesty of a film in 2002. The original had class,it was a fresh idea about a agent from the 60's frozen only to reapper in the 90's to fight his arch nemesis.Sure they jokes were'nt hilarious but they were original and being a spoof of James Bond,it contained subtle and unsubtle references to the series.Then "The Spy who Shagged Me" came out an it was okay.Now that Mike Myers played three characters there was a few more jokes and Mini-me.Slowly the jokes became more desperate fart jokes(Although though one or two were humorous)until eventually the "Dr.Evil spaceship" came along and then I finally gave up on the film. "Goldmember" was the worst of the bunch(What with Beyonce Knowles involved)and there was even more dumb jokes one after another(Okay I did laugh at the spoof joke with Gwenyth Paltrow,Tom Cruise,etc.because that was funny).Unfortunatley it was by the time that Britney Spears appear I knew things were going to get worse(Oh where to start!) Firstly there was the whole "Daddy wasn't There crap" and suddenly theres the Fook sisters.Next was the school for secret agents which just happens to have all the main characters from the last two films oh! and whats this another time machine,an annoying guy with peeling skin(plus poor speech and constantly declaring "I'm dutch!!" a la european stereotypes).The we had to see a horrible rendition of "It's a hardknock life"(Ooh!!Isn't that Ben Savage and some cheap mole jokes),a disturbing scene in jail between Myers and Sterling(By the way the interragation scene with the subtitles,it was unnecessary for Beyonce to read them out loud),a unforgiving godzilla joke and a repeat of the "spaceship" joke mentioned earlier(Like we need The Osbournes cameo just to remind us that).Micheal Caine on the other hand plays his role very well as usual but dosn't save this excuse for a movie.Now with Seth Green as a possible villian and Demi Moore in talks I sleep more restless each night until this turkey(Please God!Just to teach them not to make more sequels)is out in the cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's funny ? but is very hit and misses ? with too many misses and not enough good hits</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Austin powers is called in when it becomes clear when a master villain Dr Evil has teamed up with 1970's villain Goldmember to use a tractor beam to drag a gold meteor into a collision with the earth. As insurance against Powers, Dr Evil kidnaps Power's dad and transports him back to the 70's to Goldmember's lair. While attempting to rescue his dad Powers meets Foxy Cleopatra and the two travel back to 2002 to try and foil the two evil madmen.I love the first two films and love this type of humour. However here I felt that it was far too hit and miss ? with way to many misses to be good. The plot tries to do way too much and we have too much going on to fit into a 90 minutes film. However plot has never been important in this type of thing as long as the jokes keep coming.However the comedy is hit and miss ? not a bad thing, but this has more misses than hits, with many jokes just getting a smile or silence and less getting good laughs. Part of the reason is that the characters have travelled their distance. Powers' shtick was tired in the second film (hence the greater focus on Evil), even Evil isn't as funny as he has been and Fat B*stard and Goldmember are unfunny and very unwelcome. Only three characters really are welcome. Cleopatra is good because she's a lot more lively than the other Powers girls, Nigel Powers is good and then Mini-Me.Mini-Me was one of the best thing about the film ? he was consistently funny with Dr Evil. The same is true here, every time he's on the screen the film is funny ? especially a running gag where he gets hurt in very funny ways! The reliance on unfunny characters (Goldmember) and characters who have started to reach the end of their road (Powers, Fat B*stard) means much of this is unfunny. Another fault is that a lot of the repeat jokes from the other films aren't funny this time round.One of my main complaints was the fact that the series just seemed to inflated on itself ? hence we had tonnes of star cameos, the majority of which weren't funny?.like we're supposed to laugh just cause Brittany Spears comes onto the screen?! However I am being hard on it and the film does have plenty of good things. It is funny in many places, but when I saw it in a full cinema the majority of the film had only a few titters or (even worse!) almost total silence! However like I said there was plenty of good scenes where the place was roaring ? just not enough!The cast are mixed. Myers can't play that many characters and with many he has nothing left to do. Dr Evil was the best thing in part 2 but here he redoes a lot of his old jokes ? some are still very funny but it just feels like old ground. Likewise with Powers ? and Fat B*stard was an unwelcome addition last time, never mind this time. As Goldmember he has a few funny lines but he is a waste of space. York is little used, but Caine has a good time and most of his stuff is pretty funny. Green overdoes it and his new material (becoming evil) isn't very funny. Likewise a lot of the star cameos don't work ? simply because we're supposed to fall over ourselves at the sight of a big star, it works in the opening sequence (well mostly) but after that it's tired.The best of the cast are tw big surprises. Firstly who'd have thought that Verne Troyer's Mini-Me would have so completely stolen the show! He was hilarious and he manages to be hilarious despite not speaking once! Also Knowles herself was really good ? she does a good double take and did well with the comedy, I was surprised as I thought she'd be terrible. However I didn't like the whole `OTT ethnic stereotype' that she did ? all clicking fingers and moving head etc, but in fairness ? that was her character. Also se was so much hotter than any of the other girls in the other films!Overall this is funny in a hit and miss way. However it has more misses and half-hits than it has hits. Now that may be OK from a small spoof released on video ? but from a big budget series you definitely don't want to sit in a cinema where the gaps left for audience laughter are only filled with silence. I assume they'll do a fourth ? lets just hope they learn from the mistakes they made here.</fullReview>

It was like a whole bunch of un-funny comedy sketches "tied" together. I cant even begin to talk about the plotholes, there was just too many. Like, where was Goldmember for almost 30 minutes in the middle of the movie, after he was already brought in. He just disappeared. And the Fat Bastard loosing all his weight, and having extra skin, wasnt funny at all. But, like I tell all people, "go see the "movie" if you're an Austin Powers fan, just dont expect to like it".

		<shortDescription>Very old and oh so tired.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Were the first two Austin Powers movies funny or GOOD enough to merit a second sequel? NO, and this installment proves it with some of the most tired jokes and bad acting seen in recent history. You'd think that since this is the 3rd movie, they'd try to create some original laughs. While they do introduce two new characters (that aren't funny in the least) the jokes have been recycled from the first two Austin Powers "films" and quite a few other comedies from the past. Basically what we get is a much worse Austin Powers. Yes, I said worse if you can imagine that.Mike Myers shtick as Powers is simply old and no longer (if it were ever) funny. "Goldmember" one of the new characters, is so unfunny its pathetic. His whole punch line is that 1.) he skates 2.) he can contort his body in all sorts of odd positions and 3.) he's evil. Beyonce Knowles is even unfunnier. She needs acting lessons, bottom line. Her comic timing is so off that it's pathetic, I even felt embarrassed for her. Stick with what you can do half way good, sing. Notice I said "half way" (I'm trying to be nice).Everything here is old. That oh so witty father/son banter between Dr. Evil and Scott is so tired and lame, it just got on my nerves after a while. This movie shows without a doubt how tired Austin Powers is. I just hope the public notices and there isn't yet another sequel then God help us all...Austin Powers 3 is simply 90 minutes of complete and utter stupidity that isn't funny for 1 micro second. Skip it! If you want REAL comedy rent The Jerk.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Goldmember isnt as good as the other 2 Austin Powers films. The jokes seem very strained, and apart from a few funny bits, especially a piece in the doctors office, the film never entertains as often as the others. The Goldmember character just doesnt work, Austin Powers himself seems to be struggling badly for any new gags leaving the still brilliant Dr Evil and Mini Me to offer the only funny parts. Although the plot was never the biggest part of these films, Mike Myers seems to have hit a complete dead end. Michael Caine isnt funny, Beyonce does her best in a part that allows little opportunity to be funny. The Fat Bastard character should have been left out, and the name dropping and product placement is way over the top. The opening scene contains a number of famous people such as Tom Cruise, Kevin Spacey and Britney Spears but the musical opening just doesnt work. I thought the film was poor. The jokes have ran dry. Mike Myers needs to move on because he is better than trying out old jokes again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tired and distinctly unfunny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some reviewers on the Internet have said that the opening scene of Goldmember is absolutely hilarious and likely the best part of the movie. From then on, they said, the film's jokes hit home less and less.The audience was silent through the opening scene of Goldmember when I saw it. They remained silent for the rest of the film. Those reviewers on the Internet were partially correct. The film did go downhill from the start, but the start was terribly unfunny itself. I liked the first film and the second was mediocre. What is good about the third one, Goldmember? The new female role is played well unlike the previous film. Verne Troyer gives a strong performance...well that's about it. The actor playing Austin's dad is great, but he's given nothing. As other reviewers have said, it was a mistake to make him exactly like Austin (just older). The humor has sunk to lower levels than before with NO intelligence to it. Sometimes films can make that work (Naked Gun and the like). Not this one. They reuse jokes from previous Austin Powers. That would be fine if they were still funny. They aren't anymore. It's now like a Saturday Night Live skit that needs to die. I could say more about this abysmal wreck of a film, including it's ridiculous ending, but it isn't worth giving a point by point critique.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here we are into the third installment of "Austin Powers" and sadly it is wearing thin. We don't have the same originality that the first one brought or the usually funny jokes. Now while the ideas were good and it seemed strong, it just didn't give.The beginning is classic and it seemed like this was going to be great. I mean, we have Tom Cruise playing Austin Powers, Kevin Spacey as Dr. Evil, John Travolta as Goldmember, and Danny Devito as Mini Me in the Austin Powers movie! Just great and brilliant. But then the actual movie starts, Felicity is not here for no explained reason and Austin is single. Leading him to Foxxy Cleopatra, played by Beyonce and is way too stereotypical. Fat Bastard is also back and tries too hard with his disgusting jokes that fall flat.Dr. Evil is still pretty funny, but again just loosing his touch. We have a brilliant idea of Michael Caine as Austin's dad, but it's a hit and miss with Caine's dull performance. Goldmember, also played by Myers, is just too disgusting and tries too hard to impress the audience as another funny villain. Scott has now decided to take over the family business, which takes his cool and unique style away. :( Mini Me is push aside then from Dr. Evil and he joins up with Austin to try again for that "shocking and ironic" laugh of him now being a Mini Austin. The ending is just ridicules.I'm sorry, this just didn't amuse me that much. The jokes were overused and not funny any more. There are too many stereotypical performances in here and the only thing worth watching is the beginning with the amazing cameo's. That was unforgettable, but the rest is just a skip. So, pass on this one, guys, it's not worth your time really.6/10-and 4 points of that goes to the beginning!</fullReview>

Now it may not suit everybody's taste but just so long as you don't watch it expecting a plot or story that flows, you will have one hell of a laugh! All the old gags are present and they STILL seem to work! Beyonce Knowles is extremely Foxy and the cameos from the likes of Steven Spielberg and Britney Spears are worth every penny. Honestly, watch this film if you love Austin Powers as there is plenty of energy left in the franchise and hopefully enough to keep it going many more years.The only downside to the film is that you can't remember every classic scene and every joke. Still, a good excuse to watch it again!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This in all honesty has to be one of the worst films ever made. The "humor" consists of bathroom, sex, and grossness gags which aren't in any way made funny, but are just presented for us to laugh at because they are obscene. Most people over the age of eight won't break into giggles at this sort of thing. I'm not speaking out of any puritanical objection to grossness in itself in a film: there is a long tradition of comic grossness in art, but for grossness to be comic, you have to do something with it. This film doesn't. If there were an academy award booby prize, Goldmember would deserve it. Advisory: the "sexual innuendo, crude humor and language" which give the film its PG-13 rating are all too idiotic to be very harmful to anyone of any age. The New Line Entertainment DVD transfer is very good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Myers picked the right time to call it a day</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's easy to forget that the first time the world was introduced to Mike Myers' wonky-toothed and bespectacled British superspy back in 1997 with Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery, precious few people went to see it. The film eventually gathered a huge following when it was released on VHS, and the formula was recycled again for the smash-hit sequel, The Spy Who Shagged Me (1999). The character and his arch-nemesis Dr. Evil are now so ingrained in popular culture that it's quite bizarre to think that you could once shout "oh, behave!" or "yeah, baby!" at a friend to receive a look of utter bewilderment in return.The franchise proved so popular that its two sequels repeated the same gags and failed to really move the story on. Despite this obvious flaw, The Spy Who Shagged Me and the (as of 2016) final instalment Goldmember still managed to generate enough belly laughs to give them a pass, often relying on the irresistible comedic charm of its star Mike Myers. However, it was clear that the series was running out of steam by the time number 3 came around, as Goldmember remains the least funny of the trilogy, introducing a forgettable baddie in the form of the titular gold-obsessed, skin-munching Dutch supervillain, also played by Myers.Yet the film kicks off with the greatest gag of all the movies. Just as we think we're watching an over-the-top set-piece from one of Austin's missions, its soon revealed to be a movie within a movie, with Tom Cruise wearing the spectacles and Kevin Spacey as Dr. Evil. We are then treated to the expectedly ridiculous, but entirely endearing, opening dance sequence, this time involving Britney Spears. Its a level of hilarity that the remainder of the movie sadly fails to maintain. For the first time we get to meet Austin's father in the form of Michael Caine, and Beyonce Knowles donning an impressive afro and plenty of sass as Foxxy Cleopatra, in a loving tribute to blaxploitation.The bulk of the movie consists of the characters being restrained by their own eccentricities, which after two previous movies starts to stretch the humour a bit thin. Like Fat Bastard from the second entry, Goldmember is a one-joke character when the joke isn't that funny to begin with. His innuendos and disgusting habit repulse to the point of being simply unpleasant. Its at its best when it sticks to what made the franchise so lovable to begin with - the Bond pastiches. There's a ludicrous masterplan in there somewhere and the scenes in which Austin and Evil go face-to-face are as priceless as ever, but when Myers tries to insert some dramatic weight to the mix involving Austin's daddy issues the movie starts to drag. By the end, its clear that he picked the right time to wave goodbye to his most successful character (although he hasn't had much luck since).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Austin Powers in Goldmember (2002): Dir: Jay Roach / Cast: Mike Myers, Verne Troyer, Beyonce Knowles, Michael Caine, Seth Green: The series may be running out of mojo for Goldmember lacks the freshness of the first film and duplicates jokes that were already repeated in the second film. Goldmember is a slang term and the name of the villain who kidnaps Austin's father Nigel and brings him back to 1975. Standard fare but director Jay Roach reveals the origins of Powers and Evil. Mike Myers brings energy as the sex-craving secret agent and the absented-minded Dr. Evil. Austin feels disappointed at the absence of his father. Dr. Evil goes to prison, and we learn more family secrets. Myers also portrays the new villain Goldmember. Verne Troyer goes through growth as Mini-Mi who joins Evil in prison but will question his worth when Evil's son Scott takes a step up. Beyonce Knowles is underwritten as Foxy Cleopatra who appears as an agent in 1975. She serves little purpose other than to parody classic Pam Grier roles. Michael Caine as Nigel is a pleasure and inspired casting despite the predicted resolution. He is kidnapped by Goldmember but feels hardly fazed. Seth Green also returns as Scott Evil with an interesting transformation of his own. Despite its recycled vulgarity the production is colourful and pointlessly amusing. In its 70's galore.

		<fullReview>Goldmember completes the Austin Powers franchise with little more than a nod to the 1st and 2nd films. The story's recycled again, Dr. Evil (Myers) insists on world domination, Austin Powers (Myers) awkwardly saves the day. It's not rocket science. Myers is up to his usual tricks; Evil garners the most laughs and Powers is, well, Powers. Mini Me gets the discriminated, but they're still just as funny. The 3rd installment sees two new inclusions, Beyonce Knowles's Bond-esque girl Foxxy Cleopatra, who lacks the emotional pull that Heather Graham had, and Michael Caine as Austin Powers' father, Nigel Powers, who fits his role suitably. Myers' Goldmember and the returning Fat Bastard fair less better. Still, Myers carries on doing what he does best, and that's making (most) viewers laugh.Check out my other reviews on http://straighttelling.co.uk</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining end to the zany trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mike Meyer's three Austin Powers flicks parody James Bond and the swinging 60s-70s. They are as follows: "Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery" (1997), "Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me" (1999) and "Austin Powers in Goldmember" (2002). What's interesting about these films is that Austin Powers (the character) is not a full spoof of 007 as he's his own character, just with Bond-like qualities.Anyway, I wasn't sure I wanted to review any these flicks because, by doing so, I'm admitting that I actually watched them (lol)! I say this because they're so goofy, juvenile, silly, sometimes raunchy (more verbally than pictorially) and filled with toilet humor. So I was never a fan and didn't even watch any of them until 2009. What turned me off? Besides the toilet humor and raunch, Powers (the character) seemed to have a gayish quality despite being a renowned ladies man in the stories. A good example is when he says, "Oh, beHAAAve," which never struck me as funny, just gay.I've since seen all three twice and, despite my reservations about Powers and distaste for toilet humor, I do enjoy the zaniness and stoo-pid humor. If you can catch a grip with these films they're laugh-out-loud funny about a third of the time, sometimes more depending on the movie."Goldmember" is my second favorite of the trilogy behind "The Spy Who Shagged Me." It has the best opening, by far, with unexpected cameos and the first half is often laugh-out-loud funny. If it kept up the laughs it would've taken first prize, but the second half loses its mojo, while still being likable and amusing. Beyoncé takes the place of Heather Graham as Austin's babe while Fred Savage plays Number Three and Michael Caine appears in a pretty significant role.Best quote: "Riiiiiiigggghhhttt." The film runs 94 minutes and was shot in Southern California; Reno, Nevada; Moab, Utah; and England.GRADE: B</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bronze effort for the Gold one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The second Austin Powers film was that rarest of sequels which was actually better (or at least on a par!) with the first. Therefore, the third instalment, aka 'Goldmember' had a lot to live up to. Does it? Just.Despite all its efforts, it isn't quite as good as its predecessor. It does come close, but the jokes have a 'recycled' feel to them and the new baddie (Goldmember himself) isn't a patch on Dr Evil. And now the two of them have to share screen time, therefore you still get the major laughs from Dr Evil and Mini Me, whereas you only get a couple of amusing catchphrases from the Gold Dutchman.But, this is just light-hearted entertainment at its best. It doesn't try to be anything too deep and meaningful and, if you liked the first two, you should enjoy this, too. If you've never seen an Austin Powers movie before, this is probably the wrong place to start. You're probably best to start at the beginning and if you like that one, try the next two.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funniest of all three. Why it has such a low rating, I'll never know. Well, actually, I do know....but I disagree with most people....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It would appear that Austin Powers in Goldmember is the "worst" of all three? No, it actually isn't. In fact, it definitely isn't. I find it to be the funniest, clearest and brightest of all three; and to be honest, I don't really like the first one, I find it rather idiotic in an annoying, 90s kind of way, with bad cinematography and unlovable characters. Whereas, the Spy who Sh***** me was somewhat funnier, with a vast range of characters; including Mini Me and Fat Ba*****. Then came my favourite: Austin Powers in Goldmember. Funnier, clearer, has even BETTER actors and an even bigger range of characters; a mountainous range of characters, i must add. Better cinematography, better characters; more characters too, funnier things taking place, more laughs and more fun; Austin Powers in Goldmember is a great film and i always laugh when watching it. It never gets old.If i were to rate the film out of 10, i would have to score it a solid and deserving 8.5 - and it definitely deserves that; at least i think anyway. Mike Myers is very funny in it; and he does a great job portraying various, related characters - enough to make the film even better; which it does.....it does. So there you have it. Yet another positive review from me. Hope you liked reading it; and more importantly, hopefully i have provided you with enough comment on the film for your excitement to reach maximum, thus edging you more to watch it. Thank you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loses Some of the Previous Films Charm but Still Laugh Out Loud Funny,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Austin Powers in Goldmember is a great movie with a good storyline line a top notch cast and of course fantastic characters.I certainly don't think it offers as much entertainment as the previous film,the Spy who Shagged Me Did,although I do prefer it to the first.I felt this one repeated jokes from the second one too many times,but parts when it didn't are mostly hilarious.The films cast is the finest of all three,one if the most memorable scenes is when they get high profile actors to play ye characters (Tom Cruise as Austin,Kevin Spacey as Dr Evil,etc.),I was very impressed with the actors they got to make quick cameos,it was short but very funny.Mike Myers is certainly no problem in this movie,the third time around and he is still clearly interested and enjoying playing these characters,and I truly love seeing him as Austin Powers,Dr Evil,among others,his range of characters and voices is comedy gold.Fans of the last two Austin Powers movies should certainly enjoy Goldmember.In order to save his father (Michael Caine),Austin (Mike Myers) must travel back to the 70's and defeat the evil Goldmember (Mike Myers) and of course his arch nemesis Dr Evil (Mike Myers).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael Caine great but Goldmember not funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dr. Evil and MiniMe escape from prison and team up with Goldmember to flood the world by using a tractor beam to pull a meteor down to melt the polar ice cap. Goldmember has kidnapped Austin's father Nigel Powers (Michael Caine). Meanwhile Austin also travels back in time to 1975 to stop Dr. Evil and Goldmember.Michael Caine is a great addition. Beyoncé Knowles is not as good. The problem I have is Goldmember. He's very creepy, very weird, and not very funny. Fat Bastard does return and he's the good kind of weirdly funny as oppose to Goldmember. Mike Myers continues to add new interesting originality to this franchise. I just wish he could rewrite Goldmember or maybe just skip him altogether. And it's great to see MiniMe get a good important side story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hardly sparkling, nor indeed worth its weight, Goldmember has its amusing moments but limps in the long-run</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Austin Powers in Goldmember" brings the curtain down on a mostly unremarkable series, something which exploded into life with an often funny spoof of spy films whose most interesting parts were when it juxtaposed life in the 60's with life in the 90's via subtle montages. It gave way to a sequel which ought not ever even existed such was its often intolerably lax nature, but Goldmember is a film which, to an extent, brings the franchise back. This is very much the sequel "The Spy Who Shagged Me" should have been, with Elizabeth Hurley's character from the first one perhaps returning to fill the role of the female accomplice; the time travel element removed and everything else remaining the same. Distancing itself from its roots was a brave thing for Goldmember to do, but distancing itself from the likes of the 1999 sequel was almost mandatory ? thus, Jay Roach's 2002 second sequel is here stuck in a precarious position although just about manages to find a way out of it.The film will begin loudly and bombastically, in a manner that suits most fatuous Hollywood action movies, via its aesthetic and general content. For a franchise to be synonymous with the Bond films, I view this as a slight on more contemporary entries and how devoid of character and charm they are in the opinion of the makers: spoofing Oddjob and the idea of a hunched, cat stroking villain in a swivel chair is good fun out of the fact these people and their characteristics are so distinct and charming ? fast-forward to what we're expected to spoof through the likes of "Tomorrow Never Dies" or "The World is Not Enough" and much is lost. How are you meant to riff on something which is so action orientated and without the sort of soul evident in the films of the 60s? But the film is not even a "The Player" take on what goes on behind the backlots of Los Angeles, filthy money grabbing cameos-and-all. Nay, for what we get is yet another entry which appears to be bored of Dr. Evil as the villain (before changing its mind); appears to be bored of the 60's and thus sees the 70's as an ideal setting (before changing its minds for the 2000's) and wants to throw in this quasi-deep father/son relationship subplot which, around all the action and in true "Last Crusade" style, is meant to see us all sigh in recognition that two men of the same name finally come together and accept each another.The chief difference in this third film compared to the others lies with its villain, Mike Myers' own Goldmember, a send up of 1964 smash Bond hit "Goldfinger". But where's the sense in sending up one of the most loved; most cherished Bond villains, about whom mostly nobody has anything nasty things to say? Spoofs are supposed to send up the relatively unloved; the often derided, the derivative and the easily mocked. Here, Goldmember is a world-hating; skin flake consuming abomination of a much admired former villain who speaks mock-Dutch and has suffered genital pratfalls. For a while, and with Myrers' other creation Dr. Evil behind bars, it looks like things are heading in the sorts of fresh directions with this fresh villain and the time setting of the 70's which was sorely required three years earlier. Alas, the film welches and it isn't long until we're back into a familiar groove whereby an African American character called Foxy Cleopatra (Knowles) is filling the female void whilst paying homage to a movement of films the target audience won't even have heard of. At one point, Knowles' character (herself an agent) is brought forward to the then present of 2002 ? how does she react to this revelation? Why, by laughing at an Internet video of a monkey falling off a tree.I read somewhere that Myers based his performance of Powers on that of Michael Caine's in his 1966 breakthrough role "Alfie" ? look closely at Powers in that first one and you will see scraps of Caine's Harry Palmer character as espionage and British spy films of the 60's are parodied. I mention this out of the fact Caine appears in this entry as Nigel, Austin's father. In a franchise that needed to expand, Caine's suave take on a former top agent and the material they give him is, admittedly, somewhat amusing. The way in which he points out how useless anonymous henchmen often are when the time comes for them to take on the hero in these sorts of films not only cracks a good observational joke but tees up further changes another character will undertake when Nigel's capabilities in psychological warfare are applied.Social critique was never the reason anyone tuned in to an Austin Powers film, but that doesn't mean there weren't instances of it in previous entries. Here, an amusing 'dance off' between Powers (with his group of 60s go-go dancers) and Britney Spears highlights an inherent clash in attitudes towards music of the then-and-now. Through Spears, we observe the highly provocative and heavily sexualised route contemporary popular music has undergone over the decades. Her backup singers are topless, everybody's clothing is black and leather invoked ? things are much more aggressive. On the other side of the stage, Myers initiates a mock-fisticuffs session with Spears wherein his clothed, bubble-gum and seemingly normal troupe of flower-power girls and boys do battle to a thumping musical soundtrack as these two very distinct eras of music and attitudes towards dancing and music play out. The sequence isn't anything important plot-wise, but it's one of the best of the trilogy and proof that there is something at the centre of the whole Austin Powers idea which was always there, but just never quite tapped into. The film, like the series as a whole, is colourful and energetic but ultimately a bit drab and often inconsequential.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ran out of ideas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having recently revisited the Austin Powers franchise, it was abundantly clear within 10 minutes that this 3rd offering was not up to par. In fact, I would go as far as to say this instalment was a mistake by all involved.Here are some reasons that stand out: 1) Poorly recycled jokes from the previous films at nearly every opportunity. I get they were trying to tie them together in an attempt to make it funny, but it just highlighted how they had run out of good ideas.2) The Fat Bastard cameos were neither welcome nor warranted. The character was best left as he was and the attempts to 'humanise' him fell flat. The film did not need him.3) Goldmember was not a good new character.Poorly thought out.4) The 'mole' incident was excruciating and went on too long, and shouldn't have happened multiple times! 5) Mini Me changing sides, and dressing up as Austin was rather annoying.6) They ran out of ideas for Scott Evil and so by making him evil ruined his character. The lasting image of him doing 'the laugh' sums this up.7) The 70'sish scenes were too over the top, even for a film like this, and didn't feel as believable or as fun as the 60's from the first films.8) I know that these films were never meant to be plot driven, but the previous two flowed better and were not just about the gags. This 1 felt like it ditched the story somewhat to focus on an all out assault.9) The 'Just the Two of Us' scene from 'The Spy Who Shagged Me' was fun and surprising, and felt natural. The follow up here of 'Hard Knock Life' was exactly the opposite, considering they were in a prison. It felt forced and was overly annoying.10) Beyonce's character added little to the film beyond adding clichéd 70'sness.11) Michael Caine?! Michael Caine as Austin's dad was pointless and didn't need to be there. His character was completely unnecessary.12) The cameos were far too excessive and only to show off who they could fit into the film. They didn't fit nicely with the film.13) The 'Silence of The Lambs' parody was AWFUL! Rant over! At least I had more fun writing that than I did watching this film.I heard there was talks of a 4th film but this may or may not ever happen. If it did I still have enough respect for the franchise to check it out. However, this was a complete mess, and if it was anything like this then it will be ruined forever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beyonce was a terrible choice..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beyonce was a terrible choice as a "Power's Girl" and it kind of ruined the entire movie for me. She's really not that pleasant to look at, not to mention her acting was very obnoxious. I think the movie would have been gold (super corny pun intended) if they had cast just about anybody else to play the part of Foxxy Cleopatra. Everything else about the movie was great just every time she spoke I wanted to stab my eardrums until I became deaf and every time she came on screen I wanted to put my steel toe boot through the TV. Now for the spacer because apparently this retarded excuse for a movie website doesn't think I can get my opinion of this film across in less than 10 lines. Strange, isn't it? Well that puts me up to the limit. It's been real. Thanks for reading.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but not the best of the bunch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Granted the opening is the best of the trilogy, but then it doesn't hold up to the first two. I never found the character of Goldmember funny. He's just a weird guy who makes a movie or disco reference and then says the name of what he is referencing. And this is also the decade where penis jokes were wearing thin. It was funny in the 70's and 80's, the 90's they got tiresome, in the 2000's it's like "Okay, enough." The joke where Fat Bastard talks about his terrible problem with obesity, sad music plays and then he farts worked in the second film, but in this movie, we saw it coming. Then he describes what the fart smells like. That's not funny.Yeah, there's many moments where it just Mike ad-libbing and it gets put in the movie. The filmmakers may have found it funny, but the audience doesn't. It's times where it's like the filmmakers only care about what they want, instead of the audience. Which what you're supposed to be doing if you're a filmmaker.The object in space that looks like a private part was funny in the second film but here, not so much. And the joke about the mole is just not funny.However, the movie is fun and fast paced, the score was great and it was just epic. I like it when silly comedies get epic. The joke about the subtitles was hysterical, the scene where Austin and Mini-me are behind the screen was hysterical, Beyonce was really good as Foxxy and yes I was surprised at the twist at the end. I went to see this film twice. The second time, I saw it with my friend and his jaw dropped opened at that scene.Is it the best of the three? No, I think the second film is the funniest. It is hugely enjoyable, but far from Groovy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Surprisingly, this was my favorite Austin Powers movie out of the series while it seems to be the least favorite of everyone else.Many of the jokes are rehashed, and while funny, were still not as funny as the first time they are used. Despite this, I feel this movie came up with a decent amount of new jokes and stupid circumstances which I thought were incredibly hilarious.The acting was once again good enough for what the movie achieved.I think that this was a fitting end for the conclusion of the series. The jokes about Austin Powers are definitely reaching their end, but I think that this series gave enough good laughs for it to be worthy to watch by someone who hasn't seen it before.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So the first and second films in the Austin Powers were pretty funny. It parodied the inherent camp of the old 007 films of the 60's and 70's making Mike Myers a huge star. This was the third film he starred in as the character and it shows it's age. The "Yeah, baby" catchphrase was old and there's only so much of one actor playing a bunch of unfunny one liner characters you can watch. It seems these days if you want to see a comedian trying to hard to be funny then look for a fat suit or other outrageous costume and multiple roles in one film. The saddest thing is when viewing a movie like this is that you know Mike Myers is capable of something better. He's a versatile performer, a good writer and has shown some serious acting talent in films like 54. This movie came across as a desperate attempt at making money.</fullReview>

In this installment, Dr. Evil (Myers) and Mini-Me (Troyer) escape from prison and kidnap Austin Powers' father, Nigel (Caine). They travel back in time to 1975 where they join forces with goofy Dutch businessman, Goldmember (Myers) who is obsessed with gold. Austin (Myers) is sent to 1975 teaming up with agent, Foxxy Cleopatra (Knowles) to stop them. Soon, Mini-Me decides to turn on Dr. Evil after he and Scott (Green) get close. Savage plays Number 3 who is a new member of Austin's organization, York returns as Basil, Wagner returns as Number 2 and Sterling returns as Frau. Myers also plays Dr. Evil's henchman, Fat Bastard who appeared in the last film. This is a good comedy sequel, Myers, Caine &amp; Knowles are great and I recommend this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Austin Powers in Goldmember', the third installment of the Austin Powers series, is, without a doubt, the funniest installment among all. Also, Mike Myers, reprises his previous characters, along-with Goldmember, most entertainingly. 'Austin Powers in Goldmember' Synopsis: Upon learning that his father has been kidnapped, Austin Powers must travel to 1975 and defeat the aptly-named villain Goldmember - who is working with Dr. Evil.Like it's prequel, 'Austin Powers in Goldmember' too is over-the-top and silly. But, like the prequels, it's entertaining nonetheless. I truly found this film as hilarious. I had a complete blast. And what I admired, was the fact, that, I had seen this film years back and even after 9-long years, it still continues to make me laugh hysterically. I am not saying that is Great Cinema, but definitely, memorable &amp; light-hearted cinema, that genuinely entertains. Mike Myers &amp; Michael McCullers Screenplay is over-the-top, zany &amp; nuts. But, throughly entertaining &amp; funny. Also, the character of Sir Michael Caine, who plays Austin Powers' Dad, is extremely likable. Jay Roach's Direction, relies completely on the gags &amp; the performances. Cinematography, Editing &amp; Art Design, are good. Performance-Wise: Mike Myers entertains in all the characters he portrays. As Austin Powers, he gets it right, as Goldmember, he is amusing, as Fat-Bastard, he is expectedly creepy, but is simply incredible as Dr. Evil. Sir Michael Caine is outstanding as Austin Powers' Dad. Beyoncé Knowles does a fair job. Seth Green is superb, as usual. Verne Troyer as Mini-Me, is funny. Michael York, Robert Wagner &amp; Fred Savage support well. On the whole, 'Austin Powers in Goldmember' is over-the-top, comedic cinema, at it's best. If you want to have a good-load of laughs, then don't dare to miss this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Austin Powers 3: Calling in Favors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 2002, the Austin Powers series officially ran out of steam with its third installment, GOLDMEMBER. I had enjoyed the series until this point, but it's come to a point where I can't defend it anymore. Everything that was funny about the series has been run into the ground and the third film relies mostly on tired gags and an excessive amount of cameos. I'm not kidding; there are no less than a dozen cameos in this movie. The filmmakers were wise enough to realize that another film with just Austin Powers vs. Dr. Evil wouldn't cut it, so they've branched out to include a new villain (played by none other than Mike Myers, of course). This time around Dr. Evil has teamed up with the "villainous" Goldmember to hold the world ransom once again with a tractor beam. The two plan on using the tractor beam to bring a massive golden asteroid to Earth and colliding it into the North Pole, thereby melting the ice caps and drowning the world's nations. To neutralize Austin Powers, Goldmember has kidnapped Austin's father and?what else?taken him back in time to the 1970s to keep him secure. So now it's up to Austin and 70s blaxploitation FBI partner Foxxy Cleopatra to rescue Austin's father and save the world from Dr. Evil's latest scheme.I'm pretty sure Mike Myers and director Jay Roach had just given up at this point. There's nothing in this movie that we haven't seen more than enough in the other films. Shadow gags? Sure. An evil lair with Dr. Evil's face plastered comically on the outside? Absolutely, but this time it's a submarine. Dr. Evil's social ineptitude leading to a hilariously misnamed evil plan? He's labeled his tractor beam project Preparation H. You decide. Musical numbers? Plenty. It's all the same jokes regurgitated in a new setting. Puns, fart jokes, and an abundance of pop culture references. A Japanese businessman named Mr. Roboto? You think they're setting up for a reference to the Styx song---oh, there it is. *cue rim shot* I would've been happier if they could've at least found a way to avoid the over-used time travel plot device. It was the major plot in the first movie as Austin is a 60's swinger displaced in modern times. In the second film, a modernized Austin travels back to the '60s and confronts the lifestyle he left behind. Here, it's not even important to the story. Goldmember transports Austin's father to the '70s, Austin travels back to find him, and five minutes later all of them have returned to modern times. Done. So what was the point of even including a time travel sequence? Because this is Austin Powers, and an Austin Powers movie isn't an Austin Powers movie without time travel. Plus it was the only way to work a 70's blaxploitation character into the plot. Convenient, eh?I don't hate this movie. I was just really disappointed that they couldn't break away from the mold and try to do something fresh to keep the series alive. Everyone just sort of phoned it in here and the franchise has become a joke. How in the world did they ever get Michael Caine to agree to this film? Granted, he's one of the best parts of the movie. Seriously, a lot of people must've owed the filmmakers favors. In the opening alone, we're given Tom Cruise, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kevin Spacey, Danny DeVito, Steven Spielberg, Quincy Jones, and Britney Spears. And this is before the movie even begins. Enough is enough. I really enjoyed the first two Austin Powers films and I would love to see the franchise continue, but only if they're going to try and make it fresh. Drop the old jokes and drop some of the old characters. I think we've had our fill of Fat Bastard and?I know I might be alone here?Mini-Me. Goldmember's already worn out his welcome as a new character. His entire character is supposed to be funny just because he's Dutch. Seriously, most of his lines are reminders that he's Dutch ("Isn't that veird?"). He's a one-note character. Well, two-note if you account for the fact that he eats his own peeling skin for some reason. That's funny, right? It's time to create some new characters to flesh out the Austin Powers world, even if it's just Myers in a new costume. Don't be afraid to experiment a bit, but please don't crap out another cash-grab as obvious as this one.</fullReview>

Though the plots differ nominally, the three separate parts of the trilogy are essentially the same movie with the same jokes just put in different order. But they're good jokes, and it's just as funny watching Myers and company deliver the same punch line for the third time as it was the first.Grade: B for the whole series</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Austin Powers movie series obviously runs out of steam, with it's third (and up to this point) final installment of the series. While many were glad to see him and although many would likely be watching a fourth part and therefor making it successful commercially, fortunately it was decided to stop here.While this movie isn't bad (especially comparing it to the recent flood of "spoof" movies) it still is obvious that it lacks the originality and power that it originally had. Mike Myers still goes all out (you could compare his passion and dedication to one Jim Carey, but the latter has shown, that he can change pace and character), you still won't get a great movie experience out of it. Watch it once and it's OK, but this definitely can't hold a repeat viewing</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>fairly good action comedy yet somewhat slow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently watched Austin Powers in Goldmember after waiting for months to be able to see it fully. I had heard positive comments about the film. I found it to be fairly entertaining with some good action sequences, but it also had a lot of weak parts which were boring and slow.If you want to see the film without knowing what takes place in the storyline then it is best to stop reading my review and go buy it and watch it, because my review HAS SPOILERS. However, if you want to know a little more about what takes in the film before you see it, then continue reading my review.The opening action sequence when Austin parachutes into a car was decent but not as exciting as the action sequences in movies like Terminator 3, X2 Xmen United, The Bourne Ultimatum, Live Free or Die Hard, or XXX state of the Union, but it is important to remember that this is an action comedy as well as a James Bond Parody but not an action thriller. I am now going to state to you in two separate paragraphs what I liked and what I didn't like as much.Some of the enjoyable scenes include the sumo fight where Fat Bastard sends his opponent flying in the air, the fight in the changing room where Austin fights with Fat Bastard, the meeting with Mr Roboto, the scene where Austin is urinating, the part where Austin and Foxy infiltrate the factory and rescue Nigel, the car chase through Tokyo,the roller disco club, the part where Nigel comes to the submarine layer, the scene where Austin and Foxy escape Goldmember's club with the girls shooting at them, the part when Austin and Mini Me are behind a screen door, and last but not least the part when Dr Evil and the prisoners sing "Hard Knock Life." Now it might sound like I enjoyed everything in the film but that is not true. There were many scenes that made the film feel bland and simple. Some of those scenes include the knighting ceremony, the scene where Austin visits Dr Evil in jail, the flashback at the academy, and the scene when Dr Evil realizes he is Austin's brother, and he turns good. These were some of the weak aspects of the film. Another problem with this movie was that some scenes had too much dialogue but not enough action. But some of it is funny, like Fahza and mole for instance.But I think everyone should watch Goldmember at least twice especially Austin Powers fans who enjoyed the first two movies.Wheather this film is worth owning depends on you. If you are a movie buff like me who loves non stop action blockbuster then it might not be the film that belongs in your collection but that is up to you. If you are an Austin fan who likes comedy movies and is a fan of the sixties spy films, then this would be a perfect film to include in your DVD collection. This would also be a good film to own if you are a person like me who wants to own a lot of DVDs.Overall, this was a good film to see. It was something different from the other films I see and had an equal share of good scenes as it did of bad scenes. Yes some parts of the movie are slow but that is because this is a James Bond parody and many of the Bond films were slow at times.I would like to end my review by saying that the best way to decide if this is a movie for you is by watching it.Good Luck and Have Fun</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reasonably funny sequel has a great beginning. Watchable at home</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Austin Powers movie has such an impressive start that I felt disappointed when it slipped back into juvenile jokes and filthy humor. A repeat viewing has led me to believe it is certainly no worse than the second film, even though it reuses many of the same themes. Some of the jokes are admittedly quite funny. Mike Myers remains in peak form and is funny both as Austin and as Dr Evil. He is however simply disgusting as 'Fat Bastard', and his 'Goldmember' character feels incomplete. Verne Troyer makes a return as Mini Me but the joke is getting stale now. Michael Caine is quite good though.Overall 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very decent comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Flashy, Funny, and Favorable when compared the the previous two installments.Austin Powers is pitted against Dr. Evil yet again to save his father (Caine) with the aid of Foxxy Cleopatra (Knowles). Michael Caine is a great addition to the series and brings a great amount of credibility to the character, not to mention the resemblance. Beyonce's performance is adequate, and Seth Green's character has a bit of a larger role, though I wish it was bigger because he is hilarious as Evil's son. Let's not forget to mention Fred Savage as "The Mole", a funny character that they made sure not to show us too often so the mole joke never dies. There are great cameos and an excellent production design (Evil's new submarine lair is by far the best).Bottom line is, if you like comedies that aren't dark or just plain silly, you'll like this movie because it is somewhere in between.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly Gilding the silly: Austin Powers in Goldmember</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Say anything three times and it's funny, according to the secret rules of sure-fire comedy (the same rules that say the word "chicken" is unfailingly a rib-tickler). Austin Powers in Goldmember, Mike Myers's third incarnation of his gormless but irrepressible swinging sixties British spy, really is pretty funny.After three movies and six years of the shagadelic, flouncy-shirted, buck-toothed homunculus and his ever-expanding cartoon world, it's become easier to surrender than resist. Place it against Men in Black or Mr. Deeds or any of a host of other barren summer comedies and the difference is obvious: Myers's sheer fertility of invention is of a different order, and even if he misses as often as he hits, he's definitely a swinger.Even if the gag-to-wince ratio isn't high, there are enough punchlines thrown here to make a sphinx smirk. Father, forgive me, I must confess: I sprayed my popcorn.Powers, the self-adoring spy whom Myers says he invented one day while riding back from hockey practice and listening to Dusty Springfield sing The Look of Love on the radio, is not so much a spy spoof (the sixties were already crawling with spy spoofs) as nostalgic sixties anglophilia: Think of it as James Bond crossed with the Carry-On Gang, or maybe Jerry Lewis imagining he's Cary Grant. The character(s) -- Myers plays four parts here, three of them villains -- finds that tightrope between enviable childish narcissism and obnoxiousness where much comedy struts.The successor to the massive success of the $200-million second instalment of the series, The Spy Who Shagged Me, starts off with a large bang, and not, this time, of the sexual nature. Instead, it's a series of scenes from a film within the film, featuring a cast of stars way too famous to be named and an action stunt that should make the James Bond franchise pack up its product placements and go home.Dr. Evil, Myers's best character, with his pinky-chewing and air quote signs and poor ability at higher numbers, takes centre stage early. Having found a way of taking his unscrupulous behaviour into legitimate business by taking over a Hollywood agency business (he charges just 9 per cent instead of the usual 10), he's stationed himself in a lair above the Hollywood sign and is concocting one of his usual plans to blackmail the world's leaders for a largish amount of money.The entire evil cast (with the exception of the bald cat, Mr. Bigglesworth, who seems to have dropped out between trailer and movie) is back -- Dr. Evil's annoying son, Scott (Seth Green); Dr. Evil's silent clone, Mini-Me (Verne Troyer), who proves he has a mind of his own, and the rest of the Evil cast, including Number Two (Robert Wagner) and Frau Farbissina (Mindy Sterling). Myers hides himself under a couple of tonnes of makeup as an obese Scotsman, Fat Bastard, who is in love with his own body effluents.Myers also plays a new Dutch villain called Johann Van Der Smut, a middle-aged seventies playboy nicknamed Goldmember (regrettable smelting accident), who enjoys roller-skating, disco dancing and eating strips of his overtanned skin.The best piece of casting falls on the side of good, with Michael Caine as Nigel, Austin's swinging, and insufficiently paternal, spy dad. Caine (who himself played a bespectacled spy in The Ipcress File) looks the part, and turns on some real actor intensity, especially in his raging declaration that he hates intolerance and Dutch people.Austin, for some reason, has to travel back to swinging Manhattan to "Studio 69," to rescue his dad, who has been captured by the evil Van Der Smut. There, he teams up with Pam Grier-inspired Foxxy Cleopatra, played by pop diva Beyoncé Knowles of Destiny's Child, who has great abs and a way of looking at Austin as if she just scraped him off the bottom of her platform shoes.There's no doubt that Goldmember has its long flaccid stretches, and a good deal of repetition of familiar gags: shadow play, inadvertently obscene subtitles and an assortment of euphemisms for genitalia. At times, Myers's toilet-bowl humour overfloweth.The strategy here is the basic Mel Brooks string o' gags school of comedy. While it's not high wit, it never stops trying and, occasionally, as in the prison-rap number inspired by Hard Knock Life from Annie, the results are inspired.A flashback to Austin and Dr. Evil's early days at the Intelligence Academy, for example, shows a savvy such scenes rarely manage; the young actors are close enough physically to the adult characters, but what makes it work is Myers's dubbing in their adult voices.Fourth-time Austin Powers is a spectre that can only arouse apprehension. No one can look forward to a bigger role for Van Der Smut (or bigger rolls for Fat Bastard). Who cares if Mini-Me decides to talk? But taking a page from the International Man of Mystery, let's not worry about the future when the present (and past) are groovy. When it comes to Austin Powers, three's a charm.

		<shortDescription>Austin Powers in 2002 goes back to the 1970's, bummer!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a fan of the first two Austin Powers films where after the first movie became a somewhat cult classic, a sequel (The Spy Who Shagged Me) followed where it proved to be even greater laughs than the first movie. The first two movies were shot in the nineties, yet with Goldmember being shot in the beginning of the 2000's, it felt wasted to see another Austin Powers movie when other comedy flicks followed.The plot of Austin Powers 3 has the famous British super agent going back in time. This time around it's the 1970's where he must rescued his father Nigel, played by Michael Caine, who never really was around for Austin, when a villain by the name of Goldmember (Mike Myers in a fourth role with Dr. Evil being the second role and Fat B as the third), a Dutchman who has the ability to turn anything into gold including a man's twigs and berries. Austin gets help from a soul singer by the name of Foxy Cleopatra (Beyonce Knowles) along with getting help from convict Dr. Evil, but not before escaping with plans of his own.There are other characters that come back from the film from Fat Bastard (or Fat B. to the offensive people), Mini-Me, Number Two, Scott Evil and more where the real moments of the film just like the first two movies are the spoofs from spy movies to recent pop culture (Britney Spears, music videos, dance sequences and more) bringing out the true guns of comedy. There's even cameo appearances by major media influences from Tom Cruise, Gwyneth Paltrow, Steven Spielberg, Katie Couric, Quincy Jones, Masi Oki (before the Heroes fame) and more where it doesn't mean the better.I love Beyonce, but I didn't think she was the right choice to play Austin Powers' love interest where there wasn't any connection between them during their scenes together.Austin Powers was welcomed in the 1990's, but I'm not sure if the new century is ready for him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Myers still has the 'Powers', baby!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Take: The most elaborate and probably the funniest of the three.After the success of the first two AUSTIN POWERS movies, a sequel had to come out for the sake of the cash. And while it's meant to get a lot more money, AUSTIN POWERS: GOLDMEMBER, the third of the spy-spoof series, is still very funny, and you have to admit, Mike Myers still has the 'Powers'! Adding to his characters of Austin Powers, Dr. Evil and Fat Bastard, Myers also plays the new "villain", Mr. Goldmember, a parody of the famous James Bond villain Auric Goldfinger. The film, itself, is still a parody of all the classic James bond movies and many other movies. But, thanks to the creativity that's still intact upon the screenwriters, GOLDMEMBER still has enough funny bits to delight fans and other viewers that pass by alike. It may just be the the most elaborate AUSTIN POWERS yet.However, since it is done twice before, some things get pretty tired. It may be the most elaborate of the three, but the material certainly hasn't changed. Austin is still the same character he was in the first two films. Still has a thing for his fellow agents, always women, and he still has bad teeth, of course. Dr. Evil still wants to rule the world, and still coping with his relationship with his son (this time has improved, though). New characters include sassy "sugar" spy Foxxy Cleopatra (Beyonce Knowles), a parody of female blaxploitation spy characters like COFFY played by Pam Grier, as well as Austin Powers father ("His Fasha!" says Goldmember in a Dutch-accent), played by Michael Caine, accompanied by the Mini Cooper he used in the role he played in the original THE Italian JOB.Director Jay Roach is still having fun with the material, and we have the same amount of fun he had. The comedy bits, although some repetitive, are still uproariously funny. The cameos of Tom Cruise, Gwyneth Paltrow, Danny DeVito, Kevin Spacey and director Steven Spielberg in a pseudo-M:I:2 opening credits of "a new Austin Powers" film called "Austinpussy" (a nod to Bond's OCTOPUSSY, which also rumored to be the film's working title) surprisingly funny, as i the long-running joke about the "Mole" (in a literal sense of the word). It's probably the funniest of the three so far. Go see it! Rating: **** out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not sure this quite lived up to the other two, but I still laughed a lot and I was relieved to be seeing a cleaned-up version on Fox. I can handle the naughty humor as long as it doesn't go too far.Mike Myers did a good job with all his roles. Wait until you see the obese Scot wearing a plaid ... whatever Sumo wrestlers actually call what they wear.Michael Caine added something to the movie, but I'm not sure this really shows how talented he is.Mini-Me was really funny. I'm not sure how much was Verne Troyer and how much was a stuntman or dummy. But he gets to dress like Austin! Wait until you find out why!Beyonce's blonde afro was great. I liked seeing her character adapt to today's world, and her hair looked even better with a more contemporary style. She's a pretty good actress, too, but a better singer.Mr. Roboto was a fitting name for the robotic character. I liked the naughty subtitles which actually had more to them if they changed the background from white for certain words.The opening scenes were impressive, not only for their stunt work but also the beautiful scenery with red rock formations reminiscent of The Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote.I enjoyed going behind the scenes with Steven Spielberg's Austin Powers movie, starring Tom Cruise, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kevin Spacey, Danny DeVito and John Travolta. There was also a scene with Quincy Jones conducting the music while a beautifully costumed and wonderfully choreographed parody of "Singing in the Rain" was shown in the background. The choreography was also great in Britney Spears' music video--and Britney haters will love what happens at the end of that scene. And The Osbourne family appeared as well, with bleeped-out cursing and Kelly displaying hair a shade of red not found in nature.I don't want these people to Be-HAVE! I want more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Austin Powers in Goldmember is a decent sequel. Beyonce Knowles is okay in the film. When you know that the bad guys in real life do not harm you because you are from the Moonfleet orbiting Earth it makes for camp humor. Because there are approximately 1000 sentients in the Moonfleet it means that since my form is up there I have to say I am a triple Oh not a double Oh in case the Creator has the number 1000. I am not delusional. Thanks to the Creator I have enhanced problem solving abilities. The big news of this millennium is that the Creator has made Humans immortal. Yay for our Creator. May we Humans serve the Creator loyally and always keep Him or Her entertained. Since I went to a Catholic High School, have taken Catholic Communion and represent the Archangel Michael to our Creator I am sort of an undercover Catholic and Anglican at the same time since my DNA with time travel may have been sent back in time a very long way. I have tried to pass on the message of fear not always. The Messiah is on Earth now and I am protecting her. She came from the Moonfleet, is incredibly smart and has a computer inside of her from the Creator. Thanks to sending messages back through time this Princess of Peace through Conquest of the Universe by our Creator who is in several Galaxies already, the Messiah knew that she was going to be crying a day in advance because her computer played recordings of her crying over and over again. I tried to keep her in the house all day but her grandmother lured her to a playground where she was stung on the tongue by a hornet or yellowjacket as she licked a candy ring. I comforted her and gave her popsicles for her tongue. She started to feel better remarkably quickly. My bad English is watermarking to prove that I haven't been replaced by a Communist educated Clone or something. They have an aversion to bad English for some reason, maybe it was the besst of what you got single. My real full Aunt is Queen Elizabeth II Windsor who likes social controls and may be surprised that I always tell the truth. It makes sense that the Creator would want honest to him or her subordinates. The Creator caring about his forward observation officers so much that there are many backup clones of us reminds me of the story of the Creator making sure that the birds get enough to eat and are we not more important than birds.

		<shortDescription>The worst of the three</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mike Myers is back for his third outing as the international man of mystery, Austin Powers. Sadly though, he should have stopped at "The Spy Who Shagged Me," as the introduction of new but boring characters and the rehashing of already used jokes means that this is nowhere near as funny as the previous two.Admittedly, there are still a few laughs to be had out of this, and the movie is in no way terrible. The acting is spot on, and there could have been no better choice than Beyonce to star as Foxxy Cleopatra. Michael Caine is top notch as always, and Verne Troyer probably got the most laughs out of me as Mini Me.However, the inclusion of Goldmember to the characters played by Mike was a big mistake. He was just not funny at all, lacking character throughout, and is easily forgettable. Some of the jokes used were already done in the previous films, and as such were not funny the second time round, for example, the satellite shaped like a pair of breasts scene was already done in The Spy Who Shagged Me.To conclude, Goldmember is still an enjoyable experience, and the inclusion of cameo appearances from the likes of Kevin Spacey and Danny Devito was well put in, just don't expect to get as many laughs out of this as the last two films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Austin Powers in Goldmember is a very funny film, just as funny as the first Austin Powers, but unfortunately nowhere near the the second film, which I consider the best of the series. In fact, it's obvious the series is losing its steam, with jokes from the first films being only repeated over and over again (in essence, beating a dead horse). Even Mike Myers as Austin Powers/Dr. Evil seems to be growing tired of this role - and though his Fat Bastard role was funny, his new Goldmember role wasn't anything new. The only exception to an otherwise repetitious roles for most of the cast, I thought Verne Troyer was again hilarious as Mini Me. A funny 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was so disappointed with The Spy Who Shagged Me, this film's prequel, that I did not see Goldmember till it played on network television. And I'm regretting I didn't pay to see it uninterrupted at the time, back in 2002.This is an Austin Powers movie, not a Dr Evil movie like its predecessor. Austin doesn't look lost, but is back in his element. It doesn't give too much focus on the villains. With Michael Caine as Austin Powers' father, the scenes seem to have more sparkle?perhaps knowing they would attract someone of Caine's calibre, everything was that much more polished. Even the toilet humour seems tolerable compared with the previous outing.The sets are more expensive; the jokes are less repetitive; and there are more cameos than before, including those of Tom Cruise and Gwyneth Paltrow in a clever film-within-a-film sequence. While Myers penned this idea in his original script for Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery, it was nice to see it realized here.Beyoncé Knowles is a surprisingly good actress, and at no time does it appear this is her first film role. And rather than be directly inspired by a James Bond film, Myers has charted a more original, and highly entertaining, course. In fact, the Michael Caine references are plentiful: the use of a Mini as a getaway car, a sequence where the stars sing a version of 'What's It All About, Alfie' (edited out, though the song is still heard in the end credits), and even old footage of Caine. The Nigel Powers character's spectacles are a take-off of Caine's Harry Palmer's, from the 1960s. And not a lot of people know that.One disappointment is the lack of screen time for Robert Wagner, and Mr Bigglesworth, the cat, is hardly seen except in a flashback sequence.Goldmember nearly had the sort of impact its predecessors did. Just as fingered "air quotes" became commonplace after the first film, many people will have the idea that a Dutch accent is the bad one Myers adopted for his Goldmember persona.The finalé is a surprise, and that's hard for a movie series that has prided itself on self-referential humour and parody. And while it gives a reasonably satisfying conclusion, it leaves open the opportunity of a very different fourth Austin Powers movie.</fullReview>

I mean there's been two movies before this and it isn't a surprise the kind of humor that is used in these movies. The Austin Power movies are about poking fun at things us as human beings do not discuss often and for that matter at all sometimes.Its about pushing the limits in comedy and showing people that hey this stuff can be funny if you think about it.Austin powers is hilarious,and I think that Goldmember was the best out of the three.Now don't get me wrong this movie had its flaws like all other movies do,but for what it is, I was really entertained by this and encourage those to see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little tired - but still fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the third installment in the Austin Powers series Mike Myers finally seems to have lost some steam. His performance isn't as fresh as in either of the previous movies and he tries to cover up for the loss of freshness with even more ludicrous gags than in either of the two previous films combined and it works, to an extent.It is a safe assumption that Goldmember is the most far out, weird film of the series. Lines like: "I open-mouth kissed a horse once" firmly establishes that. Myers always did have a crazy sense of humor which he established in the first film and refined in the second film but in the third film he completely goes overboard. The first two films were clearly Bond spoofs and while the third film maintains many Bond spoofs it also references films like Silence of the Lambs but the film does the same mistake as the latest Bond film (Die Another Day). It starts to spoof itself. Many of the jokes are almost complete replicas of the previous Austin Powers film. Fat Bastard returns only to produce the same kind of toilet humor he did in the second film and there is a "we're casting shadows" scene once again and while this is pretty funny the first time you see it it pretty quickly loses its appeal. Myers still continues in his Peter Sellers inspired way to add more and more characters that he plays himself and the new character, Goldmember, is by far, the weirdest yet. He is a Dutch criminal mastermind who eats his own skin flakes and has a preposterous accent. The new love interest for Austin is the weakest yet. Beyoncé Knowles is hot and she really can sing but quite frankly isn't much of an actress. The director, Jay Roach, could definitely have done better with the casting there. All of the supporting cast returns again and do exactly what they did in the previous films. No news there except for Verne Troyer (Mini-Me) who is still absolutely hilarious. Also it was nice to see that Michael Caine can be genuinely funny and shallow as well as deep and personal. There are a lot of cameos in the film which produces some of the best laughs. Cameos like: Tom Cruise, Steven Spielberg, Kevin Spacey and Britney Spears.The effects are pretty impressive for a comedy but they don't really do much. They are just there to look nice and were probably expendable when you think about it. Still its nice to know that Hollywood are willing to spend a considerable amount on money on comedies as well as big action movies and as the effects don't lessen the value of the movie it really doesn't make much of a difference.The film is still pretty funny and I enjoyed it even though it felt a bit tired. Some if the re-used ideas worked well and I did laugh uncontrollably in one scene but overall the film is inferior to its predecessors but definitely worth a look.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw Goldmember, I thought it was the weakest of the three movies. However, I bought all 3 films on DVD. Having watched them again and upon reflection, I have actually come to consider the third movie the best. It's much more solid than the second, and the laughs are more frequent than the original. Recommended scenes: 1) The dance sequence that breaks out following the filming of the "movie" in the opening, 2) The shadow-play in the submarine doctor's office,3) The flashback with young Austin, young Dr. Evil, young Basil, and young No. 2 in boarding school, and 4) Any scene with Beyoncé Knowles--she is absolutely magnetic.Honestly, the laughs don't stop. And, yeah, a lot of it's potty humor. Who cares? It's effective potty humor. Relax, give in to it, and enjoy!</fullReview>

But I liked her. Austin, Dr. Evil, and Fat Bastard were still hilarious and Goldmember was funny but he didn't make me laugh as much the other guys did. I loved all the cameos and the sequence with Tom Cruise at the beginning of the movie cracked me up. Mini-Me was still great and Michael Cain gave a satirical performance as well.

		<fullReview>It's disgusting, gross, puerile, fatuous, boorish, obscene, flatulent, egregious, stupid, bigoted, and ineffably silly, among other things. And it's funny. It's really funny. I mean, tickled my funny bone. I may not have the same effect on you, but I suggest you give it a try. Really. In my case, I rented it with a strong feeling of skepticism, not quite sure if I wanted to risk four bucks on it, thinking it was likely to be another gimpy sequel, nothing more than an awkward and contrived impersonation of the original, as is so often the case. But, to my surprise, it wasn't. Sure, it had an ample number of references to shagging, but they are a bit more subtle; for example, the somewhat inconspicuous Cooper Mini license plate that reads `GR8 SHAG,' a worthy caricature of all those dumb-ass `I'm so sexy' James Bond movies, was my favorite.In fact, I think Goldmember is the best Austin Powers yet. The reason: all the characters have evolved. I know: that sounds pretty silly, maybe even stupid. OK, I'll grant you that. It may be the dumbest thing I've ever said, which would have to be insanely stupid considering all the boners I've committed. (Yes, stupid pun intended.) But before you make up your mind, consider the following. In Goldmember, Dr. Evil isn't quite so evil. He's much more complex, especially in his relationship to Scott, a prodigal son proudly returned to the true path of evil. Herein we see his inner core of love and affection. Dr. Evil's response to Scott's inner transformation is an ambivalent mixture of pride, and fatherly concern. It's so touching. Better yet, Austin Powers is much less `shagadelic' than before. Of course, he still has excellent mojo. His mojo is so mighty, in fact, that even destroys Britney Spears with its overwhelming, irresistible power. And who could fail to appreciate that? But in Goldmember, he's almost nothing more than an appendage to Foxy Cleopatra. (Yes, stupid pun intended.) And, if you like bathroom humor, you're in for a treat: Fat Bastard's never been better. He's an utterly repulsive mixture of crude humor and vile appearance. National Lampoon can't compete with this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great comedy, and one of my favourites of all time (Along with 'Holy Grail'). There's alot of Original Humor that many haven't seen in a while, and it is rather refreshing, but of course, it carries some of the OLD jokes of the sequels over, but who cares? They still make 'em funny. It also has the 'action' portion of it, which is just a thing to add into, because it is Spoofing James Bond, and his films had ACTION, so it will keep you entertained also.

		<shortDescription>Back to parodying Bond...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a detour in AP2 Myers is back to parodying Bond. This movie seems a lot fresher than the first sequel and any jokes that get "recycled" from the first two movies are much shorter in length and only appear once. Myers has succeeded in restoring Austin Powers into a viable character (i.e., he's not annoying in this one like AP2). Luckly Fat Bastard is reduced to a couple scenes. Goldmember is a somewhat disappointing character because he is pretty subtle and doesn't get any laugh out loud bits but he grows on the viewer.The movie feels especially fresh because the makers actually have the budget this time to spend a little $$$ to parody some of the Bond conventions. Michael Caine is a fantastic addition to the cast and Scott Evil gets some much needed character development. You can also look for some homages to Wayne's World with the blatant product placement and a couple scenes.The opening sequence is sheer brillance, and the movie has some dead spots, but it's certainly much better as a "movie" than the second, although it may not be as funny. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is another good installment in the Austin Powers series but I think the franchise should think about coming to an end. I don't see where they could go for a fourth movie, they've already covered the '60s, '70s, '90s and 21st century. I guess they could go back to the '80s but that's so un-Powers. Also, you can see Mike Meyers is an SNL alumnus because some of the gags fall victim to the SNL-problem; they drag on so long they stop being funny.On the good side, the opening "surprise" was great fun, and the casting department did a fantastic job with the actors playing the characters as teens.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not as funny as the first</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just viewed this movie tonight. I found the third instalment to the series to be more over the top than the last two. The first few minutes of the film which had the big star cameos was probably the funniest part out of the whole flick. I found the movie dragged on longer than it should have and that most of the jokes and one-liners were being recycled from the last 2 movies. Un-like the first Austin Powers, this one had no plot or direction. It heavily and solely relied on gross-out humor and sight gags to get its laughs. Mike Myers possesses tremendous talent but there should never be another Austin Powers movie. It doesn't have the wit, humor, or dialogue like the first. He should have stopped at the first.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Austin Powers (Myers) chases villains (all Myers) across continents and through time in order to save the world; etc, blah,...$?*&amp;=+&gt; Yes, of course there's no plot, stupid! And of course it's rougher than the first two. It's a cash-cow. Is it ever funny? That's the question. Sometimes... Quite a few sometimes - no! Often (if you've bothered to let yourself get into the spirit of it all - and if you've hired it out or paid at the flicks to see the third instalment you must have SOME idea of what you're letting yourself in for) it is very, funny indeed. Crude? Yes. Crass? Very. Offensive? Extremely. Funny? Enough. (The sight-gag with the unconscious Japanese guard at the Manikin fountain is a perfect example of all of the above). Fat Bastard is way too OTT and Goldmember's one-note 'Farsher' gag lame indeed but Dr Evil is hilarious ("...and not you, the extra over by the machine, arbitrarily twidling useless knobs pretending to look busy...") and the Jailhouse musical sequence as inventive as any MTV video you'll see for a while.Myers puts me in mind of a warped Conan-Doyle. Powers has at least another two box-office hits in him despite Myers (like Conan-Doyle did with Sherlock Holmes) trying to murder him by removing any semblance of narrative interest from around him. In fact, because Myers is too clever at what he does (the musical set-pieces; the marvellous rapport with mini-me; the internacine nepotism) the joke he constructs in order to dismantle the characters (i.e. that the whole thing is a shallow facade - cinematically and narratively) ends up being the right joke to take things in a promising new direction.No. It's not Bergman. But it still knows what cinema is. And it can use it; as well (if not better) than far too many overstuffed Hollywood turkeys. And it can make money. And in the end - despite anything else Myers might care to do with his undeniable gifts - it'll be too tempting not to bring Powers and Evil back again. So... behave.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Myers makes the movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mike Myers, Saturday Night Live alumnus, has written mostly all of his movies (from the Austin Powers to the Wayne Cambells). International Man of Mystery gave the audience something new. A new character, storyline, and an introduction to a niche in society (How many people have you heard say "Yeah, baby" after the first movie?). The Spy Who Shagged Me gave a great follow up to such a mark in comedic cinema. Showing other talents of Mike Myers, such as composition of music, dance, and even more characters to portray. There was also good chemistry with supporting actors where the laughs weren't just coming from Mike Myers. However, Goldmember seems to be a movie that was made for the sake of making it.Funny, but not the same potential as the prior Austin Powers. Goldmember takes a step closer to a musical with the dance numbers. Also, the supporting cast members didn't seem to be as intricate as in The Spy Who Shagged Me. The only other character that may have made an impact was Mini Me (Verne Troyer). Surprisingly, the many cameo appearances of different actors also made a presence within the film. Otherwise, it seems like Mike Myers pushed this out for the sake of making another Austin Powers movie. Also, a few jokes triggered memory of Wayne's World lines and some SNL skits. I still admire Mike Myers on his writing capabilities. However, Goldmember is not a good example of his best work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some of the jokes are painfully not funny, and they do tend to drag on a bit (the fountain one for a start), but still, I could watch this again. The only problem with making this film was that they tried to make it funnier than the second one, which was the best one by far, and they recycled some of the old jokes (the tent shadow thing). Mike Myers still manages to make you laugh, but he does seem a bit tired of the whole Austin franchise. While the whole "Yeah baby" joke wears thin, there are still some laughable moments. But I think the biggest problem about this film was Beyonce Knowles - don't get me wrong, she's an amazing singer, but that's really where she should have stayed. She didn't seem to do anything in this film other than walk around in very short shorts saying "Sugar" a lot. All in all, this isn't as good as 'The Spy who shagged me', but it still has it's moments. Probably a film you could watch only twice at the most and no more.</fullReview>

You can only use the same gag so many times as ozzy osbourne was good enough to point out. Goldmember lacks the freshness of the first two films and in parts just makes us feel like we're going through the motions. i welcomed the new characters we were given in the first sequel mini me and fat bastard but goldmember just seems rather pointless unless that is the film makers have some major issues with the dutch and on first viewing i thought beyonce knowles character foxxy cleopatra came across well but on second viewing just came off as rather annoying.Although all that said there is still a lot of fun to be had in goldmember all the austin powers regulars are back i particuarly enjoyed seth green's scott evil who has finally made the transition to evil and has won his father's love. the cameos from the beginning are excellent and seeing a certain pop princess's head blow up was rather satisfying.All in all i would recommend austin powers to anyone apart from the rare few that don't like the other films. I can happily say i was very pleased with goldmember i just think myers and new line cinema should leave the austin powers trilogy as the comedy phenomenon it is.I rate this a 7</fullReview>

Put together a new movie using a successful formula and known attractions (Mike Myers, Robert Wagner, Michael Caine) then pay them all to commit professional suicide on the screen. What would be left? Beyonce Knowles. And, this young lady can sing and can act. She has a future, unless she gets involved with another turkey like Austin Powers IV.Cameos by Tom Cruise and Gwyneth Paltrow gave great promise to a creative Austin Powers movie as the surprise beginning started. Then, the real cast took center stage and the movie self-destructed into worn gags, potty humor, and cliches. The ending (incredibly inept) gives promise to there being no more Austin Powers sequels as Dr. Evil and Austin are buds and Scott Evil cannot laugh well enough to run an evil empire.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved the first AP movie back in 1997. My friends and I could reite nearly every line. After seeing AP2, I quickly lost interest in the franchise (see my AP2 review). When AP3 came out last summer, I knew I wanted to see it, but I was concerned that it would be just as crude as the second one. I also felt that maybe I had grown out of Austin Powers. Luckily, I found Goldmember to be a very funny and entertaining movie. The opening scene is fantastic. The cameos (which I didn't like in AP2) work well this time. It's almost as if Myers realized that his franchise ha become too big for itslf, and therefore had to spoof it. This movie, for me, seemed to recapture the spirit of the original. The humor (for the most part) was clever. Jokes regarding male genitalia, flatulance, and urination can be funny when utilized corectly. The scenes which took place at the British Academy (when Austin and Dr. Evil were kids) were also very funny.Like many, I was surprised by the ending (SPOILER). I suppose it works, but it also effectively ends the Austin Powers series. That might be a good thing though. At least he went out on a high note.</fullReview>

Probably one of the few movies I had to resist walking out of. Austin Powers 2 was terrible, unfunny and very stupid. Fat Bastard and Mini-me were horrible new characters and all the freshness of the first movie was gone.Enter Austin Powers 3. I didn't bother to see it in the theaters because it looked pretty bad. Even after the roommate bought the DVD, I was rather hesitant to watch it until I just finally decided to give it a shot. This movie was rather average. No where near the pure badness of the second movie; but not at the level of greatness of the first movie. I enjoyed some parts of it; but in general it feels like Austin Powers is finished and that anymore movies would just be overkill.There's still a lot to like about this movie. Including seeing Tom Cruise in Austin garb and the Japanesse sub-title scene. Ms. Knowles is a slight improvement over Heather Graham and I loved seeing Britney Spear's head explode.So I will say that if you're looking for a way to watch some mindless film, for a while; you can't go wrong with this one. Just don't expect too much.</fullReview>

I find that humor rather juvenile and to be a product of poor writing and a lack of inspiration. Maybe they are trying to attract a certain younger cruder audience but it would seem they are alienating a large portion of market. I'm not looking forward to the next episode since the jokes lost their interest when I graduated from grammar school.

I do agree somewhat with some of the comments about the jokes were dry because they were basically used up in the first two. Once these ideas were exhausted, what else can Mike Myers do to make the third of the trilogy to be even funny. By pulling in famous celebrities such as Cruise, Spielberg, and even Britney Spears does Mike expect the audience to laugh at?Another complain is that Goldmember wasn't even used that much. In fact his role turned out to be important in the end but yet there was no character development for him as well as Foxxy Cleopatra. All the other characters feels like one dimension and what's with the mole? It was emphasized so much that it didn't need to be expressed. The only real character(s) I liked were Fat Bastard and Mini Me. Always a pleasure to have! And at the end when they show him losing most of the weight by some miracle diet that his stretched skin was showing and his neck looked like a vagina. That cracked me up. I also liked the music video while Dr. Evil and Mini Me was in jail depicting Jay-Z rapping style of "It's a Hard Knock Life". That was pretty good.Overall, it's worth taking a look and only 1 look.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With hindsight, I think I had an over-developed sense of excitement about this movie. I'd enjoyed the first two which I saw as a back to back double header - imagine that! Anyway, it was probably unrealistic to expect that the standard could possibly be maintained when the same characters are required to come up with a new and bizarre storyline, the third time around. OK, it wasn't quite up to scratch but, nevertheless, I had a few good laughs - it was worth the money, but don't expect to double up with laughter; be happy to be mildly amused.

		<shortDescription>Some definite laughs to be had.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>But they are some very cheaply bought ones. Who would not laugh when they see the most expensive actor in the world playing a trashy spoof icon? Myers and ###### are two sides of one coin. It rips a chunk out of Get Shorty (Devito again contributing) and recycles most of the gags from the two previous movies, showing obvious contempt for its audience(And no, we don't laugh the third or fourth time). Miss Spears is a welcome appearance, being such a...talented girl. The jokes in these movies are really laughed at because laughing is our only option, we are surprised that anyone would make a two hour feature out of such pathetic humour. There is no definable plot, he has drawn on the profound, though not original idea of simply putting together some character-based ideas. Goldmember has no cause for being there aside from justifying the title. Foxy Cleopatra likewise simply adds a name to the movie, she has nothing to do(Dont believe me? watch very closely when it comes on overnight-rent or falls into your lap). Its definitely the most audacious yet though; the humour in this is completely gross-out. They explore the idea of mini-me for multiple 'me's in the movie, it may sound funny but believe me, its all the idea, when you actually watch it it's not really funny(as with most of the describable jokes). The same with Michael Caine for that matter, one would think that his presence could steal the show and save the movie but no, Myers keeps him firmly on the bench, he has very little to do.Mini-me was a revered personality in 2, his silence gave to the character, his interest is comprehensibly destroyed in this movie. The original had some wit about spoofing Bond, the sequel was hilarious for getting chummy with Star Wars. Part III? Nothing in particular, thats what makes it so forgetable. Its just retreads of the previous two.So in short, it opens with a bang of hilarity but chuckles afterward can be counted on two hands, being so frontloaded destroys the experience. Honest to goodness, its not like seeing a movie that disappointed you but you nevertheless took something away from. I heard about the actor and director of the movie within this movie and Michael Caine and I thought I was in for a treat. I was beating myself up for ages afterward, I payed MONEY for THAT! But the $215 mil does not surprise me, M:I2 did the same and Harry Potter made much more after all. Alot of Americans have some serious issues.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And that's it for me. The first one was just so funny and original. I remember I went to see it a few times in the theater and friends thought I was nuts. But, just like a sports team with fair-weather fans, everyone all-of-the-sudden LOVED it when the second one came out. "Oh, I've always loved the first film." By the time I saw previews for the second film, I knew it was the same funny gags from the first film just regurgitated and a LOT more dumbed down to please the masses. So I skipped it, knowing I missed nothing new. And the third one came out... with previews even worse than the last. I read the "quotes" section on this film and am totally assured of my original thoughts. This franchise has turned into something for people that have no standards in their humor. Poop and sexual inuendo jokes seem to go a long way in this fantastic society. I'm just going to stay with the fond memories of the first film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I sincerely hope this is the last Austin Powers movie. There I said it. This should not be misconstrued as a criticism of the series in general but more of a 'don't flog a dead horse' warning to Mr Myers. There is only so far one can take a comedy series before it starts to grate and if we never see those horrible teeth on screen ever again then the series will have survived, reputation untarnished. The point is, this is a fantastic movie.As with all spoof movies the comedy is distinctly hit and miss (think Scary Movie, Hot Shots, Naked Gun and yes, even Airplane!). Thankfully AP3 has a far greater percentage of hits than misses. Some of the set pieces worked into this movie were absolute, unquestionable genius. The scene with the fountain statue and the Japanese guard had me almost crying with laughter. Another fine &amp; inventive set piece was the scene with the Japanese subtitiles. Other fine examples were the Mole, Fat Bastards wire driven combat scene and another brilliant shadow scene, this time with Mini-Me instead of Felicity Shagwell.Acting wise, very impressive. Aside from the comic genius that is Mike Myers,this time adding a forth, politically incorrect villain in the form of the hilarious Goldmember ("Hi guysh! I'm from Holland! Isn't zat vierd?"), Michael Caine is perfectly cast as Mr Powers Snr, in a kind of lighter hearted 'Get Carter' sort of way.Credit must go, however, to young Beyonce Knowles. Popstars who act are a mixed breed. You have the good (David Bowie, Jennifer Lopez, Bjork), the average (Britney Spears, Ice Cube) and the bloody awful (Mariah Carey, Jon Bon Jovi, Mick Jagger). Fortunately for her, the 21 year old is comendably realistic as the big-haired blacksploitation secret agent. Surrounded as she is by a top-notch cast she can hardly fail to look good, but instead of riding the talent of her cast-mates as you might expect from a relative newcomer, Beyonce carries herself extremley well and doesn't look at all like she's reading off a piece of card (I'm looking at you Mariah!).Now we get to the part of AP3 that forced me to give it a lower rating than it might otherwise have got. Scott Evil. Now you may remember that in the first two movies, young Scott was one of the principle sources of entertainment with his frequent set pieces with Dr Evil. Now call me cynical if you like, but turning Scott Evil...er...evil was about the worst thing they could have done to the character. The whole reason he was so great was that he was a voice of reason within a organisation of evil geniuses. You can also tell that actor Seth Green, is uncomfortable in a role he used to relish, especially at the very end of the movie.Aside from this one gripe though, Austin Powers in Goldmember is a thoroughly entertaining spoof comedy, easily the best in the series and highly recomended to anyone who wants to be in stiches for an hour and a half. It's not rocket science, but there's only so much arty-farty psycho-analysis movies you can stand. Or is it just me?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, I admit that this was a hilarious movie. But it wasn't a good movie or one I would like to see a second time. The movie as a whole is not funny, just certain jokes are. The whole plot doesn't flow. Its a bunch of choppy sequences composed just for the sake of getting a laugh at that moment. For example, Austin and Foxxy Cleopatra go to a Japonese factory of some sort for no important reason other than wasting time with cheap jokes. The new characters in this sequel weren't too good either. Foxxy Cleopatra had no funny parts. She was just someone to make Austin look stupid and to pretend she is the coolest and most sophisticated person ever. Goldmember was disguisting. I really can't find the humor in eating dry skin. The character never had any importance. Maybe it was just there to draw people to the theater with the anticipation of something new and fresh. Then finally Number 3 was the most worthless and stupid character to the movie. If he wasn't in the movie, nothing important would have been changed. Once again, I agree this was funny, but it left me feeling "homesick" for the first Austin Powers, where the comedy actually worked.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The plot is not really important. Essentially all of the characters from the previous film are back, except that this episode's female sidekick is Foxy Cleopatra (singer Beyoncé Knowles). Star Mike Myers has also added a new character named Goldmember, who lost his, uh, member in "an unfortunate smelting accident" and likes to eat the pieces of his skin that flake off regularly. He is also Dutch, which provided numerous opportunities for Dutch jokes, which aren't funny but are *supposed* to be because they aren't. Visually he reminded me a bit of Arte Johnson.Also new is Austin's father, played by the *ideal* British actor (I won't reveal who) for the part. He helped fill in some of Austin's history and was generally good in the role, but I couldn't help but feel that something was missing.One good scene involved the use of subtitles when some characters were speaking in Japanese. Specifically, the white subtitles were made partially invisible by a partially white background. This being an Austin Powers film, the remaining letters spelled out dirty jokes, but the fun part was that the characters were aware of the subtitles, reading them and taking steps to eliminate the white background so that they became legible. It wasn't actually the funniest scene in the film, but perhaps the most inventive.But for me the two things that worked the best were 1) the cameos by some *really* big stars, and 2) the musical numbers. Maybe halfway through the film I thought that it was basically a musical, but unfortunately as the plot (such as it was) got going, the musical numbers dropped off. And since the cameos were also concentrated up front, I found this to be a film that promised a great deal but then mostly failed to deliver. Still, the best scenes make it marginally worth seeing, and if you liked the second film, you'll like this one.Seen 7/25/2002 at the pre-opening party for the Camera 7 theater (in which I am an investor), at the PruneYard in Campbell, CA.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Austin powers 3 in Goldmember was expected to be the best one out of the Austin Powers trilogy but sadly wasn't. After viewing the movie for the second time I discovered that it wasn't as funny and lapsed in that of acting. I think what brought the movie down was the drop of Heather Graham for Beyonce Knowles which made her roll dull and her acting was annoying and not very good. Also, the role of the man himself Austin Powers was a let down because of his non-interest for his modjo and women as he never came close to phisically wanting to be with a woman like he did in Austin Powers 1&amp;2. He found himself more concerned with his dad and we always knew there was not so much of a difference with Dr Evil and Austin Powers but the end sought of ruined the whole Austin Powers storyline. Goldmember was brought into this movie as a backup and his role was not funny at all. The start was brilliant and I thought it was a great idea by getting actors like Tom Cruise, Danny Devito, Kevin Spacey and Gwenyth Paltrow to portray roles of the Austin Powers characters and that must have been the highlight of the movie. Overall I thought that Goldmember was a let down and was the worst one out of all three. Still, The Spy Who Shagged Me remains number 1 and nothing can top that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If only there were a special olympics for the motion picture industry, where everyone is a winner regardless of effort or achievement. "Goldmember" is Mike Myers' debut enthusiastic love letter to the cerebrally challenged. That the script offers few surprises and even fewer guffaws is testament to Myers' apparent conviction that he will be the next Woody Allen or Steve Martin, who have both dared to venture beyond the four corners of slapstick. Here, Myers and his personae non gratae are but insulting incarnations of Jerry Lewis and Howie Mandel. Suffice it to say that the funniest scene involved an exploding rubber chicken.</fullReview>

But with Goldmember, it topples the other 2 movies.With Fresh new characters, different twists and some old (but funny) jokes thrown into the mix again, it's simply not possible not to laugh, especially with such characters as Mike Myers involved. Special effects are great, especially Dr.Evils underwater sub-marine lair.With cameos from big names, you'll be laughing out loud and trying not to disturb the audience(chances are they'll be laughing, too)Beyoncé Knowles is stunning in a hilarious movie. Goldmember isn't as sexy as the other two movies, but you will not be dissapointed, especially if your a fan of Mike Myers.I applaude the cast and crew and everyone to do with Goldmember.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

But, the movie in the end has little replay value, just like the others.Satires like Young Frankenstein and Airplane can be watched over and over. Austin Powers 3 cannot be. Maybe once every year or two but that's about it.I think a big problem with this movie is that the series has run out of jokes. And much like Austin Powers 2 it is pretty stale in the end.The Fat Bastard character is really the only character I felt was still fresh (is that an oxymoron?). I think the twist they did with Scott and Dr. Evil was interesting but also shows that the series has run it's course.But The Austin Powers films ran the course well. In the vein of Mel Brooks they made satires that actually try to develop some characters and have a story. Whereas most satires are plot less films with characters there only to be used as joke props.So, a good, funny movie like the previous Austin Powers films. I give it a 6.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

Of course not wanting to fall short of the others, this Austin Powers gives us the same great humor with a different twist; we are now in the 70's as opposed to the 60's.If you haven't seen the other two films then you will probably not be able to appreciate this film, as many of the jokes and humor is pulled over from the other two films. Again more characters are added, many of them acted by Myers. It is fun watching Myers play the four or five different characters in the film, and one cannot help but to admire the talent.This movie offers a great beginning and the first five minutes alone are a non-stop riot and worth the price of admission.For upholding the reputation of others, this film rates a 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disappointing addition to the series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Austin Powers travels back to 1975 in an attempt to rescue his father, who has been kidnapped by Dr Evil's new partner in crime, Goldmember.First the plus points. The film looks great. The large budget and excellent production design have been put to good use, giving it a glossy and expensive feel. Some of the performances are also quite pleasing. Michael Caine seems to be enjoying himself playing Austin's superspy father. Beyonce Knowles is surprisingly good as Foxy Cleopatra and Verne Troyer steals every scene he's in as Mini-Me.Now to the minus points. Most of the first half of the film is desperately unfunny. It's so bad that I almost walked out at one point (a couple in front of me did). It struck me that it was similar to watching Peter Sellers in the last 'Pink Panther' film that he made. What was once fresh and joyous was now tired and merely self indulgent. The character of Powers himself is at his most irritating here. Fat Bastard's presence appears to have no point, and the title character Goldmember is underwritten. Also the large number of cameo appearances is becoming a lame gimmick.Things do pick up a little in the last 30 to 40 minutes, and there are some genuinely funny moments, but they are too long coming. Overall this is a disappointing addition to the franchise, and one can only hope that Mike Myers can re-ignite the spark of the previous films, should he choose to do another.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought the first two films were great; I thought this one was great.Everything else being fantastic, aspects I didn't like so much were:- The character of Fat Bastard seemed to make an appearance merely because he was a popular character in the second film. The part he played in the plot didn't seem that important or, indeed, necessary.- The character of Goldmember didn't really do anything for me. I didn't think that his character was strong enough and it seemed that his quirky eating habits are a result of Mike Myers wondering how he could give this guy some personality.That's all the faults that occur to me -- like I said: in general, I thought it was very funny. I absolutely cacked myself (and embarrassed my fiancee somewhat) when Austin physically couldn't stop himself from commenting on the thing that he was telling everyone else not to.The plot was busier then the first two and the production felt a bit more slick and sophisticated.I have to say I've noticed a lot more cross-advertising on TV with this film; to be expected, I guess, with the series' growing popularity. I suppose this is good advertising for the movie but occasionally the commercialism of what I consider quite a clever, original and well-executed concept is slightly annoying.Loved the beginning of the movie. Unexpected and brilliantly done.All in all, a good laugh.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had a lot of hesitations about a third installment to the Austin Powers movies, and after watching it, it only confirmed what I was thinking.The character of Austin Powers ended up telling lame jokes and there wasn't anything particularly exciting or appealing about him at all! Foxxy Cleopatra wasn't a great "Powers" girl and spent more time doing "don't go there girlfriend/Ricki Lake" neck manouveres than actual good lines. Dr Evil was a complete pansy, his jokes completely faltered, nothing of the fun villain we came to love. Why name a movie "Goldmember" when the title character appears only for about 20 minutes? Mini Me stole the limelight from everyone, giving us some glimmer of the previous "Austin Powers magic". Nigel Powers was completely useless, lacking any sort of interest that the father of the International Man of Mystery would have had. Apart from a few face shots, was Frau Farbissina there at all??The Austin Powers franchise has become 2 commercialised, with the appearance of way too many celebrity cameos. Despite the opening sequence being funny, there were 2 noticable cameos that should never have been. One being the Osbournes, ok we get that you get off on saying the "f" word but we are over it now! (Acutally I think anyone would be over it after saying it the first time ever in your life) However, how you know that the Austin Powers franchise has hit an all time low is to have even considered Britney Spears stepping on the set of the movie, wait sorry go further back to have even asked her at all! Thank god she got blew up in the movie, maybe that was suppose to epitomise her not-so-hot career anymore?The Austin Powers movies should have ended at "The Spy Who Shagged Me", "Goldmember" is completely forgettable with a unoriginal storyline, bad casting (hint..Beyonce Knowles..by the way the age gap kinda bug anyone else? Austin could have been her father for god's sake!) If you really want to watch it, wait for the video, that way you can stop it when you feel it's bad...believe me it's not that long after the opening credits!</fullReview>

And yes I was right, the movie did not live up to the hype that was made about it. It didn't have the same feel to it.Austin's character ended up telling flat jokes and wasn't very interesting. Foxxy Cleopatra wasn't terribly exciting as a "Powers" girl either, with more "Don't go there girlfriend" neck manouveres than actual great lines. Dr Evil ended up being a complete pansy, despite having some humourous moments. Scott Evil wasn't funny at all, a complete personality makeover unfortunately didn't have it's intended affect. Was Frau Farbissina in this movie at all? Maybe a couple of face shots but that's about it!! Nigel Powers was completely useless, he had potential that got lost along the way. Fat Bastard was ok but again a let down, I think his fat rolls were more interesting in "The Spy Who Shagged Me". Mini-Me was better than the whole lot of them, providing some of the original Austin Powers magic into a less than shiny "Goldmember". Speaking of Goldmember...did they even utilise the purpose of his character?? Why did they bother naming the movie after a character who barely makes more than a 20 minute appearance altogether?There were too many celebrity cameo appearances, I only enjoyed the Tom Cruise, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kevin Spacey, Danny DeVito, Steven Spielberg and John Travolta appearances. How you know that the Austin Powers franchise truly lost it's "Yeah Baby!" appeal is by stooping so low as to allow the likes of Britney Spears to even be allowed on the set let alone appear in the movie. Thank god they blew her up in the movie, maybe it was suppose to epitomise the state of her not-so-hot career anymore? Hell, Burt Bacharach is better to watch!! Please no more of the Osbournes, the joys of say the "F" word probably went away in the late 50's.So despite some...and I mean SOME funny bits, the movie is pretty forgettable.

		<shortDescription>Could be more funnier!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't expecting this movie to be hilarious, but I thought it will be at least a bit funnier than the last movie, which was good. A lot of the jokes didn't seem to work, it was missing the same magic and timing that was in 'The spy who shagged Me.' From the other reviews 'toilet humour' has been mentioned quite often, which I agree is quite true. To be crude is not always funny, Austin Powers needs to go back to his originality of being funny, like in the last two movies. I don't want to be a spoiler but some of the stuff that didn't seem to work was the rap done by Dr. Evil and Mini-me, Dr. Evil trying to cut off his son scott in a conversation, and quite a few other instances. Michael Caine was pretty irritating as the father, I was expecting him to be more of a hilarious character, but he came across as a dirty old man. God help us if there's a fourth movie, if there's no originality in a next movie, it'll just go from bad to worse!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know people love a fart joke. And I know i have never understood that. But really - this film was the worse case of toilet humour I have ever seen - aside from the first two Austin POwers Films that is.This is a great shame as when the script raised itself above the navel it actually provided a few genuinely funny moments. As with all the films the Doctor Evil?Scott Evil/Mini Me scenes were by far the best - perhaps because they contained the least amount of lowest common denominator humour.The musical scenes - particular the homages to Oliver and West Side Story were te highlights of the film and the opening credits are also quite clever.Yes they do over do the cameos a bit but hey why not!Overall a film on par with the second Austin POwers and obviously a lot better than the first - which was simply dreadful. Worth a look but certainly wouldn't bother for a second viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Has Some GOLDEN Moments Baby!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Austin Powers 3- Goldmember was a cool movie. Thats to sum it up in one line. Yet to be honest when i watched the Trailer for the movie i thought it would SUCK. Yet when watching the film, i was definately proved wrong. Austin Powers 3 circles around Goldmember (Least likeable of all characters), a man thats into GOLD (And has some weird hobbies to do with it to). There is a return to Dr.Evil/ Mini-Me and Scotty Evil &amp; Fat Bastard not to mention the new female enterage FOXTY BROWN. Oh and did i mention AUSTIN POWERS IS BACK BABY - He must save his kidnapped father.If you walked in to the cinema 10 minutes late, you would have missed out on one of the most classic film introductions in history. So get in EARLY to the movie, you dont want to miss the intro. The casting in this movie was the best of all 3, you have so MANY famous faces. From Britney Spears, Kevin Spacey, Stephen Spielberg, Gwyneth Paltrow, Dany Devito, Beyonce Knowles, Tom Cruise, Michael Kane, Seth Green, Fred Savage and not to mention MIKE MYERS.The acting was fine. Cinematography was good but no great. The script though was A BIT iffy.First reason is Goldmember had the most amount of rude and crude humour in all 3. Sure some were funny, yet others fell flat and were quiet offensive. Also there was a lack of plot, i had to put the cards on the table, sure it was funny but the approach wasn't. Still This film is recommended if you want some good laughs. You WILL laugh through-out the movie, yet you will especially love the Intro, Shadow Scenes, Rap Cameo, Mini-Me scenes are always good.ACTING: The acting was very good. Mike Myers is one my favourite comedic actors. He does a good job portraying all charactors. Beyonce Knowles did an acceptable role, yet she didn't have to do much, just laugh at Austin Powers Joke, walk around in sexy clothing and say "SHAZAAM" And "Sugar" way too much. Michael Caine fitted his character well. Everyone did well. EVEN BRITNEY SPEARS!!!ACTORS: The best selection of actors in a film since TRUE ROMANCE(1993). So many famous faces, so many cameos. You almost feel like your watching a few movies, how could all these great actors come into a film in short notice? I was very pleased.SCRIPT: Not as well written as part 1 or 2. I disliked some characters. Goldmember wasn't so good. Foxy Brown was just entirely pointless.Scotty Evil was annoying as ever. The plot was thin. It could hve been written a lot better. Yet still many scenes left you laughing so hard. It's probably forgivable.CINEMA: Cinematography was fine, yet the atmosphere didn't fit in to its prequels. And travelling back in forth in time, they didn't set the scene so well for the 70's. Boogie Nights did a MUCH Better job. Yet still the costumes and clothing was funny and matching to its times. Acceptable cinematography, nice shots of Tokyo.COMEDY: Very Good. It is GUARANTEED to make you laugh, so thats a start isn't it? Some Jokes are really funny and original. Others are repeatative and wear a bit thin (signs of lack of ideas). There werent many corny names, i used to love the Corny names, here theres a couple like Fook Mi and Fook Yu. It's funny, but not as funny as its prequels.MUSIC/SOUND: Beyonce barely sang in this. Music was okay, the 70's tunes were well written and sung by beyonce. Not many sound effects, except farting, burping silly little things.OVERALL: Goldmemeber in overall was my least favourite of all Austin Power Films, but dont fret. It is still a film with lots of laughs in chunks through-out the film. Sometimes its slap-stick, sometimes its offensive, but BABY! You will still like it. My only Question is..Will There Be Part 4? Will Scotty Take Over? If So. Im NOT watching.*** 1/2 (3 1/2 stars out of 5)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Goldmember" is decent comic fare bogged down with pyrite plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The world's favorite British spy not named James Bond is back for round three in "Austin Powers in Goldmember." This time around, Austin (Mike Myers) and his new female sidekick, walking stereotype Foxxy Cleopatra (Beyonce Knowles), try to stop Dr. Evil (Myers) from, as usual, taking over the world. Some new faces are thrown into the zoo: Austin's father, Nigel Powers (Michael Caine) and eponymous baddie Goldmember (Myers, again), who is perhaps the first villain to be a skin-eating Dutch contortionist. Powers has a new car in this latest installment, called the "Pimpmobile," complete with a pink plush interior, purple paint, and lowrider-style hydraulics, and it's used to travel back to 1975 in order to complete his mission. (He goes back to '75 in a 1972 Cadillac. Go figure.) "Goldmember" hits zero to 60 in seconds courtesy of a strong first act, including a hilarious set of cameos in the opening sequence and several scenes where Austin interacts with an agent known as "The Mole" (Fred Savage), who indeed - you guessed it - has a huge mole on his lip. Subsequently, Austin desperately tries to refrain from commenting on it.However, "Goldmember" quickly runs out of gas and loses sense of direction, as any original ideas are already spent before the film is half over. The remainder of the picture is then stuffed with the same tiresome phallic humor (not to mention another unnecessary appearance by Fat Bastard) in order to produce cheap laughs and to divert viewers' attention from the weak plot, which was why the first sequel, "The Spy Who Shagged Me," was just downright awful. The characters have not gotten better with age, either; they've become like a once-hysterical joke told too many times. By the time the conclusion rolls around, the movie gets stuck in neutral altogether. The twist ending is as anticlimactic as the revelation of Cartman's father on "South Park." (There is one interesting part of "Goldmember" worth noting: In a flashback sequence showing what appears to be Austin's college graduation ceremony, the students' school uniforms look suspiciously like the ones in "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.")To make a long story short, "Goldmember" isn't as good as the first film (9/10), but it is superior to the second (2/10). Perhaps, though, it's time that this exhausted franchise, which has become increasingly more drag than shag, is finally put to rest. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've always been a fan of Mike Myers (in fact, I think he's a hell lot hotter than Russell Crowe ;0) )..anyways...naturally I loved Austin Powers..that is until I saw Goldmember. Austin Powers (AP) 1 &amp; 2 was hilarious..so I anticipated laughing my a$$ off when I walked into the theater to watch AP3 Goldmember. Boy...was I disappointed. I find AP3 so lame that I made sure I promised myself that I'll not watch AP 4 (if Mike decides to make another one)!! Sure..Goldmember had Tom Cruise, Britney, Beyonce..all those superstar cameos and sure, Mike 'came back' as Dr.Evil and Fat Bastard etc. but I think that's about it....cameos and Mike playing fabulous multiple roles. The toilet humour that made AP 1/2 extremely funny became somewhat tiring and pretty gross..and what's with the 'mole' joke!!?? It's NOT funny at all!! I spent the first half of the movie..practically forcing myself to laugh and ended up so fed-up with myself that for the rest of the movie, I just sat there watching, deadpanned and wondering why some of the audiences (most of them teenagers) are laughing their a$$es off! And where there was a continuation of AP1 in AP2 (Lz' Hurley's character)..what happened to Heather Graham's Felicity Shagwell in AP3!!??..Well..all in all..I was deeply disappointed with AP3...too bad for a comedy once soooo funny..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yeah baby yeah - Austin's back and funnier than ever. Forget what all the elitist critics have said in their efforts to belittle Mike Myers latest effort. Goldmember is truly funny in the laugh out loud, roll around in the aisles sense.Unlike other franchises which seem to struggle with number 2 (no pun intended), and by number three are ready for the scrap heap, Austin Powers gets funnier with each new instalment. This time around, the humour is very British. I couldn't help thinking of Benny Hill and Morecambe &amp; Wise in some of the scenes - I'm sure they're smiling in their graves.And despite all its silliness, some of the humour is truly brilliant and witty. The opening scene for example - and no I won't spoil it for you - will have to go down in history as one of cinema's funniest moments. Another scene is a wonderful, albeit tongue in cheek, salute to West Side Story.There are also a lot of things happening in the background - if you keep your eyes open. Dr. Evil's lair and sub have innumerable OSH style signs on the wall, which, if you're quick enough to catch them make fun of the world's current obsession with safety at work, even if your work is world destruction.Adding to the characters we've already come to know and love are Goldmember, an evil Dutch megalomaniac and Foxy Cleopatra, Austin's new sidekick. We also get to meet Austin's dad Nigel Powers (Michael Caine) and find out a little about Austin's early life. While all the actors deliver wonderfully manic characterisation, special mention has to go to Seth Green as Scott Evil. In every AP's movie he's been a stand-out, and more than delivers the goods again.There are a surprising number of twists and secrets revealed, all with excellent comedic timing. It also leaves everything nicely set up for the next instalment, and I say bring it on.Bottomline, Goldmember is one crazy movie baby. Be prepared to laugh until your sides hurt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably should have stopped at Number 2...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really enjoyed the first two installments of the Austin Powers saga. I felt a little disappointed by this chapter though... while it was entertaining, I think it has failed to reach the benchmark set by 'The Spy who Shagged Me' and 'International Man of Mystery'.The story goes like this: Austin Powers father is kidnapped by the Dutch disco-king Goldmember and taken back to 1975. Thanks to the information provided by the incarcerated Dr Evil, Austin makes the journey back in time to Studio 69 to retrieve Nigel Powers (played by Michael Caine). And so unfolds the plot do bring Dr Evil's, well, evil plan.Don't get me wrong, it's funny. When you laugh, you will wet yourself doing it but the biggest let down is the plot, or should I say lack thereof. This movie really has just cashed in on the jokes set by the last two movies and has resorted to way out storylines to frame the funnies. The ending was by far the worst taste in my mouth. I must say, I definitely enjoyed Michael Caine as Nigel Powers... he was everything an International Man of Mystery should be! Newcomer to the screen, Beyonce Knowles was suited to her part and of course the show was stolen by Mini-Me (Verne Troyer)...If you're an Austin Powers fan, you'll laugh but quite probably walk out of the cinema hoping AP4 won't make the same mistakes twice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the blatant product placement in the last film (for example, when Austin arrives back in 1969. "Hey baby, get off my heinie!") I expected at the very least a 5-minute ad break in the middle of the film. Not quite that bad though did anyone not notice the Pepsi machine behind Britney during the closing credits, I can't say I enjoyed the film. Sure, it has its moments (the opening 5 minutes, the schooldays flashback) but overall most of the jokes fall flat or bring to mind the words 'flogging' 'a' 'dead' and 'horse' to mind. The Osbournes cameo just showed the filmmakers know this.It was also a shame to see the supporting cast wasted this time around, having barely any screen-time. Rob Lowe's 'appearance' in the film was a 5-second sequence during the end credits that featured him and Robert Wagner sitting next to each other with Wagner dressed in drag pulling off a wig. Can anyone explain what that was about?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funniest Austin Powers ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I guess it's not easy making a trilogy of films with each one better than the previous, but Mike Myers and Jay Roach have done it. "Austin Powers in Goldmember" has surpassed "Austin Powers: The spy who shagged me" on my laughing meter. I had tears coming out of my eyes from beginning to end. Does Mike Myers have no limit to his creativity?In this movie we are introduced to several new characters, including Goldmember, Foxxy Cleopatra and Austin's father Nigel Powers which Myers wanted to be played by Sean Connery, if I'm not mistaken. We also get more of the old characters (Fat Bastard, Mini-Me, Scott Evil, etc) and lots of cameos like Tom Cruise, Steven Spielberg and Britney Spears.This third Austin Powers film makes use of all the jokes that made the other two a hit, but with a twist. There's even an inside joke about it, starring Ozzy Osbourne. I don't mind this, as long as they come up with entirely new and funnier jokes, as they did.What's next for Mike Myers after Austin Powers (if this were the last movie)? I'm sure he has the potential to keep creating memorable characters and making the best comedy I've seen in years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Austen Powers Gold Member is Toilet Humour</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I find something is terribly wrong with modern western civilization when professional athletes are overpaid, lawyers are superman, and terrible hollywood movies are massively promoted. I am sure it costed 50 million dollars to promote this crap. Austin Powers is a great persona. it is easily imitated. Peter Sellers enjoyed the same glory and fame in the Pink Panther Movie Series. I do not have the same effection for Austen Powers as I do for The Pink Panther. The Austen Powers Movie Series should be called Toilet Humour 1,11, 111. It was a ghastly mess from start to finish. Almost embarassing to watch. I thoroughly expect to see these unenlightened, unimaginative wretches to be rewarded by Hollywood with more big contracts. No wonder the UK almost banned Austen Powers 11, The Spy that Shagged Me. A better director and writer is needed to pilot this movie franchise. It is embarassing to even comment on this mess.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dear Mr Myers,I highly respect your work, but if you want to write a bunch of unrelated sketches, please go back to SNL: the world doesn't need more of this kind of garbled writing passed off as feature film.It's painful to see the franchise that began with your hilarious original outing, with all elements of story, being reduced to a 'random task' where any old joke will do, despite it's effect on things like plot and character.And speaking of character, you've got far too many competing for screen time: the whole world of Austin Powers has been completely overblown, and is heading toward the embarrassing convoluted realm of Casino Royale.See to it that you correct these shortcomings in your next venture, as I suspect there will be, as it's clear you've got a bad case of Sequelitis.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this film, it was very funny. Which is no surprise to me, because I loved the other Austin Powers films.Mike Myers was great as always in all of his roles accept for Goldmember, i was really disappointed by the way he did his 'Dutch' accent, because it was not Dutch at all! It was totally German! He even said a German word at one point, that about says it all! They should have put some more afford in actually doing research on the Dutch and their accent, that way they would've known that Germany and The Netherlands are NOT the same country!!! But accept for that, Goldmember was a quite a funny character too.The whole supporting cast was great too! Beyonce wasn't smashing, but she wasn't bad either, i think that she could go far with a little practice.I think this is a must see movie, it's really funny, I promise you'll laugh out loud more than once and there are quite a few surprises that you'll probably really like too!I just have one tip; do not eat during this movie! There are a few really gross scenes that will totally spoil your appetite!!!Go and see it ASAP!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, Austin Powers rules. The first got a 10/10 from me, the second got a 7/10. This one gets a 4/10. I was excited to see this movie, but unfortunately, the areas in this movie which lacked originality was in writing, direction, and acting. Three rather large areas!So is it just me, or was this Austin Powers movie a take on other Austin Powers movies? I could see in the second film, they had lost some originality with putting in Dr. Evil for a second time. Why couldn't they have introduced more interesting villains. The Goldmember villian is quite annoying, and will never rival the Dr. Evil from the first movie. But I didn't appreciate the usage of Dr. Evil and Mimi-me again in this 3rd installment, because their characters seemed more like actors having fun rather than well-developed characters.I thought Austin Powers 3 would find some new areas in the Austin Powers universe. But it didn't. It's just the same old stuff over and over again... without a coherent plot, bad acting, and as a whole, bad directing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh man, will this ever end?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That is what I thought when I heard that another Austin Powers movie was coming. That is what I think when ever a sequel comes out (Did you know that there is yet another 'Brady Bunch' movie coming soon?? And lets not forget another 'DUMB AND DUMBER' movie too, WITH THE ANNOYING DELL KID TO BOOT!!). Lets just say that I'm not a big fan of, "Hey, it made us lots of money, let's juice out the stupid public some more with a bad sequel". Buuuuut, I (reluctantly) went to see the latest version of James Bond gone stupid, and I have to say that I secretly laughed...a lot. I know, I sound like a snob, but ya know what, I don't care. I hate "sampling" in songs (come on, 'Jack and Diane' used by Jessica Simpson...you're killing me!) and I hate when old TV shows are made into movies, no originality left in Hollywood. But they did a good job with 'Goldmember'. It was totally gross sometimes (just thinking about some of the gross stuff makes me nauseous) and the jokes were the same (yes, some more of wacky names like Fook Mi and her twin sister Fook Yu (why do they have different last names if they are sisters, hehe)) and another song by Dr Evil that is almost too embarrassing to watch. But all in all, it was pretty entertaining.Hey listen, its not like I'm NO fun, I have my share of retard movies that I like a lot (this is on that list) but sometimes its frustrating being a movie goer, especially when neighbors ask if they can borrow my "Rush-Hour 2" DVD...I don't have "Rush-Hour 2" you wacko, but I will lend you some intelligence and my crock pot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilarious albeit recycled sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>* Contains minor SPOILERS - although they don't really matter with a movie like this* It seems most people were disappointed in this movie. I expected to be, too, but I wasn't. A lot of Austin fans seem to have expected a new plot and I'll amdit that this was mostly recycling the old elements. But I think this sequel, although it lacked in originality and plot, was just as funny as the previous ones.Sure, the plot is thin - even surprisingly thin, considering the other two movies had a coherent plot. The story doesn't seem important to the writers this time, it doesn't really proceed for most of the movie, it's just parodies and gags. That's ok, though, as long as they're funny. And for the most part, they are.The beginning is hilarious. Tom Cruise as Austin, Gwyneth Paltrow as the girl, Kevin Spacey as Dr Evil and Danny DeVito as Mini Me? LOL!! It's so unexpected and well made. However, the Britney Spears cameo is disappointing and the musician cameos are just dull. All they do is play the keyboards. The whole Hollywood idea doesnt' really fit well with Austin Powers. Especially the ending seems to take some of the edge off the story.Michael Caine/Nigel Powers seems unnecessary. The whole father plot is a bit weird, especially the ending. It seems like a good idea, but they just don't use the character enough. Nigel doesn't have half the charisma of Austin, either, although he seems to like women as much.Foxxy Cleopatra was also a bit disappointing. After the hilarious first scene with the lip synching man - it looked SO weird! -, she fails to make a real impression. In fact, she does almost nothing throughout the whole movie. She just stands there and looks sexy.Goldmember is a bad character. He's insulting to Dutch people, and non-Americans in general (why are Americans so xenophobic? Everyone has an accent, there's nothing funny about that). And he just plainly isn't funny. The mole thing - funny the first two times, but there could have been less of it. Fat Bastard is exactly the same as in the last film, and I always found him gross and unfunny. I didn't want to see him again. The sumo wrestling part was funny though.The funniest character is Mini-Me, although I didn't like some of the scenes that made him act like a dog. Mini-Me as Austin is the funniest thing about the movie. Dr Evil isn't quite as funny as in the previous though, but still gets a lot of laughs.I think Austin himself is losing some of his charm - in some scenes he talked in a voice that was too "normal" for Austin, like when he was visiting Dr Evil in the jail. Nothing groovy about that scene. Somehow it seemed that Mike Myers sometimes forgot he was playing Austin Powers. That's the impression I got anyway.It seems no one else liked Dr Evil and Mini-Me's version of "Hard Knock Life", but I found it simply hilarious. It was so surprising! I think it was funnier than "Just the two of us" in The Spy Who Shagged Me. The Japanese subtitles joke was funny although it was a bit overlong, and I also liked the doctor's appointment scene. Some jokes, like the Japanese twins, were a bit dumb, but there were also some great puns(like the..eh..linguist one).All in all, Austin Powers in Goldmember is as funny as the other two, although it lacks some of the originality and charisma. I laughed throughout the film, just some overlong scenes at the end seemed boring. There was a lot of gross stuff, but not too much in my opinion. I liked this, but I hope there won't be an Austin Powers IV. This is still a worthy movie and would be a good ending for the series. The next one might just suck.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No, baby, no!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you enjoyed the jokes in the first and second Austin Powers movies, then you'll love them in the third installment - because they're exactly the same. This must surely rank as one of the laziest comedies ever produced, or the greenest, because everything is recycled. And by adding a knowing, post-modern wink at the blatant plagiarism of it all that supposedly makes it all right. Everything about "Goldmember" is childish and tiresome - it's like being told the same joke over and over again.Sure, the opening credits were the best bit. But you've still got another 85 minutes to go after that (worst of all, horror of horrors, apparently the first cut was 3 hours long, so that will be one DVD Special Edition to avoid). Unfortunately "Goldmember" has taken a LOT of money so there will be a fourth in the series. But it should at least be interesting to see if Mike Myers can plumb any further depths because the barrel has been well and truly scraped here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There are some very funny moments, but you can feel the ideas are getting a bit thin.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Canadian comedian Mike Myers has certainly got a lot of mileage out of 'Austin Powers', but I think it's time for him to find a new vehicle before this one breaks down completely. Not that this is a bad movie, indeed it is about as good as the second Austin Powers film, 'The Spy Who Shagged Me', but the signs of strain are there.'Goldenmember' has Austin trying to foil Dr Evil's latest evil scheme for global conquest/destruction by traveling back in time to 1975, where he hooks up with his old flame Foxy Cleopatra and tries to rescue his dad Nigel Powers (played by Michael Caine, which is a nice nod to his spy roles of earlier years) from the clutches of Goldenmember, a swinging villain with a fetish for gold and his own skin. Meanwhile, Scott Evil and Mini Me are having trouble relating to their own father, Dr Evil.The opening scenes before the titles of 'Goldenmember' are hilarious - describing them would give away what make them so good. But after that there are only a few very funny moments scattered throughout the movie. For instance Goldenmember's introduction - meet a leg-bending, rollerscating, hip Dutch wierdo doing a dance number - is great, but after that he becomes rather dull as the personalities of the other characters seem to overwhelm him. Likewise Foxy Cleopatra could have been a lot more interesting than she is - a babe with an afro and a bit of attitude who laughs at Austin's lame jokes. Mike Myers also often overplays those jokes. There's only so many times you can laugh at a giant mole or a funny accent, and that's not many times. I don't know why he wanted to stretch his material out so often, as the movie does feel overlong. I would have also liked to see something a bit wittier thrown in now and then, as it's nice to laugh at something clever jokes as well as something silly.For all that 'Goldenmember' is a pretty funny movie and fans of the first two films will like it. But I'm glad I didn't pay to see it.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lackluster comedy dud</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Austin Powers in Goldmember (2002) C-94 min. D: Jay Roach. Mike Myers, Beyonce Knowles, Seth Green, Michael Caine, Verne Troyer, Robert Wagner, Michael York, Fred Savage. The opening credits are the highlight in this lackluster comedy dud, the 3rd in the AUSTIN POWERS series. This time around, Austin Powers has to travel back to 1975 to rescue his kidnapped father from the clutches of Dr. Evil and a new villain, named Goldmember. The same gags from the previous two films are way overused here, and although Knowles is funny as a Pam Grier-esque heroine, Green is hardly in the movie. RATING: 3 out of 10. Rated R for slapstick violence, crude humor, and strong language.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The power of adlibbing?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Austin Powers 3 was a very good movie and it made me laugh quite a bit, but Mike Myers unfortunately was not able to shine with all of his brilliance in this movie. With it's wonderful new jokes, such as Fred Savage playing the mole for the secret agents, and having a grotesque mole above his lip, makes for outrageous humor when characters interact with him. The film also, successfully, uses almost all the jokes from the previous two installments in this trilogy. I mean why not? If it's funny and makes money, do it right? That seemed to be Hollywood's only plan.Mike Myers was not allowed to do what he does best, and that is adlib. His sense of humor is apparent in his writing ability, but it really shines when he pulls jokes and gags out of thin air, and that ambiance is what this movie was seriously lacking. Although it was funny, and I recommend seeing it, I do feel that it is not the greatest of the 3, and falls short where the other two stand strong.</fullReview>

But having not seen either I whole-heartedly recommend this. In places this had me in tears of laughter (Perhaps the fact I was under the influence helped) and there's no doubt it was, at the very least, enjoyable. If you want to leave your brain at the door you'll enjoy this, and it proves Myers is more than adept at creating comedy that bridges the Atlantic gap. Good damn fun :)</fullReview>

The whole idea is looking a bit stale. There were parts where I laughed, and parts where I yawned. I think Austin Powers has run his course. I don't want to see a fourth instalment, though I fear there could be one. I hope Austin Powers doesn't go the same way as Police Academy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mike Myers has got to be the Albert Einstien of comedy. He knows were to put the jokes and how far apart they should be. The movie is great the only thing that was a downside was what ever happened to Felicity Shagwell played by Heather Graham. We found out what happened to Vannesa in The Spy Who Shagged Me. Another downside is the amount of screentime Fat Bastard has (personally my favorite character in the series). Also the newest character Goldmember who is played by Myers is hilarious. A must see for anyone who loves comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All of my friends who had seen the movie told me it was absolutly hilarious, and the best of the all. I'm wondering what movie they went to go see, whatever it was it wasn't Goldmember. But, I did like the movie, although the villian Goldmember wasn't funny, just gross. My favorite jokes in the first two are the ones with Scott, Dr. Evil, and Mini-Me. They are in this one as well, but there seems to be less. One problem I think is that things that shoudl've been carried over from the first two weren't and things that should've stayed behind didn't. Even though this wasn't my favorite, I DO want there to be a fourth and although it wasn't the funniest movie, I would recommend it to people, espiecially if they like the first two Austin Powers movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Do you remember the first time you heard a joke about a traveling salesman whose car breaks down at an old farmhouse inhabited by a crotchety old farmer and his young, buxom virgin daughter? It was pretty funny, wasn't it? Then you may have heard the joke about the traveling salesman whose car breaks down by the farm and the farmer's wife does something or another. It might have been mildly amusing. Later on, you may have heard the one about another traveling salesman and his busted car and immoral doings with the cows. Oh, yeah, ha-ha, heard it before.If you can empathize with such as this, then you really don't need to spend $7.50 to see Austin Powers in `Goldmember'. Don't get me wrong; I laughed uproariously at the first film, and even enjoyed the second. But I get the joke, already. Believe me, if you've seen those first two films in this series, then you've, in effect, seen this one. The Austin Powers franchise, the brainchild of comedian Mike Myers, was never intended to be an ongoing series, but money talks, so after the first film made four times the money in home video than it did in box office gross, sequels were inevitable.I'm not going to strain my brain in attempting to summarize the plot for you in any detail; it really isn't important anyway. Supposedly, Austin's father is kidnapped by his nemesis Dr. Evil, and zapped back in time to 1975, where some roller-boogie Euro-swinger called Goldmember is holding him. It's all pretty much downhill from there. I really expected something from Mike Myers to be written better. This is the mind that had Wayne and Garth playing `Truth or Dare' with Madonna, Linda Richman talking coffee and worshiping Barbra Striesand, and Dieter forcing his guests to touch his monkey. This entire film feels like a rod on which to hang all of the gags Myers and director Jay Roach dreamed up while sitting around one night getting blitzed on Zima.Poor Michael Caine, two-time Oscar winner that he is, must have some pretty awful naked pictures of himself out there somewhere to be blackmailed into appearing in this farce. I didn't expect to see him doing King Lear, but I did expect to see him doing something. Caine may be on screen for a total of fifteen minutes, and seems to be heavily medicated for most of that time. Beyonce' Knowles fills the slot of the `Austin girl,' but I find her L'Oreal commercials on television to be much funnier. Her role as Foxxy Cleopatra is, I imagine, intended to be a satire of the roles Pam Grier would play in blaxploitation films of the 1970s, but I didn't find the word `sugah' added to the end of each line of her dialogue to be very satirical. Even Mike Myers doesn't seem to put the same bite into playing Austin Powers as he did in the first two films. Maybe the ever-growing number of characters he plays in these films has diluted the amount of wit he can put into any one of them.I suppose there's something that audiences find comfortable in repetition. We all certainly line up for the Star Wars films time after time. Satire, however, doesn't stand up to repeated performances. The first Austin Powers film was a satire, full of witty, wink-wink references to the culture of the swinging late '60s and the Spy-game film genre it was sending up. Unfortunately, that gag has run its course and all that's left to do is double-entendre and flatulence jokes, meaning the target audience for this series has gone from being adults to adolescents. I suspect the Austin Powers animated series on Fox Kids can't be far behind.The opening pre-title sequence, filled with celebrity cameos that will certainly surprise you, is the only thing in this film worthy of your attention, but that's not reason enough to go see it in a theater. I promise you it will be just as watchable on a DVD that you rent from Movie Gallery for $3.75 and play in the comfort of your own living room for you and all of your friends, maybe even while getting blitzed on Zima.</fullReview>

And on and on with the same jokes: a small appearance of Fat Bastard (s****ing again..), Austin Powers behind a curtain making shadows (like he did in AP: TSWSM with Heather Graham in the tent) and more expecting fart, pee, penis and breast jokes. Austin Powers was getting boring, Dr. Evil was going over the top, mini-me stays the same little babyman, together with everyone else.But, still, I was able to sit through the movie, so that's sufficient enough. There were some some good jokes also, too bad not as funny as the ones in the previous two.

		<fullReview>This movie really is a true predecessor of the first 2 installments of the characters created by Mike Myers, In this sequel we get to see all the character plus a new ones like the sexy japanese girls "Fook Mei" and "Fook Yu" and the new villain called "GoldMember", there are some good jokes and some old jokes that still fit in for a good laugh because lets face it, we don´t see this movie thinking "Oscar" but we see it thinking "Funny", Beyonce Knowles as Foxxy Cleopatra is nothing but a prop for the show, we see different facade of funny woman Frau Farbissna and Scott Green is just there, he used to be funny now hes reduced to nothing ness, the cameos are good, but the long waited Britney spears one is a Downer, look out for Nathan Lane, Tom Cruise, Gweneth Paltrow,Steven Spielberg,Kevin Spacey,Danny de Vito,Fred Savage and The Osbornes, The japanese subtitles joke is turned around in a very funny way until austin takes it too far and you just loose interest, Toilet Humor is back and works just fine,Although sometimes you get the feeling Mike Myers just ran out of Jokes and started improvising i can assure you that you´ll have a good time, check out at the ending on the credits when they finally show the scene they were keeping since the last movie where we see #2 from the past and #2 from the present just had sex, it goes fast but its worth a laugh. I´ll give it a 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The charm is gone...time to move on, Mike Myers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I ADORE the character Austin Powers, but I didn't think Austin was as funny in this 3rd installment. Believe it or not, Fat Bastard and Dr. Evil were funnier. Bottom line for me...it was all the same old gags but with more crudity. The Goldmember character was just nauseating and not funny at all. The skin peeling was just gross. I can see the potential humor in a pasty freckly Dutch guy with a golden "member" but it just was NOT FUNNY!!!!! The only scene I laughed at was the one where Austin and Mini-Me have to disguise themselves together as one sailor (guess who's on whose shoulders?!) and the rest of that physical exam scene (more shadows, but even funnier than the last film). Now that whole scene was hilarious, but I should have waited for the rental. Oh sure, there were a few titters here and there (the all-star cameos, and the Sumo wrestlers) but definitely NOT the laughfest I was hoping for. More of a gross-out fest, sorry to say.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw goldmember last night with a friend and being a fan of the first two films I was looking forward to an original film. I was disappointed.Goldmember took the funny jokes from the other two movies and reused them only this time you can see them coming a mile away.I think the change in character for scott evil was a good idea but seth green came off as annoying.Did anyone find the character of goldmember funny?

		<shortDescription>Harry Palmer, yeah baby!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Austin Powers has always been seen as a James Bond spoof and yet in many ways it is also a spoof of the Harry Palmer films starring Michael Caine. The glasses are certainly from Harry! In this film Michael plays Austins Dad and the homage is complete.The clever set piece Bond spoofs are less obvious in this film but there is a lot more low down filthy toilet humour. I found it hysterical and laughed from beginning to end.Beyonce plays a straight 1970s pastiche black sassy woman, but without any humour. This is okay but a shame given how good Heather Graham and Liz Hurley were in the first 2 films.The new villain is great, especially if you know the Dutch and can see how wicked the satire is.Production values are high, the end is cheesy, the movie within the movie is great. Oh, didn't I mention that?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well Goldmember was not what I expected. It was funny at times but most of the time it was just studid, gross, and unfunny. All the characters are back except for the beautiful Felicity Shagwell. Austin Powers is pretty funny. Dr. Evil is pretty funny but he also gets pretty old. No. 2 and Frau dont have a big part. Scott Evil was not funny. There was too much of Mini Me, he got old too. Fat Bastard was hilarious. The funniest character in the whole movie. There were three new characters in the movie. Austins Dad played by Michael Caine who was pretty much a waste of time. Foxxy Cleopatra who was played by Beyonce Knowles was pretty hot. THe new character play by Mike Myers is Goldmember. Goldmember is disgusting and insulting. He is the worst character of the austin powers movies. Overall, Goldmember is ok but doesn't compare to the other two.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good in itself, but disappointing if you've seen the first two</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In itself, 'Austin Powers in Goldmember' is quite good. But if you've seen the previous two Austin Powers films, it seems like déj?-v?. Much of the comedy is too similar to 'Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery' and 'Austin Powers: The Spy who Shagged Me'. The Asteroid that resembles 'big juicy melons' is but one example of a gag has lost its originality.Austin Powers is a parody of James Bond (but for copyright reasons, it isn't; just like the monster in 'Goldmember' that looks like Godzilla, but isn't). Why does James Bond's films appear fresh after so many movies, yet Austin Powers' appear stale, after only three releases? Probably because of the characters. Each Bond movie had a different enemy, but it's always Powers against Dr Evil, and his henchmen. Mike Myers is very talented in the way he portrays Powers, Dr Evil, Fat Bastard and now Goldmember, but perhaps he could develop a new character.The 'Powers-girl' in 'Goldmember', Foxxy Cleopatra, is excellently played by Beyoncé Knowles, singer in Destiny's Child, and Sir Michael Caine would have been an awesome Powers in his day.If Mike Myers wants to continue successfully making Austin Powers films, he'd need to bring back some originality: he needs to rediscover his mojo!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I walked into the theater expecting a really good movie; after all, Myers himself had said that he wouldn't have gone through with the movie unless he knew that it was going to be the best one yet. Yes, I admit that the opening scene (up until the theme song starts) was very, very funny. But after that, I mean come on! *SPOILER* Britney Spears?! */SPOILER* I can't believe she was in this movie! And what's with all the re-hashed jokes? I couldn't believe they actually tried the "looks like a big..." joke again! To think they actually had the nerve to try that... and then the Osbournes came on the screen, and I think that was when I realized that this was basically a big cameo get-together free-for-all. Although when Ozzy said, "They keep reusing the same f'ing jokies", all I could think of was, "Well said, Ozzy."I'm sorry, I usually don't ramble on like this in reviews, but there were so many problems with Goldmember. There were some funny jokes, yes, but too, too many potty jokes. I don't see how anyone could not like the second film and like this one. It just doesn't make any sense to me. Speaking of which, I wish they would have explained what had happened to Felicity Shagwell. That would've been great if she would've turned out to be a fem-bot too, and Basil explains that they knew that all along as well. See, repetition works in some cases, but not at all the way they used it in Goldmember.Anyway, I give the film a 6/10, just because the jokes that were funny, were pretty damn funny. But it was way too much of a hit-and-miss ordeal. I don't even think I'm going to buy the DVD. Too bad...</fullReview>

What remains is wall-to-wall toilet humor. Furthermore, his portrayals of Austin and especially Dr Evil are not as consistent and focused as the first two movies. If you are a die-hard fan, there is enough here to get some reasonable laughs and not feel cheated. Otherwise, stick with the first two movies.</fullReview>

The Austin Powers trilogy is probably the most funny films I have ever seen, though they only beat Monty Python with and inch or two. Austin Powers is funny. It is humor, but it is only for people who like insanely stupid humor and some of us humans do.Mike Myers as Austin Powers is every real boy's big idol. He is the symbol of a male hero - the man you just want to become! He is AUSTIN POWERS!!!The 3rd film is so funny that I will not spoil anything for you! But mark my words, go on your own risk, you just might either bore or laugh yourself to death depending on what you believe is funny.

		<fullReview>Okay, I must admit I had pretty low expectations for "Goldmember". The first movie was very funny, Some of the ideas were very original and few were actually brilliant. The second movie was pretty moderate, It had a few funny scenes but most of it was low-intelligence comedy with alot of childish humor. Okay now to the third one. unlike my expectations the first few minutes were hilarious and surprising , giving me some hope.unfortunatly the rest went even lower than the worst scenes of the second movie. A lot of physical humor which isn't very funny. Some scenes are even repulsive. Much of the humor is recycled from the former two movies and chewing the same thing for the fifteenth time is boring!. Michael Caine is a great actor and as usual he's doing is job well. Mike Myers is a talented actor and even more talented as a writer, but he should refresh his mind a little and try and write something actually NEW. He was always a fan of physical humor but he should try and make it more funny and less repulsive. To sum it up, you can watch it on video or wait for the cables, the first few minutes worth your time, the rest isn't.Longan</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sigh. If you haven't seen Goldmember yet, I'm sure this and other negative comments won't stop you, but here are my two cents worth. As many people before me have said, Goldmember is the weakest film of the series, to say the least. I may have laughed five times, tops (four if you exclude the "mole" joke which was massacred over and over again on TV ads). I loved the first two, in both of which Mike Myers demonstrated a quirky sense of humour that caught me offguard and cracked me up (which is the sort of humour I like, not predictable and over-structured jokes - you see where I'm going with this). In this, the jokes are simply bad - incredibly bad. I mean, come on, the scene where Powers is talking to Mr. Roboto with the fill-in-the-gap subtitles came from the same guy who gave us, well, the first two AP movies? This is the crux of the matter; what in the hell happened?Either the studios decided to force Mike Myers against his will to do rehashes of the jokes that worked in the first two movies, or, the more likely, Mike Myers decided to put his feet up and make some friends in the entertainment and advertising industry (Heineken, anyone?). The sheer amount of cameos which some found to be worth their money, I found repugnant and detracting from the humour (albeit terrible) in the movie, although I totally agree with Ozzy. Then the plot. Dr. Evil is SUPPOSED to be bent on world destruction. Mini Me is SUPPOSED to be evil. Scott is SUPPOSED to hate his father. Powers is SUPPOSED to be unsentimental. It was what made them funny in the first place, dammit! Now we're given a completely pointless and unfunny flashback, ditto new character Goldmember, ditto return of Fat Bastard, ditto appearance of Michael Caine! Sigh. The potential for this movie could have been great. It could have easily stood up to The Spy Who Shagged Me (e.g. the underutilised spoof of Hannibal Lecter, etc.). But no, I had to endure two hours of boredom because I trusted the comedic genius of Mr. Myers. Bad mistake. I should have learned from Mr. Lucas.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jay Roach's "Austin Powers in Goldmember" is just plain funny. Mike Meyers is back and smashing as Austin Powers in this sequel. Meyers also wrote "Goldmember", and you've got to acknowledge him for rifling out the jokes. Not all of them work, and you really have to credit the misfires. The first 10 minutes of the movie which includes classic cameos from Tom Cruise (who is really great), Gwenyth Paltrow, and Britney Spears, is some of the funniest and off-the-wall movie-making ever.Dr. Evil (Meyers too) is back, and again threatening world destruction, though I can't remember exactly what for. I saw the movie a couple weeks ago. Austin must again go back in time, though this time to the mid-70's very cool disco era, to track down the Dutch villain, Goldmember (also Meyers). Along the way, he renews a relationship with an old partner Foxxy Cleopatra (Beyounce Knowles). One of the curious things is that Meyers keeps making unfunny Dutch jokes which goes on throughout the movie, and in doing so is hilarious. We also learn that Austin has an incomplete relationship with his father Nigel Power (perfectly played by Michael Caine). It is something that has cost him in the present. Will Austin complete this relationship with his father? Well, it is almost moving, touching, and inspiring. Almost.The actual story is secondary, and Meyer's script is like a bizarre stream of consciousness. Other highlights include a laugh until you can't breath Jay-Z rap parody by Dr. Evil and Mini-Me (Verne Troyer) in prison, and the scenes of Young Austin and Young Evil in prep school which is kind of a weird "Smallville" satire.One of the surprises is that the new villain, Goldmember, is not a big deal. Yeah, baby. Though Austin, Dr. Evil, Fat Bastard, Nigel Powers, and Foxxy Cleopatra are very good. Special props to Tom Cruise. "Goldmember" is not the greatest movie, but it is one of the funniest. Whatever you do, don't miss the beginning of the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Throwing in the towel is exactly what I was planning to do after seeing The Spy Who Shagged Me. However, Goldmember was really amusing. I don't need to get into all the characters (you don't really want to read about them,) but I will tell you that the abundance of Myers' is very well done and the developing connections between all the characters is quite fun to follow. Scott remains the wildcard, and although this movie by no means resolves the Powers/Evil dynamic, it seems to me that this angle will play itself out like Steve McGarrett v. Wo Fat in Hawaii 5-0.Although this is essentially a goofy spy movie, the spy plot is totally unimportant. If you like Tom Clancy or a good Harrison Ford thriller, you won't enjoy this movie. The true action is on the level of the relationships and feelings these characters hold for each other; I know that may sound crazy, but I found it thoroughly intriguing. As an earlier poster noted, this move is DEFINITELY for the OUT crowd - you'll read it on another level. I will note that my straight counterparts enjoyed this film and it will definitely appeal to anyone in the mood for a funny and strangely touching film.</fullReview>

I can't think of anyone better to play him.As for Beyonce Knowles as Foxxy Cleopatra, eh, whatever. *Oh look, I'm spoofing blaxploitation, hardy har har* She's at least watchable.Mini-me, Number 2, Frau and Scott Evil are back and still quite funny, and the addition of "The Mole" is another high point.Overall, I'd recommend it for a weeknight when you have nothing better to do.

		<fullReview>Throwing in the towel is exactly what I was planning to do after seeing The Spy Who Shagged Me. However, Goldmember was really amusing. I don't need to get into all the characters (you don't really want to read about them,) but I will tell you that the abundance of Myers' is very well done and the developing connections between all the characters is quite fun to follow. Scott remains the wildcard, and although this movie by no means resolves the Powers/Evil dynamic, it seems to me that this angle will play itself out like Steve McGarrett v. Wo Fat in Hawaii 5-0.Although this is essentially a goofy spy movie, the spy plot is totally unimportant. If you like Tom Clancy or a good Harrison Ford thriller, you won't enjoy this movie. The true action is on the level of the relationships and feelings these characters hold for each other; I know that may sound crazy, but I found it thoroughly intriguing. As an earlier poster noted, this move is DEFINITELY for the OUT crowd - you'll read it on another level. I will note that my straight counterparts enjoyed this film and it will definitely appeal to anyone in the mood for a funny and strangely touching film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie has "mojo," baby!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found that Goldmember really had "mojo" in this sequel to the Austin Powers trilogy. I also find it very creative that the writers are able to take titles from Bond films and twist it into something quite humorous and would be up the alley of any swinger.It is hard to believe that all of the characters that Mike Myers portrays are really him. Each one has such a different personality, that only a multi-talented person such as Myers could pull it off. Austin Powers still knocks them dead in this movie. Dr. Evil is back and is still as funny as ever. Fat Bastard returns with his disgusting characteristics that are so gross, you have to laugh. Myers' newest character Johan Van Der Smut, aka Goldmember doesn't totally cut it. He just wasn't funny.I found that Beyonce Knowles was rather sexy in Goldmember. But the whole "sugar" quote that she would constantly use got rather annoying quite quickly. Michael Caine was absolutely hilarious. He fit the whole swinging spy part, and even gave off a fatherly vibe. He was wonderful.I have to recommend this movie for anyone who likes to laugh. If you do not laugh at this movie, then you have some problems. Check yourself into a proctologist and relieve yourself, because this movie is FUNNY!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrible movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was not only the worst Austin Powers movie by far, but it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The first movie was good, the second was great, so everyone expected this one to be oustanding. That wasn't the case. This was dreadful, just a rotten movie on every level. The comedy was either not funny or way too predictable. I laughed 4 times throughout the entire movie. It's a real shame that the same people involved with two great movies could put together this piece of garbage, but it's true; avoid this movie at all costs; and don't say I didn't warn you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved Austin Powers 1 and 2. I eagerly awaited this one. The trailers looked funny and a spoof on Gold Finger sounded perfect. I was sorely disappointed. This movie just doesn't work. Goldmember is a poor sequel to Austin Powers 1 and 2. The humor has digressed from the realm of clever to stupid. Wait for this one on video, it's not worth the price of admission.

		<shortDescription>Its bad... but not really</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Plain and simple this is a bad movie... except that of course it is a great movie. Wait let me explain. Goldmember has no plot to speak of, you can tell that mike myers invented so many site gags and one liners for this movie he had to jerk the plot around in strange and impossible directions to fit them all in.All the old favorite characters are there but in an attempt to introduce new characters to keep things fresh the movie gets so filled with people who want to say things that it leaves out some of the old favorites like Frau and Scott. Which is unfortunate because the new characters (with the exception of austin's father) are all terrible. Goldmember's skin flakes off and he eats it, the digust experienced when this is seen is only outdone by the sheer pointlessness of it. Foxxy Cleopatra, Austin's newest fem-sidekick gets almost no meaningful lines which is good because even though 90% of her lines are one line catch phrases you can still tell how terrible an actor she is.But wait this movie is not bad... All the terrible points about its characters and plots aside this movies gags are THE best I have seen in a long time. Sure the original Austin Powers 'made sense' amd there were consistent laughs but this movie has at least half-a-dozen s*** your pants shoot coke out your nose moments that will have you break out laughing hysterically just by thinking about them a day later.Go see this movie. But as soon as you realize a scene is trying to further 'the plot' and not just set-up a hilarious gag then stop paying attention, you'll thank yourself for it later.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie should be taken to the recycle plant...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very disappointed. Austin Powers 1 and 2 were so much better than this. And I was at least expecting to laugh at the beginning because of other reviews I've read. But, I didn't think it was funny at all. It had nothing to do with the story and I thought it was the unfunniest part of the whole movie.(SPOILERS): I thought the mole gag was pretty good. I did laugh some but it was just mainly during the tolietry humor. But even those gags were getting old. The whole shadows behind the curtain thing was good. But, I liked that part in the second movie also. Foxy Cleopatria was way under used. Why even get someone famous to play her? The goldmember character was just plain stupid. He was so unfunny. I was even disappointed with the whole flash back scenes of Austin and Dr. Evil at school. Not that funny.FINAL VERDICT: Ozzy Osbourne summed it up best. All this movie has are recycled jokes from the first 2 Austin Powers. So, the question is why did they even bother with this crap. At least, I didn't pay to see it, and I ask everyone else to do the same. If I had saw it in a theater, I may have walked out during the first half hour because it was the most boring part.</fullReview>

The Movie Seemed to Drag On and On. I Admit There were some funny parts. i remember laughing harder in the second one. When i saw Fat Bastard Come On Screen i thought maybe he would make me laugh and enjoy the movie...but i was wrong. He just did the same thing he did in The Spy Who Shagged me. And where was Heather Graham? i hate how they change the girl everytime. I KNOW that if they make another one that they're going to get a differant girl. Beyonce Knowles is not going to do another(and i pray that she does not). And the movie got more Perverted with the jokes and it kind of disgusted me. I didn't like the ending...i mean Dr. Evil HAS to stay EVIL! and with Austin and Dr. Evil being related...i thought that was kind of corny...but thats just my opinion...go see it if ya want</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To be honest, I was never a big fan of the original movie although I admit it had it's moments and I thought the whole concept at least had some shreds of imagination and invention on the part of Mr Myers. The second one was probably actually an improvement in my opinion, more laughs and more time on screen given to the best character Dr Evil. So with that in mind I went to see the third installment hoping that the improvement would continue. Well, to say that this was not the case would be an understatement. Constant rehashes of jokes that people found funny the first time around reek of a poverty of ideas. The once hilarious dialogue between Scott and Dr Evil is suddenly shamefully off the mark. Also, can someone please tell me why Beyonce Knowles was included in this film???? This is a comedy film right? So why has a very average RNB singer been drafted in to play the leading lady???? Not a single laugh in sight when Beyonce is anywhere near the camera. Plus let's be truly honest, Austin Powers Three introduces us to one of the most truly unfunny characters in film history - Goldmember...A roller skating foreigner with gold genitals and a skin disease, let the hilarity ensue. Scott Evil's reluctance to follow in his fathers footsteps was the one thing that made him funny, so what do they do in this film? They make him decide to follow in his fathers footsteps, real sensible. Fred Savage is drafted in for a one joke gag that Mike Myers decides to play about...oh...a thousand or so times, trouble being it isn't that funny in the first place. I think I laughed maybe twice and then it was just in response to the psychical abuse bestowed upon Mini Me which although humourous, not really all that inventive, or original. Don't get me wrong, I love a slice of mindless humour but for me Goldmember adds absolutely nothing at all on the first two, same gags not done so well. Oh and before I forget, why oh why oh why did they decide to bring back Fat B*****d??????? I mean, I thought it was universally known how rubbish that character was??? Surely even Mike Myers got the message on that one??This is honestly the first film I ever saw where the most entertaining part is the opening credits, apart from the horribly misjudged Britney cameo that is. So yeah, go and see Goldmember with your mates after a few drinks on a friday or saturday night and it might raise the gills, otherwise, hire something truly funny out from the video store, like 'Fargo' for instance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh, Hell NO!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I cannot begin to describe how monumentally disappointed I was with this film. I am a huge fan of Austin Powers but this has nearly ruined it for me!Mike Myers has completely lost sight of the genius that made Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery the film that it was. The original concept was brilliant. It was funny, witty and original and was an excellent lampoon of the secret agent/spy genre, sending up everything from James Bond to In Like Flint. This vision was somewhat lost in Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me but it was still a good sequel. The gags were faster and, in some cases, funnier. Distinctly different from the original, Spy Who Shagged Me was witty and original and gave us the unique Mini-Me! And, lest we forget, the scene where Dr. Evil's chair breaks down. "I need an old priest and a young priest! The power of Christ compels you, the power of Christ compels you!"Sadly, the wit, humour and originality has been completely lost and what we're left with is a badly made, shoddy, jumbled-up mess of a film. It has clearly been the subject of some pretty sloppy editing, sudden script changes and, possibly, visionary disputes between writer (Myers) and director (Jay Roache).The storyline behind 'Goldmember' is completely inexplicable and I'm not even going to bother writing a blerb about the plot because I honestly can't tell you what this film was about, I haven't a clue! This is a shame because this was one of the funniest parts of the first two films. Dr. Evil's plans were stupid but they were exactly the kind of stupid plans that the old Bond villains would have deemed feasible! Even Drax or Blofeld would have had trouble swallowing Dr. Evil's plan in Goldmember.This problem with the plot is repeated with the cast. Almost every character is apparently pointless and all the time traveling left me so confused I didn't know where or when we were supposed to be half the time. Goldmember himself is a completely stupid character, who can only be described as a pointless, half naked Dutchman with a solid gold wedding tackle, who eats his own skin! Sir Michael Caine was, however, excellent but God knows why he agreed to do it.The underrated Seth Green reprises his role as Dr. Evil's wayward son, Scott Evil. Sadly, Myers chose to downplay the awkward father/son relationship aspect of the Evils and tried to make them bond in this film. The result was nowhere near as funny as the dysfunctional relationship in the first two films. Verne Troyer returns as Mini-Me, Michael York as Basil Exposition, Robert Wagner as Number Two, and Mindy Sterling as Frau Farbissina. The only other notable addition was The Wonder Years' Fred Savage as 'The Mole'. The Mole, who has a huge hairy mole on his face, caused the only other remotely funny scene in the film, where Austin Powers makes a Basil Fawltyesque attempt, unsuccessfully, not to mention the mole (incidentally, however, we had already seen this in the trailer).The Austin Powers francise has been horrifically corrupted by Hollywood and the product-placement isn't even funny anymore (see also, Spider-man, Men In Black 2, etc.). The celebrity guest stars are numerous as usual and include: Tom Cruise, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kevin Spacey, Danny DeVito, John Travolta, Steven Spielberg (annoyingly referred to as "Sir Steve" throughout his stint), Britney Spears, and Ozzy Osborne and Family. The only good guest-spot went to Nathan Lane, who also delivered one of the only other funny segments of the film.Also, Jeanette Charles has been hired once again to play the "Queen of England" in the scene where Austin in knighted, despite bearing absolutely no resemblance to our own dear Queen whatsoever. Just to annoy me, as an ardent monarchist, if you care (which nobody will), she wears the Sash of the Order of the Garter over the wrong shoulder and the Garter Star on the wrong side. (This would normally have amused me, as in The Spy Who Shagged Me where the army colonel has completely the wrong uniform on, but because the film was so crap it just compounded my annoyance.)The whole film is just awful and crushingly disappointing and myself and my friends left the cinema close to tears. Only real die-hard Austin Powers fans will enjoy this film, the kind of nerds that will enjoy it no matter how lame it becomes or people whose sense of humour is so lacking in sophistication that penis jokes are all that is required. I myself require a little bit more.Once last bone of contention, from my own petty nationalistic point of view. I always liked Austin Powers because of the Union Jacks everywhere and because, like the Bond films, it made you proud to be British. It was suddenly like it was cool again, a far cry from all the Hollywood villains with upper-class English accents. Sadly, Myers (a Canadian and, thus, a Commonwealth cousin) must be under some pressure from the Hollywood machine. We saw the usually Union Flag bedecked opening sequence have a few star-spangled banners thrown in and Elizabeth Hurley's Vanessa Kensington was replaced with the more than welcome sight of Heather Graham's Felicity Shagwell in The Spy Who Shagged Me. Now, in Goldmember, we get yet another American, this time Beyonce Knowles as Foxxy Cleopatra. Miss Knowles may be a good singer but her acting ability makes Liz Hurley look like she went to RADA.For God sake don't watch this film unless you're a brain-dead vegetable. Buy the first, rent the second but forget this one. I wish I could.1/10 (and that just because of The Mole!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Austin Powers In Goldmember" was laugh-out-loud from beginning to end. The original characters were back: Austin Powers/Dr. Evil/Fat Bastard (Mike Myers), Number 2 (Robert Wagner), Scott Evil (Seth Green), Frau Farbissina (Mindy Sterling), Johnson (Clint Howard), Basil Exposition (Michael York), and Mini-Me (Verne Troyer). We got new characters: Foxy Cleopatra (Beyonce Knowles), Number 3/The Mole (Fred Savage), Nigel Powers (Michael Caine), and Goldmember (Myers). We even got some cameoes: Britney Spears, Steven Spielberg, John Travolta, Gwyneth Paltrow, Tom Cruise, Quincy Jones, Burt Bacharach, The Osbournes, Kevin Spacey, and Danny DeVito.The movie is still shagadelic. There were even twin Japanese sisters named Fook Yu and Fook Mi. My 3 favorite scenes and they're not in particular: 1. The office scene with Austin Powers and Mini-Me. 2. The beginning where they're making a AP movie and Cruise plays AP, Paltrow palys Dixie Normous, Spacey plays Dr. Evil, and Danny Devito plays Mini-Me, and the scene when flips the bird at the screen was very funny. Even Spielberg was directing it. 3. Whenever The Mole shows up every time on the screen. (mole)From what I heard, the movie was originally 3 hours long and they cut out half of it, including: one with Mustafa (Will Farell), the younger Number 2 (Rob Lowe), and the first two AP babes: Vanessa Kensington (Elizabeth Hurley) and Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham). (mooooooolllllleeee)Oh, well. That's why we have DVD and I hope they put the deleted footage in the DVD. But, if you enjoyed the first 2 AP movies, then you'll enjoy "Austin Powers In Goldmember."

		<fullReview>When "Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery" came out in 1997, it made almost $60 million at the B.O., but, became a big hit in the video stores. In 1999, the sequel, "Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me," made more money opening weekend then the original at the B.O. and grossed over $200 million, making Austin Powers one of the funniest characters ever. Now, in 2002, "Austin Powers in Goldmember" has just been released and the movie is more groovier. Besides Mr. Powers, we have all the characters back: Dr. Evil (Mike Myers, who also played Ausitn Powers), Mini-Me (Verne Troyer), Number 2 (Robert Wagner), Frau Farbissina (Mindy Sterling), Scott Evil (Seth Green), Fat Bastard (Myers), and Basil Exposition (Michael York). And we have new characters: Foxy Cleopatra (Beyonce Knowles), Number 3/The Mole (Fred Savage), Nigel Powers (Michael Caine), and Goldmember (Myers). What's also surprising are the cameos: Tom Crusie, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kevin Spacey, Danny DeVito, Steven Speilberg, Burt Bacharach, Quincy Jones, John Travolta, Britney Spears, and The Osbournes.But, after the 1st and 2nd, is the 3rd still funny? Yes. And it's funnier. The jokes are still coming strong (moley moley moley moley) and the new jokes are much funnier (mole) and we see Dr. Evil rapping to Jay-Z's "It's A Hard Knocked Life" (mole mole). Even more surprising is the ending. It's very surprising. If you want to shag for the third time, then "Goldmember" is your ticket.

		<shortDescription>Tired, shagged out series. PS: Woody Allen?!?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first two Austin Powers movies were funny. The third one is a pretty bad rehash. The jokes are just tired now. Some of the parts were rather funny, but this just wasn't up to par with the rest of the series. The humor has slipped further and further down the scale, ending (I hope) here with Goldmember. This one is almost exclusively toilet humor. That, of course, is exactly what most people want.And I have to respond to the person who thought Goldmember parodied Woody Allen. I'll grant that Austin resembles Woody Allen with his glasses, but I don't think it's an intentional parody. The subtitle humor was NOT a parody of Annie Hall--parodying requires some sort of resemblance to the original work, and aside from the subtitles, that is non-existent. The scene in question was not showing their thoughts, only an understandable version of the words. It is, however, still derived from an earlier film: the original (and better) version is in Airplane. If anywhere, I think that's where the reference lies. I haven't seen Purple Rose of Cairo or Stardust yet, so I can't comment on those. Personal opinion, while there might conceivably be some references to Allen (from what the user said, the end is close to Stardust), there is very little Woody Allen influence in Goldmember. Allen's humor was a LOT better, and I couldn't help but feel a little sad when his name was mentioned along with this movie.A few funny moments keep Goldmember from being a complete waste of time, but I really wish I had waited for video. 3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good comedy, weak script, great jokes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Austin Powers started off as a small James Bond-spoofing title back in 1997. Since then, it has grown into a giant marketing juggernaut that has held a firm grip on summer comedies since it's debut. The original had a small budget, but excelled in its script, which was filled with visual gags and memorable quotes, as well as the predominant Bond spoofs it contained. The sequel came out two years later, and received a moderately mixed reception. Some were disappointed with it, as they saw the recycling of old gags and the introduction of more bathroom humour. I, on the other hand, saw it as a worthy sequel that wasn't as good as the original, but could still hold it's own. Now, we have another sequel that allows the Austin Powers series to become a trilogy, a large honour in franchises.The plot goes like this: Dr. Evil has hatched a plan where he will recruit the evil villain Goldmember from 1975, he will kidnap Austin Powers' father in the present and hide him in the 70's, meanwhile, he begins a plan to pull a asteroid into Earth with a tractor beam. Austin must now team up with his former girlfriend Foxxy Cleopatra to save his father and defeat the evil Dr. Evil.Before you see Goldmember, keep in mind that this movie is a lot sillier and crazier than the previous ones. Unlike the first two, this one tends to keep its plot a little contained and focus completely on its jokes and gags, many of which are hilarious. Some scenes are recycled again, but have been turned around so they appear more original (like the "objects that looks suggestive on the radar screen'). The celebrity cameos that were used are really hysterical (I'm not going to spoil anything for you, it's much more funny if you don't expect it) and the spoofing in here was nicely done (a little more subtle this time around). The jokes are what drive this movie, the plot is meaningless as time goes on, and that's one problem. In the first two, a decent plot was used to back the movie up, in this one; it's a little absent. One reason for this is the fact that the editing job is a little poor, so as a result, you really can't tell what is going on sometimes (I had to watch it a second time to understand it).See this one for the humour, just leave your brain at the door and enjoy, that's wait this movie is aiming for. Not as good as the original, about on par with the second one. To be honest, they should end this series now, Goldmember showed a few signs of franchise fatigue as the movie went on, creating a fourth one would just be milking the series.7/10</fullReview>

But don't get we wrong, the opening credits are worth it, so go, and then leave after that. The best part of the entire experience were the junior mints i was eating during the showing, once those were done, the rest was torture. The jokes were used and abused, and the plot twists and turns reached new rancid heights, even for an austin powers film. Mike Myeres is a genius, but you can only take one joke so far. Just watch the first film three times if you want a trilogy. Be thankful the movie is only a meesly hour and a half, and remember the junior mints.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Meyers maintains his comic genious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion many of the critics have been overly harsh in their reviews of the latest "Austin Powers" movie. Is this movie on par with "Citizen Kane?" No, nor was it ever intended to be. Mike Meyers is the one individual who can take crude and sophmoric humor and make it genuinely unoffensive and funny at the same time. It's his gift, which he uses well in this third installment of the "Austin Powers" series.The opening sequence of the movie, which features some wonderfully utilitzed cameos was worth the price of admission all on its own.

		<fullReview>Oh, BEHAVE, Mr Meyers!!!!! Goldmember is the best installment if the Austin Powers Trilogy. I loved the first one, finding the humor clever and goofy. I was disappointed with the second one,the plot was dull and Heather Graham wasn't a good choice for Austin's right-hand gal. Goldmember, however had much more of a plot, incesent humor, and tons of star cameo's. Beyonce' Knowles was funny and charming as Austin's new gal. I was a little wary about Meyers puylling off four characters but it was so great to see him be able to get so into each character and barely resemble himself.All in all, this film is a great film to see if you are in need of a laugh. I left the theater still laughing. Two thumbs up! Very Shagadelic baby, YEAH!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Meyers maintains his comic genious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion many of the critics have been overly harsh in their reviews of the latest "Austin Powers" movie. Is this movie on par with "Citizen Kane?" No, nor was it ever intended to be. Mike Meyers is the one individual who can take crude and sophmoric humor and make it genuinely unoffensive and funny at the same time. It's his gift, which he uses well in this third installment of the "Austin Powers" series.The opening sequence of the movie, which features some wonderfully utilitzed cameos was worth the price of admission all on its own. The starpower and Hollywood muscle utilized in the first five minutes of the film demonstrates that Meyers is worthy of our attention. Meyers' gifted comic characters are skillfully represented with vulnerability and sensitivity that go far beyond the comic intentions of the film its self.

		<shortDescription>Not Better Than Ever, But Still Funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing the first two Powers flicks I was expecting more of the same from the third installment. I got what I expected. It was full of the same type of crude (but effective) humor and sight gags. While it was not as funny as the first two I did find it a worthy sequel over all. Having said that, the move does drag for a little bit towards the middle. Also, I am not sure if Michael Caine was cast correctly. Beyonce Knowles did a refreshing job as Foxy Cleopatra in addition to looking smashing baby! Yeah! Bottom line, if you liked the first two you will like this one. If you did not like the first then duh! You will not like this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was not as good as I had wrongly expected. Only two parts actually made me laugh. The start with the stars playing the parts Austin, Evil etc. I especially like Kevin Spacey as Dr. Evil.The other bit that made me laugh was the Convoy take between Dr. Evil and Goldmember. But apart from that (as Ozzy said himself in the film) They were just using the same ****ing jokes all over again.Beyonce should stick to Destiny's Child. As she has no talent as an actress, none at all. She probably said the line "I'm Foxy Cleopatra!" once while in make-up, and so the makers milked it for all it was worth.The inclusion of the Michael Cane film (of which I do not know the name) seemed very out of place, and was really just a way of making fun of Belgians, and of the Dutch.Also it seemed that the movie was trying to do too many things at once. Austin and Foxy's relationship, Austin and his father's relationship. Dr. Evil and his son, Dr. Evil and his clone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You have to go into these AP movies knowing you are going to be treated with mindless humor. That being said I have to say this was a bit too much re-tread to be enjoyable.I was expecting to be sore from laughing - and it started out great. The whole opening scene was a surprise and had me hysterical. From there it was downhill. If Tom Cruise is the funniest part of a movie then you are in serious trouble.Yes, the movie had a few funny moments but nothing was sustained at all. I don't mind bringing good gags back but it seems like just about every joke is recycled. At least make some kind of effort to put some new GOOD gags into the film.I know the retread gags and the shlocky overused product placement (advertising) is supposed to be an inside joke but it all came across lame. The outright tailoring of much of the movie to the MTV crowd was totally weak. There were entire scenes that were meant to be funny where the theatre was in dead silence (ex. rap video).As I write this I am amazed that this film is listed as 7 star entertainment - maybe I saw a different movie. If this is going to be the level of effort for future AP films then I hope MM puts this puppy to rest.Beyonce is a sight to behold but I am NOT feeling Randy, Baby!!! For the FEW good laughs in this movie I would give 3 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I went to see the long awaited Austin Powers 3 I didnt hold my hopes high due to the sequel 'The Spy Who Shagged Me' being miles from its predossessor. What we get with the movie 'Goldmember' is the same re-hashed humour that seems almost to mock the deformed or different. The first half hour of this farsy third installment comprises of Miss Beyonce Knowles' pretty damb appalling portrayal of Foxxy Cleopatra whpse character by no means adds to the plot. Believe me theres no one sexier than Beyonce Knowles but I would keep on singing baby, for you may be a whole lotta woman but I dont rekon a whole lot to your acting skills.Apart from that 25 minutes seems to be comprised of a joke about a mole, which only the demented people at the back even remotely found interesting and well a mole. Thats your lot.Even though the films first 30 minutes werent enough to keep the joker laughing the movies main star 'Mini Me' seems to be the main part of the humour. Whereas Mike Myers Mindless character 'Goldmember' seems as almost pointless as Beyonce Knowles..but as least shes sexy.Jay Roach should be really dissapointed, in the light of his film 'Meet the Parents' which was the best comedy so far 'Goldmember' seems like another ploy for Jamie Lee Curtis stalker Mike Myers to return and kill us with his 'make more cash, crappy characters.In many ways it seems the movie 'Goldmember' is just a chance for few actors to mess around and hopefully an audience will fall for the same prosessed humour that was seenback in the original movie.All in all Goldmember is a film that delivers few humourous moments but manages to stimulate one small part of the brain. With cameos from Tom Cruise and Kevin Spacey its worth the watch, if not just to see foxxy beyonce in one of her sexy outfits!</fullReview>

During that time Austin meets up with an old girlfriend named Foxy Cleopatra(played with a real sexy by Beyonce Knowles).

		<shortDescription>It's obvious what Mike Myers was trying to do</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS CONTAINED HEREINI have to say that I disagree with Dennis Miller in his opinion that Dana Carvey is the most talented SNL player ever. IMHO that title is reserved for Mike Myers. That being said, the latest Austin Powers offering is not the sterling example of comic hilarity that the first two were. I absolutely adored Austin Powers 1 and 2, but 3, while having some funny moments, lacked any of the big belly laughs and ultra hilarious moments that the first two had. Why is this? The answer is obvious. Myers was actually TRYING to make a film that tied up the first two and made it a trilogy, and sacrificed a lot of spontanaiety in the creative process. His fourth character in the series, Goldmember, is entirely unfunny and serves no purpose. That thing about him eating his own skin was pointless and grosser than any fat bastard floater joke. Speaking of FB, he's one of my favorite characters from the second film, but here it's obvious he's being added just to tie things up. He serves no purpose whatsoever, though he still gave me a few good chuckles.Meanwhile, Austin Powers himself has moved back to take a supporting character status in the last two films. The first one was about Austin's being a fish out of water in a new era, but after that, the real star of the films has always been Dr. Evil. The formerly hilarious supporting cast of Robert Wagner and Mindi Sterling are incidental in the film, and Scott Evil gets to develop, but loses the original intent behind his character. Beyonce Knowles is unfunny and untalented, and Fred Savage has never been funny. There have been comment made that this film seems completely disjointed, just randomness thrown together, and I echo that statement completely. The film wanders all over the place in an attempt to tie up all the loose ends in the films. What is forgotten is that there really isn't a need for such a thing in this kind of comedy. In Star Wars, maybe, but not Austin Powers.Still, there are funny moments in the film, ranging from Dr. Evil's revelation about his true connection to Austin ("I'm Dougie!") to Mini-Me's scene stealing as a double agent and becoming mini-Austin to Dr. Evil's "It's A Hard Knock Life" performance, to Fat Bastard's scenes, there is humour evident. Funnily enough, the superstar cameos at the beginning did little for me, other than the Speilberg moments with Austin (check out Speilberg's double hand springing away from his seat as the opening music hits, that was the funniest part for me). Tom Cruise and Paltrow left me cold, while Kevin Spacey and Devito were funny, it was so short it didn't really entertain me. Britney Spears was entirely unfunny and unentertaining in her short appearance. Like everything else about the pop diva, her appearance was cold, calculated, and entirely manufactured to do one thing: maintain her "cool factor" and not entertain. Actually, the funniest cameo IMHO was by Nathan Lane, who never says an actual word.All in all, it has it's moments, but compared to the hilarity offered by the first two films, it pales in comparison. I'm not worried, though, Myers has loads of untapped talent and I'm sure he has yet another batch of characters ready to amuse us with. Sadly, the Austin Powers era seems to be over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can I say, I loved the first film and although the second film was a carbon copy three hours of Austin Powers beats many other ideas of entertainment. The problem is not the good cast either. After walking out of the cinema I wanted to yeah baby but ended being angry at the sheer arrogance of the filmmakers. They knew that no matter what they did they would make money and the film shows this perfectly. Too little poor jokes and the odd funny joke does not make good comedy. Two days later I am sat writing this and I can't genuinely remember hardly any of the jokes or the good parts of the film. Just a notch above boredom for two hours. Do me a favor, when this comes out on DVD watch this after watching Airplane! Or Naked gun or,or,or....., yesterday I spilled a drink on my shirt and my friend said I have a drinking problem. I said I do not know what you mean and he said shurly you do so I replied I don't know what you mean and don't call me Shirley. What happened to true comedy.

		<fullReview>Allen's Influence Present Throughout AP3Most of the kids that saw Austin Powers 3 may never have seen a Woody Allen movie. Some adults that saw it may have recognized that scene that emulated Annie Hall, but the movie also borrows from some of Allen's lesser known movies.A hand-drawn picture of Austin Powers was displayed in this movie, and it looked amazingly like Woody Allen. I dismissed this at first, though Powers had already jumped through a movie screen, coming to real life, alá Purple Rose of Cairo.Myers does not as much borrow, than parody the scene from Annie Hall. Which one? Why, the scene where Alvy and Annie speak meaningless garbage, while their true thoughts are displayed on-screen through subtitles. So Austin Powers and his father (Michael Caine) are in a room full of American girls. Caine suggests that they speak in "English." While saying things that could only be discernable by Brits, subtitles appear, informing us Americans what they mean.Finally when the plot ends happily, we feel as if we are watching Stardust Memories all over again. We are taken to the premiere where the actors have just finished watching Austin Powers 3. They applaud, then rise from their seats, just as in Stardust Memories. You can just feel Myers' overpowering affinity to Allen by paying homage to him, using this esoteric reference, while knowing it will fly over the heads of the majority of the crowd.However, I believe some people noticed what was going on. The point of this message is to ask, were there any other Allen movies that were parodied?</fullReview>

I like to see fat guys taking a crap, or a guy who has a winker of gold'. Get real guys.Myers, yet again, plays Austin Powers, Dr. Evil, Fat Bastard, and the totally new and totally unfunny Goldmember quipped `I LOVE GOLD!' Well, in the first five minutes, Powers captures Dr. Evil (sigh), and gets knighted by the queen. Guess who didn't show up? You guessed it, Nigel Powers, portrayed by Michael Caine, who wasted his great acting skills in this load of crap.Which brings us to the stupid new idea that daddy-never-loved Austin bull. Well, we didn't hear about it in the other films. I think it's because Felicity Shagwell (who was portrayed terribly by Heather Graham) just got up and left, and was never heard of again. Boring?New jokes, please. Most of them are just like the former Austin movies. If Myers was such a genius, why did he put the same jokes in? Half are really funny; the other half is gross and idiotic. Hmm, can we be original again Myers?The two good things: 1.) Beyonce Knowles. I can say that the only reason I enjoyed this film is because I could look at a beautiful woman running around with an attitude. Groovy baby! She was sexy, slim, hip, funny (the former Austin girls didn't do so well), and she can actually sing. Rock on Knowles! 2.) Nice soundtrack. They had many songs that were actually good! I liked that Knowles did her songs by herself. Sounds like she's the only talent in Destiny's Child.If I can sum up this film for you, here it is. Just think opposite the title.

It's obvious that Myers is mining the Austin Powers franchise for every last shekel, yet obviously hasn't any fresh ideas to deliver in exchange.Others have covered the plot, so I'll not get into this paltriness, but suffice to say that it's thin...by any standard. And the star turns are obnoxious. Hard to imagine that Mike Myers thought it would be a good idea to rip off the concept of Get Shorty, but indeed he did. I hope Elmore Leonard is getting his royalties - because they sure ripped his idea off.Skip this rubbish - spend your money elsewhere and don't feed the Austin Powers beast - you'll get nothing in exchange except the vague realization that you've been violated - rather like being molested while you sleep.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found the first of the trilogy to be average; the second I thought amusing. I was not therefore expecting AUSTIN POWERS 3: GOLDMEMBER to be so truly terrible.Forgetting the fact that the jokes are simply recycled from the previous movies; the plot, writing and direction were an embarrassment. The movie didn't flow, its ending was a cop-out of the greatest proportion, GOLDMEMBER had no point being in the movie other than to provide a title, and as for the mole jokes - what are you, kidding me? Perhaps it was ok the first time AUSTIN was shocked, but after that it got to a point where you felt embarrassed for MIKE MYERS having to sink so low to try to be funny. Going to the dentists would have been less painful.The only part of the movie I'd recommend as being watchable is the opening sequence which is mildly amusing, though it has been done in many a film before it.If you want to be astounded by the garbage that Hollywood churns out, and their line of thinking that goes "Hey, we know it doesn't make sense, but its Austin Powers so it doesn't matter", go see this movie. If not, don't!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Did this movie make me laugh? Occasionally, I'll admit, but not as much as I would have liked.Maybe I'm missing the point of the Austin Powers movies in general, but even the first one seemed like it was a conglomeration of old, used jokes. Even the spy movie satire elements were nothing that other movies hadn't poked fun at dozens of times before.When the first sequel appeared a couple of years back, a few of the jokes still had enough life left in them to repeat one last time, but now that Goldmember is here, I assure you, all remaining humor has long since been wrung out of them.If you want to see yet another try at the sugegstive shadow scene, the fembots (this time with a celebrity cameo in a desparate attempt to make them funny again), more clone jokes, and even more of the father/son conflict than you saw before, then by all means, feel free to go for another helping, and don't let my criticism stop you, but don't blame me if you feel like you've seen it all before.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has its moments but they are simply moments with a lot of failed jokes in between. The first Austin Powers was groundbreaking and excellent, the second played off of that and was unusually good for a sequel although not as good as the first, and this latest third installment just struggles throughout.The opening sequences lend themselves of the humor from the first, but they quickly fade. Many of the jokes from the first two are simply reused and are no longer funny since we know what is going to happen either from seeing the previous films or the many parodies that stemmed from them.Mike Myers still has potential in the characters of Austin and Dr. Evil and both do have good scenes but there was a lot more that could have been done but was not. Goldmember is rather 2 dimentional and Fat Bastard who was excellent from the second installment, seemed to be added in as an afterthought. Suprisingly, Scott seems to be the most developed character in this film.The franchise has been milked for all it is worth and is in evident decline. Unfortunatly there is an opening for a fourth film. Please, leave the franchise with some dignity and do not make a fourth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Allen's Influence Present Throughout AP3Most of the kids that saw Austin Powers 3 may never have seen a Woody Allen movie. Some adults that saw it may have recognized that scene that emulated Annie Hall, but the movie also borrows from some of Allen's lesser known movies.A hand-drawn picture of Austin Powers was displayed in this movie, and it looked amazingly like Woody Allen. I dismissed this at first, though Powers had already jumped through a movie screen, coming to real life, alá Purple Rose of Cairo.Myers does not as much borrow, than parody the scene from Annie Hall. Which one? Why, the scene where Alvy and Annie speak meaningless garbage, while their true thoughts are displayed on-screen through subtitles. So Austin Powers and his father (Michael Caine) are in a room full of American girls. Caine suggests that they speak in "English." While saying things that could only be discernable by Brits, subtitles appear, informing us Americans what they mean.Finally when the plot ends happily, we feel as if we are watching Stardust Memories all over again. We are taken to the premiere where the actors have just finished watching Austin Powers 3. They applaud, then rise from their seats, just as in Stardust Memories. You can just feel Myers' overpowering affinity to Allen by paying homage to him, using this esoteric reference, while knowing it will fly over the heads of the majority of the crowd.However, I believe some people noticed what was going on. The point of this message is to ask, were there any other Allen movies that were parodied?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not the best Austin powers, but it works. To see the return of these monsterously creative characters and to see the cameos makes one feel as if an old friend who you haven't seen in say a few years stops by. You and this friend have a great time until the changes become evident and then its almost as if you have a new friend...and some of the changes you don't like, but you still want this friend, so you accept and move on. This is what one must do when experiencing Austin Powers in Goldmember. Austin and the usual gang are back, but there are quite a few changes. These changes make for both an engaging and fun way to look at the AP franchise, but also a way to kill it.I had a fun time with Goldmember and you should too...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Although Austin loses a bit of his mojo, "Goldmember" finds humor in supporting roles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(lots of spoilers ahead) I didn't find Austin Powers as shag-a-delic in this third installment. Unlike the first two films, "Goldmember" begins with a bright spark - undeniably the best opening sequence I have ever seen (although Britney seemed unnecessary - I kept thinking if I watched this movie on DVD in 10 years if I'd have to explain who that girl is). Tom Cruise smiling at the camera, Kevin Spacey slowing putting his pinky to his mouth, and Danny Devito flipping off the camera were fantastic. The flashback sequence to Dr. Evil &amp; Austin in college further ignited my curiosity for the rest of the film. Unfortunately this flame quickly dies out after the first hour.What happened to Austin's sexy sidekick? I didn't think Heather Graham measured up to Elizabeth Hurley, but at least she had chemistry with Myers. Beyonce Knowles' character Foxy Cleopatra is not useful to the plot and should have been left on the cutting room floor. She's supposed to be a spy, but it seems more like she's just following Austin around the set, waiting for him to make the first move. While the audience laughed at Austin's former sidekicks, Foxy's mantra "whole lotta woman" gets tired. Dr. Evil and Mini Me carry this film, as they did in the second film of the series. As a result of the somewhat-serious storyline with Austin's father, new characters Goldmember and Sexy Cleopatra fail to add laughs or significance to the plot. Fat Bastard was awful in AP2, and is still awful. The Mole, TERRIBLE. Austin not shagging anybody, TERRIBLE.Overall, I give the film a 7 out of 10. Austin Powers' fans will appreciate the inside jokes and repetitive humor. Dr. Evil and Mini Me are fantastic! Not enough Frau or Number 2. Mini Me is the only one who has a comical chemistry with Cleopatra ... more toilet humor of course. I truly appreciate toilet humor. I'm curious to see what Myers will come up with next for the character of Scott Evil. Scott was so original in the original, I don't know where else he can go now. I think Myers should give Mini Me a shot next to take over the world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is way too overrated, I mean, it's just another silly, idiotic comedy. We got idiot's screaming `Myers, pure genius. I like to see fat guys taking a crap, or a guy who has a winker of gold'. Get real guys.Myers, yet again, plays Austin Powers, Dr. Evil, Fat Bastard, and the totally new and totally unfunny Goldmember quipped `I LOVE GOLD!' Well, in the first five minutes, Powers captures Dr. Evil (sigh), and gets knighted by the queen. Guess who didn't show up? You guessed it, Nigel Powers, portrayed by Michael Caine, who wasted his great acting skills in this load of crap.Which brings us to the stupid new idea that daddy-never-loved Austin bull. Well, we didn't hear about it in the other films. I think it's because Felicity Shagwell (who was portrayed terribly by Heather Graham) just got up and left, and was never heard of again. Boring?New jokes, please. Most of them are just like the former Austin movies. If Myers was such a genius, why did he put the same jokes in? Half are really funny; the other half is gross and idiotic. Hmm, can we be original again Myers?The two good things: 1.) Beyonce Knowles. I can say that the only reason I enjoyed this film is because I could look at a beautiful woman running around with an attitude. Groovy baby! She was sexy, slim, hip, funny (the former Austin girls didn't do so well), and she can actually sing. Rock on Knowles! 2.) Nice soundtrack. They had many songs that were actually good! I liked that Knowles did her songs by herself. Sounds like she's the only talent in Destiny's Child.If I can sum up this film for you, here it is. Just think opposite the title. Pure gold, no, pure s***. I hate this movie so very much.Austin Powers: Goldmember get a D-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps I should begin this review with a brief history of my experiences with Austin Powers. The first movie I saw when I was in sixth grade and me being a huge James Bond fan my mother offered to take me, both of us unaware of the barrage of sexual innuendo. I was forced to walk out and for many years after that I despised Austin Powers and felt that it represented the low-brow humor of my generation which I was "so much above."When, "The Spy Who Shagged Me" came out I went with a friend who really wanted to see it, and it being his birthday, I was unable to avoid it. Needless to say I laughed my ass off, at first unwillingly, then, after a while, I just couldn't control it anymore. Since than I have seen the rest of the original, but only in sections.I went to see Goldmember the second day it was out. The audience was primed, everyone was excited and it was a total laugh riot. Complete with movie riffs dance numbers and, of course, fart jokes, this was equal to The Spy Who Shagged Me, if not better. I was unfettered by any superiority complexes and I just laughed. Foxxy was a great character, even if she herself didn't have any funny lines. She didn't need to! Beyonce Knowles was the perfect straight man (err, woman) for Myers, in all his forms, and for Nathan Lane, in his brief, but hilarious, cameo. I ended up seeing this one twice and it makes me regret seeing the first and second films only once.The opening sequence was great and the movie went up from there. Although I found Fat Bastard unfunny I was cracking up at just about everything else. So what if some of the jokes were reused. The point is that this movie contained riffs on the spy genre and on the original two Austin Powers' movies, which, if you think about it, just stole scenes from James Bond movies, which were just as cliche, and twisted them around to make them funny. The first and second Austin Powers' funniest themes were ripped off of older movies (bald evil genius who has a furry white cat and elaborate plans to kill his enemies and tae over the world that never quite work and never make any sense, evil henchman, people who don't die or who escape death through extremely unplausible and unsensible situations, an oversexed superspy, a female lea whose only job is to be sexy, the list goes on).The point is that after three movies Myers can juggle four characters and keep them all fresh and funny.There was never much originality to the Austin Powers' franchise. The jokes were just raunchier than what people were used to. But they all made people laugh. I don't rate the films as best or worst in the series, they are all good and Myers should be complimented for creating a smashing good time.P.S.: Word is that there were over forty minutes of deleted scenes which will show up on the DVD, one of which shows what happens to Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham).</fullReview>

They've recycled all the best jokes from the last movie. They added very little new material and the paper thin plot gets really tedious after a while. Then, they have the gall to rub your nose in the fact that you actually paid to see this film(Ozzy Osbourne segment). I expected more from Mike Myers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Diminishing returns</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Goldmember delivers almost everything you can expect from the movie - most of the previous characters return to deliver their best gags from the first two movies, with enough new material added to the mix to make it worth watching. Unfortunately, the new characters and plot points suffer from being chronically under written - the eponymous Goldmember being a good example. Is he supposed to be funny just because he's Dutch and therefore "weird"? Okay, a basis for a character, but surely it's got to be developed from there. The jokes and patter run much as in the previous movies, and are still quite funny, but the laughs are now in recognition rather than guffaw-inducing humour. I like the two previous movies, and I enjoyed this one, but it could have been a lot better with just a little more effort. Also, Austin seems to have become a shadow of himself in this movie. Where are all his women? And wasn't the whole joke with Austin the anachronism of this 60s persona trying to deal with the 90s? So why isn't Austin's 60s/70s clash, with a dash of turn-of-the-century hindsight/foresight, explored in this movie, when Austin goes back to find Goldmember? It would seem like an obvious, and interesting, joke but is never explored. Instead, these 'subtler' points from the first movie are replaced by cruder dick and fart gags. Still, a good movie but not great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While I am a big Mike Myers fan, as I was leaving the theatre I felt that he had just plain run out of material when writing this film. On the other hand, I needed to watch the first two films at home before I truly began to appreciate Myers' wit. Perhaps I'll like this one better if I see it several times. There was much less of a story line compared to the last films.I don't know who the targeted audience was, but to me the over abundance of scatological jokes became boring quite quickly. I feel that its a shame that this, his least worthy Austin Powers flick, grossed more the first week than the original film grossed in its entire existence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Austin is out of mojo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Austin Powers in Goldmember has got to be the most disappointing movies I've seen this year. Being a huge Austin Powers fan, it was strange to find myself barely awake through this somewhat pathetic attempt at a comedy. I can count on one hand the original and truly humorous scenes and lines. Unfortunately, I could rant for an hour or two about the disgusting, offensive and generally un-funny situations Austin finds himself in during this latest episode. The introduction of Austin's father is the one saving element of the film. The character is truly how one would picture the International Man of Mystery's pop. The great opening credits, a play off of subtitles and a flashback produced the only heartfelt laughs. Goldmember would have induced vomiting if I had eaten more popcorn. He was hideous to look at and generally unpleasant (which would've been alright...if he was funny). Take that and throw in the Osbournes. And Britney Spears. Pretty unappealing, eh? The jokes were either old, crude, or just plain stupid. Beyonce was great...for what she had to work with. Her character was cliched and abrasive. My rating...5. My suggestion...don't bother.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was looking forward to seeing this so much, I had read reviews that raved about it. I had seen the last two (many, many times) and loved them to bits. But I came out very disappointed.It looked like a film that was made for the sake of making a film. Ok, so I did laugh, there are a few good moments but "on the whole" I was cringing for large chunks of this film. Too much of it was poorly thought out humour, where the jokes were obvious and just not funny.The set of characters for this film were poor. Foxy Cleopatra??? She might as well not have been in that film at all, why was she anyway? Terrible, how many times did she say the same thing? Number 2? Why was he there?, underused. Frau (Not going to attempt to spell her name, you know who!) was underused too. Micheal Caine's character was terrible and he got landed with two of the worst jokes in this film. I was glad to see Fat Bastard back, because I liked him, but, like most of this film, his appearance was all a bit pointless. In a film that never really goes anywhere.It all ended up being complete nonsense and the already weak storyline fell to pieces. I doubt there will be a 4th, I think Ive just witnessed the sad ending of another good series of films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this movie was one of the best movies I have seen in a long, long, time. I don't understand why so many people thought this was the worst of the three Austin Power movies. This is better than the second, and tons better than the first. It has a much better plot, and the characters have even developed a lot more. I still like the original characters, and most of of the new characters are well thought up, including, Goldmember, Foxxy Cleapatra, Nigel Powers, and Mole. Possible SpoilersThere were some things I didn't like about the new film, and they are, -The Cameos. In my opinion that was so stupid. Who thought up that idea? What was so clever about that? -The Ending. The ending was kind of neat, and kind of stupid. It was cool that Austin Powers and Dr. Evil are actually brothers, but, I don't think Dr. Evil should have turned good. Now, how are they going to make a 4th one? Some people are probablyshouting out for joy, but I'm not. They are really good movies. They will have to think something up.This is my disappointment on the whole Austin Powers Trilogy. Too Raunchy. Most of it is not that bad, but alot of the sexual stuff gets kind of uncomfortable. I wish they could tone it down a little bit, and it would make it alot more enjoyable. Other than a couple minor details, it was a fantastic movie. I can't wait to get it on DVD. My rating is 10/10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought that this film was good. Normally, slap-stick humour applied in films as a way of replacing a good story-line does not remotely engage, interest, or make me laugh in any shape or form. I dislike films such as There's Something About Mary and Scary Movie. I haven't as yet seen Austin Powers: The spy who shagged me, so I cannot comment on the trilogy as a whole, but from what I've seen, it is very funny. Like the aforementioned films, there is no original story-line, but the humour is definitely more intelligent, and it is used to complement, rather than compensate for, the story-line. As opposed to the take-offs in Scary Movie, the references to other films (such as Silence of the Lambs and The Italian Job) were subtle, which meant that they were invariably more funny. And a lot of the humour was genuinely hilarious, such as the exchanges between Scott and Dr Evil.Do not go into the cinema expecting a striking screen-play; enjoy it for the slick comedy that it is!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, some movies are meant to be dissected, analyzed, scrutinized... but not this movie baby! One word says it best; entertaining! Oh, I could say things like "the plot was weak" or "some jokes were repeated" or "it was stupid". But why should I? I'll leave that to other hard-to-please movie go-ers. I loved it. I laughed, and I cried from laughter. What type of movie is it? It's a FUN movie and also visually pleasing. The jokes are very funny indeed, but it's mostly in the way that they are conveyed, and the interaction between the characters that make them ridiculously hilarious. This movie is not meant to please film school graduates. It's a C-O-M-E-D-Y !! No, it's not for everyone, to be sure. But if you have a similar type of sense of humour as several million other people who appreciate Austin Powers movies do, than you will enjoy Goldmember. If it's not your type of humour, than don't. Heck, some people find other movies funny when I don't. One's sense of humour can be very different from the next person. That's what makes us unique. It is impossible to make a comedy that will make everyone laugh. That's why comedies are probably the most difficult genre of movie to make. One thing's for sure though; the Austin Powers series has been funnier than most other comedy movies in North America, based on the public's accounts (forget box office sales). Mike Myers has succeeded in making more people laugh than most of us, and for that I thank him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A big fan of the first two Austin Powers movies, I felt that this third installment wasn't nearly as funny nor did it have much of a plot. Sure it had some hilarious moments, but overall it didn't even compare with its predecessors. For me, any movie that is under 90 minutes is either a kids movie, or just not worth seeing. Just a coincidence I guess. I've seen the movie listed as being 2:13 long but I timed it at 1:28.I realize that Mike Meyers did this show as a tribute to his father, but for the type of shows the first two Austin Powers movies were about, this one seemed rather sappy. I respect the love and affection he had for his real father, but it just didn't play well in a bathroom humor type of comedy. Not to give it away, but the ending was completely awful. Perhaps this is it for the Austin Powers series. One thing I will give it...the makeup is incredible. They did a terrific job with Goldmember. I can't see Mike Meyers in him at all.</fullReview>

The best parts of the film are the cameos at the beginning and towards the end of the film. I won't mention the stars featured but it's worth waiting for. As much as I would like to see more Austin Powers, I think now's the time to stop. Everything has been wrapped up and there isn't really any other direction the franchise can go to.To the makers of the film: Quit while you're ahead. Don't let the saga drag on and on. Look at the Friday The 13th or Halloween franchises!Overall, a great comedy film which is well worth watching.</fullReview>

Another thing that bothered me was a long setup for one line involving "Mr.Roboto". It was not funny and I knew it was coming as soon as I heard the word Roboto.

The bottom line is that Mike Myers can be funny even if most of his humour does involve bodily functions (The Spy Who Shagged Me). But in this film he goes too far and uses too many stale jokes. I give it two stars out of five.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't ya hate it when some of the best scenes of a movie are in the previews?Not all of them of course. I will list a few pleasant SPOILER surprises in a moment.Too many self-aware jokes for my bag baby. How many of those can we do before it gets tired? Self aware jokes are simply inserted when there are holes in the script. One or two is effective. But 5 or more and it becomes a bit insulting...*SPOILERS*Highlights for me included DANNY DEVITO (perfect!!) and Mini-Me crossing over....loved it. Didn't see it coming!Enjoyed Dr. Evil in prison and I even enjoyed Fat Bastard's sumo wrestling.At times, the movie felt so busy though, that I actually wandered off mentally. Too many bells and whistles going off...exhausting.Although, I liked that Dr. Evil and Austin Powers had relative peace at the end and that Scott Evil looks to take over the evil throne, I sure hope Dr. Evil won't let Scott hanging to carry the lair all by himself. I really hope, if they write another installment, that Dr. Evil and Austin Powers will go back to fighting against each other. Drama is conflict and peace in entertainment can be quite boring.But, it's only a movie... 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As far as Austin Powers movies go, I can say that this movie was almost a stroke of brilliance(again, only by Austin Powers movies terms.) The only reason I think that I didn't give this movie a perfect ten,(I gave it a nine,) is only because the ending was quite obvious. The other 2 I loved also but not as much. By ratings terms, I'd give them each an 8. Still I loved all three, but I beleive that a 4th wouldn't be a great idea. And couldn't be as successful as the three existing titles. For those who saw the movie they will know what I mean.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought that this film was good. Normally, slap-stick humour applied in films as a way of replacing a good story-line does not remotely engage, interest, or make me laugh in any shape or form. I dislike films such as There's Something About Mary and Scary Movie. I haven't as yet seen Austin Powers: The spy who shagged me, so I cannot comment on the trilogy as a whole, but from what I've seen, it is very funny. Like the aforementioned films, there is no original story-line, but the humour is definitely more intelligent, and it is used to complement, rather than compensate for, the story-line. As opposed to the take-offs in Scary Movie, the references to other films (such as Silence of the Lambs and The Italian Job) were subtle, which meant that they were invariably more funny. And a lot of the humour was genuinely hilarious, such as the exchanges between Scott and Dr Evil.Do not go into the cinema expecting a striking screen-play; enjoy it for the slick comedy that it is!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this movie was one of the best movies I have seen in a long, long, time. I don't understand why so many people thought this was the worst of the three Austin Power movies. This is better than the second, and tons better than the first. It has a much better plot, and the characters have even developed a lot more. I still like the original characters, and most of of the new characters are well thought up, including, Goldmember, Foxxy Cleapatra, Nigel Powers, and Mole. Possible SpoilersThere were some things I didn't like about the new film, and they are, -The Cameos. In my opinion that was so stupid. Who thought up that idea? What was so clever about that? -The Ending. The ending was kind of neat, and kind of stupid. It was cool that Austin Powers and Dr. Evil are actually brothers, but, I don't think Dr. Evil should have turned good. Now, how are they going to make a 4th one? Some people are probablyshouting out for joy, but I'm not. They are really good movies. They will have to think something up.This is my disappointment on the whole Austin Powers Trilogy. Too Raunchy. Most of it is not that bad, but alot of the sexual stuff gets kind of uncomfortable. I wish they could tone it down a little bit, and it would make it alot more enjoyable. Other than a couple minor details, it was a fantastic movie. I can't wait to get it on DVD. My rating is 10/10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was Saturday, I was bored, so I decided to live out the British Spy in me and go see Austin Powers, the first two movies of which I found hilarious and superb.I would have had more fun watching a snail cross the road.Honestly people, maybe it was me, maybe I didn't get the jokes... but when I went to this movie, I was stunned to find myself holding the popcorn bag to my face, waiting for someone to throw Goldmember off a bridge or something.The Good: The beginning. Instant gut-implosion time, woot!The Bad: Is it just me, or did Doctor Evil totally change facial expressions more than ever? Also very little Frau and Number 2. Pity.The Ugly: GOLDMEMBER. If I saw one more moment of him, that bag would have had more in it than just POPCORN.The only way anyone would ever drag me to that movie again is so that I could see that marvelous Two Towers trailer, and some more Bond. Cool.Final rating: (1.5/5) Retire baby, yea!</fullReview>

Golmeber is one of the funniest movies to come along in years and i think it deserves better credits then what you so called "movie lovers" have gave it. You obviously dont like movies if you do not like Austin Powers in Goldmeber. Goldmeber is by far in my top 5 for funniest movies, and its number 2. So all you haters you suck and if you didnt like it thats your fault you officialy have no scence of humor or a life. Same jokes get funnier. Yah i'll admitt some jokes are the same but they are renewed and better. So ALL YOU REAL AUSTIN POWERS FANS GO SEE IT I KNOW YOU WILL LOVE IT. Also if you dont like it and if they come out with a 4th all you haters dont see it cuz your obviously just gonna dis it and that makes you a complete idiot. SO GO SEE AUSTIN POWERS IN GOLDMEBER CUZ ITS ONE OF THE BEST COMEDY MOVIES IN YEARS SINCE THE FIRST 2.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the opening shots of the newest installment in the Austin Powers series it becomes apparent that much more money has been spent than in previous films. It also becomes clear that jokes that seem like they'll be funny ultimately fall flat. Furthermore, jokes that seem like they'll fall flat from the beginning do in fact fall flat, and are then rammed in our faces at least three more times for us cringe.The film is loaded with potentially funny celebrity cameos. It is also loaded with jokes that had no business making it through editing. (Austin: (After destroying a Fembot Britney Spears) Oops, I did it again.)Product placement runs wild through the film as well.Watching `Goldmember' is for the most part tragically embarrassing. It occurred to me about 20 minutes into the film that it didn't even seem like it was Mike Myers playing his characters, but rather someone who looked just like Mike Myers but could only do a sloppy impression. Austin himself is immensely pathetic. Dr. Evil seems to take on some strange Canadian traits. Fat Bastard...was dead, was he not? Well, anyway, he's annoying here. And last and least is Goldmember, an annoying and highly underdeveloped character. (How do we know he likes gold? Because he says he likes gold, that's it.) Other actors don't have much luck either. Beyonce Knowles does practically nothing as Foxy Cleopatra, although she admittedly seems like she could be fun. Michael Caine is good with what he has, or I should say, what little he has. Infact, the only consistently funny character is Mini Me, who is suprisingly hilarious in all of his scenes.Part of the problem may be that there are so many `things' the Powers movies always do, that this film is stifled by having to go out of its way to do them. A very unsatisfying series of `It's a (insert body part name here)' should have been cut, rather than kept only to keep with tradition.When the movie is funny, which does happen, it is very funny. The rap with Dr. Evil and Mini Me in prison is hilarious, the fight between Austin and Mini Me is hilarious. Some jokes about urination and childbirth are also particularly funny. These rare moments don't come closing to making up for the general schlock-ish feel of the film. This Austin Powers is unfunny, predictable and utterly forgettable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the best of the AP series, but still fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a hectic driving experience and a quick scurry to the popcorn and candy stand, we were in our seats for the new Goldmember flick. Let me just say that for right now, this is not my favorite AP sequel, but it does have its moments. Mike Meyers is a very funny man, and once again he brings an amazing range of character and humor to his four different roles (Austin, Dr. Evil, Fat Bastard, and Goldmember). Mini-Me gets his time in the spotlight, there's a very funny, cameo-packed opening, and some gross, albeit hilarious, body humor. Yes, we get a bunch of the old stuff (that looks like a giant--Johnson!), but Mike knows this and builds on it. Also, for all the hype around the title character, Dutch mastermind Goldmember isn't all that funny. Oh, and why does he eat his skin??? That's one odd choice that didn't result in a laugh. Michael Caine, who plays Austin's father, Nigel, doesn't get enough screen time and that's too bad. He was pretty good considering he played all of the material with a very faupish, England straight face. And now here are some spoilers for you: Beware!1. Cameos include Danny DeVito, Tom Cruise, John Travolta, Nathan Lane, the Osbournes, Steven Spielberg, and Fred Savage. All in all none of them were too inspiring (though I had read about the 'hilarious opener' beforehand, so the movie can't be faulted). Nathan Lane was the best of the bunch.2. Mini-Me becomes a good guy! Whouda thunk, huh? Verne Troyer gets a lot more screen time in Goldmember. The result? Ensuing hilarity!3. Turns out Dr. Evil is NOT Austin's father (as joked about in the second film), but his brother! Yep, turns out they were siblings all along. Needless to say, Dr. Evil joins sides with Austin to stop the dastardly Goldmember. Oh, and Dr. Evil's name is Dougy!4. Scott Evil becomes...evil! And in a stunt that pretty much confirms the next sequel, he becomes the new supervillain. Does that mean I want another AP movie? Maybe, but it has to be a little funnier than this.***/****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A funny movie, but the weakest of the three.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>** 1/2Starring: Mike Myers, Beyonce Knowles, Michael Caine, and Verne Troyer.The follow-up to the hilarious Austin Powers franchise started in a hilarious opening. Things were looking quite up from there, except that it fell down a deep hill as the movie went on. The movie's plot is practically like the first two movie's plots. Austin having fun, he time travels, finds Dr. Evil, bathroom jokes, and so on. Austin Powers goes back to 1975 to find his kidnapped father. He meets up with Foxxy Cleopatra, a cross between pam Grier and Tamara Dobson. I really didn't like her character too much. She was funny at times, but she really was there for eye candy. Austin and Foxxy find a new foe, Goldmember. A strange Dutch who isn't that funny and makes you cringe more than laugh. They save Austin's father and must foil Dr. Evil and Goldmember's plan. This movie is full of bathroom humor, sometimes funny, sometimes stupid. They had some really good moments but not enough. I must also say that Fat Bastard was hardly in this, yet he stole every scene he was in. Dr. Evil and Minime also steal every scene they are in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The beginning and middle were funny but the ending SUCKED (WARNING: MAJOR SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although not a true fan, I enjoy the Austin Powers series and looked forward to the release of the third sequel. First, I must say that at first Beyoncé Knowles seemed to be out of place but as the movie went on she seemed fit in pretty well but was quite different than Elizabeth Hurley or Heather Graham were to the other Austin Powers movies. Although there wasn't much of a plotline (Dr. Evil hatched a plot to destroy the world but it wasn't as prominent as in the other two movies), there were plenty of jokes true to the storyline as well as entertaining action.Until the end, that is, where there was a huge plot twist that absolutely ruined the Austin Powers franchise.WARNING: LOTS OF SPOILERS AHEAD...SKIP THIS IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE!I have to say that the cameos in the beginning were absolutely hilarious, with my favorite being Danny DeVito as Mini-Me. The middle wasn't quite as funny, but it still has its entertaining moments. The Fat Bastard sumo wrestling scene, the Godzilla "copyright , infringement" scene, and Mini-Me's remarks to Foxy Cleopatra about "having a little clone inside herself" were some of my favorites. The one thing that really annoys me is that they made a big deal of going back in time to 1975 but were there for what, five minutes?Now for the end: As Scott Evil loses his trademark character and becomes "Evil", Nigel Powers (Austin Powers's father) reveals that he is Dr. Evil's father as well and they all come together in one big happy family...so Austin Powers and Dr. Evil (not to mention his entire organization) are friends. Aside from the fact that this was not funny at all, it also left very little room for a future installment (which I would have liked). Are the producers and writers trying to kill the franchise? What's next, Austin against Scott Evil? That would be awful.On a side note, Goldmember seemed to be a pointless addition.Overall, I would give Austin Powers in Goldmember a 6.5 out of 10. The first (Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery) was my favorite with The Spy who Shagged Me second and Goldmember third.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this film was funny and did enjoy it, although i was some what dissapointed.I suppose its because i had very high expectations of the film and was expecting something amazing! Really i shouldnt have done that, because it sort of let me down! I don't know what i was expecting but it didnt have that 'thing' i thought would b there!Don't get me wrong there were some very funny scenes and i did laugh out loud, but there wasn't really any plot to the film. I know Austin Powers is definatly not to be taken seriously but to be fair i was laughing at the jokes without really having a clue what was going on!Its obvious that this film was going to be a hit whatever they put in the film because everyone was going to go and see it purely because the first 2 were so good and many people, including me, love the AP films. It was going to make millions without even trying - as soon as I found out there was going to be a 3rd film, i couldn't wait - i was definatly going to go and see it along with my other AP fanatic friends!So, yes i enjoyed it and yes i laughed a lot but some of jokes that they used from the last film didn't work quite as well. May b it was because they weren't origional, i dont know! I loved the first of these films and the second one was my favorite but to be fair i have watched them over and over again and they seem to get better each time because you always miss some things the first time you watch a film, so no doubt i will be watching this one again and again in the future. :)Another thing, most of the characters were brilliant but i really didnt get what was going on with 'Goldmember' - i didn't really find him funny! But saying that the others charaters were good and funny and the surprise appearences are brilliant! Although i did feel that Austin had lost some of his 'shagadelic' charm and his 'mojo' wasn't quite all there! Again i don't know why! Still on the whole characters were good. :)I know there are a lot of mixed feelings about this film, some absoultly love it, some, like me enjoyed it but felt it could have been a bit better and others hated it.Still as long as i enjoyed it thats the main thing and maybe next time i watch it i'll get the plot! (if there is one!)I think people should definaltly go and see it especially if they enjoyed the first 2, because its best to make your own opinions of a film!It was funny and i laughed so im happy and there is no denying if there is a 4th Austin Powers going to come out i will definatly be seeing it! :)YEH BABY YEH!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Austin is 'member' of gold-star club of coolness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yeah, baby, yeah! Austin Powers returns after being an International Man of Mystery and meeting up with The Spy Who Shagged Me. The always hip Mike Myers reprises his tour-de-force role, playing multiple roles, including Austin's archenemy, Dr. Evil; and the loquacious, foul Fat Bastard.This time around, Austin's just been knighted by the Queen of England - and his dad (a notorious no-show) isn't there to witness the great event. But no matter, soon Austin's off to stop the nefarious world-domination plot of Dr. Evil. Austin's transported to 1975 in a chic time machine and meets up with Foxy Cleopatra (Beyonce Knowles), a fellow agent. Foxy works for Goldmember, a sinister villain who happens to run a trendy disco club (where Foxy sings, of course). Goldmember's famous for his love of gold; his name stems from the fact that a certain part of his anatomy is golden, owing to a horrible smelting accident.Austin and Foxy know that Goldmember has been working on a plan for Dr. Evil, and they're sworn to stop him. That's about all of the plot you need to know now. There are some twists and turns, some absolutely hilarious. Along for the ride are, as in the past films, Seth Green as Scott Evil; Robert Wagner as Number Two, Michael York as Basil, and Verne Troyer as Mini-Me. Adding to the mayhem is Michael Caine with a somewhat smarmy bit as Austin's itinerant dad (although he's a bit under-used; just about any actor could have done the same in this role).The first thing one asks before seeing this film is, "Will this be as entertaining as the first two films?" The answer is yes, my friends, yes it is. There are a zillion jokes, and they're largely hit and miss, but those that hit are very funny. One of the misses is actually a hit, too - the opening sequence, which is a movie about Austin Powers - but not starring Austin as Austin, but rather an even more recognizable face, in one of many celebrity cameos.Any movie that has you rattling off its catch phrases as you depart the theater is a good movie, in my book. I kept saying, "Oh, behave!" even though there was no one else in the car. I even looked over at cars parked next to me at traffic lights, with my eyebrow raised and my mouth widening into a you-know-what grin. Yeah, baby, yeah! Wanna... shag?Goldmember's a lot of fun. Oh, don't worry, it's not a thinking man's movie. It's gross and disgusting - farts and eating your own skin play into the plot. The jokes can be a little on the ribald side, but there's nothing much you should warn your kids about. For the most part, if your kids loved the first two Austin Powers films, then this one's fine for them to see.Now, the cast. Myers is excellent as always in his multiple roles - in fact, I think there was more of him on the screen this time around than in the past, but that might have just been my own perception. Knowles, who's basically a novice when it comes to acting (she sings with the group Destiny's Child), is very appealing - spot on, as the Brits would say. "My name is Foxy Cleopatra, and I'm a whole LOTTA woman!" she tells Austin when they meet. Foxy's decked out in a big golden Afro wig and platform shoes - boy, who misses the fashion of the 70s, huh? - and peppers her speech with a lot of period slang.Only on celluloid could a guy with bad posture, terrible teeth, no dancing ability to speak of, a somewhat annoying bray, and a crooked haircut get all the hot women. I mean, look at this guy! In the first film, he got Elizabeth Hurley; in the second, it was Heather Graham. And now it's Beyonce Knowles! Who's next? Madonna?There were a couple of slow spots, but not very many. This one was a lot of fun, highly enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first in the Austin Powers series was amazing. Simply amazing. It is because the first movie was so good that i have reservations about calling Goldmember the best. The second movie was awful. The reason for that was because the second movie focused on austin being a 60's british spy in 2000 north america (and then back in the 60's again) - the whole fish out of water angle had been done in the first movie and it was time to move on. They even killed mustafa again in that one, for the love of pete....In any event, when there were repeated gags in Goldmember, it was acknowledged. for instance, scott saying "Oh, this is the part where i... yadda yadda yadda". That said, contrary to popular belief there wasn't much repetition of jokes, nor was there as much overkill. I thought that Goldmember was remarkably well-done, very funny and i can say that while the jury's out on whether or not it's better than #1, it's infinitely better than #2 and has restored my faith in the series.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is one of the few sequels, that lives up to its previous movies. It's funnier, it's bigger, it has more of everything that made the first two movies the same. The jokes are very funny the first time you watch the movie. After a while, they may get old. The movie is a spoof on many other movies, and it doesn't hold back one bit. It's gross at times, but that's what makes it so funny (in a very uncomfortable way). There are some very HUGE cameos in this movie by some very big stars that I won't give away, you have to see them for yourself, you will be surprised. Score 8 of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Austin is Back Baby Yeah!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the third installment of the Austin Powers Spy series. Personally, I thought it was the funniest of the three movies. It not only spoofs the Blaxploitation films of the 70's but Harry Potter and other up to date movies. It has a large ensemble of cameos most notably was Danny Devito as Mini me and Nathan Lane. The movie is not just a comedy but also a musical, where we see Dr. Evil and Mini-me do a rendition of Hard Knock Life (Jay-Z) it is one of the funniest scenes in the movie. Beyonce Knowles does a suprisingly good in her acting debut. And Mike Myers, Michael Caine are good in it. I would see it again. Very Funny movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny but disjointed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is in many ways routine - well-made, with a good joke/time ratio, lots of the required silliness, and even a few moments of inspiration. Some new contributions to the series work better than others (Nigel Powers: good, Goldmember: bad), but by going through such a checklist one by one I make the same mistake the writers made: not thinking about the picture as a whole.As a whole, the film is too disjointed. There are good little tidbits here and there, mostly at the required hilarity level, but the joints squeak and squeal. That is particularly noticeable towards the beginning when we get a few musical numbers too many. Apart from this Burlesque-inspired combination of music and comedy, the disjointness can be blamed on several underdevelopments of plot and characters. The time travel to 1975 was confined to a few references of 1970s culture, the Goldmember character is largely side-lined, and Mini-me's defection deserved more attention.In the end, it's the Blazing Saddles school of comedy, not the more coherent approach of Support Your Local Sheriff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much better than the second, as good or better than the first</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a riot. I've enjoyed all of the movies so far, but the second to a much lesser degree. I had mediocre expectations going into Goldmember, and laughed hysterically through the whole thing.There are very few recycled jokes (and they even admit to recycling one of them during the movie, which itself is funny when you see it), and one that (I think) was done better than in The Spy Who Shagged Me. The new humor is great, I love all the Dutch jokes! Anyways, as a movie, this plot makes more sense than Spy, and the characters actually have more to do. Austin, again, isn't the funniest character in the movie. Dr. Evil, Scott, and Mini Me steal the show, with Goldmember runnerup. If you've watched the first two and always wanted Scott to actually DO something, or Mini Me to be an essential character, this is the movie for you. The fight between Fat Bastard and Austin in the Japanese...bath chamber?...is a classic.The Pitfalls: The beginning seems a little forced to me, Spy still has the greatest opening credits, though Goldmember's is still enjoyable.The ending is slightly anti-climactic, but then again, only slightly. I expected Scott to take matters into his own hands at the end, but then he just runs off. And Goldmembers' defeat is pretty quick. But still it's enjoyable.Mixed Feelings: Foxy Cleopatra. Very spunky performance, but she doesn't really do anything. I mean, she's technically "there", but her role is less than the the other two women in the previous movies.Greatest Moments: Dr. Evil's reaction to "the Mole" every time.Mini Me vs. Austin Powers rematch.Definately one of the funniest movies I've ever seen.</fullReview>

The high class of Austin eating Fat Bastard's feces in "The Spy Who Shagged Me"? Get a life, people. It's meant to be gross, silly, funny. The operative word is FUNNY. I hope like hell Mike Meyers makes a fourth installment. I know I'll be there the day it opens. It'll still be better than most anything else that's out there (which "Goldmember" certainly is).

		<fullReview>I loved International Man of Mystery. The Spy Who Shagged Me was OK but not as original. Goldmember is a sorry excuse of a sequel. As is pointed out, the gags seem to be recycled but placed in a different order. Goldmember is a very poor and underdeveloped character. He is a two joke character that is not enough to base a movie on. Michael Caine is.... Michael Caine (pass the cheque and I'll show up). The best part is the opening sequence and a scene set in a Japanese mogul's office. Even my sister, who is a great Austin fan, was not impressed with this. Definitely a spoof to far.</fullReview>

I wanted to like it - I tried hard to like it. But when Ozzy Osborne saying "boobs" is one of the funniest bits in a film, something's missing.This does not even get into the technical film-making, which looked rather low budget, or the editing, which was sloppy.

		<shortDescription>Uneven But Often Hilarious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A trippy, almost surreal vision from Mike Myers that is generally engaging but occasionally misfires. The plot involves another ransom demand from Dr. Evil, who threatens to use a "tractor beam" to pull a large meteor toward Earth. The opening sequence, with several superstar cameos, is amusing and wonderful. The rest of the movie is a series of rapid-fire gags; many of them are of the self-parody variety. Goldmember doesn't have much witty dialogue, but his presence is intended to be an absurd homage, (complete with sick personal habits) to the gold-obsessed Auric Goldfinger character. Similarly, Beyonce Knowles as Foxxy Cleopatra is here primarily to emulate Pam Grier's persona from her sassy "blaxpoitation" movies in the 70's. I found these homages to be clever and well done. Beyonce is very sexy and delivered her lines very competently for a 20 year old with no acting experience. One of the failures of the movie is Foxxy does not become a romantic interest during the movie, as Vanessa and Felicity did in the earlier 2 movies. That would have given the movie more soul. The gags are mostly funny, however. The rap by Doctor Evil in prison is terrific. Seth Green's new gambit for his father's love and respect becomes hilarious and he ends the movie on a petulant, defiant note. Mini-Me's "conversion" is also hilarious, especially his new duds as a Powers' convert. However, the fight between Mini-Me and a misconstruing Powers does drag on too long. I'm one of the few who thinks Fat Bastard is funny and I thought he was more funny here than in the last movie. Michael Caine was drolly amusing as Austin's father. I loved Nathan Lane's cameo as a Foxxy liasion. The least amusing scene was Austin's (over)reaction to the "Mole" character. However, the Mole's scene with Dr. Evil was genuinely funny. All in all, this is a fun movie to watch. I recommend it, especially if you can see it with other fans of Myers' absurdist humor. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, this is what free movie tickets are made for. The first Austin Powers was hilarious. A gem of a movie from that year. The second Austin Powers was more disgusting than it was funny. For the third one they took out the most sickening humor from the second one, but then forgot to add the jokes!There are, really, perhaps 3 funny scenes (and those are recycled from the first two movies, only in much shorter form) in the entire movie... Then you have the other hour... Boring, un-funny, I mean didn't they have a clue when Mini-Me kept falling asleep during the exposition in the beginning?You have Fred Savage as the Mole, a hilarious character that feels like it's building to go somewhere but never quite arrives. You have the cameos from Tom Cruise, Steven Spielberg and John Travolta that are more distracting than they are funny.Really the only new and funny thing in the entire movie is the transition of Scott Evil from bored teen rebel to twisted Evil Genius.Give this one a pass, don't even rent it.

		<fullReview>It may be safe to say that any of the Mike Myers' Austin Powers films are sure to make you laugh, as all of them have for me. Maybe that is why we all rushed out to see the third installment, Austin Powers in Goldmember, out of commitment and curiosity. However, a part of me says you can still watch the first two and get the same banter you will from the third one. Don't get me wrong, there is plenty original material in Goldmember, some really funny jokes and the ever popular Dr.Evil - MiniMe Duet, but the series grows tired, and even dry. I already knew Austin Powers can dance to make girls heads explode, I knew Dr. Evil likes to ask for obnoxious sums of money, and I knew Fat Bastard is slightly uncouth. These things are repeated, not subliminally, but instead there to smack you in the face. Ok fine, touch base with the preceding films. Now on to good stuff, the new stuff. There were some scenes alone that definitely made this film worth seeing, and worth laughing. One being the urine sample scene, conspicuously as silhouettes on a curtain, and the subtitles scene. New additions such as the gaseous Evil Submarine and the energetic Beyonce Knowles refresh the film, reminding the audience of Myers' creativeness. If you're a Powers fan, you've already seen the movie, if you're teetering on the edge, make sure you haven't seen the first two movies in a while.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Austin Powers in Goldmember is really stupid, but man, is it hilarious!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To begin with, I am a BIG Austin Powers fan: when I saw International Man of Mystery on video, I laughed myself silly. When I watched The Spy Who Shagged me in theaters, I fell on the floor laughing. And when I viewed Goldmember last week, I'm pretty sure I cracked up so loud that I cried! There is no arguing that all three AP movies are incredibly stupid. The first two had a few clever spin-offs of James Bond, but by the third time around, any sign of intelligence in the franchise has completely dissipated. So what? I GUARANTEE you that if and when you watch Goldmember, you will laugh harder than you ever have in your entire life. The "premise" of AP3 -- if there is any -- is as follows: Dr. Evil (who delivers even MORE laughs than the previous two combined) ~*~ POSSIBLE SPOILERS ~*~ has tried Preparations A-G to suck a solid gold meteor to Earth and melt the polar ice caps. Since all of these attempts have failed, he is now resorting to -- prepare yourself -- Preparation H (deep, menacing music playing)! By this point in the film, my sides were already beginning to split. Verne Troyer is hilarious (and I mean, HILARIOUS) as Mini-me AND Mini-Austin, and Seth Green has some surprising tricks up his sleeve as Dr. Evil's rebellious son, Scott. Also, Michael Caine makes a wonderful addition to the cast as Austin Powers' GROOVY dad who is kidnapped for some odd reason that I can't remember. Beyoncee Knowles is so-so as the roller-disco dancer, Foxxy Cleopatra (I still think she should forget acting and stick to singing), but the audience is left wondering what in the world happened to Felicity Shagwell? However, plot holes are of no importance and are easily forgotten while you are watching the movie. Oh, and remember in the first one how Dr. Evil said his mom was a prostitute named Chloe with webbed feet, and his father often complained that chestnuts were lazy? These issues are -- at last -- fully explained, and the final truth about Dr. Evil's genealogy is bound to shock you! By the way, have I mentioned the title character yet? Mike Myers plays yet ANOTHER character in AP3 (the tally is now four), an evil genius with a peculiar accent and a fancy for eating pieces of dried skin named Goldmember. All these aspects are utterly hilarious, but there is ONE flaw with Austin Powers that has been present in all three so far: the unfunny and utterly moronic sexual innuendo. Why does Jay Roach continue to spoil his drop-dead funny movies by including sex jokes that don't even deliver a giggle? Oh, well: you can't have everything! All in all, Austin Powers in Goldmember is one hilarious romp that will have you laughing from start to finish.Overall rating: 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was so good and hilarious. The story is about Dr. Evil who forms a plan to attract a meteorite to destroy and cause a flash flood and teams up with goldmember. Beyonce Knowles was great as Foxy Cleopatra no one could've done a better job. Britney Spears makes a quick cameo at the beginning as Austin Powers and his dancers go against Britney Spears and her male dancers on her recent song "Boys". Although it was a quick one it still was amazingly good. Tom Cruise and Gweneth Paltrow make their way in the beginning of the movie as well as Danny Devito and Kevin Spacey. The Osbournes made a quickening but funny appearance as well. Their are so many actors in that join on in this 3rd installment of the Austin Powers series you got to check it out and see for yourself I would give it 10 stars!</fullReview>

Can't say I liked the ending - but then again, after seeing the same jokes from I and II being rehashed, the ending was the only thing different from the others. I would have liked to know what happened to Felicity Shagwell. Mini-me, again, stole the show and another great performance from Seth Green, who unfortunately wasn't used more. As for some people bashing Beyonce Knowles' acting - yes, it wasn't great, but it's an Austin Powers movie - give her a break...it was better than sitting through Britney's Crossroads (which I unfortunately did). The character of Goldmember wasn't that funny, except for his taste in "snacks." Wait until video/DVD to rent it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This ain't "The Godfather," folks. Don't go expecting a labyrinthine plot, Oscar-cailber acting or a rousing John Williams-esque score. Go, and expect to laugh, and you won't be disappointed.Yes, there are a LOT of gags from the first two Austin Powers films recycled here. Some work, some have become stale. And yes, there is a greater quotient of toilet humor here than in the first two. Again, it's a hit-and-miss affair. But I laughed more in the first 10 minutes of "Goldmember" than I did in all of "Men in Black II." In the end it's Myers' comedic ability that makes this third entry in the series fly.No, there haven't been very many good comedies this summer. In fact, they've all been pretty much awful, so to say this is the funniest movie of the summer season would hardly be a compliment. I'll just be content to say it's damn funny.

		<shortDescription>No, Baby, No!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me just start by saying I love Mike Myers. I think he is a comedic genius, and he is truly one of my favorite comedians. I have been extremely pleased with most all the characters he has portrayed in films, including all of the goofs in the Austin Powers series (Austin Powers, Dr. Evil, Fat Bastard). Much like Eddie Murphy creating completely different and unique characters in Coming to America (which you can barely tell are all him), Mike has the same talent in that regard.Because I liked `AP: Int'l Man of Mystery' and `AP: The Spy Who Shagged Me' so much, I was looking forward with great anticipation to this, the third installment; `AP in Goldmember', and was curious to see what this new incarnation of Myers, Goldmember, would be like.Sadly, I was quite disappointed.The beginning sequence of the film is very funny, I will give you that. The cameos were unexpected, and were carefully chosen, which made the whole idea that much funnier. There were a few industry jokes that I thought were funny, but people from Iowa probably wouldn't have understood them (kind of a benefit of living in the entertainment capital of the world, I guess). And there were definitely moments that made me laugh out loud. There's no doubt that Austin still cracks me up, sometimes even without saying a word.However, that said, I was disappointed with the fact that SO much of this film was rehashed and put back together to represent new comedy. Many of the same old gags were used, but tweaked slightly, perhaps in an attempt to not seem quite so unoriginal &lt;TINY JOKE SPOILERS AHEAD&gt; (i.e. the whole `Johnson' gag, the ramblings between Dr. Evil and Scott, etc.) Goldmember as a character was really nothing fabulous; he didn't seem to have the distinct idiosyncrasies that would make him stand out, like Myers's other characters. His attempted Dutch accent didn't seem that convincing (although the clog-style roller skates were amusing), and his skin-eating tendencies just flat out grossed me out (much like several other aspects of this film, but I should have expected that). Caine's character was dull, and it was a little bizarre to see Fred Savage all grown up (those mole jokes really got old quickly). I would have liked to have seen Beyonce Knowles's character showcased more, as she seemed to breathe a good portion of what newness this film had into it. I did kind of miss Mustafa, and had been expecting to see him show up, just to get killed again, a-la Kenny from South Park, but no such luck. There were so many other predictable jokes and scenarios (I saw the `Mr. Roboto' joke comin' a mile away) in the film, I figured it would have fit right in.O.K., and maybe I'm just getting nitpicky, but I have to say it. The shocking blue contact lenses on both Dr. Evil and Mini-Me were distracting as hell. Did anyone else ever notice in "The Spy Who Shagged Me", Dr. Evil's eyes went from blue to brown and back again? Did they think we wouldn't notice? At least they kept it consistent this time. and they decided to slap a pair on Vern as well so they'd be perfectly matched. I can see why, but again, I found them to be extremely distracting and almost freakish to behold. (BTW, Vern is much cuter as mini-Austin, IMO.)All in all, `Austin Powers in Goldmember' was mildly entertaining, despite the recycled gags and ultra gross visual humor it churned out. For me, it left something to be desired, but for the third movie in a series, it held its own, and will undoubtedly continue to rake in the profits based on the name alone. When it's all said and done, I may have left the theater feeling disappointed, and muttering to my friend, `That was really lame,' but sheepishly, I admit, if a 4th one comes out, I'm sure I'll go see it. My recommendation to you though, is: save your money. It's a rental.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie ROCKS!!!! From the opening (which was clever), to the unveiling of the "secret" at the end, this movie brings down the house with its unique brand of comedy. The audience was laughing throughout!!! (I almost squirted my soda out of my nose at the Preperation H joke!)Mike Myers takes on quadruple duty in this one, playing Austin, Dr. Evil, Goldmember, and Fat Bastard (whose presence in this movie wasn't THAT important). To my knowledge, only Eddie Murphy has played more roles in a comedy portraying the entire Klump family. Anyway, Myers is AMAZING to say the least. He does a fantastic job playing the good guys, the bad guys, and even the fat guys.Beyonce Knowls did an Ok job as Foxy Cleopatra, but her chareacter didn't get as much screen time as I thought she would. Oh well, she still had her moments.Verne Troyer returns as Mini-me in this film, and Mini-me is still well... Mini-me. Intresting to note that Troyer does all of his own stunts. I would never do half the things he did in this movie, and I'm 6'1"!!!Of course, all of the other henchmen for Dr. Evil returns as well. Unfortunatly for Robert Wagner (Number 2) and Mindy Sterling (Frau Farbissina) they get less exposure than in previous installments. (I think that would be a good thing for Sterling. All that yelling...)Seth Green also returns as Scott Evil. I like Scott because he says what's on my mind whenever I hear a bad Dr. Evil joke. (Remember Operation Wang Chung from the second movie? Classic).As for celebrities, watch for cameos from Brittney Spears, Quincy Jones, Tom Cruise, Danny Devito, Steven Speilburg, John Travolta, and the Osbournes among others. Man, last time I saw so many stars, I was looking through a telescope!!!Also funny in this movie is the recuring jokes, one of which is in this review. All in all, Goldmember is the best Austin Powers movie yet. I'm only imagining what they will do for the sequel (although with all the sudden twists in the movie, it will be hard to figure out what the heck they will do next).Oh and one more thing, WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO FELICITY SHAGWELL?!?!?!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I imagine Mike Myers sitting down to write this movie and saying to himself, "I don't care what lines it crosses, if it is funny, it is going to be in this movie".The first 10 minutes of the movie were worth the admission price alone. I almost fell out of my seat laughing. The rest of the movie didn't disappoint either. Sure, the movie has childish humor in it. Sure, the movie stops at nothing to ignite a laugh. But, having said that, I am sure you weren't expecting a Frank Darabont masterpiece here. Myers has positioned himself as the comedy master in Hollywood, and he and Jay Roach pull it off to a "T".The movie was so funny that I found myself laughing less and less as I became more and more desensitized to the humor. This movie would have been 10 times funnier if they had given a 15 minute intermission in the middle to reset my funny bone.Overall, very, very funny movie with enough jokes and humor to make it funny the 10th viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So we've come to #3 in the series.Sure, some of the jokes were a bit old -- e.g. Dr. and Scott Evil's trademark exchange around the big table, Fat Bastard's monologue -- but I still found them riotously funny. The opening sequence needs to be seen to be appreciated, and the new character, Goldmember, isn't quite as unpalatable as some people here have made him out to be.(Funny, people never complain about James Bond being "old" or "tired" or "worn-out.")Keep an eye out for all the Toronto/Canada references, eh? (Look for Mini-Me's Leafs jersey, and the Headline News-esque proclamations, to name two.)All in all, I liked Goldmember, and thought it was pretty funny -- not the funniest movie I've ever seen, but still quite good nonetheless. Worth your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad for a third version...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are a lot of people that are complaining about this movie. First of all, yes, this movie has some potty humor, but all of the films had it (But this has the most, by far..) but this BY FAR has the best Austin Powers opening and anyone that would give it away is pure evil, baby! Besides, what do people want from an Austin Powers movie? A LIFE CHANGING EVENT? If your expecting CITIZEN CANE or THE GODFATHER, I think you shouldn't even buy your ticket.. Anyways...I liked a lot about this movie. I thought Foxxy Cleopatra was a great character and Beyonce did a great job for her first film. Michael Caine was great as Austin's Dad and just like the 2nd version, Verne Troyer stole the show. Its kind of sad in a way that they seem to be making fun of him, but keep in mind- The guy is the one whos laughing, with endorsements and stuff- he's a millionaire by now..Dr. Evil is great as usual, and I liked the new character of "Goldmember", who yes is very gross, but not half as bad as "Fat Bastard", who was so not funny in this movie.. Note to creators: If you're going to make a fourth version, feel free to write out this character- Unlike Dr. Evil and Austin- he's getting old, and has only been around for 2 versions..Anyways, I don't have that many complaints except I would have wished they would have explained what happened to Felicity Shagwell and I really would have wished "Mustaffa" would have made yet another comeback.With the great writing, I think they could make another version. Austin could go in the 80's and the new "Austin Girl" could be Britney Spears.. Just a thought..Thanks</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Myers won me over with his "Goldmember"...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought Mike Myers couldn't possibly top his first two movies in the Austin Powers trilogy, but I stand most definitely corrected. I feared I would hyperventilate from laughter during the first 15 minutes of the film, which I won't spoil for you here but was well worth the price of admission on its own! Here's the setup:Austin must rescue his kidnapped absentee father played by the perfectly cast Michael Caine from the clutches of Dr. Evil, who has recruited across time a 70s mastermind criminal by the name of Goldmember to assist him in achieving world domination. Fans of the Bond movies will recognize this obvious salute to Ian Fleming's infamous and dangerous "Goldfinger". However, Myers' auric mastermind received his moniker after "an unfortunate smelting accident". I'll just let your imagination complete this picture for you...The ever-talented Mike Myers adds Goldmember to his line-up of characters in this newest Austin Powers feature. Laden with freckles and spouting unintelligible English with a Dutch accent, he plots to take over the world alongside Dr. Evil. Along with this villainous duo and Austin himself, we are treated to a reprise of Myers' hideously revolting Fat Bastard.Also reprising their roles, are our favorite characters: Mini-Me, Number Two, Scott Evil, and Frau Farbissina. There are many wonderful surprises and plot twists that I will not spoil for you here, but you are truly in for a treat!Austin's love interest this time around, is a Pam Grier tongue-in-cheek knockoff by the name of Foxxy Cleopatra and played with surprising spunk by Destiny Child's Beyoncé Knowles. Looking like she just stepped off a runway modeling 70s chic couture, Ms. Knowles kicks ass along side Austin as she travels back into the future with him by way of a tricked out fur-lined and very purple pimpmobile.There are cameos galore that I also don't want to spoil for you here. This film is a laugh riot with plenty of gags and twists to keep you interested in the storyline. If you are a fan of the other Powers flicks, then you will most certainly be pleased by this latest addition. I give it two snaps up in a "Z" formation, baybee!Amy</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's not bad, but not great either. There are some good laughs, a couple of REALLY good laughs and a lot of re-hashed jokes from the first two movies.There's a lot more scatological humor in this one, gross-out gags and the like. The plot is the weakest in the series...in fact it seems that the plot is only used as a tool to introduce (and re-introduce) jokes. There's never a real sense that the evil plot is really playing out, and the climax and conclusion are downright silly.As much as I enjoyed the first two movies, I was more than a bit let down by Goldmember.

Only watch the first Austin Powers, and then you'll realize why there were two horrible sequels. Money. How could such a great movie turn into such a crummy franchise? The jokes from part 2 sucked, so why use them again? Forget it. Some funny moments, not "hilarious, laugh out loud" stuff like people are saying. Don't waste your money, unless you think Foxxy is sexy, like I do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me just start by saying I love Mike Myers. I think he is a comedic genius, and he is truly one of my favorite comedians. I have been extremely pleased with most all the characters he has portrayed in films, including all of the goofs in the Austin Powers series (Austin Powers, Dr. Evil, Fat Bastard). Much like Eddie Murphy creating completely different and unique characters in Coming to America (which you can barely tell are all him), Mike has the same talent in that regard.Because I liked `AP: Int'l Man of Mystery' and `AP: The Spy Who Shagged Me' so much, I was looking forward with great anticipation to this, the third installment; `AP in Goldmember', and was curious to see what this new incarnation of Myers, Goldmember, would be like.Sadly, I was quite disappointed.The beginning sequence of the film is very funny, I will give you that. The cameos were unexpected, and were carefully chosen, which made the whole idea that much funnier. There were a few industry jokes that I thought were funny, but people from Iowa probably wouldn't have understood them (kind of a benefit of living in the entertainment capital of the world, I guess). And there were definitely moments that made me laugh out loud. There's no doubt that Austin still cracks me up, sometimes even without saying a word.However, that said, I was disappointed with the fact that SO much of this film was rehashed and put back together to represent new comedy. Many of the same old gags were used, but tweaked slightly, perhaps in an attempt to not seem quite so unoriginal &lt;TINY JOKE SPOILERS AHEAD&gt; (i.e. the whole `Johnson' gag, the ramblings between Dr. Evil and Scott, etc.) Goldmember as a character was really nothing fabulous; he didn't seem to have the distinct idiosyncrasies that would make him stand out, like Myers's other characters. His attempted Dutch accent didn't seem that convincing (although the clog-style roller skates were amusing), and his skin-eating tendencies just flat out grossed me out (much like several other aspects of this film, but I should have expected that). Caine's character was dull, and it was a little bizarre to see Fred Savage all grown up (those mole jokes really got old quickly). I would have liked to have seen Beyonce Knowles's character showcased more, as she seemed to breathe a good portion of what newness this film had into it. I did kind of miss Mustafa, and had been expecting to see him show up, just to get killed again, a-la Kenny from South Park, but no such luck. There were so many other predictable jokes and scenarios (I saw the `Mr. Roboto' joke comin' a mile away) in the film, I figured it would have fit right in.O.K., and maybe I'm just getting nitpicky, but I have to say it. The shocking blue contact lenses on both Dr. Evil and Mini-Me were distracting as hell. Did anyone else ever notice in "The Spy Who Shagged Me", Dr. Evil's eyes went from blue to brown and back again? Did they think we wouldn't notice? At least they kept it consistent this time. and they decided to slap a pair on Vern as well so they'd be perfectly matched. I can see why, but again, I found them to be extremely distracting and almost freakish to behold. (BTW, Vern is much cuter as mini-Austin, IMO.)All in all, `Austin Powers in Goldmember' was mildly entertaining, despite the recycled gags and ultra gross visual humor it churned out. For me, it left something to be desired, but for the third movie in a series, it held its own, and will undoubtedly continue to rake in the profits based on the name alone. When it's all said and done, I may have left the theater feeling disappointed, and muttering to my friend, `That was really lame,' but sheepishly, I admit, if a 4th one comes out, I'm sure I'll go see it. My recommendation to you though, is: save your money. It's a rental.</fullReview>

(I almost squirted my soda out of my nose at the Preperation H joke!)Mike Myers takes on quadruple duty in this one, playing Austin, Dr. Evil, Goldmember, and Fat Bastard (whose presence in this movie wasn't THAT important). To my knowledge, only Eddie Murphy has played more roles in a comedy portraying the entire Klump family. Anyway, Myers is AMAZING to say the least. He does a fantastic job playing the good guys, the bad guys, and even the fat guys.Beyonce Knowls did an Ok job as Foxy Cleopatra, but her chareacter didn't get as much screen time as I thought she would. Oh well, she still had her moments.Verne Troyer returns as Mini-me in this film, and Mini-me is still well... Mini-me. Intresting to note that Troyer does all of his own stunts. I would never do half the things he did in this movie, and I'm 6'1"!!!Of course, all of the other henchmen for Dr. Evil returns as well. Unfortunatly for Robert Wagner (Number 2) and Mindy Sterling (Frau Farbissina) they get less exposure than in previous installments. (I think that would be a good thing for Sterling. All that yelling...)Seth Green also returns as Scott Evil. I like Scott because he says what's on my mind whenever I hear a bad Dr. Evil joke. (Remember Operation Wang Chung from the second movie? Classic).As for celebrities, watch for cameos from Brittney Spears, Quincy Jones, Tom Cruise, Danny Devito, Steven Speilburg, John Travolta, and the Osbournes among others. Man, last time I saw so many stars, I was looking through a telescope!!!Also funny in this movie is the recuring jokes, one of which is in this review. All in all, Goldmember is the best Austin Powers movie yet. I'm only imagining what they will do for the sequel (although with all the sudden twists in the movie, it will be hard to figure out what the heck they will do next).Oh and one more thing, WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO FELICITY SHAGWELL?!?!?!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I imagine Mike Myers sitting down to write this movie and saying to himself, "I don't care what lines it crosses, if it is funny, it is going to be in this movie".The first 10 minutes of the movie were worth the admission price alone. I almost fell out of my seat laughing. The rest of the movie didn't disappoint either. Sure, the movie has childish humor in it. Sure, the movie stops at nothing to ignite a laugh. But, having said that, I am sure you weren't expecting a Frank Darabont masterpiece here. Myers has positioned himself as the comedy master in Hollywood, and he and Jay Roach pull it off to a "T".The movie was so funny that I found myself laughing less and less as I became more and more desensitized to the humor. This movie would have been 10 times funnier if they had given a 15 minute intermission in the middle to reset my funny bone.Overall, very, very funny movie with enough jokes and humor to make it funny the 10th viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So we've come to #3 in the series.Sure, some of the jokes were a bit old -- e.g. Dr. and Scott Evil's trademark exchange around the big table, Fat Bastard's monologue -- but I still found them riotously funny. The opening sequence needs to be seen to be appreciated, and the new character, Goldmember, isn't quite as unpalatable as some people here have made him out to be.(Funny, people never complain about James Bond being "old" or "tired" or "worn-out.")Keep an eye out for all the Toronto/Canada references, eh? (Look for Mini-Me's Leafs jersey, and the Headline News-esque proclamations, to name two.)All in all, I liked Goldmember, and thought it was pretty funny -- not the funniest movie I've ever seen, but still quite good nonetheless. Worth your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad for a third version...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are a lot of people that are complaining about this movie. First of all, yes, this movie has some potty humor, but all of the films had it (But this has the most, by far..) but this BY FAR has the best Austin Powers opening and anyone that would give it away is pure evil, baby! Besides, what do people want from an Austin Powers movie? A LIFE CHANGING EVENT? If your expecting CITIZEN CANE or THE GODFATHER, I think you shouldn't even buy your ticket.. Anyways...I liked a lot about this movie. I thought Foxxy Cleopatra was a great character and Beyonce did a great job for her first film. Michael Caine was great as Austin's Dad and just like the 2nd version, Verne Troyer stole the show. Its kind of sad in a way that they seem to be making fun of him, but keep in mind- The guy is the one whos laughing, with endorsements and stuff- he's a millionaire by now..Dr. Evil is great as usual, and I liked the new character of "Goldmember", who yes is very gross, but not half as bad as "Fat Bastard", who was so not funny in this movie.. Note to creators: If you're going to make a fourth version, feel free to write out this character- Unlike Dr. Evil and Austin- he's getting old, and has only been around for 2 versions..Anyways, I don't have that many complaints except I would have wished they would have explained what happened to Felicity Shagwell and I really would have wished "Mustaffa" would have made yet another comeback.With the great writing, I think they could make another version. Austin could go in the 80's and the new "Austin Girl" could be Britney Spears.. Just a thought..Thanks</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Myers won me over with his "Goldmember"...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought Mike Myers couldn't possibly top his first two movies in the Austin Powers trilogy, but I stand most definitely corrected. I feared I would hyperventilate from laughter during the first 15 minutes of the film, which I won't spoil for you here but was well worth the price of admission on its own! Here's the setup:Austin must rescue his kidnapped absentee father played by the perfectly cast Michael Caine from the clutches of Dr. Evil, who has recruited across time a 70s mastermind criminal by the name of Goldmember to assist him in achieving world domination. Fans of the Bond movies will recognize this obvious salute to Ian Fleming's infamous and dangerous "Goldfinger". However, Myers' auric mastermind received his moniker after "an unfortunate smelting accident". I'll just let your imagination complete this picture for you...The ever-talented Mike Myers adds Goldmember to his line-up of characters in this newest Austin Powers feature. Laden with freckles and spouting unintelligible English with a Dutch accent, he plots to take over the world alongside Dr. Evil. Along with this villainous duo and Austin himself, we are treated to a reprise of Myers' hideously revolting Fat Bastard.Also reprising their roles, are our favorite characters: Mini-Me, Number Two, Scott Evil, and Frau Farbissina. There are many wonderful surprises and plot twists that I will not spoil for you here, but you are truly in for a treat!Austin's love interest this time around, is a Pam Grier tongue-in-cheek knockoff by the name of Foxxy Cleopatra and played with surprising spunk by Destiny Child's Beyoncé Knowles. Looking like she just stepped off a runway modeling 70s chic couture, Ms. Knowles kicks ass along side Austin as she travels back into the future with him by way of a tricked out fur-lined and very purple pimpmobile.There are cameos galore that I also don't want to spoil for you here. This film is a laugh riot with plenty of gags and twists to keep you interested in the storyline. If you are a fan of the other Powers flicks, then you will most certainly be pleased by this latest addition. I give it two snaps up in a "Z" formation, baybee!Amy</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's not bad, but not great either. There are some good laughs, a couple of REALLY good laughs and a lot of re-hashed jokes from the first two movies.There's a lot more scatological humor in this one, gross-out gags and the like. The plot is the weakest in the series...in fact it seems that the plot is only used as a tool to introduce (and re-introduce) jokes. There's never a real sense that the evil plot is really playing out, and the climax and conclusion are downright silly.As much as I enjoyed the first two movies, I was more than a bit let down by Goldmember. It's got its moments, but overall it shows us that this franchise has reached the end of it's life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Golden Capstone of the Austin Powers Pyramid.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Austin Powers series saves its best for last. The series can be likened to a three-piece pyramid: The first film as a foundation, the second as fill material, and the third as the golden capstone. This is the funniest and most in-depth Austin Powers movie of them all.The film opens with some hilarious cameos. I won't say who. This mole- uh, movie does many of the same point-of-view and silhouette gags, but they're still funny- Funnier than the last one! It doesn't take a genius to come up with toilet humor, but it certainly does take a genius to come up with the hilarious ways of executing it as seen in the film. The scene with the classical urinating fountain brought the house down, as did the later scene involving Mini-Me, a large dress, and some apple juice.moleI must give credit to the production designers for the hilarious exterior appearance of Dr. Evil's submarine.Mike Myers introduces a FOURTH character to his auto-cast (a term I invented to describe mole..tiple characters played by one actor). He's a physically gifted but mentally challenged Dutch metallurgist who goes by the name Goldmember, as he lost his you-know-what in an "unfortunate smelting accident", moling---making him crazy. His calling card is spray-painting other people's peckers gold.He likes gooooooooolllld!Michael Caine plays Austin's distant, self-minded father, and is very convincing as such. He wasn't there when Austin graduated International Mole of Mystery School. Wait, I meant "MAN" of Mystery. There's a hilarious gag with un-shadowed white subtitles that you have to see to believe.Moley Moley Moley Moley MOLE!!!!The revelations keep on coming until the ultimate ending twist- one you would never expect. It ends rather like the last episode of a television series. It's awesome, baby, yeah! Go see this movie and laugh your head off. You'll never look at the other two Austin Powers movies the same way again.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yeah Baby, the critics are wrong again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this movie expecting to find it lacking in some way. From what I had heard through the grap vine, which is the critics bylines, the funniest parts of the movie happened in the first few moments of the film and after that it became, to quote Austin himself, "ouch baby, very ouch." I heard that Austin was in it too much, that the new character of Goldmember was curiously unfunny, and that the movie was comprised of mostly re-hashed old jokes. But now, having seen the movie, I realize what the critics, in their own eloquent manner, were trying to tell all of us would- be Austin viewers; that they are MORONS!!!! First, anyone remember a critic who LOVED the first or second Powers movies? Anyone? Please, I can't hear you so you might have to stand up. No one? Well, can't say that I do either, so does it come as any truly cosmic suprise that the critics again are decidedly cool to down right deep frozen towards the newest installment? It reminds me of earlier this year when critic after critic talked of the ol Star Wars movies as prized American treasures and spoke of how the new movies were but dim shadows of the old brilliance of the early films. Yet, go back and read the reviews of the old Star Wars movies. Glowing would not be the first word to stream across your mind. The same thing with Austin. The majority of critics complaining that Powers has lost his mojo are the same fellas and fellets that couldn't see the mojo in the first place. So what I need to do now, for all of you fellow Austin lovers who have been scared to heavens by the reviews is, as Dr. Evil says, to "throw you a freakin bone here." Goldmember is great, and not just the character. The cameos are funny, but the brilliance of the film comes from the addition of the new character, Goldmember, and the expansion of mini-me role in the film. It is quite clear to me, having listened to the audience reaction, that these movies have become much more about Dr. Evil and mini-me then anyone else, but the interaction that the characters have with one another are fantastic. Are old jokes re-hashed here, absolutely, that has been one of the charms of the other two. But there are plenty of new and innovative gags that had the audience I watched it with on the floor. The musical interludes are riotous, and there are certain scenes that will have you almost falling out of your chair. Is this one as good as the second? In my opinion no, I have never laughed as hard at a movie as I did at the second Austin Powers, but it is, very much up to par with the first and has several scenes that rival the second for those can't stop laughing moments. Micheal Caine is perfect as the suave Nigel Powers, Austins dad, as Caine, while not being given hysterical material to work with, uses what he is given to the best of his talents and ends up giving, in my opinion, some of the more memorable lines in the film. Beyonce Knowles, yet another singer turned actress, does a remarkably good job here, displeeling any rumors that she was giving Heather Graham a run for her money as the worst actress in an Austin to film to date. Knowles is beautiful, strong, sassy, and 1970's ghettos all at the same time and there are no scenes she takes part in where you get that "boy, she just seems lost" sense. Myers, well, Myers is Myers and if ou have not been convinced that his comedy is genius yet, combining slap-stick with gross out with intelligent humor, then you just are not capable of liking this film. Myers is just Myers, and his new character Goldmember is terrific. Finally, however, is mini-me, whose name escapes me right now. Mini-me has perhaps some of the funniest moments of the entire film, and the concept of having him be a mute has been one of the best comic choices to date. Mini-me is funny because he is small, but also because the little guy is just damn funny. The faces, the sounds, the humping, they are all incorporated into this wonderful little character that is truly allowed to take off in this film. The fight between Austin and mini-me is sure to have you gasping for air. The only problem I had with this film was the end, which I felt was a bit forced and not as creative as the other two endings had been, but with Myers creative genius at work, if there is a fifth, I am sure that the problems created at the end are easily fixed. This movie is funny, witty, and just plain enjoyable. If you love Austin Powers then run, don't walk, run to see this movie (I wonder if anyone has actually ever run to see a movie after reading something like that?) and if you want to enjoy yourself, check the critics reviews at the door.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, Austin Powers is back in the shiny 3rd installment as the International Man of Mystery in Goldmember. This film is more highly polished than the previous two, avoiding the sketch-comedy awkwardness (which was in some ways charming) in lieu of high-powered Hollywood cameos, slickly edited musical sequences and even more playful self-effacing. The opening scene is at once so typically blockbuster, and yet so exciting, surprising, and altogether funny that I wouldn't dare give a moment of it away. Without spoiling a thing I will synopse: Austin Powers, Britain's "ultimate gentleman spy", returns in a seemingly unending battle with Dr. Evil, while juggling Fat Bastard and a new hard-case by the name of Goldmember. So enraptured by the precious metal he burns off his own "twig and berries" in what must have been a hot and heavy session with a vat of molten gold. He thus becomes Goldmember, an Au-gmented Dutch madman from 1975 with a golden complexion and wheeled clogs to match. Mike Meyers manages to add this fourth personality with enough uniqueness and humour to make this entire picture as much fun as anyone is bound to have at the movies. Add a great supporting role by the extremely hot and sexily named Byoncé of Destiny's Child (who naturally adds to the soundtrack in a perfect balance of business and creativity) playing the strong-willed blaxploitation backlash Foxy Cleopatra. Also joining this strong cast in what must put his film role numbers in the four digits is Michael Caine, as Austin's father - who is as aesthetically awkward as he is attractive to the ladies. (like father like son) The sexual relationship with the heroine is unfortunately hastily skimmed over - unlike the first two films - this 3rd Powers powerhouse has the characters dealing with their relationships with their fathers, their clones, and even themselves. What begins initially as a Hollywood who's who of cameos, turns into a truly unique and hilarious film, and captures that same sense of freshness the original "Man of Mystery" so confidently employed. Although another sequel may be in the works, one of the most satisfying aspects of this film is that it doesn't blatantly set up a sequel like so many other movies of past summers, allowing us the viewer to sit with what we've seen, happy with the complete picture of this silly secret agent. 4/5 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Goldmember is a perfect accent to the first two films. It revisits old material without driving it into the ground and adds new touches without taking the series in a new direction. Myers is, as usual, above perfection in his performance. Dr. Evil continues to be the best of the characters and provides a hysterical lyrical turn that must be seen to be believed. The film wraps up in a respectable place where it can be equally viable as the last Austin movie or provide a turning point if the series continues. Once again a genius comic spoof that is made even more enjoyable for fans of the James Bond series who catch all the in jokes along the way.</fullReview>

Old style physical comedy was becoming a dying art, with dozens of cheap rip offs of jim carrey routinely passing as a limp substitutes for it. This film is the first in a long time that reminds me of the keystone cops, laurel and hardy or charlie chaplin. The funny is funny and the film lacks pretension or an absorption with plot details that encumber humor. This film is the first to capitalize on all the humor the other two movies gave us glimpses of. Mike Myers is not but may yet become this generation's peter sellers, or charlie chaplin.

		<shortDescription>Yeah, Baby, Ye- Oh, just give me my money already.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In short: God, what a disappointment! Okay, okay, so I'm being a little unfair. First off, I gotta say: do NOT look at the cast list. A lot of the really good jokes in the movie come from unexpected cameos, and knowing about them beforehand will destroy a lot of the humor. The opening has a whole bevy of these surprises, and is easily one of the cleverest scenes in the film. Unfortunately, the freshness and originality wears off quickly. As each of the characters are reintroduced, it just gets more and more uncomfortable. It becomes increasingly clear that no one involved really cares. Mike Myers seems to be strolling on screen, re-enacting each of his catchphrases, and collecting his check. The LEAST they could have done was think of some new jokes, but instead they re-use all the old ones. The shadow gag, the radar bit..it's all here, and we've seen it all before.Another thing: CUT DOWN ON THE BLOODY MUSICAL INTERLUDES! Good god almighty, these things are painful...like much of the movie. Okay, so the "Hard Knock Life" bit is possibly the funniest scene in the film, but that's it. The rest really have got to go. But the biggest strike against the film? It takes the second movie's biggest problem - a reliance on gross-out humor - and multiplies it ten-fold. Fat Bastard's back, but while he was at least intermittently funny last time, here he's just disgusting. And not in a good way...in an excruciating, "Why the hell am I watching this?" kind of way. The titular Goldmember has a fetish for dead skin that's more disturbing than funny. And while sh*t was the bodily function du jour last time, here the filmmakers seem fascinated by farts and urine. Ah, how far we've come in 3 years.I know I must sound like this is a bad movie, but it's really not. Just don't expect anything nearly as good as the first movie, or even the second. There ARE some hilarious scenes, like the aforementioned rap parody, an inspired scene between Austin and his father that plays on British slang, and a play on misread subtitles. But it's the long, laughless stretches that stick in the mind more. But if the humor's not surprising, at least the plot is. By film's end, we have the roles of Dr. Evil, Scott, and Mini-Me completely thrown for a loop in ways that even surprised me (and I can usually predict plot twists a mile away). It makes me curious about how they'd deal with a fourth movie...but considering how quickly the humor well is drying up for Austin, I'm not sure if I could sit through another one to find out.One last thing I forgot to mention: How the HECK are they going to release this movie in the Netherlands? I mean good god, you'd think the movie wanted every last Dutchman on the planet wiped out. I also forgot to mention another high point: Beyonce Knowles should have a great career in the movies. She studied up on her Pam Grier before auditioning, and man does it show...she's straight out of the blaxploitation era. I completely forgot she was anything but an actress, which is quite an achievement. Oh, and her song on the soundtrack, "Work It Out", kicks major old-school booty.Again, it's worth seeing, at least as a matinee. Just don't expect greatness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yeah Baby, the critics are wrong again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this movie expecting to find it lacking in some way. From what I had heard through the grap vine, which is the critics bylines, the funniest parts of the movie happened in the first few moments of the film and after that it became, to quote Austin himself, "ouch baby, very ouch." I heard that Austin was in it too much, that the new character of Goldmember was curiously unfunny, and that the movie was comprised of mostly re-hashed old jokes. But now, having seen the movie, I realize what the critics, in their own eloquent manner, were trying to tell all of us would- be Austin viewers; that they are MORONS!!!! First, anyone remember a critic who LOVED the first or second Powers movies? Anyone? Please, I can't hear you so you might have to stand up. No one? Well, can't say that I do either, so does it come as any truly cosmic suprise that the critics again are decidedly cool to down right deep frozen towards the newest installment? It reminds me of earlier this year when critic after critic talked of the ol Star Wars movies as prized American treasures and spoke of how the new movies were but dim shadows of the old brilliance of the early films. Yet, go back and read the reviews of the old Star Wars movies. Glowing would not be the first word to stream across your mind. The same thing with Austin. The majority of critics complaining that Powers has lost his mojo are the same fellas and fellets that couldn't see the mojo in the first place. So what I need to do now, for all of you fellow Austin lovers who have been scared to heavens by the reviews is, as Dr. Evil says, to "throw you a freakin bone here." Goldmember is great, and not just the character. The cameos are funny, but the brilliance of the film comes from the addition of the new character, Goldmember, and the expansion of mini-me role in the film. It is quite clear to me, having listened to the audience reaction, that these movies have become much more about Dr. Evil and mini-me then anyone else, but the interaction that the characters have with one another are fantastic. Are old jokes re-hashed here, absolutely, that has been one of the charms of the other two. But there are plenty of new and innovative gags that had the audience I watched it with on the floor. The musical interludes are riotous, and there are certain scenes that will have you almost falling out of your chair. Is this one as good as the second? In my opinion no, I have never laughed as hard at a movie as I did at the second Austin Powers, but it is, very much up to par with the first and has several scenes that rival the second for those can't stop laughing moments. Micheal Caine is perfect as the suave Nigel Powers, Austins dad, as Caine, while not being given hysterical material to work with, uses what he is given to the best of his talents and ends up giving, in my opinion, some of the more memorable lines in the film. Beyonce Knowles, yet another singer turned actress, does a remarkably good job here, displeeling any rumors that she was giving Heather Graham a run for her money as the worst actress in an Austin to film to date. Knowles is beautiful, strong, sassy, and 1970's ghettos all at the same time and there are no scenes she takes part in where you get that "boy, she just seems lost" sense. Myers, well, Myers is Myers and if ou have not been convinced that his comedy is genius yet, combining slap-stick with gross out with intelligent humor, then you just are not capable of liking this film. Myers is just Myers, and his new character Goldmember is terrific. Finally, however, is mini-me, whose name escapes me right now. Mini-me has perhaps some of the funniest moments of the entire film, and the concept of having him be a mute has been one of the best comic choices to date. Mini-me is funny because he is small, but also because the little guy is just damn funny. The faces, the sounds, the humping, they are all incorporated into this wonderful little character that is truly allowed to take off in this film. The fight between Austin and mini-me is sure to have you gasping for air. The only problem I had with this film was the end, which I felt was a bit forced and not as creative as the other two endings had been, but with Myers creative genius at work, if there is a fifth, I am sure that the problems created at the end are easily fixed. This movie is funny, witty, and just plain enjoyable. If you love Austin Powers then run, don't walk, run to see this movie (I wonder if anyone has actually ever run to see a movie after reading something like that?) and if you want to enjoy yourself, check the critics reviews at the door.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The third installment of the Austin Powers series is not as funny as either of the first two movies, but it's still worth seeing. Although the writing in this film is weaker than the first two, and some of the jokes seemed like they were waiting for a final rewrite (or a script doctor), there is still plenty of enough really funny scenes to make it worth.P.S. Make sure you stick around for the brief out-takes and a short extra material during the credits.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, Austin Powers is back in the shiny 3rd installment as the International Man of Mystery in Goldmember. This film is more highly polished than the previous two, avoiding the sketch-comedy awkwardness (which was in some ways charming) in lieu of high-powered Hollywood cameos, slickly edited musical sequences and even more playful self-effacing. The opening scene is at once so typically blockbuster, and yet so exciting, surprising, and altogether funny that I wouldn't dare give a moment of it away. Without spoiling a thing I will synopse: Austin Powers, Britain's "ultimate gentleman spy", returns in a seemingly unending battle with Dr. Evil, while juggling Fat Bastard and a new hard-case by the name of Goldmember. So enraptured by the precious metal he burns off his own "twig and berries" in what must have been a hot and heavy session with a vat of molten gold. He thus becomes Goldmember, an Au-gmented Dutch madman from 1975 with a golden complexion and wheeled clogs to match. Mike Meyers manages to add this fourth personality with enough uniqueness and humour to make this entire picture as much fun as anyone is bound to have at the movies. Add a great supporting role by the extremely hot and sexily named Byoncé of Destiny's Child (who naturally adds to the soundtrack in a perfect balance of business and creativity) playing the strong-willed blaxploitation backlash Foxy Cleopatra.

Also, this has one of the best movie openers I've seen in a LONG time (you'll know what I mean when you see it)! If you feel like getting out of the house for a laugh, or if you liked the other Austin Powers movies, GO SEE THIS!!! It's probably the best of the series so far! I just hope Mike Myers will make another (I hear he wants to...YES) :-)!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We'll he is back again in theaters this time Mike Myers has droped to new levels of humor to keep the story alive. Although most of the movie I could not stay in my seat from laughter, I felt there were a lot of dead scenes where not much was going on. There is a lot of potty hummor is this movie and is not a great movie for those who are sensetive of that kind of humor. Although it was a great movie I think I'll save my money and rent it when it gets on DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This morning I went to see "Austin Powers 3: Goldmember" and to say the least about it; it was amazing. I couldn't stop laughing from the opening until the closing of the movie. Even the very beginning, and the very very end were funny. I don't recall any boring parts of the movie. This is a great movie, clearly the best Austin Powers one so far. Mike Myers did an incredible job playing the role of 4 characters. The whole idea with the movie being made about Austin Power was hilarious. Especially since they used Tom Cruise, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Danny DeVito. (sorry about my spelling mistakes, if any.) Well to end this, I'd like to recommand this movie to any person that likes to laugh. Especially Austin Powers fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Goldmember is a perfect accent to the first two films. It revisits old material without driving it into the ground and adds new touches without taking the series in a new direction. Myers is, as usual, above perfection in his performance. Dr. Evil continues to be the best of the characters and provides a hysterical lyrical turn that must be seen to be believed. The film wraps up in a respectable place where it can be equally viable as the last Austin movie or provide a turning point if the series continues. Once again a genius comic spoof that is made even more enjoyable for fans of the James Bond series who catch all the in jokes along the way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Goldmember capitalizes on what 1 &amp; 2 gave glimpses of.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film returns austin to his english roots. The humor is dry, the humor is raunchy, the humor is overstated, the humor is understated. Parts are subtle, parts are anything but... The humour is basically english though.And the humor is physical. Old style physical comedy was becoming a dying art, with dozens of cheap rip offs of jim carrey routinely passing as a limp substitutes for it. This film is the first in a long time that reminds me of the keystone cops, laurel and hardy or charlie chaplin. The funny is funny and the film lacks pretension or an absorption with plot details that encumber humor. This film is the first to capitalize on all the humor the other two movies gave us glimpses of. Mike Myers is not but may yet become this generation's peter sellers, or charlie chaplin. I'm looking forward to whatever comes next.</fullReview>

The opening scene is at once so typically blockbuster, and yet so exciting, surprising, and altogether funny that I wouldn't dare give a moment of it away. Without spoiling a thing I will synopse: Austin Powers, Britain's "ultimate gentleman spy", returns in a seemingly unending battle with Dr. Evil, while juggling Fat Bastard and a new hard-case by the name of Goldmember. So enraptured by the precious metal he burns off his own "twig and berries" in what must have been a hot and heavy session with a vat of molten gold. He thus becomes Goldmember, an Au-gmented Dutch madman from 1975 with a golden complexion and wheeled clogs to match. Mike Meyers manages to add this fourth personality with enough uniqueness and humour to make this entire picture as much fun as anyone is bound to have at the movies. Add a great supporting role by the extremely hot and sexily named Byoncé of Destiny's Child (who naturally adds to the soundtrack in a perfect balance of business and creativity) playing the strong-willed blaxploitation backlash Foxy Cleopatra. Also joining this strong cast in what must put his film role numbers in the four digits is Michael Caine, as Austin's father - who is as aesthetically awkward as he is attractive to the ladies. (like father like son) The sexual relationship with the heroine is unfortunately hastily skimmed over - unlike the first two films - this 3rd Powers powerhouse has the characters dealing with their relationships with their fathers, their clones, and even themselves. What begins initially as a Hollywood who's who of cameos, turns into a truly unique and hilarious film, and captures that same sense of freshness the original "Man of Mystery" so confidently employed. Although another sequel may be in the works, one of the most satisfying aspects of this film is that it doesn't blatantly set up a sequel like so many other movies of past summers, allowing us the viewer to sit with what we've seen, happy with the complete picture of this silly secret agent. 4/5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yeah, Baby, Ye- Oh, just give me my money already.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In short: God, what a disappointment! Okay, okay, so I'm being a little unfair. First off, I gotta say: do NOT look at the cast list. A lot of the really good jokes in the movie come from unexpected cameos, and knowing about them beforehand will destroy a lot of the humor. The opening has a whole bevy of these surprises, and is easily one of the cleverest scenes in the film. Unfortunately, the freshness and originality wears off quickly. As each of the characters are reintroduced, it just gets more and more uncomfortable. It becomes increasingly clear that no one involved really cares. Mike Myers seems to be strolling on screen, re-enacting each of his catchphrases, and collecting his check. The LEAST they could have done was think of some new jokes, but instead they re-use all the old ones. The shadow gag, the radar bit..it's all here, and we've seen it all before.Another thing: CUT DOWN ON THE BLOODY MUSICAL INTERLUDES! Good god almighty, these things are painful...like much of the movie. Okay, so the "Hard Knock Life" bit is possibly the funniest scene in the film, but that's it. The rest really have got to go. But the biggest strike against the film? It takes the second movie's biggest problem - a reliance on gross-out humor - and multiplies it ten-fold. Fat Bastard's back, but while he was at least intermittently funny last time, here he's just disgusting. And not in a good way...in an excruciating, "Why the hell am I watching this?" kind of way. The titular Goldmember has a fetish for dead skin that's more disturbing than funny. And while sh*t was the bodily function du jour last time, here the filmmakers seem fascinated by farts and urine. Ah, how far we've come in 3 years.I know I must sound like this is a bad movie, but it's really not. Just don't expect anything nearly as good as the first movie, or even the second. There ARE some hilarious scenes, like the aforementioned rap parody, an inspired scene between Austin and his father that plays on British slang, and a play on misread subtitles. But it's the long, laughless stretches that stick in the mind more. But if the humor's not surprising, at least the plot is. By film's end, we have the roles of Dr. Evil, Scott, and Mini-Me completely thrown for a loop in ways that even surprised me (and I can usually predict plot twists a mile away). It makes me curious about how they'd deal with a fourth movie...but considering how quickly the humor well is drying up for Austin, I'm not sure if I could sit through another one to find out.One last thing I forgot to mention: How the HECK are they going to release this movie in the Netherlands? I mean good god, you'd think the movie wanted every last Dutchman on the planet wiped out. I also forgot to mention another high point: Beyonce Knowles should have a great career in the movies. She studied up on her Pam Grier before auditioning, and man does it show...she's straight out of the blaxploitation era. I completely forgot she was anything but an actress, which is quite an achievement. Oh, and her song on the soundtrack, "Work It Out", kicks major old-school booty.Again, it's worth seeing, at least as a matinee. Just don't expect greatness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yeah Baby, the critics are wrong again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this movie expecting to find it lacking in some way. From what I had heard through the grap vine, which is the critics bylines, the funniest parts of the movie happened in the first few moments of the film and after that it became, to quote Austin himself, "ouch baby, very ouch." I heard that Austin was in it too much, that the new character of Goldmember was curiously unfunny, and that the movie was comprised of mostly re-hashed old jokes. But now, having seen the movie, I realize what the critics, in their own eloquent manner, were trying to tell all of us would- be Austin viewers; that they are MORONS!!!! First, anyone remember a critic who LOVED the first or second Powers movies? Anyone? Please, I can't hear you so you might have to stand up. No one? Well, can't say that I do either, so does it come as any truly cosmic suprise that the critics again are decidedly cool to down right deep frozen towards the newest installment? It reminds me of earlier this year when critic after critic talked of the ol Star Wars movies as prized American treasures and spoke of how the new movies were but dim shadows of the old brilliance of the early films. Yet, go back and read the reviews of the old Star Wars movies. Glowing would not be the first word to stream across your mind. The same thing with Austin. The majority of critics complaining that Powers has lost his mojo are the same fellas and fellets that couldn't see the mojo in the first place. So what I need to do now, for all of you fellow Austin lovers who have been scared to heavens by the reviews is, as Dr. Evil says, to "throw you a freakin bone here." Goldmember is great, and not just the character. The cameos are funny, but the brilliance of the film comes from the addition of the new character, Goldmember, and the expansion of mini-me role in the film. It is quite clear to me, having listened to the audience reaction, that these movies have become much more about Dr. Evil and mini-me then anyone else, but the interaction that the characters have with one another are fantastic. Are old jokes re-hashed here, absolutely, that has been one of the charms of the other two. But there are plenty of new and innovative gags that had the audience I watched it with on the floor. The musical interludes are riotous, and there are certain scenes that will have you almost falling out of your chair. Is this one as good as the second? In my opinion no, I have never laughed as hard at a movie as I did at the second Austin Powers, but it is, very much up to par with the first and has several scenes that rival the second for those can't stop laughing moments. Micheal Caine is perfect as the suave Nigel Powers, Austins dad, as Caine, while not being given hysterical material to work with, uses what he is given to the best of his talents and ends up giving, in my opinion, some of the more memorable lines in the film. Beyonce Knowles, yet another singer turned actress, does a remarkably good job here, displeeling any rumors that she was giving Heather Graham a run for her money as the worst actress in an Austin to film to date. Knowles is beautiful, strong, sassy, and 1970's ghettos all at the same time and there are no scenes she takes part in where you get that "boy, she just seems lost" sense. Myers, well, Myers is Myers and if ou have not been convinced that his comedy is genius yet, combining slap-stick with gross out with intelligent humor, then you just are not capable of liking this film. Myers is just Myers, and his new character Goldmember is terrific. Finally, however, is mini-me, whose name escapes me right now. Mini-me has perhaps some of the funniest moments of the entire film, and the concept of having him be a mute has been one of the best comic choices to date. Mini-me is funny because he is small, but also because the little guy is just damn funny. The faces, the sounds, the humping, they are all incorporated into this wonderful little character that is truly allowed to take off in this film. The fight between Austin and mini-me is sure to have you gasping for air. The only problem I had with this film was the end, which I felt was a bit forced and not as creative as the other two endings had been, but with Myers creative genius at work, if there is a fifth, I am sure that the problems created at the end are easily fixed. This movie is funny, witty, and just plain enjoyable. If you love Austin Powers then run, don't walk, run to see this movie (I wonder if anyone has actually ever run to see a movie after reading something like that?) and if you want to enjoy yourself, check the critics reviews at the door.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The third installment of the Austin Powers series is not as funny as either of the first two movies, but it's still worth seeing. Although the writing in this film is weaker than the first two, and some of the jokes seemed like they were waiting for a final rewrite (or a script doctor), there is still plenty of enough really funny scenes to make it worth.P.S. Make sure you stick around for the brief out-takes and a short extra material during the credits.</fullReview>

In fact, it's more fun than the previous two Powers' films in some respects, and has a noticeably faster and tighter pace. I have no problem with Powers repeating the same gimmicky formula. the original Bond films did the same thing. The only criticism is that the Goldmember villain is not terribly amusing or entertaining. The film misses the mark here. Also, in keeping with Bond parodies and icons, the producers passed up a deliciously wicked opportunity to have Austin or Dr. Evil cover some buxom young girl in gold paint. Yes, a dirty job, but potentially a playful and memorable scene! Only the guys get the gold paint treatment in this film, b-o-r-i-n-g!</fullReview>

The cameos in the opening credits are the high point and then it's slowly down hill as the film is not a story but a series of setups for gags that are a little too repetitive.

		<fullReview>This amazing installment of the Austin Powers series sets such ahigh standard that it's hard to imagine another one. All of the oldgimmicks have been reinvented for the 70s (not to mention a trip toTokyo, where Mt. Fuji always stands in every shot, even though it'snowhere near Tokyo). Others have been ingeniously expropriatedfrom blackploitation flicks, modern high-octane actioners, andGoldfinger itself. Older viewers had better be up on their moderncultural references (if they even see the movie -- most of myaudience was in the 18-25 range) or else they'll be sitting there,wondering why everyone else is bursting a gut. My advice is to seeit anyway.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't seen this movie but my friend told me it was good. He loved the one liners in the movie and told me that the funniest character in the film was Mike Myer's character, Dr. Evil. He said the characters are very funny and the ending is very funny. The plot is about Austin Powers International Man of Mystery and his dad who is kidnapped by a very mysterious character known as Goldmember, a swinger who's private area is made of gold. The only way Austin Powers can find his dad is by seeing Dr. Evil, who is in jail, so he can find goldmember. The plot is kinda like a spoof of silence of the lambs. To do that he has to go the 70's and find goldmember with the help of Foxy Cleopatra who is played by Destiny's Child Beyonce Knowles. The movie was hilarious and who I really liked was Scott as Dr. Evil's genetic son who is a hater of his dad and doesnt want to be evil like his father. But the movie makes it look good at the end. So I give this movie a 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Few Chuckles, but Mediocre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved the first couple of Austin Powers movies, and this one wasn't terrible either, but there was nothing outstanding about it. It recycled a lot of material from the first two Powers flicks in a self-conscious way. It's getting harder to tell whether Mike Meyers is parodying film clichés or falling into them himself. This one contained even more poo-poo and pee-pee jokes than the first couple, to the point that it got tiring 3/4 of the way into the movie.The accent Meyers chose for the title character got very annoying a few minutes after the first time he spoke. Meyers has a lot of talent for this sort of thing, but Goldmember's accent came across as contrived and a bit stiff, like Meyers was trying too hard.Michael Caine is a lot of fun as Austin Power's father, Nigel Powers. It was obvious from his performance that Caine was having a very good time on the set. The Cockney "private conversation" between Caine and Meyers is one of the high points of the movie.Personally, I think this series is getting tired. Meyers should consider moving onto a fresh project instead of milking the Austin Powers character for all he's worth. The ending of Goldmember makes it abundantly clear, however, that there's going to be another sequel. I don't know if that's such a good idea... I felt after seeing this one, while I did have a few laughs, that Meyers is getting close to taking the easy way out as far as coming up with new material. His time would be better spent, I think, going in a new direction. Maybe its time for a Deiter movie?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cameos the best part</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I chuckled a few times. For a comedy, I should have been laughing a lot more. Some of the jokes were more clever than humorous, more droll than amusing. Some fellow behind me actually groaned at a punny use of the line "He's not heavy, he's my brother." Many references like that seemed aimed at an older audience than the rest of the film, which makes me think the series is starting to lose focus and perhaps should die a merciful death with this film.The only parts of the film that elicited hearty audience reactions (I saw it on the day it came out, theater about 2/3 full) were the cameos. Some of them really surprised me, and to tell you the truth, the film-within-a-film that opens the movie was a whole lot more entertaining than the real film. The stars they got to make cameos make appearances at both the beginning and end of the film, wearing out the gimmick a bit, but that is par for the course these days in comedies - if something works once, repeat it at least once and preferably several times to milk it for all it is worth.Beyonce Knowles does a fabulous acting job for a singer and was the best part of the film. Michael Caine slowed things down every time he appeared, and some of his scenes were completely over-written and could have been dispensed with or completed in half the time. Robert Wagner would have been good if Meyers had given him anything to do, but mainly he sits around and looks pained. Seth Green looks like he is going through a career crisis, I hope he makes it.This installment shows all the signs of a series past its prime. It is obsessively self-referential, there are huge props that probably cost a pretty penny to create, and the precise same gags used in the previous installments are done again, but in an exaggerated way, exactly in the style of Meyer's launching pad, Saturday Night Live. I'm not sure why Meyers feels the need to play all the key parts himself, but he is no Peter Sellers and the gimmick wears thin in a hurry (he should have stopped at just Austin and Dr. Evil, less is more here).It was mildly entertaining, but not memorable. If they try to flog this dying horse for another round, it will probably stink, like Superman IV or the last Jaws installments. Probably a good rental on dvd, but not worth going out of your way to see in the theater.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is, by far, the best and funniest of the Austin Powers trilogies! The opening alone made my husband and I laugh so hard that tears were rolling down our cheeks. The use of the cameos made the film even more hilarious.The only drawback to Mike Myers' characters was "Goldmember". He was not what I had hoped for in that his part was not as humorous as those of his other characters. I did, however, enjoy the other characters that Mike Myers played.The movie was a laugh a minute and the audience that was there when I saw it were rolling on the floor laughing.Thanks, Mike Myers, for such an entertaining film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw Goldmember opening night, and I was definitely NOT disappointed. If you combine the first two movies and multiply by three, that's about half as funny as this one. Halfway through the movie I had a headache from laughing so hard. There were a few unexpected surprises to add to the astonishment of this movie. On a scale of 1-10, I give it 11.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me start off by saying that I was greatly disappointed with "Austin Powers in Goldmember." We waited 2 hours to see it the night it came out, and I was mad to discover that it turned grossly corney after the first 10 minutes. Granted, I did laugh out loud maybe 3 or 4 times through the rest of the movie, however the third installment of this series is no where near the witticism of the first two. There were nothing but stupid cliches and played out jokes in this movie. Foxy Cleopatra's character was completely underdeveloped. One thing that made the first two movies great was the dynamic relationship between Austin and his leading lady, and there is none of this in Goldmember.I suppose my biggest qualm with this movie was that the editing was HORRIBLE. It was so ridiculously choppy, it seemed like half of the plot must have been cut out. I mean, there were no transitions between scenes what so ever. And where the hell did Britney Spears come from?Finally, why the heck is this movie called "Goldmember" in the first place? The Goldmember character is barely even in it, and he is so not funny it's embarrassing to watch.Ok, so my overall rating for this movie is a D+, only because the Tom Cruise bit was hilarious.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Last night I went to see "Goldmember", the newest installment in the hilarious Austin Powers movies. The theater was packed and almost every seat was filled. After the opening scene, everyone in the theater was just dying in their seats. I was, in fact, also. "Goldmember" is by far the funniest of the 3 Austin Powers movies! There are some very funny celebrity cameos, but the Osbournes really just need to go away. The sight gags from the first 2 films are back, and better than ever! The character Goldmember was very funny, and Fat B*****d is more hilarious in this one, but way more disgusting. It was also very funny how Austin reacted to the mole on, well The Mole. And of course Austin and Dr. Evil are very funny. Don't forget Mini-Me! Anyone who says this is the worst film of the Austin Powers movies has no sense of humor. I think a lot of people would agree because everyone in the theater was laughing so hard. And how could you not like a movie that is making fun of Jay-Z?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really didn't know what to expect from this 3rd installment of the Austin Powers franchise. I did expect the line on opening night to be extremely long. Thankfully the wait time I spent was only 1 hr and twenty minutes because I would have killed myself otherwise. I really savored the opening credits for it is something that was completely unexpected. After the opening I had carried over high hopes that the movie be better than watching clothes spin in a dryer...I lost my anticipation as soon as I saw the same "shh" joke from the previous two Austins. Even though most of the jokes were recycled, there were a few scenes that made me open up and blast my drink downward. The storyline seemed to have come from one of those websites that every loser in the world can add a line to the story, twists and stupidity ensues surprises and bad accents. If you liked Austin before, you might like this movie as the trilogy completes, but if you never did like the series, do not waste your time/money on this overrated repeat. Just remember, you don't have to leave the theater right away, go to another one to get your money's worth, since Goldmember is not worth the eight dollars you paid. Popcorn?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thankfully, I went to a bargain afternoon show and didn't have to pay full price to see this fetid piece of dog crap. Ozzy Osbourne said it best in the film when he noted that the breast joke was simply a repeat of bits we've seen in the other 2 films. When not ripping themselves off, the filmmakers apparently thought it would be funny if Dr. Evil mumbles incoherently, or takes one in the groin or Mini-Me runs into a wall. The only ones in the theater laughing were the 10 year olds this material was apparently aimed at. I can honestly say I did not laugh once, the first time this has happened since the 80's debacle Howard the Duck. I went to the film with great apprehension, since Austin II was such a major letdown after the first, cult classic film. Seems there's a law of diminishing returns applied to this series. I'm just disappointed that the IMDB won't let me rate lower than 1, so I'll do it here: 0/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, let me say that I really did enjoy this movie. However, it does not live up to the other Austin Powers movies in the trilogy.Working at a movie theater, I had heard all day Friday from people exiting the theater that it was the best Austin Powers film yet, it provided endless laughs, and especially the opening scene was amazing. I was greatly anticipating our private employee showing late that night, but what I saw instead somewhat disappointed me.Although Mike Meyers does a great job as usual in playing multiple characters, most of the jokes and plot was recycled from the first two movies. The writers obviously tried to continue on from the best jokes from the 2nd movie, but they just aren't funny this time around. There was such a lack of new content in this movie that it made the movie a little boring about 3/4 of the way through the movie. Also, unlike the 2nd movie (The Spy who Shagged Me) which provided almost non-stop laughter, this one has much more down-time in which you have to wait for the comedic moments. Thats not a big deal if what you wait for is worth it, but these comedic moments are definitely not worth the wait. Sure, there were the few times when the audience all instantly roared in laughter, but those times were seldom.One of my biggest problems with this movie is not the recycled content, it is instead the overall theme of the movie: Goldmember. I have never seen a movie named after a character with such a minor part in the movie. Goldmember does play a part in a few of the funnier parts of the movie, especially when Dr. Evil is having a little language/accent communication problem. Other than that though, hes hardly even around.Another drawback of the movie is the amount of other famous people in the movie. Britney Spears makes a brief appearance, but has absolutely nothing to do with the plot. She is simply in the movie to be in the movie. There are plenty of other brief star appearances, but I don't want to go into those because some people consider it extremely funny and I don't want to ruin it for you. But...There is definitely one star that did deserve to be in that movie, and that is Beyonce Knowles. I thought she was going to be just like all the other stars in it, playing a meaningless character and just in the movie for publicity, however she played her part to absolute perfection. She was definitely the star of this movie, every time she was on screen you could count on some excellent acting and funny moments.Overall, the movie isn't bad, it just has a lot of drawbacks that will keep many movie-goers a little disappointed with the third installment of the series. The series, which constantly pokes fun at other movies, now seems to be poking fun at itself at times, but yet the writers did set it up for another sequel... however they also set it up to end the series if thats what they want to do. Go see Goldmember, you'll enjoy it, but be slightly disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK the plot may be a mess, It may be the weakest of the three movies, and a lot of the material is repetitive. However, I did laugh and laugh hard a number of times. After going through a week of hell at work, it was a pleasure to get lost in this crazy movie for a few hours. With all the junk movies out there that are supposed to be "real movies", I at least had some fun watching this one. Everyone was funny and I liked all of the cameos. So if you like Austin Powers, don't listen to all of those evil reviews and go have some fun baby.</fullReview>

In between these are infernal sequences composed of lengthy and purile concepts that are unfit fodder for swine. It is a true shame, the concept is good, and there is potential here. The cast has amazing talents such as Robert Wagner, Michael York, and Michael Caine. The characters' dialogue is not worked to it's fullest potential.

		<shortDescription>Goldmember is fine, not bad, not beautiful.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the various reviews I've read about Goldmember I see pure fans gulping down the small idiosyncrasies and other foibles in the story.This movie is good.Indeed it isn't as creative, or "new" as the first two films; however, it has the creative and trademarked comedy that can only be found in a film by Mike Myers.Some scatological, some intellectual, other things just Monty Python...the comedy in this film appears to be duplicates of "good" stuff from the first two.The good stuff: The story flows well. It moves at a pace that keeps one awake and interested. There are a number of jokes that were so humorous I stopped breathing. The characters, and the actors behind them, all did very well.The Not-So-Good stuff: Again, sometimes the jokes are just repeats. But, there's nothing wrong with them. I LOVE AUSTIN POWER JOKES, seeing repeats of the same jokes is great. There could have been some more "new" things, but the reuse of older ideas didn't bother me.That's all the bad things I have to say!In general, this is a very good movie. I sat in a nicely sized audience, and have never heard people laugh so hard. Why do some of these other reviewers have to be so harsh to the film?This movie is good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some recycled jokes, bet close to on par with Spy Who...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was able to catch a sneak preview of Goldmember and, overall, I liked what I saw. I didn't really know how funny this would be because something the Powers series was becoming known for with the second installment: Recycled jokes. Yes, Goldmember has some recycled jokes, plenty of them, but at least the film identifies this in the Osbournes scene. I expected the characters to be more tired than in the previous installment, and indeed they were. Fans of the series will probably still enjoy some of the moments with Scott, Mini-Me, Fat Bastard, etc. The story has it's crazy take over the world idea, but it still could have remembered this series started as a Bond-series spoof. Dr. Evil is more insane and, while a bit tired, is still rather funny, especially the Silence of the Lambs spoof when Mini-Me and Evil go to prison. It has a a "friggin" funny take on the song 'Hard Noc Life' that will no doubt be dated sooner rather than later. The new character Goldmember wasn't too funny, pretty much falls flat. No matter what, Myers has to be given props for playing 4 different characters, but at the same time 4 is maybe one too many....New female love interest Foxxy Cleopatra was OK at best, certainly nothing great and I found both Vanessa and Felicity to be better. Michael Caine is a different story though, he was funny and brought some freshness with his character. The only thing I didn't like that much was the ending, too "tie everything up neat and happy," though I enjoy what happens to the character of Scott. Getting a bit dated and stale, but still an entry into the series a bit behind the second. I'd say Myers needs to fresh up the franchise though if they continue with a fourth one. And yes, the cameos are hilarious...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>90 Minutes of mini-skits</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a fan of the first two Austin Powers movies. Unfortunately, I will not be a fan of the third. While the movie does have it's moments, too much time was spent on the clever opening and not the movie itself. The movie is comprised of skits strung together by a very loose storyline. To my wife and I, it seems that much of this material was stuff left behind, not good enough for the first two movies. The other 'skits' were simply rehashing of old jokes. It further seemed Mike Meyers was a) consumed with his own popularity of the first two movies and b) just sent this one in. The jokes, while raunchy in the first two but had purpose, simply were attempts to gross the audience out or go for the cheap thrill. I was very disappointed in this movie. It didn't live up the expectations, based on the brillance of the first two. I am sure I will be in the minority in my opinion, but watch closely and you will see what I saw.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hope you liked the jokes from the first two movies A LOT 'cause if you don't you won't like this movie at all. There are about three new jokes in the entire movie (after the opening which is unbelievably funny), and those feel old too especially after being bombarded with clips on Comedy Central and in advertisements. Well I'd say skip this one but most people will see it anyway (as I did), and the intro is worth seeing before you hear too much more about it. Just don't be looking for any of the comic revelations of the previous Mike Meyers movies, actually this does feel like Wayne's World 2 (but not as good!!), with it's repetitions from the other movies. Just go in expecting little and you'll won't be disapointed. And someone start around the petition to prevent Mike from making another one...please.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This probably one of the best Austin Powers movie yet.I was really Impress with this Movie.Austin Powers IN Goldmember in my opinion is the funniest comedy this summer and maybe the funniest comedy in 2002.After Seeing the Unfunny Men In Black 2 this movie kind of made me put a smile on my face from beginnning to end.Mike Myers does it again bringing Austin Powers,Dr. Evil,Fat Bastard back to life in this Summer's Hilarious Comedy also bringing to life a new villain Goldmember.Mike Myers is probably the best comedic Actor along with Chris Tucker who knows how to make movies enjoyable and fun.Beyonce Knowles did an excellent job in this movie Playing Foxy Cleopatra and oh was she so darn fine.She really is good as an actress and we might see more of her acting in the near future.She sure knows how to play as a Secret Agent and sure does know how to dress.Anyways If you haven't seen the movie yet you better go see it and If You Didn't liked Men In Black 2 Then I suggest you go see Austin Powers in Goldmember Because it unlike MIB 2 this movie will keep you laughing throughout the movie.I give the movie 9 out of 10 stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Austin Powers Does It Again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw "Austin Powers in Goldmember" so since it's fresh in my mind, I'll make my comment on it. I give it 8 stars out of 10. It was very funny, it had a few references to the '70s, and not so much the '60s like the first two movies. Dr. Evil finally gets captured and it happens just when he's revealing his latest plot which is to go to 1975 to meet Goldmember, who has invented a successful tracking beam. He code names the plan, "Preparation H". They will use the tracking beam to bring a meteor to Earth to flood the planet. Soon after, Austin's father Nigel Powers is kidnapped and he finds out from Dr. Evil that he must go back to '75 to find Goldmember, who has Nigel. While there he meets his old flame Foxxy Cleopatra who is a detective. They both go back to 2002 after Goldmember goes to 2002 with Nigel and soon they are involved with Goldmember and Dr. Evil's newest plot. They recycled a few jokes from the first two movies like the joke with Austin being behind a sheet with Felicity and it seemed like she was pulling things out of his ass. They also (once again) recycled the joke where Dr. Evil asks the government for $1,000,000. It was very good. Beyonc?'s performance was exceptional and Mike Myers once again succeeded in making a great movie. The cameos were great. Britney Spears, Gwyneth Paltrow, Tom Cruise, Kevin Spacey, Danny DeVito, Katie Couric, the Ozzbournes, the list goes on. The only complaint I have is that they never explained what had happened to Felicity Shagwell. I could understand if maybe Heather Graham didn't want to be in the movie, but still, they could've at least given a brief explanation to what happened to her within the movie. Even so, I highly anticipate seeing this again, and I will definintely get it when it comes to video. Also, I do hope that they make an Austin Powers 4.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was able to catch a sneak preview of Goldmember and, overall, I liked what I saw. I didn't really know how funny this would be because something the Powers series was becoming known for with the second installment: Recycled jokes. Yes, Goldmember has some recycled jokes, plenty of them, but at least the film identifies this in the Osbournes scene. I expected the characters to be more tired than in the previous installment, and indeed they were. Fans of the series will probably still enjoy some of the moments with Scott, Mini-Me, Fat Bastard, etc. The story has it's crazy take over the world idea, but it still could have remembered this series started as a Bond-series spoof. Dr. Evil is more insane and, while a bit tired, is still rather funny, especially the Silence of the Lambs spoof when Mini-Me and Evil go to prison. It has a a "friggin" funny take on the song 'Hard Noc Life' that will no doubt be dated sooner rather than later. The new character Goldmember wasn't too funny, pretty much falls flat. No matter what, Myers has to be given props for playing 4 different characters, but at the same time 4 is maybe one too many....New female love interest Foxxy Cleopatra was OK at best, certainly nothing great and I found both Vanessa and Felicity to be better. Michael Caine is a different story though, he was funny and brought some freshness with his character. The only thing I didn't like that much was the ending, too "tie everything up neat and happy," though I enjoy what happens to the character of Scott. Getting a bit dated and stale, but still an entry into the series a bit behind the second. I'd say Myers needs to fresh up the franchise though if they continue with a fourth one. And yes, the cameos are hilarious...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although when I walked into the theater I wasn't expecting a very good movie, I was pleasantly surprised. I'm not a big Beyoncé fan and doubted her acting abilities. She was fair, and Mike Myers was at his best. The cameos were great. This is most certainly the best one yet. It even has a surprise ending. The best part was when they showed them as young students and Evan Farmer was there as young Number 2. You may remember him from the best movie ever made, 2GETHER, he played Jerry. The cast was great and the story was amazing. This is a must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Low brow for sure, but we hardly stopped laughing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I see that Austin Powers is getting very mixed reviews, both from the pros and IMDB users, and be assured that it will not be joining Some Like It Hot and Tootsie as one of the funniest and intelligent movies of all time. Perhaps it suffers a bit from a wee too much scatology. And the plot is the barest wisp of a framework to hold the movie together. It's really just a series of gags and sketches.Nevertheless, I recommend this movie for the simplest of reasons: The audience I saw this with, including me, hardly stopped laughing throughout. A few of the gags are so gross they'll make you wince, and a few are carryovers from the first two Austin Powers films, but on the whole the movie is one funny, creative bit after another. And the many surprise cameos are a hoot.Kudos too for Beyoncé Knowles for a funny and charming turn as Foxy Cleopatra. While not the most complex female lead in film history, she fills the limited demands of the role nicely.These days, a film that does nothing more than keep me laughing for an hour and a half will get my vote every time.8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wait for the DVD</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this film with the highest of hopes. Having seen the first two installments, and absolutely loving them, I couldn't wait to see Goldmember. Perhaps I should have hesitated a bit. After an incredible cameo filled opening, the film slips into gross-out humor and non-existant plotline. There are the usual suspects:Dr. Evil, Fat Bastard, Mini-Me, Frau Farbissina, and of course Austin, and they deliver, but their "act" seems old and predictable. The addition of Michael Caine could've added a burst of freshness, but he is underused, and just ends up being a poor parody of himself. Beyonce Knowles as Foxxy Cleopatra is a combination of every Blaxpoitation movie out there, but she is little more than fodder for the eye, and her acting talent(if there is any)does not get the opportunity to emerge. Seth Green was an unlikely standout as Dr. Evil's son Scott. His transformation to "evil" is one of the highpoints of the movie. Also, look for a school-years flashback of Austin and Dr. Evil that had me in stitches, and in awe of the young men portraying them. These high points were few and far between. This is not to say that "Austin Powers in Goldmember" didn't make me laugh, it just didn't make continuously laugh. In this franchise, the third time really isn't the charm. My advice is to save your hard earned cash, and wait for the DVD, which will probably have all sorts of extras, which will actually make you feel like you got your money's worth, which unfortunately I did not.</fullReview>

I don't think anybody really liked Goldmember. He was just plain , nobody laugh a his jokes when I was sitting in the theater. They certainly could have gotting some one that could act to play the part of Mrs. Foxy Cleopatra. One moment in the movie really made me sick, when that damn Britney Spears showed her face. Do get me wrong I love her face , along with other things , but it ruined the movie for me. Spears was the only cameo they would have been better off leaving out.

		<shortDescription>Third time's a charm, baby!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>He's back, baby. It's the shagadelic third installment in the spy series. This time, Austin Powers (Mike Myers) must save the day, again, when his arch-nemesis Dr. Evil (Mike Myers) threatens to flood the earth by using a laser beam to control the earth's satellite. In order to stop him, Austin must travel back to 1975 and rescue his father Nigel Powers (Michael Caine) from Dr. Evil's newest henchman, Goldmember (Mike Myers, again!) and form an alliance with ex-girlfriend Foxxy Cleopatra (Beyoncé Knowles), then travel back to 2002 to stop Goldmember, Dr. Evil, and the rest of his infamous gang of henchmen.Even though this installment is the funniest of the three (the first 10 to 15 minutes of the movie is a riotous hoot with cameos galore), Goldmember is the weakest link of the series. With his testicles made of gold and having a weird attribute of eating his peeled skin, it almost makes you sick to your stomach in some scenes. The other let down of the movie, Heather Graham had a cameo appearance as Felicity Shagwell and all her scenes ended up on the cutting room floor. Oh, well. The revelation is unexpected (except to those who saw the first two movies), and the ending leaves the door open for a fourth Austin Powers adventure. Funniest moments are the first 15 minutes of the movie, the clever &amp; witty names of female characters (and everybody who thought `Fook Yu' was a bad word will now be grateful to say in front of parents. Don't worry, they won't get it until DVD release), Dr. Evil's version of a Jay-Z rap song, Dr. Evil's new lair, the satellite (which is reminiscent of number two's funniest moments), the battle between Austin and Fat Bastard (Michael Myers from those `Halloween' slasher films), and Fred Savage as The Mole. After the movie, you'll wonder: Which direction will AP4 take if they decide to make it? (Trust me, you'll be asking yourself this mind-boggling question.) Yeah, baby!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**Very minor spoilers**The first was good. The second was still good. The third...oh so bad. The jokes are tired. Even the actors themselves look tired. The best part of the movie was the opening two minutes. After that, it all went downhill. Britney Spears's cameo however was just shameless and I'm glad her head exploded a short time after she appears. Midway through the first half you can't wait for it to be over. Yes, there were a few good jokes, but the movie as a whole felt so much more crude than the original two that I actually cringed in parts. Mini-me though does steal the show completely, although I do feel a tinge of guilt for laughing at a midget getting beaten up every two seconds. Michael Caine also proves he's past his acting prime and I'm honestly surprised he picked such a terrible part to play.Anyway, I'll stop right there. Don't go in expecting anything near as 'good' as the first two. This is pure, unadulterated and crude Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just got home from viewing a sneak preview of "Austin Powers in Goldmember" and have mixed feelings. Although i found myself laughing at the usual comedy of the group it seemed that it was old jokes renewed. The shadows showing dirty things and Austin holding a gun yet never shooting anyone. This is much a family film so don't get me wrong, I don't want him to run around killing people. In this installment Scott wants to take over the evil thrown after his father and be as evil or more as him. A sudden but inevitable and obvious twist alters the film making it more a feel good comedy then the battle of good and evil. 6/10, I still like the first one most of the trilogy and although this isn't horrible, it isn't that good either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dismal third attempt at recreating a shagadelic atmosphere...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best joke in the latest Austin Powers Film comes at the very end when our perrenial villain, Fat Bastard, compares his new look to a women's organ.The third and seemingly last of the Austin Powers films (we will get to that later); Austin Powers in Goldmember, is a disappointing finale if the trilogy does come to an end. This movie is susceptible to what I like to call, 'bowtie endings' in which all the characters are happy, everything falls into place and the masses are pleased with no clear cut solution. Pity, just when I thought the film would bring closure to a great little idea, it falters at a tremendous rate. This being said, please allow me the admittance of describing the feeling for such harsh opening remarks for the third installment of a once venerable franchise. The first Austin Powers film was a little gem. That film literally came out of nowhere and gained its' following on video cassette after a paltry box office. Upon the sequel, the same feel and excitement was elevated after the creative team knew they had to come up something fresh, and they did. For those who follow the films, the tone was set in the second film after a great opening sequence displayed the many abuses the male genitalia can undergo. In the third installment, all the energy runs dry after a hilarious cameo packed action sequence sets the running gag for the 'film within a film' concept. Once we are pleasantly surprised by whom Mike Myers and the rest of the team can assemble for cameo appearances, we are thwarted into vintage Austin Powers territory as the musical introductory sequence occurs. Unfortunately, not all the cameos in the world could save a deplorable and uncreative musical sequence that sets the tone for a heavily choreographed, mildly funny film that solemnly brings closure to the franchise.Mike Myers returns as the heroic Austin Powers, he also returns as the villainous Dr. Evil and the evil henchman Fat Bastard. Amidst all the characters, the creators have decided to throw in another character who is supposed to be from Holland, yet has a freakishly accent reminiscent of New Jersey. The aptly named Goldmember has an affinity for all things gold, and he is supposed to be the driving force behind the evil schemes, yet his character is completetly futile in terms of plot development and those who saw the film, know there isn't even any closure to this character. The question arises - Will there be another Austin Powers film? If it is as recycled as this film was, many will take a pass at it. Some may be asking by this point, why so harsh? It is very simple. Avid fans who have come to know and love the immortal Austin Powers character know the man behind the character; Mike Myers, is a very talented and creative man. Insiders have always claimed many of the intuitive ideas were spawned from Myers and his thorough involvement within the script contributed to the success of the two films. Alas, this cannot be said for the third As aforementioned, from the musical introductory sequence, a morbid feeling came rushing over me as if to say, 'have they already used up all their ideas?'. Yes they have. Director Jay Roach (Meet the Parents, Austin Powers) returns to helm the third installment in what proves to be a disappointing foray into comedy. Roach tries his best at simply running the camera as many of the skits seem to be strictly improvised grounded in about a couple of sentences of script. The key word is skit. This film lacks cohesiveness due to a complete omission of plot. The film mentions something about kidnapping Austin Powers' father (Sir Micheal Caine) and having Goldmember destroy the world. The gags have all been done before and this time, the audience is laughing at recycled elements from the first two films thrown into a pot. This film is like a best of gag reel and amalgamates all the best elements of the first two films and brings them together. It is simply a running skit of gags that in terms of story, do not contribute to one another. Remember the shadow scene from the second film, it is here. Remember the rivalry between Dr. Evil and his son Scott, it is here too. Remember the sequence where they get around saying a graphic word by alluding to it by spotting things in the sky (a la 'Hot Dog' skit in the second film), it is here also.Spunk and creativity are lacking as the film takes on an uncomfortable tone of dismal classiness. The first two were funny, raunchy and wholesome films. This film will guarantee you many laughs, but when the film is over, one will be asking themselves what they were laughing about. It is that exact mindlessness that works against the film. So many times there were scenes that did not elicit laughs from the audience, yet they were still included in the final cut. A lot of little 'bits' in the film did not work, it seemed like a bad high school variety show at some points, but they were still in the film. It is inexplicable when there are uncomfortable pauses within in a comedy, something is incorrect. Adding to the demise of the film is Beyonce Knowles. A singer who makes her acting debut as Foxxy Cleopatra. A Hybrid of Shaft and Jackie Brown all rolled into one. Her character is endlessly annoying and is simply present to prompt awareness about Austin's biracial preferences. In any event, the film will elicit many laughs merely due to the immaturity of the jokes and the recycled cliches brought together. Will it leave the viewer with a dire need to watch it again as in the first two films, sadly no. This time, Austin is not shagadelic.Giancarlo's Rating: **</fullReview>

Right along with Ace Ventura, these movies are about the only films that actually make me laugh out loud. AP3 is different, with the hilarious fake opening, yet takes what was funny about the previous movie and rehashes it into something funnier. There are too many hilarious moments to describe them individually, but I will say there are many surprise cameos.

Upon the sequel, the same feel and excitement was elevated after the creative team knew they had to come up something fresh, and they did. For those who follow the films, the tone was set in the second film after a great opening sequence displayed the many abuses the male genitalia can undergo. In the third installment, all the energy runs dry after a hilarious cameo packed action sequence sets the running gag for the 'film within a film' concept. Once we are pleasantly surprised by whom Mike Myers and the rest of the team can assemble for cameo appearances, we are thwarted into vintage Austin Powers territory as the musical introductory sequence occurs. Unfortunately, not all the cameos in the world could save a deplorable and uncreative musical sequence that sets the tone for a heavily choreographed, mildly funny film that solemnly brings closure to the franchise.Mike Myers returns as the heroic Austin Powers, he also returns as the villainous Dr. Evil and the evil henchman Fat Bastard. Amidst all the characters, the creators have decided to throw in another character who is supposed to be from Holland, yet has a freakishly accent reminiscent of New Jersey. The aptly named Goldmember has an affinity for all things gold, and he is supposed to be the driving force behind the evil schemes, yet his character is completetly futile in terms of plot development and those who saw the film, know there isn't even any closure to this character. The question arises - Will there be another Austin Powers film? If it is as recycled as this film was, many will take a pass at it. Some may be asking by this point, why so harsh? It is very simple. Avid fans who have come to know and love the immortal Austin Powers character know the man behind the character; Mike Myers, is a very talented and creative man. Insiders have always claimed many of the intuitive ideas were spawned from Myers and his thorough involvement within the script contributed to the success of the two films. Alas, this cannot be said for the third As aforementioned, from the musical introductory sequence, a morbid feeling came rushing over me as if to say, 'have they already used up all their ideas?'. Yes they have. Director Jay Roach (Meet the Parents, Austin Powers) returns to helm the third installment in what proves to be a disappointing foray into comedy. Roach tries his best at simply running the camera as many of the skits seem to be strictly improvised grounded in about a couple of sentences of script. The key word is skit. This film lacks cohesiveness due to a complete omission of plot. The film mentions something about kidnapping Austin Powers' father (Sir Micheal Caine) and having Goldmember destroy the world. The gags have all been done before and this time, the audience is laughing at recycled elements from the first two films thrown into a pot. This film is like a best of gag reel and amalgamates all the best elements of the first two films and brings them together. It is simply a running skit of gags that in terms of story, do not contribute to one another. Remember the shadow scene from the second film, it is here. Remember the rivalry between Dr. Evil and his son Scott, it is here too. Remember the sequence where they get around saying a graphic word by alluding to it by spotting things in the sky (a la 'Hot Dog' skit in the second film), it is here also.Spunk and creativity are lacking as the film takes on an uncomfortable tone of dismal classiness. The first two were funny, raunchy and wholesome films. This film will guarantee you many laughs, but when the film is over, one will be asking themselves what they were laughing about. It is that exact mindlessness that works against the film. So many times there were scenes that did not elicit laughs from the audience, yet they were still included in the final cut. A lot of little 'bits' in the film did not work, it seemed like a bad high school variety show at some points, but they were still in the film. It is inexplicable when there are uncomfortable pauses within in a comedy, something is incorrect. Adding to the demise of the film is Beyonce Knowles. A singer who makes her acting debut as Foxxy Cleopatra. A Hybrid of Shaft and Jackie Brown all rolled into one. Her character is endlessly annoying and is simply present to prompt awareness about Austin's biracial preferences. In any event, the film will elicit many laughs merely due to the immaturity of the jokes and the recycled cliches brought together. Will it leave the viewer with a dire need to watch it again as in the first two films, sadly no. This time, Austin is not shagadelic.Giancarlo's Rating: **</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I possess the immature sense of humor that makes the Austin Power series the ultimate of comedies for my taste. Right along with Ace Ventura, these movies are about the only films that actually make me laugh out loud. AP3 is different, with the hilarious fake opening, yet takes what was funny about the previous movie and rehashes it into something funnier. There are too many hilarious moments to describe them individually, but I will say there are many surprise cameos. It's a leg humping, mojo blasting, shagadelic romp that shouldn't leave you disappointed.</fullReview>

It was funny and the movie was good but it was not as good as the previous two movies. I sat the entire movie waiting to burst into uncontrollable laughter like I did with the previous two installments but alas, I did not. The jokes were cheezier and not on the level of the previous movies. Save this one for a Sunday matinee.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The writers did a good job retaining the ongoing themes yet keeping the jokes fresh. Considering it's the third movie, it's excellent relative to other sequels. The opening was well done and very funny. Tons of Cameos. Music is good. The ending was disappointing - very unlike the previous two. The movie never quite reached a climax so it's unfair to say the ending was anti-climatic. Nonetheless it's a funny movie and well worth the time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was terrible. It was a constant reminder that Hollywood needs some original ideas.Austin Powers: Oldmember, err I mean Goldmember, is another chapter in the life of Austin Powers. (Don't worry, there are no spoilers that will jeopardize the movie).Austin has to hunt down some old gezzer named Goldmember, how original. Dr. Evil and Goldmember are partners because they want to rule the world, blah blah blah, you get the idea. This movie had so many pop stars I wanted to kill myself; with talent less silicone infested people like Britney Spears, to the dysfunctional, brainless, prince of stuttering Ozzy Osbourne, this movie was crawling with celebrities that shouldn't even be in the film. I never did understand why all these celebes were in the movie, was Mike Myers trying to take a page from Moby? or just to say, "Look, these are my friends."I'm not going to lie, I was so tired of seeing commercial after commercial of Austin Powers, but when I seen the movie, it wasn't all that's cracked up to be, and now I am REALLY tired of seeing these obsolete commercials of Austin Powers. Well, on a more softer side to Austin Powers, Myers tried to make Austin out to be the victim when his father was never there for him; aahhh, my black heart bleeds for him; the chemistry between Austin and his father does not click with me, it was so dry of a good relationship.Saying Mike Myers is a comic genius is like saying Fred Durst or Kid Rock are brilliant lyricists, it's just not true. Austin Powers wasn't funny, the acting was terrible, and the characters had the worst dialogue in the world. Also, what is with the dancing? Come on, this movie was WORSE than Crossroads, and THAT should tell you something.</fullReview>

At times I was laughing so hard my sides hurt, but at other times I was bored. Mike Myers was great as Austin and Dr. Evil. I wish Fat Bastard could have been a bigger part. He should have kept Goldmember at home. Hopefully, the character won't return if there is another Austin Powers movie. The thing about this movie was there were too many characters for a 90 minute movie. Benowce Knowles was decent as Foxy Cleopatra, and she isn't a bad actress. Michael York is just plain Basil, Seth Green was not that good as Scott Evil as he was in the other Two movies, Robert Wagner is still sad as Number Two and Mindy Sterling as Frau Farbisina did not have that big of a role. Michael Caine was pretty good as Austin's father and Verne Troyer as Mini-Me was actually better this time than the last movie. The best part of the movie was the cameos. I will see this film again very soon, and this time I won't be expecting a lot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie @ a sneak preview and I think I can say that everyone there laughed through the entire movie. I didn't hear half of the dialoge because everyone was laughing too hard. I will say that a lot of it was bathroom humor, right up there with "There's Something About Mary" but is that really so bad. Some of the jokes in it are recycled from the first two, but done in a new enough way that they don't seem tired and old. And some of them seem like they are inside jokes for the fans of the first ones. One tip: If you plan on seeing it, don't let anyone tell you about the Cameos. The surprise of who you are seeing is half of the joke. This franchise has proved that the sequels can surpass the originals.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exactly what you'd expect, but worth it if you've enjoyed the other ones.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the things about sequels that make people lose interest is the redundancy in material. It's one thing to base your movie on an idea and bring it in a new direction, it's another to rehash and barely expand on what you have. So many good films have lost their luster simply by trying to cash in on the original's good name. Even this summer we have seen "Men In Black II", "Stuart Little 2", and even "Halloween 8" degrade the spirit of the original. The new Austin Powers movie is guilty of all of the above, but by far the least of the offenders. It offers not much unexpected after the first five minutes, but still lies in the "guilty pleasure" realm that many critics prefer not to go into.So is the new Austin Powers worth going to see? Yes, if you're a big fan of the series. It offers plenty of laughs and succeeds in keeping its particular audiences' attention. Although considered "mindless" by some, there's actually quite a lot of thought put into it. Almost every scene is at least fairly funny and there's enough going on to keep even the most ADD glued to the screen.While there's no sort of award for comic performance in film, you've got to hand it to Mike Myers for providing pop culture with some of the most memorable comedic characters in quite some time. As one of the few post-SNL crew that make movies that matter (at least financially), Myers has brought us Austin, Fat Bastard, Dr. Evil, and now Goldmember. While the latter is probably the least likeable of all of his creations, it's still quite something to see someone handle four very different main roles by himself and do it well.Returning director Jay Roach knows not to fix what's not broken and keeps things rolling along with all of the usual stuff you'd suspect along with the aforementioned dazzling celebrity-ridden first five minutes. Michael York, Seth Green, Mindy Sterling, and Verne Troyer also all return to their now famous roles and are joined by the worthy Beyonce Knowles and Michael Caine. If it seems all too familiar, it's because it is supposed to be.This one is worth going to check out if you enjoyed the other ones. You'll get what you expect and if that's what you're looking for then Mike Myers and Co. did a good job. It wasn't made for critics, so it's up to you to decide if this is something you want to see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you're looking forward to a bucket of hip-hop, pop-culture gags, quirky movie spoofs, and character punches, this movie won't be a disappointment. It has a choc-a-block of colorful characters, zapping at the charm of the classic musical shows (hey, never thought that I'd ever imagine 'Singing In The Rain' could be funny!), and providing mickey-punches on the '70s Blaxploitation films such as 'Goldfinger', but not without splatters of nudges on the '70s fads and characteristics to create the ever-so-familiar synergetic groovy Austin Powers appeal, so loved by the fans. It also makes a crack at the '70s disco wave.This flick offers no apologies for daring the viewers to slight at any human peculiarities and imperfections, as seen in the eyes of the beholder. Even diction and accents are never left out for laughter. Needless to say, the Mike Myers' villains continue to belong to a breed of very flamboyantly insane creatures. Yeah, baby, yeah, many of the actors of the last two films are back playing their respective roles in this campy flick - Verne Troyer (Mini Me,) Seth Green (Scott Evil,) Robert Wagner (Number Two) and Mindy Sterling (Frau Farbissina) and Michael York (Basil Exposition). Even Mr. Bigglesworth, the cat, has not failed to make his appearance! Yep, they are all back on screen with their unforgettable silly mannerisms.Can't say this movie lacks foul vibes and crude toilet innuendos. Hey, it's Special Agent Shagalicious, teaming up with his old flame, and doing his Shagadelic! In a funky sense, this movie embraces the freedom to be crazy and stupid, silly, idiotic and weirdly and wildly evil! It blasts the screen with amusingly blatant and sassy acts and dialogue. The acts of the characters appear more as being psychotic, celebratory and mischievously wacky than disgustingly crude. It's these acts and mannerisms that make the characters bizarre, weird and totally infectious. All are varied in their attitudes, putting the viewers through a non-stop ride of hilarities. Yep, this film is filled with adolescent potty humor. And yet, the film does not fail in referencing the characters' fears and hopes, their wishes and struggles, their ideals and goals.Interesting cameos - Tom Cruise, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kevin Spacey, Danny DeVito, Quincy Jones and Britney Spears - they definitely prove their point that they too can whip up some solid amusement, especially when they take the viewers by surprise. And fans of the Mike Myers' AP character are definitely in for a cool treat when they get flipped in to the teenage years of the heroic spy. Oh don't forget to lookout for the youthful Dr. Evil and his No. 2 too. And Michael Caine is great as Nigel Powers, offering loads of signals that he's a ladies man, yet retaining an air of mystery about his character. Beyoncé Knowles carries off her Foxxy Cleopata role beautifully. She's the best Foxxy I've seen. Overall, the cast is wonderfully entertaining. And there are some unusually catchy phrases. Oh, I do love the father-son ferociously wicked lingo!I should think this flick would do very well at the box-office!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The highly anticipated Austin Powers in Goldmember looked very funny in its trailers.; new characters, new era, plus returning favourites from previous instalments in the series. And while it is pretty funny, it just doesn't stand up to the first two.If you don't know Mike Myers's Austin character, then you've been living under a rock under an even larger rock. He plays a time-travelling, swingin', shaggin' British secret service agent, always trying to foil his arch nemesis, Dr. Evil (also Myers). The second movie, Austin Power: The Spy who Shagged Me brought new characters, like Fat Bastard (Myers again) and Mini-Me (Troyer) into the fold, recycling the best jokes from the first, while adding a new kick in the pants. Somehow, it still managed to be clever and, more importantly, extremely funny.Now comes Austin Powers in Goldmember and what can I say? They try doing to same thing again but this time, it's irrelevant. There are references to the first 2 movies, and we find out more about Dr. Evil parents, but we've seen the gags before in this very series. Heck, they even make jokes about re-doing the same material. And when the best laughs come from surprise cameos (and there are lots of them), that's not a good sign. Nevertheless, the movie does become pretty damn funny, once they have to establish a "plot" (something about Dr. Evil flooding the world). It really picks up once Dr. Evil and Mini-Me are in prison, singing "It's a Hard-Knock Life". Before that though, the movie is pretty lame. After that point we get to the funny stuff. 20 year old movie newcomer (and Destiny's Child's singer) Beyoncé Knowles provides the eye candy as Foxxy Cleopatra, a sassy, 70s Blaxploitation spoof, who somehow hooks up with Austin to fight evil. Michael Caine is just great as Austin's spy dad and Myers adds a 4th character under his belt, playing the title character of Goldmember, a dude from Holland with junk of gold.You may think, "Wow! This sounds great." And it does, but when you actually see, it, you're wondering why you're not laughing as hard as you should. The first movie was fresh and new. It was a small movie that didn't make much money in the theatres, earning a loyal video following. It was a clever, fish-out-of-water movie, sometimes poignant and most importantly, fall-down funny. The second, despite its rehashed jokes, somehow was funnier than the first, except without the newness of the original. But fans were so starved for new Austin material, they goggled it up. The third now comes and we realize that the freshness is gone. It's not new anymore. Sure, the gags are there, but the soul isn't. While not up to the standards of the first two in the series, Goldmember is still pretty funny, and is worth seeing if you're a fan. Just don't expect it to collect many converts to the series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will be enjoyed by Austin fans, but it's the weakest of the three films.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't worry this review does not contain any spoilers! I got a chance to see a special screening which was presented by the Just for laughs festival in Montréal. The best parts were with old characters from the two first films. Unfortunately, the new ones (Nigel Powers, Foxxy Cleopatra, Goldmember) were not as memorable and brought nothing new to the film. The movie had it's funny moments, but they were far apart or repetitive from the two first films. The part that I enjoyed the less is when we learn something about Austin and Dr. Evil. IMO that that was completely unnecessary and just didn't work. I also was hoping to see some more jokes with Austin in the whole disco scene of the 70's. But that was not to be. Even the rivalry between Scott and mini-me could have been better and longer. As for the story, it seemed unfocussed, with to many ideas, probably from the fact that they were too many characters. One could almost say that they could have made two movies with all of these ideas. Overall it's clear that it's the weakest of the three films. Still, for those who likes the two first movies, you will probably still enjoy this ones (just as I did). For the others don't bother watching this one! I certainly hope that they don't make an Austin Powers 4. Because in the end of this film, they kind of show you where they would go with it, and it doesn't look like a good place.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Goldmember = Not So Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All of the early reviews I read for GOLDMEMBER were positive, so I was psyched about going to a special WNFZ radio station sponsored sneak preview of the latest installment of AUSTIN POWERS. Then I saw it. *sigh* It was really, really not as good as THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME. Okay, granted, there were about six (maybe seven) really good laughs. They were just few and far between.I know it seems rather shallow to base an opinion of a movie on how many times you laugh, but with the AUSTIN POWERS franchise, you have to. Besides, IT'S A COMEDY! Think of THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME. You didn't watch it for the incredible plot development. (And if you did, I'm really, really sorry.) You saw it to laugh. And I did. I laughed so hard my sides hurt when I left.But this time around, we've seen all of these jokes before. The musical numbers. The "That looks like a giant--[penis reference]." They're just kind of hackneyed. I wanted something new. The second AUSTIN POWERS had more laughs because it took the humor in different (although more disgusting) directions. It's like Mike Myers just took his last script, changed some wording, and threw it into the Hollywood movie-making machine.I will give the movie this: the opener is great. The cameos are hysterical. Then you get in to the rest of the movie, and it's like The M &amp; M Show (Mike Myers--get it?). Also, it's sloppy. And that's where the laughs fall flat. They're not even trying anymore. It feels like Mike Myers is too aware of his ability to create humor. He mugs at the camera as if to say, "It doesn't matter what I do--you WILL laugh." Well, I defy you, Mike Myers!!! I just can't laugh in the presence of comic arrogance. Unless it's my own.</fullReview>

Mike Myers outdid himself, playing four roles (as opposed to two in "International Man of Mystery" and three in "The Spy Who Shagged Me." I suppose he'll play five parts in the next sequel.

		<fullReview>I too went to a screening of this film and its not nearly as good as the first two. Austin Powers I was good and had the vibrant ideas. AP 2 was good but was a little thin. AP 3 is OK and was overall pretty flat. The problem with this movie is that its the same used material as the first two films. The first and second films were both pretty much identical the only difference was AP I was funnier and more creative AP 2 did just well enough to manage, AP 3 is weak. But don't worry some things about it are funny, others are just old rehashed crap. Hopefully this is the last AP film for a while they need to give about 5 years before they make a new one to get some fresh comedy. **1/2 out of *****.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Goldmember is the third installment of the James Bond parody series with Mike Myers as the befuddled spy. The major casting addition is Beyonce, as Foxxy Cleopatra, in full afro wig , looking a lot like Pam Grier from Foxy Brown. She is an FBI agent working under as a disco singer. This time, Dr. Evil intends to use a laser beam to melt the polar ice caps and flood the world. Meanwhile, Powers is being knighted, and about to hook up with twins, Fook Mi and Fook Yu, when he hears of his father's kidnapping by Goldmember; a variation of Goldfinger. He and Foxxy team up to find his dad. They encounter a new villain, a sumo wrestler named Fat Bastard; played by Myers in a fat suit. We also are introduced to Austin's father, Nigel, and Dr. Evil's son, Scott. Mini-Me, the midget from the first two films is also back. Myers is very funny and adding Beyonce and Michael Caine to the absurdity, makes it worth the ride.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe it's not that good as first two parts but it's still very funny. Some jokes were already used in previous parts, but it was made a little differently, so it still was very funny. There were also some new jokes, in the opening we see Tom Cruise playing Austin, that was kinda funny. As in previous films there was some Dr. Evil and Scott Evil father-son relationship scenes, maybe it wasn't that good as in previous films (like when Dr. Evil and Scott were at Jerry Springer's show in The Spy Who Shagged Me), but still some moments were really funny. This film spoofs not only James Bond movies, but some other movies too, like The Silence of the Lambs or Godzilla.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thankfully the End of Austin Powers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just as one would expect, the "Austin Powers" movies got lamer with each showing. The first was alright: it wasn't the best comedy in the world, but at least Dr. Evil was amusing to listen to. The second catapulted Mini-Me into the pop culture landscape for a time, but was a passable effort with not much that was funny. The last "Austin Powers" movie (so far) is the worst. Mike Myers really strains himself to make the characters work, with little success. The jokes and writing were dreadfully uninspired and lacking in any form of wit (except for the final scene with the fat guy; I won't ruin it, and that's why I awarded an extra star to "Goldmember."). Very boring. Michael Caine doesn't really do much as Austin's father; not an interesting character in the least. Austin is boring, and Dr. Evil and Mini-Me doing hip-hop in prison looks so trite and unoriginal that I wonder why people who write these movies make oodles of cash. The character of Goldmember sucked. His accent and quips were the stupidest things I've ever heard. You can probably create better comedy in your sleep, and it would be better than the character Myers has created.This movie also has the most blatant product placement I've ever seen. It's already bad enough that there are TV commercials for cars and chewing gum before the previews; why do we need advertising IN the movies. Yeah, the movie makers stand to make a fortune, but it really shows how utterly crass movies have become.Steven Spielburg, Gwenyth Paltrow, John Travolta and Britney Spears make cameos, showing how in love with itself and out-of-touch with reality Hollywood is. Let's hope that this film is the last we'll see of Austin Powers for some time.</fullReview>

Actually, wait, there is "drama" but it goes on for about 5 seconds and then turns into a hilarious gag! Mike Myers is a complete genius! From Wayne's World to this, let me catch my breath! Please! Most comedy series of a great hit and then it heels with a bunch desperate boring movies, such as American Pie! American Pie #1 is one of the funniest movies i have ever seen! However all the rest aren't at all! Another series of movies (just 2 movies) is Bruce and Evan Almighty! Bruce Almighty almost made me drop a lung! Evan Almighty was extraordinarily dull!There is just something different about each Austin Powers movie, they all have their own memorable moments/reputation. However other movie series' like American Pie, and the Almighty series depend on one thing, the funniest most memorable moment in the first film and stretch it out way to far!In conclusion, i am the teacher and Austin Powers gets a HUGE A+! And an extra A for extra credit we weren't expecting!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The weakest entry to the Austin Power's series to me by far.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked the first two Austin Powers' movies quite a bit. Not so much with this one, this one was okay as most of it we have seen before. Granted, there was a humorous opening I did not expect and the closing was the same, but the stuff in the middle was just same ol same ol. The only two new facets in this entry are Michael Caine as Austin's dad which is somewhat funny and Goldmember a new villain who is not funny at all. Also, Austin has a new girl and Beyonce is the weakest of the Austin girls by far. So the story, of course Dr. Evil has a plan involving Goldmember, kidnapping Austin's dad and a new doomsday device all doing most of the same jokes from part one and two. Sure some of it is still a bit funny, but it is also old too. The story is not as fluent either as it goes here and there making jokes at everything and not seeming to be as well put together as the first two were. Then there is the revelation at the end that makes little sense especially considering the previous two movies. So just about everything in this one is weaker than the previous two movies. Nothing really is better here and for the most parts you are just revisiting jokes from the previous installments as well. So in the end if this is the last one of the series it goes off on a rather weak note, and I have not heard anything about a sequel anytime in the future and how this one ended I would not think it possible anyway so expect a good chuckle here and there, but nothing new really worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Third Austin Powers spy-spoof is nearly a winner for Mike Myers, playing the would-be suave International Man of Mystery once again pitted against Dr. Evil, who has hatched a plot to flood the world. Evil is now in cahoots with Goldmember, a power-mad genius from 1975 who sports a golden phallus. Surprise star-cameos and lots of funny raunch, yet the film still can't top the naughty-but-innocent initial entry in this series, which looks positively sedated next to this installment and the misguided second, "The Spy Who Shagged Me". Still, "Goldmember" has imaginative set-pieces, great music and some completely inane but delightfully executed laughs. Pop-star Beyoncé Knowles is a natural on-screen playing Powers' sidekick Foxxy Cleopatra, but Michael Caine (as Austin's father) never gets a great scene. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mike Myers suffers from an unsteadying case of star bloat in this third installment of his Austin Powers spy-spoof series, banking on the fact that his fans will want to see even more of him than they have in the prior films. They did, judging from the box office "Goldmember" got, but in retrospect this seems more a coyote-woman comedy, something you chuckle at in the theater but leaves you feeling ill and ashamed the next morning.Austin Powers (Myers) is hot on the trail of a new bad guy named Goldmember (Myers again), who has kidnapped Austin's father Nigel (Michael Caine) as part of a vague scheme for flooding the world hatched by that dastardly supervillian Dr. Evil (more Myers) and assisted by Fat Bastard (still more Myers).Any film that features four times as much Mike Myers as Mike Caine is leaking bad mojo. "Goldmember" certainly lacks balance. From the lame cameos by Britney Spears and the Osbournes that speak to how old this Austin installment quickly got, to the goofy close-ups of Myers dragging out punchlines in one of his many roles, "Goldmember" is less a comedy and more a celebration of how big a star Myers has gotten to be, an impression deepened by a DVD commentary track with Myers and director Jay Roach.Roach gushes over Myers' on-screen performance and laughs at his lame jokes like a spineless courtier. Was this what happened on-set?"Oh, Jay, I'm going to do this thing with Goldmember where I eat my own skin and quote song titles from the '70s, after which I say the name of the artist who performed the song in a lower voice, because the only thing funnier than saying "That's the way, uh-huh, I like it" is saying "KC &amp; The Sunshine Band" right after.""Brilliant, Mike, um, Mr. Myers. If Peter Sellers was still alive, he'd die of jealousy. You're like Chaplin, only more poignant and athletically gifted. Um, you haven't left me off the points on DVD sales, have you?"Goldmember is Myers' first weak character in the Austin Powers series, a chance for Myers to don another disguise, busk his way through another accent, and make another play for Sellers' comedy crown. Yet the most he can manage is roller-dancing in wooden clogs and saying lines like "I'm Dutch. Isn't that weird?" He sucks up a lot of the script, and most of what's left goes to Myers' other characters, none of whom are developed much further. Austin has Daddy issues while Dr. Evil performs a rap number with his clone Mini-Me that seems to belong on the MTV Music Awards, not here.Caine seems wasted telling Viagra jokes as an unreconstructed version of Austin and revealing his hatred for two things, "all people who are intolerant of other cultures, and the bloody Dutch." He's AWOL for most of the movie, and when he reappears at the end, it's for such a lame scene you wish he had stayed gone.Verne Troyer is great as Mini-Me, though, the one character Myers seems to respect as much as his own, and Troyer delivers with broad and witty pantomimes. Beyonce Knowles is the best newcomer as blaxplotation queen Foxxy Cleopatra. Though she's horribly underwritten as the film raises the idea of spoofing the 1970s before dropping it, Knowles shows off some nice comedy chops along with a drop-dead cinched waistline.Myers, on the other hand, seems to be getting fatter, especially around the head. Perhaps Roach needs to stage an intervention. If he can direct Barbra Streisand, maybe he can pull Myers back to create another Powers film as funny and charming as the first two.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mike Myers, Beyonce Knowles, Verne Troyer, Robert Wagner, Mindy Sterling, Fred Savage, Seth Green and Michael Caine. Special guest appearances by Tom Cruise, Gwyneth Paltrow, Steven Spielberg, Brittany Spears, Quincy Jones, Burt Bacharach, Elvis Costello, Kevin Spacey, Danny Devito, John Travolta, Ozzy Osbourne, Sharon Osbourne, Kelly Osbourne, Jack Osbourne, Clint Howard and Rob Lowe.Oh Boy.....they were really off. This is just a continuation of sex symbol Austin Powers, and this was just bad. Michael Caine plays Nigel Powers, Austin's father. Myers now plays four characters, two of them uneeded. Golmember is his worst character to date, and also the sickest(he eats his own skin). One of the second movie's character's Fat B*stard shows up as a sumo wrestler in a part that should be a cameo. Unfortunately, they stretch it out into an extremely crude 6 minute part. Verne Troyer is Mini Me, who is probably the most amusing character. Several stars show up in cameos. The opening is about the making of Goldmember the movie(in a movie) starring Tom Cruise as Austin Powers, Gwyneth Paltrow as Dixie Normous, Kevin Spacey as Dr. Evil, Danny Devito as Mini Me, John Travolta as Goldmember and directed by Steven Spielberg. Avoid this movie please. It's not good. I did like the first one and the second one OK though.My rating-D(4 out of 10 would be an F, but that's not how my reviews work) Rated PG-13 for strong crude humor, some pretty mild sexual content, campy violence and some language. 88 minutes long.(wait till after the credits for Brittany Spears and Burt Bacharach)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is simply not funny! Not even remotely. Its a series of cliché after cliché and the punch lines are immediately predictable and therefore dull. The biggest flaws are in the characters. Here you have a film where so much of the comedic appeal depends on its characters, yet the characters are in fact the same ones from the previous film and the one before that; characters we have over familiarized ourselves with.This style of comedy is a little dated. The first one was hysterical and the second almost, but this one just does not work, not so much because it doesn't want to but because there is no contextual connection with the audience unless your a 13 year old and you happen to like Britney Spears.If you're an intelligent person however and you actually do have a sense of humor, you will just be thoroughly insulted by how someone over there in Hollywood actually believes he can make someone like you laugh.In short, its nothing more than an ineffectual pile of rubbish. Oh yeah and its quite boring too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Myers goes to the well one more time in the third and one supposes (hopes?) final entry in the Austin Powers saga. The first two were some of the funniest film-making of the last 20 years, the second getting fantastic mileage out of reconditioning much of the schtick from the first. The mojo is pretty much gone by #3, which even the presence of Caine (in the conceptually-inspired role of neglectful dad) can't save. Lack of chemistry between the leads, not enough creative effort, concept worn thin? You got me. Any time one of the primary running jokes centers on a character's large facial mole you know the cupboard has run bare. If there's a fourth movie Myers will play all the roles and the credits will be real short. 6/10 for the (much fewer) gags that work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Austin Should Have Stopped At One</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really enjoyed the first Austin Powers (Mike Myers) movie, Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery. It was fresh, even though it was a retread of the James Bond movies, but more importantly it was funny. It was funny because a 60s swinger was in the politically correct 90s and have a very hard time fitting in. The second movie, Spy Who Shagged Me, was not as good as the first, mainly because it takes Powers back to the 60s, losing it's primary source of humor. Now, we have this train wreck of a movie, Austin Powers in Goldmember, a movie that looks like a boat who has lost it's rudder. The only interesting character in the movie is Austin Powers' father, played by Michael Caine, but is sorely underused. The Powers' babe of this movie is Beyonce, playing Foxxy Cleopatra in a Pam Grier-esquire homage to the blaxploitation movies of the 70s, though I do not remember a skin-eating Dutch man running Studio 54 in New York, or what ever the movie was parodying in that scene. The movie almost looks like there are too many ideas crammed into the 94 minutes of running time. The highlight of the movie is the first 5 minutes, when there are surprise cameos playing familiar characters, but the joy and surprise is done early, and the movie goes downhill from there. I do not know why Myers thinks it's cute to have Dr. Evil do silly musical numbers, or why mole jokes are funny. So much is wasted by the last two Austin Powers movies that it's really a shame. Sure there are funny moments. My favorite was when Godzilla is crashing through Tokyo (don't ask, it's not that important), but the laughs are few and far between. If there is a forth Austin Powers movie, let's hope that they get back to the basics, Austin Powers trying to figure out where he is in life when living in the 1990s or early 2000s, still trying to figure out how Liberracce became gay.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not an Austin Powers hater. The first two rank as two of the funniest films ever made. Mike Myers is a certified genius. However, this third installment is as bad of film as I have ever seen. It is a bogus sellout from the start. Cameos everywhere, but not one even slightly amusing. Michael Caine is dry. The Beyonce girl plays in a role that does not have one funny part. The Goldmember character is funny. Myers tries in his other three roles, but nothing looks planned out. The film has a rushed look and feel. Half way through I started to wonder if it was just me or was this film as funny as jock itch? I have a great sense of humor and I love silly humor as much as anybody. However, this is not silly comedy, this is poorly written crap in search of a paycheck. The skit has run its course, let it die. Time for Mike Myers to move on, Lord knows he is talented enough to come up with something new. I just wish he had come up with something new for this poor film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Totally weak, unfunny and disgusting Austin sequel made me realize i actually detested the series.It relies on racial stereotyping and hatred. Every character is a racial stereotype:Austin = BritishMustafa = Middle EastFoxxy Cleopatra = African Americans, referencing blaxploitation chick Cleopatra JonesFat Bastard = Scottish, as well as over-weight people - how matureFrau Farbissina = GermansFook Yu = Nondescript AsiansAs well as many other minor characters - but the strangest, most disgusting blow of all was Goldmember himself: a rollerskating, be-freckled (like a disease covering his skin), orange haired, leotard-wearing man who picks scabs (or dry skin or something) off his body and eats it. He's supposed to be, what was it, Swedish, danish? Which random culture shall we pick to make a joke of?So racial misunderstandings do not equal comedy.But the greatest thing wrong with the third Austin Powers, is its just more of the same. Same dorky unfunny jokes which don't work as spoof because nobody has seen the original spy movies they were originally supposed to be taking off.3/10. For the opening sequence of the faux movie with star cameos. Otherwise, monotonous, repetitive and ridiculous stereotyping "comedy." Plus, Beyonce can not act.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really liked the first Austin Powers movie.This one,I detested.It's terrible.Myers has lost the plot in every way here.Dr Evil goes from being an inept but vaguely cool and smart mouthed super-villain to a childish buffoon.Totally unfunny moments like the "mole" joke are allowed to go on interminably."Goldmember" is a hopeless villain,he's just repellent,and his appearances are more embarrassing than funny.The film clearly had a lot spent on it,and the effects and sets are great- if only there had been a decent script and better direction and editing. Instead Myers opts for bottom of the barrel vulgarity,which can be fun,but not when it sounds like its been put together by sniggering 10 year olds.I believe some potentially clever scenes were edited out,such as one where Goldmember's hench-women shoot at Powers and co, and fail to be able to hit them even at a ridiculously close range.Pity it went, as "Goldmember" desperately needs some infusions of satire and wit.The only slightly amusing moment for me,is the scene where Powers chases the hapless Mini Me round a room hitting him (and that borders on the sadistic).Michael Caine appears to be sleepwalking rather than acting.The ending,contradicting information we have been given about Dr. Evil in the first movie,seems to ruin the whole franchise.On the evidence of this movie it's a good thing too.But I suppose Myers could revive it with a "prequel" about Austin and Dr Evil in the 60's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sometimes the comedy is inventive and sometimes its derivative</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Rating: **1/2 out of ****.The third film in a movie trilogy is most of the time the worst. Austin Powers in Goldmember definitely proves that point. This is not a bad movie but it clearly shows in areas that Mike Myers was running out of ideas.The first two Austin Powers were enjoyable and fresh. Mike Myers clearly showed that he was talented. Goldmember is watchable but not always fresh. The viewer will clearly see that some jokes from the second film are reused here and they are not funny this time around. The behind the tent joke is there (when it looks like Austin is doing something nasty but really is not) and a boob satellite joke (Replacing the penis rocket from the second one) are not really funny here.Then again there is somethings inventive here. There is a clever bit when Austin is talking to the head of a Japanese corporation and the subtitles are cut off by an object to make it look like something dirty is being said. That was particularly funny. The beginning is certainly inventive and very cool and funny.Mike Myers gave 2 performances in the first Austin Powers(Austin and Dr. Evil) and 3 performances in the second (Austin, Dr. Evil, and Fat Bastard). Myers is trying to outdo himself here by giving 4 performances by adding a new character called Goldmember. Alot of people said he was really pushing it when he added Fat Bastard in the second film but I thought Fat Bastard offered his share of laughs. However, Goldmember is a mockery of Dutch people that seems more offensive and irritating than funny. Besides Goldmember, I mostly enjoyed watching Myers.Beyonce Knowles is the new girl alongside Austin. Knowles is not bad but she is not as good as Hurley and Graham were. Michael Caine is fine as Austins Dad but the surprise ending when he reveals a "shocker" is lame.Despite some derivative comedy and a lame ending, Goldmember is worth watching. I dont know about an Austin 4 though. This series seems to be running out of ideas.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a big fan of the first 2 Austin Powers movies. They are great very funny. So i was really excited to see the 3rd one. So i went to see it when it hit theaters. When the movie was over i stood up and the first thing i thought was, "thats 2 hours of my life i'll never get back". This movie was horrible. I can't believe anyone actually liked it. The jokes were gross and stupid. And whats up with all the cameo appearences? I thought that was really gay, and just the whole plot of the movie was stupid. Mike Meyers isn't a good actor by any means, but he did good in Austin Powers 1 and 2. I hope that Meyers doesn't do another one, i know he's talked about it. But geez this was so bad, i can't even imagine how crappy a 4th one would be.</fullReview>

Imagine a motion picture where every single one of those boring, juvenile, and unfunny jokes were sandwiched together. No thanks. "Potty Humor: The Movie" might have been a better title, as there is little to no plot, and what plot there is, only exists so Mike Myers can put as many double entendres and penis and bathroom jokes in as possible. It's like Myers and everyone just sat in a big room trying to think up jokes, and one would occasionally raise his hand and say "Hey guys!--I--I got a good one, listen to this! So, like, there's a guy, right? And--uh--here's what's funny, the funny thing is,y'all ready for this,he URINATES! AH HAHAHAHA!", while everyone else laughed with him. It's sad, really. I seriously think that a freshman in high school would be able to write a funnier script in half the time it took for these guys to write an hour and a half of fart jokes. &lt;Yawn&gt; we can only pray that there will be no number 4.</fullReview>

I really thought that this film would be even funnier than the first two, but this was really a big disappointment. While watching the previews, I can't even wait to see this film. When I finally saw it, I wish that I should have waited for it to come out on video. Mike Myers is one terrific actor and one funny comedian, but despite his talented acting skills, he himself couldn't even save this film. Beyonce is a very beautiful, sexy talented musician, but she really should stay in the music business. Even with the cameos of some of the big names in hollywood, did nothing to help this rather poor, trashy film. This film only proves that most sequels to great movies do not survive. If they ever make another installment of Austin Powers, let this be a lesson to all parties involve. Another poor film, and Austin Powers might not even survive.4 stars out of 10</fullReview>

Unfortunately they apparently felt so confident in this film that they let a 6th grader finish writing the rest of the film during lunch period. After the first 15 minutes this film turns to witless toilet humor so un-funny you'll wish Gallagher would show up and smash something.

		<fullReview>"Austin Powers: Goldmember" tries to cap the successes of its predecessors by bringing back some now-classic characters and recycling old formulas --- but it doesn't quite work.SNL veteran Mike Myers returns as Austin Powers, the role that propelled him into the media's attention. However, "Goldmember" lacks the staying power of the first two films, and seems to be trying too hard to convince us that it's a funny movie. Given, the film did provide some laughs (especially from the portly Fat Bastard), but the funny moments are overshadowed by completely odd and embarassing moments that harass the experience. The dialogue this time around isn't as sharp as the previous installments, and the comedy is forced and unnatural at times --- plus, Michael Caine as Power's father is just about the worst casting call of the year..."Austin Powers: Goldmember" isn't a horrible flick, and, sure, it'll provide you with some laughs. Unfortunately, I didn't quite enjoy the experience. If Myers wants to stay on top of his game, he needs to ditch the old "Austin Powers" franchise and move on to new things.For a sequel to be good, it needs to bring us back all the great elements that were in the first films, but also bring something new and fresh into the mix that will make it a worthwile watch, and not just a re-hash of prior successes... By really not giving us anything new, "Austin Powers: Goldmember" fails to bring us anything worth watching. Skip this dull re-hash and stick to watching the previous installments.</fullReview>

This time the titled character (Mike Myers) must go back in time to 1975 to rescue his father (Michael Caine, who will obviously take any part offered to him) from arch-nemesis Dr. Evil (Myers again) and Goldmember (yet again Myers), another in the ridiculous line of disgusting and unfunny bad guys. Beyonce Knowles of "Destiny's Child" fame does admittedly shine as the Powers-girl this time.

There was no plot and the scenes were haphazardly thrown together. The script was downright uninspired, and with Austin moving to the 70s, his trademark phrases were kept to a minimum. The 70s basically sucked anyway, music-wise, movie-wise, and the only bright spot was the day I was born. Kind of like that lame mole joke, which captured this movie in a nutshell as the brain-dead movie of the year, the feel nothing movie of the year, and a career-ender for Fred Savage (if he still has one).

Mike Meyers is tired, though has his moments as Austin, and Caine did decently well in a few scenes, but the movie as a whole failed. BTW, my tiredness upon viewing, accompanied by a hope that at some point the movie would improve, are the only things that kept me from fast-forwarding or stopping the movie. Ugh.

		<fullReview>Austin powers Goldmember is probably the worst film of 2002,with a poor story and the introduction of useless characters I was hugely disappointed. What made the first two films so good were the jokes and the humour of the characters and that you always knew what to expect but at the same time anything could happen. The third film is full of bad characters, one of them being the lead female character foxy cleopatra which is a badly written and basically pointless character who has no need to be in the film. The new villain goldmember is a very poor and unfunny character who also adds nothing to the film. The humour that was in the first and second film is gone and its now a struggle to be funny. The characters of doctor evil and Austin powers are destroyed at the end with a foolish twist and the character of powers father is rushed into the story. The only real funny parts of the film are at the beginning and end with the chance to se other major actors in the role of the lead characters. If your easily amused his is the film for you but I strongly suggest that if you don't want to damage your views on the first two films you should stay away from this film.</fullReview>

Beyonce Knowles is Austin's lady sidekick in this one. She is no Liz Hurley, Baby. Myers should have `knowles' better and it should have been `destined' in selecting someone else for the part.

Mike myers did a great job writing the scripts and Jay Roach completes him beautifully by directing every word and every sentence so magically.Mike Myers is undoubtly one of the funniest comidian alive and his sense of humor is enchanting to any sort of viewer.I've seen this movie 3 times and I must say: "no one can make me laugh like that but Myers!" I warmly suggest you watch this movie I promise you you'll love it.I gave "Goldmember" 10/10, point for each time I cried out of laughter! :)By the way, try watching "Wayne's World" too!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Austin Powers reclaims his mojo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Goldmember is really much better than the first Austin Powers sequel, entitled The Spy who shagged me. Although there are some similar jokes, this one gets off much better. It seems that there are some standard sort of jokes, sequences or quotes that have been used in previous Austin Powers movies and will be used again in upcoming Austin Powers movies. Things like 'the laugh' by Dr.Evil and his crew, the 'shush thing' between Dr.Evil and his son Scotty or Austin's rambling when he finds something so amusing he must tell three jokes about it. All of this is very much like the standard lines and or fragments there are in James Bond films. The typical: 'Bond, James Bond' or the exploding stuff in Q's lab or even the Miss Moneypenny dialogues. Nonetheless, this film is enjoyable and exciting, more then it's predecessor and even a bit more than the original. The cause for that, is that there are more jokes that will make you laugh like an idiot (because the joke is idiotic) and because the actors are much better than in The spy who shagged me. Contrary to that film and very much in line with International man of Mystery, the casting has chosen for quality actors and actresses. There is no young number two and no Felicity Shagwell, who were not good and pretty but shallow respectively. Rather we have Foxxy Cleopatra and Nigel Powers. Beyoncé Knowles from Destiny's Child (Foxxy) succeeds in being Foxxy and in portraying a good and likeable character, whereas Michael Caine (Nigel Powers) also succeeds in portraying a good daddy Powers. Verne Troyer (Mini-Me) is even better than he was in The spy who shagged me. He was good before, but he is just hilarious this time around. Mike Myers (Austin/Goldmember/Fat Bastard/Dr.Evil) is as good as ever. I mean he is just great, making silly faces and putting on foreign accents. In spite of the returning characters and the new ones, there are quite a few celebrity cameo's, none of which were annoying by the way. If that alone is not reason enough to watch this film, I don't know what is. If even Britney Spears, the queen of actresses (smirk), does not succeed in f..king up this film , nobody will!!! I mean she is not too bad on the eye, but acting is nothing for her. That girl (woman maybe) can't so much as sing a note properly (unlike miss Knowles), so how can one expect her to act even average. She cannot even perform average in her own profession (or is her profession not singing, but rather walking around with very few, tight clothes???). In addition to the very good acting (this is a spoof you know!), there is lots of variation, for there are moments of pity, moments of wonder, moments of stupidity and a many moments of laughter. I can't wait for the fourth in the series (I know there will be one), but what will it be called?7,5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a must-see if only for the opening skit. The celebrity cameos are hilarious! The rest of the movie was pretty good, although there was an overuse of toilet humour. One thing that annoyed me was the cameo by the Osbournes; do they have to be in everything? I just don't find them funny. Overall, it's a good movie to see if you just want a laugh.P.S.

Now if you either hated this movie or not you gotta admit, the beginning is just amazing and the best bit in the whole movie. I was in hysterics.

		<fullReview>What a waste of 30 bucks! I cannot believe how bad this movie was considering how clever the first two were. In fact, the first two films are so much a part of my life that I regularly quote them in my daily interactions (pathetic as that is).I went into Goldmember wanting to love it and what was presented was (painfully) recycled jokes with a few bellylaughs (due to the occasional original joke in-between). It's obvious that the whole group who put out this turkey got lazy, full of themselves and self-indulgent. I swear, if one more person mugged for the camera, I was going to scream. And by the way, whoever edited this thing should be shot because it was choppy and flowed about as well as nitro-glycerin in an earthquake.I hope this is the last edition of Austin Powers because it's obvious that the franchise has run its course. Save your money. I would say don't even bother with the DVD.Feh! Pee-yew!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When the original Austin Powers came out, I was pleasantly surprised. The movie was amusing, the parodies were well executed and the comedy was spontaneous. Most importantly, the movie had a sense of flow. Watching the second Austin Powers was more of a chore, with lots of uncomfortable lags and plenty of holes (Heather Graham was terrible in that movie).When the previews came out for the third installment, I was reluctant. After all, I had remembered how bad the second movie was, and the casting of Beyonce Knowles sent up all sorts of alarms off in my head. However, I was swayed by the positive reviews from the mainstream critics. I put aside my prejudice, paid my $7.00 and saw the movie. Boy, I wish I could have that $7.00 back.This movie was so slow and beyond unfunny, I was in a state of disbelief for about two hours after it ended. I couldn't believe that someone could allow such a rancid product to hit the movie theaters. People can defend this movie left and right, but the fact is, no one in the theater was laughing. I can't imagine anyone who isn't ridiculously biased could have possibly enjoyed this movie. I suppose it is all about money. I wonder how many critics the studio bought with all those product placements.My grade: 2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After 2 minutes I knew this movie was going to be bad but I lingered in the hope that it would get better. it did not ... in fact the bathroom jokes got worse and the humor was awful. The first Austin Powers movie was good but after that it just keeps getting worse. Even the other people in the audience which numbered about 75 hardly laughed at the movie so I know it just was not me. Probably the most creative part of the movie is the opening and then it falls flat on its face.There is not even an apparition of what really is the theme. The movie was just done up to make money with no real passion in the acting OR creative aspect of really making a funny movie.This has got to be one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gets hilarious towards the end, but overdoses on the crude humor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now, I must admit the second "Austin Powers" movie did contain a hell of a lot of crude and sexual humor, but it often worked and produced hilarious results. In other words, it wasn't cheap and pathetic, like many of the gags in this film.The movie starts out with a bang, with many surprise celebrity cameos popping up. There are other cameos that pop up throughout the course of the film, and I felt they brightened up this otherwise mediocre comedy.Every other gag in "Goldmember" involves farting, crapping or genitalia. It's a miracle it earned a PG-13. Other than a hilarious rap duet of "Hard Knocks Life" between Dr. Evil and Mini-Me, in which they wear gold chains and party with half-naked women, the first half is pretty weak. Most of it is spent trying to tie up loose ends, giving us backstories of Austin and Dr. Evil, even going as far as showing them as roommates back in college. Some of the plot is just plain silly.Every time someone asks me about this movie, the same question comes up: "Can Beyonce act?" The answer is yes. She's a fine actress, and I wouldn't be surprised to see her in more and more movies. Beyonce's acting wasn't the problem; it was the writing. But to be on the bright side, the film strengthens towards the end with some hilarious bits, including one where Austin stands on Mini-Me's shoulders and they pretend to be one person. He gets summoned to deliver a urine sample. Funny. Then him and Mini-Me go behind a screen, and it appears in silhouette like Austin is masturbating. Very funny. And there's another recycled bit from the second movie, where everyone looks up a spaceship shaped like a pair of boobs.I liked the first "Austin Powers," I loved the second one, but damn it it's time to retire the franchise. The first movie set up the joke, the second one played along with it and now the joke is dead and Mike Myers is succumbing to a barrage of cheap toilet humor. The "Wayne's World" franchise never tired out, because there were only TWO movies.The character of Goldmember isn't that funny. His running gag is that he talks funny English (just not funny enough to make me laugh). He also collects his dead skin and licks it. Disgusting, definitely. Funny, far from it. And I really wish they could've cast someone other than Michael Caine to play Austin's father. Not that his performance is flawed; it's just I find it almost vomit-inducing to watch an incredible actor making bad penis jokes.Is there gonna be an "Austin Powers 4"? I hope not. There are some cases, like in "Lethal Weapon" series, in which a movie is strong enough to spawn a couple of good sequels. This is not one of those cases.My score: 6 (out of 10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think it's safe to say that if you liked "Austin Powers International Man of Mystery" and "Austin Powers The Spy Who Shagged Me" then you'll probably enjoy this film as well. I'd have to say that I liked this film just as much as the other two films.The story is pretty much what you'd expect, and pretty similar to the first two films, but that is to be expected. There is a lot of regurgitated comedy from the first two films, but at the same time there is a lot of original comedy that just had me busting up.The cast is fantastic, Mike Myers is a comedic genius!!! And Jay Roach is a superb director! There are some films that you just don't want another director to touch, and I think this is one of those films. Michael Caine, Seth Green, Beyonce Knowles, Robert Wagner and Verne Troyer are just great in this film! I think it's great that Michael Caine agreed to do this film, and quite appropriate in that Mike Myers parodies some of Michael Caine's past films. I definitely have respect for actors that do diverse roles. There are quite a few cameo appearances in this film, but I won't mention any of them as not to ruin the surprise for you (although, if you're reading the review on this site you probably already know about them).I thought "Austin Powers in Goldmember" was a great addition to the Austin Powers franchise. I'm not really sure how they would do a 4th installment, but you never know. I hope you enjoy the film as much as I do. Thanks for reading,-Chris</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me say that I really enjoyed the first two Austin Powers movies, I own both of them. They were fresh and very funny stories. Myers was just incredible, one of the truly great comedic performances of all time. However, this third installment is just plain terrible! Can you say "milk it"? Well here they have milked it bone-dry. I cannot begin to describe all of the problems with this pathetic film, but here are a few. There is no story, or at least not much of one. Too many worthless cameos. Speilberg and Cruise don't make this movie funny by just being there. Brittany Speers is only funny when she tries to be serious. Paltrow has a cameo for no reason at all. Worthless additions to the cast. Michael Caine and Foxy Cleopatra do not do anything approaching comedy during the whole film. Moreover, the movie barely features at all the supporting characters of Dr. Evil's gang from the first two movies. Those were the people that made this series a hit. There is nothing that was good about the first two films in this one. This film looks like a rushed, slapped together, piece of garbage. There is no heart or brain. Many parts of the movie were very flat and looked rather stupid. Often, the film has to resort to crude sexual anatomy jokes for cheap laughs. I did laugh at some parts of this film. Myers is one of the most gifted comedians ever, you have to laugh at some stuff. Moreover, I thought his Goldmember character was funny and not used enough. But overall, this movie plays like a bad series of SNL skits. There is a part in the film were Ozzy (yet another worthless cameo) complains that this movie is just rehashed and reused jokes. You know what, he was right! * out of ****. Put it to rest, Mike.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never left a movie in the middle of it, until now. This is perhaps one of the worst movies i have ever seen. I liked the first one because it was original, and could be inappropriate and raunchy without actually being bad. In this film, they stop at nothing to get a laugh, and for me none of them worked and only made me cringe in disgust. They had no problem in saying "balls" and "nuts", and Fat Bastard describing how he left a piece of excrement and a bad smell in his sumo rag. I say plotless because i never actually saw a plot emerge through the thirty minutes i viewed. I suppose there was a plot after i left, but that is a little late for me. During the 30 minutes i watched the film, I saw 2 families leave with their childern. I'm not sure if they were leaving because it was too bad for their kids, or it was too bad in general, either way I wouldn't be surprised.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just got back from seeing this one and I have to say this is the first movie this year to completely disappoint me. It's just completely lacking anything to keep you interested. Sure all the people are back and all the jokes are in there that you would expect but it's just not funny this time.Now I expected to see a lot of the same things that were in the first two movies in this series. The Dr. Evil vs Scott game where Scott tries to talk and Dr. Evil tries to make him shut up, The Fat Bastard fixation on bodily functions and excrement jokes, and even the now classic Dr. Evil contacting the "World Government" and asking for a ridiculous amount of money to ransom the world were all right where I expected them to be.I'm not annoyed that they repeated all of this and I don't think that's the reason it wasn't funny this time around. I just think that on every one of the running gags they blew it. None of the actors seemed to be trying very hard and in almost every case the timing was off badly.The story is like some sad rip-off of the second one with less thought put into making it. The opening credits are funnier than anything else in the picture which makes for a really long movie.The girl from Destineys Child might be a hell of a singer but she couldn't act her way out of a paper bag. Mike Meyers Austin character seems really forced and he doesn't look like he's having much fun doing it. His Fat Bastard character doesn't do anything amusing and is completely wasted. The lines he has are just gross without any comedy involved. It's almost like Meyers thought FB could just show up and we would laugh. The whole movie feels this way.Goldmember (the character) doesn't even have a previous funny appearance going for him. He's just gross without a point and if possible less funny than everyone else around him.The first one I didn't think much of when I first saw it but it got funnier with time and after running into it a couple of times I could appreciate it for what it was. Obviously Dr. Evil stole the movie. The second one was better because it focused a lot more on the Dr. Evil character and it seemed clear that Meyers had figured out what people enjoyed about the series. This one looks like it was made so a lot of people could collect checks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mike Myers is developing something of an Anti-Midas touch. Everything he touches, he cheapens. Jokes, plotlines, respectable actors credibility, everything. The seedy decline of the Austin Powers franchise slides to a disgusting new low in Myer's latest desperate cash in attempt in Austin Powers: Goldmember. I won't ruin it for you, but I feel I owe you the advice...DO NOT SEE THIS FILM. The horror begins with a cheap, insencire cameorgy with uncomfaratable, hurried performances from actors painfully doing Myers a BIG favour. After that...well...coherence kind of crumbles away and yields to a disturbing collage of nonsencial, recycled, disgusting and sometimes frankly rather disturbing idiocy. Dr. Evil isn't funny. Austin Powers has lost all of his appeal entirely. His character has been reduced to a ring announcer in a circus of forced humour. He gleefully displays products for dozens of franchises, awkwardly shouts about the famous actors that have shown up for cameos, and looks generally more like Mike Myers in odd clothing than a fictional character. There was something about the original character as compared to this new, pseudo-self obsessive Michael Myers that made the whole 60s british swinger character original and hilarious. Dr. Evil and Austin Powers were JUST as hilarious. Now we have seen a disgusting degeration of talent. I felt raped by this movie. I felt ripped off, and I think Michael Myers owes me $6. He didn't have the right to do this to me. I can't get back those two hours I spent in front of that product placement laden feces party. The new character, Goldmember, is disgusting, offensive and disturbing. It is Myers trying to force humour from a situation that does not warrant any. Enough said. This is a shudderingly awful travesty of a film, and should never have been made. Take me seriously, it's a waste of your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst Movie Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 3rd Austin Powers movie tragically fails to not only bring justice to the trilogy, but to the movie industry in general. While attempting to close plot holes and introduce new characters, the movie sells out with advertisements and B grade celebrity cameo's (such as Britney Spears, whose presence displays a mockery of the entertainment industry in general). The portrayal of Dr Evil also tragically does no justice to the original movie. Dr Evil was a recreation of a classic Bond villain, who was a calm and twisted genius. The funniest part of Dr Evil was that behind his maniacle smile, his plots fell apart. Adding the dancing, songs, and ability to get out of his chair (a joke from the first movie) took away from the originality that made him funny. Overall, his character is ridiculously over-the-top. Additionally, there aren't any new jokes behind the glitz or glamour. Instead, the movie tries to sell the audience on repeated gags and finished plot lines that ultimately make this movie a wasted ticket. Furthermore, it takes away from the innovative style Myers brought to the forefront when he introduced the Powers character. Overall, don't see this movie. Buy the first Austin Powers and forget that the rest of them exist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How could this be?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Austin Powers II is one of the few movies that I went to see twice at the cinema during its run there. I bought the DVD as soon as it came out and have watched it many times since. I mention this because I had high expectations for AP III. I could spend a lot of time extolling the comedic virtues of AP II, and then simply tell you that AP III has none of them.There are many scenes and devices from AP II that are re-tried in AP III. None of them work. The reason they do not work, in my opinion, is because instead of infusing more originality they just infused more vulgarity. Now mind you, I think a fart joke is as funny as the next guy, or my 8 year old daughter. There is hardly anything witty or original (as I mentioned) about this movie, but instead is a layering of silly, over-the-top bodily function and sexual humor. The script is hardly engaging, and the plot is confusing and disjointed. And Beyonce, she's no Heather Graham in any way shape or form. The Goldmember character is weak, not entertaining to look at, and does not play a prominent role in the movie when compared to Dr. Evil. They could not even get past him. And the ending... it's as schmaltzy as, well, an estranged family reunion.If you have not seen this movie, I suggest only watching it if you can borrow it from a friend, have 2 hours to kill (I started cleaning out the junk drawer in front of the TV after 20 minutes) and be prepared for an endlessly rippling wave of mindless low-bro 'humor'. If that's your thing, no doubt it's your friend's thing too and you have likely already been talked into seeing it or even own it.No wonder you can get the deluxe collector's edition at Columbia House for $5.95; it's hardly worth more. I highly recommend Undercover Brother - original and FUNNY.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Austin Powers the International Man of Mystery", was a gem almost equaled by "Austin Powers, the Spy who shagged me". The primary difference was the killing off of Elizabeth Hurly in II. In II, we were introduced to "Mini Me" who really makes II in spots, absolutely hilarious. We could have done though without "Fat Bastard". "Gold Member" has none of the class and fun of the first two. This viewer has tried on at least three occasions to get through this bore without success. Throwing in a number of big star cameos seems to be only a last minute producer gamble to give this bomb a shot in the arm. Stick and laugh with the first two and pass on this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely unfunny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't seen the other 2 films in the series, so maybe I'm missing something. The first 5 minutes are eye-popping just for the sheer number and quality of cameos. After that, things fall quickly to pieces. Almost all jokes are at high-school fart and excrement level. This tripe makes "There's Something About Mary" look positively high-brow.Even where jokes are bordering on slightly funny, Myers decides to kill the effect by over-explaining everything. As an example, had they just revealed the full English subtitles, I could have laughed at the scene. But no, they had to have Beyoncé read them out nice and slow, so even the most brainless viewer would get it.In some parts (background signs are an example), the movie tries to imitate a Zucker, Abrahams, Zucker film, but never quite succeeds. Try as it might, an "Airplane!" or "Top Secret!" it ain't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lame recap of previous efforts with a bigger budget but ever cheaper gags.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here we go again in a series that is not so much a spoof, as a spoof on a spoof. The original Austin Powers was more a spoof on In Like Flint (with James Coburn), Jason King and the other swinging sixties anything-goes James Bond rip-offs than the real 007 movies.The franchise isn't really a series of films as such, but a chance to showcase Mike Myers talents in a series of guises including, for the first time, a mad penis painting Dutchman - Goldmember - who strangely doesn't even know his own language from German!(Maybe that was a deliberate mistake - who knows and frankly who cares?!)A success has many fathers, but failure is an orphan. Good to see that now we are on a winner we have star day players onboard to remind us that they too wouldn't mind a hit franchise (or two) of their own.The greatest thing about the script is that the target audience hasn't seen the original thing and there are still loads of old Benny Hill sight gags to steal.(You've been caught baby, yeah....)Every time the writers (which includes Myers) goes back to the series they merely add to what they have created before without discarding much. Michael Caine is added as Power's (mostly absent) father and Beyonce plays a foxy blacksploitation sidekick (very well acted too - bang on the money!), but we have nothing really that new on the menu. The rule of thumb being that as the gags get cheaper the sets get more expensive.No film has to be anything but a time passer, but what is evident here is that when you take away any element of danger or intrigue you have nothing to cling on to, even silly comedy needs a forward plot device.All-in-all a product that is more interesting off-screen that it is on. A money making machine that doesn't want to stop because behind the face-pulling and the look-at-us-we-can laugh-at-ourselves we have a serious business. This won't be last of the series because we have money being made and while money is being made no Hollywood franchise will be dropped. The only alternative is that Myers gets tired of getting tens of millions for his so-so performances. Who knows - maybe he has hidden ethics? Let us hope so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The film is often annoying, has very little in the way of truly funny jokes, and is unoriginal. Many of the jokes have been recycled from the previous Austin Powers movies, something that the film itself acknowledges. The film brags about its lack of originality! Beyonce Knowles is unamusing as Cleopatra, and often just stands around watching while Mike Myers mugs. She is not as effective as Elizabeth Hurley or Heather Graham. The character of Goldmember is ill-conceived and less than amusing. As my father, who watched it with me, noted, "The character wasn't even one dimensional; he's half-dimensional." The only jokes associated with him either fail to bring even a chuckle, or grow old very quickly. Finally, the film is laden with annoying celebrity cameos that distract from the action. The celebrities in question should fire whoever talked them into appearing in this garbage.</fullReview>

How are Austin and Dr.Evil brothers when in the first movie, they acted like they didn't know each other. That's pretty weird for two guys who supposedly went to the same school. And why didn't their father, Nigel Powers tell them before that they were brothers?Foxy Cleopatra (Beyonce Knowles) and Austin claim to have known each other from the past. But their chemistry is non-existent. Austin has a habit of putting his hands on all his partners/lovers. If Foxy and he were lovers then they sure did a bad job convincing us. The closest we ever see them get cozy is at the end when they kiss... but even then it was too icy and fake.Beyonce Knowles is a bad actress. They could've got somebody better and more qualified to play the part of Foxy. I also couldn't stand the way she kept shaking her head every time she talked. It annoyed the p*** out of me.</fullReview>

It was better in some ways than the second (not quite as disgusting) but some of the gags went on way too long! I used to think of Mike Meyers as a talented comedian, but I now think he needs to be directed by someone else. I always liked him on SNL. I think as his head is getting bigger his critical assesment of his own work is getting weak. It is really too bad because there is a lot to like about his work. I just found myslef wincing quite a bit during the second and third Austin Powers films. I also saw him on a promotional appearance on "The Daily Show". He was just terrible, laughing hysterically at his own jokes that fell flat. It was a bit sad. It made me think that he is doing this for the bucks at this point and that is always sad to see when an artist that does not need the money sells out anyway.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first two Austin Powers movies were very good. So it wasn't difficult to be anxious about seeing Part III. Normally I don't go out to the movies in order to catch the `latest and greatest' features that are out, so I usually wait for them to become available for home viewing. My daughters saw this film on the wide screen and liked it. Compared to this one, the first two Austin Powers movies were exceptionally good and funny, especially The Spy Who Shagged Me. To put it mildly, I was extremely disappointed in this film. This one is a first class stinker. It has more than the usual 8th grade level `bathroom humor' that normally accompanies modern comedies of this nature (remember Wayne's World?). However, the writers make a desperate attempt to keep the plot afloat by overdoing it a bit. Nonetheless, their attempt to use it to for the benefit of the plot fails miserably. Speaking of plot, there really is none. The overemphasized humor involving genitals and "soft core" swear words is stupid and adds to the absurdness of this movie. Film features cameos of Brad Pitt, Danny DeVito, Britany Spears and John Travolta among others in another possible attempt to add substance to the plot. Not!!! This stinker is a total schlockfest. This is just another example of the junk that is available for sale, while some great classic films from the 40's and 50's go unnoticed by the powers-that-be. Even the great classic `The Final Countdown' (1980) starring Kirk Douglas isn't available for sale, but this claptrap is. Go figure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just in case you missed it in the last movie, the Austin Powers series has completely fallen off a cliff. The third installment in the Austin Powers series accomplishes little more than proving that the first sequel was not the full depth to which the series planned on sinking. The second movie fed completely off of the success and original comedy of the first movie, recycling the same jokes and trying vainly to get people to laugh at the same things, with a few new tasteless and downright bad jokes thrown in between. MiniMe and Fat Bastard (who, combined, provided about 20 seconds of amusement in the first sequel) are both back here and neither provides anything new or even anything amusing.There are sporadic moments in the film that are funny (even two scenes that made me laugh out loud), but they are so hidden in a slog of garbage that they are not worth the rest of the movie, and they're both only briefly funny anyway. There is a scene where Dr. Evil gets hit in the groin by a swinging object and screams out what you can find in the summary line of this review and, even better, Austin has a touching and lengthy flashback remembering his flaky father and how he was never there for him to see his accomplishments, and when he comes out of the memory and we see his emotion-stricken face, Dr. Evil (locked up in a glass cage like Dr. Lecter) says, 'Oh, boo-frickety-hoo!'That's funny, isn't it? Well, I laughed at it. But then you have to deal with the rest of the movie. The old scene with Dr. Evil and his son Scott arguing at the table is brought back from the dead, this time so overdone and so tired that it literally dissolves to the point where Dr. Evil is simply grunting and groaning and making strange noises, which I assume are meant to be funny. They're not. If you haven't, in fact, gotten to the point where you're raising your eyebrows and looking around at the people next to you to see if they're as mystified as you are about how this has gotten so bad, you definitely will here.Beyoncé Knowles plays the part of Foxxy Cleopatra, coming off as one of the most nerve-gratingly aggravating characters ever to set foot in this doomed series, and vainly trying to fill the tiny shoes of Heather Graham from the first sequel, who provided probably the first thoroughly boring character in the Austin Powers movies. Her wooden acting and total incongruity to the character she was playing made me think that they would have simply taken out the heroine completely for any third movie that they might be greedy enough to make, but instead they throw in the exact same thing. Both are characters put into the movies for no other reason than to have a popular face playing a tasteless character in an Austin Powers film.I think that the trilogy is such a common occurrence in movies that it's safe to say that this will be the last installment made in the Austin Powers series, but I think it's also worth mentioning that this is the first time I have ever made a specific effort to hypothesize about whether or not they will ever bombard us with another crapfest from a series of movies that is so obviously dead and gone (and I'm still terrified that someone is going to come up with the fool idea that they should make a third Scary Movie - I could stand about 25 more Austin Powers' movies before another one of those). The second movie should never have been made in the first place, and the third one is more than overkill.And by the way, I saw this movie at Leicester Square in London when I was in England doing a study abroad program through the University of California, Davis, studying Shakespeare in the summer of 2002. PLEASE believe that you have not the slightest idea of what I missed out on when I went to see this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The third Austin Powers movie offers the viewer little in originality. The few characterizations that work in "Goldmember" are not original and worked much better in the first two Austin Powers movies. The material that is new to "Goldmember" contributes little; it provides the weakest links in a weak movie. Another criticism is that the comedy is significantly more crass and vulgar than in the first two. Where the predecessors had had some wit and style, "Goldmember" tends to rely on tired potty humor.Unless you are a die-hard Powers fan and must see them all, skip it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Austin Power's latest adventure in "Goldmember" is one of the funniest movies ever made. From the unexpected beginning to the hilarious out takes and skits during the final credits, this movie is everything a funny movie should be. This movie follows Austin Powers on the search for his missing father (Fa-ja) played by Michael Caine. He teams up with his new side kick Foxy Cleopatra, well played by Beyonce Knowles, to chase Dr. Evil and the sinister Goldmember to get him back. I think some of the funniest parts in this movie are when Austin goes back in time and meets "Foxy" for the first time, and when he meets Mr. Roboto and has to read his subtitles. The cameos made in this movie from such stars as Tom Cruise, Danny DeVito, John Travolta, and The Osbournes are also very funny. I would have to say that this would be a good contender for best comedy along with "Airplane." I recommend this to anyone who wants to be in stitches in the first 5 minutes of a movie.</fullReview>

Why not just end it with her before you start another movie. And all the cameos were cool, but did we need to hear "Hey look its Briteny Spears!", that was pretty annoying to say the least. And they added a little extra to this movie than the rest, the thing that made you snap out of the movie, out of the fantasy of Austin Powers, and snap back to reality because they keep on reminding you that "its just a movie". I think they could have done without that. It's a movie, people watch movies to be immerse in it, and those little things made you come out of it. Don't get me wrong this movie has some good laughs, but real fans of Austin Powers, might be somewhat annoyed with some things that happen within this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No spoilers - nothing, not a word, except 'impressive'. Myers has transcended his own career. Making this movie was a lot of work, by a lot of people. Meticulous writing, filming, editing - and with comedy, timing is everything, and here it works, and to a degree that is surprising. Sequels aren't supposed to be good - at least not as good as the original movie. Here we have the third movie in the series taking the idea, and the talent of the people behind the movie, to a whole new level.It's fun to speculate about what the next few movies in this series will be called. If Goldmember, the third, corresponds to the third 007 movie Goldfinger, and if the fourth 007 movie was Thunderball, then a first guess on number four in the Austin Powers saga is rather straightforward, is it not? And will You Only Live Twice - with reference to Dr Evil and Mini-Me - become You Only Live Once And A Half?Go see it - no joke: It's one of the best movies of the year.</fullReview>

Austin Powers 3 just leaches on the idea that the Austin Powers series is huge.

The villian Goldmember is very weak, we know little about him and frankly don't care. The worst part of the entire movie though wasn't the movie. It was the people who had just seen the other 2 Austin Powers' movies months back, hopped on the bandwagon and were laughing throughout the entire movie just for the sake of laughing. **The funniest part I felt was the explanation of Austin's mother's death. The car suddenly blows up and Austin explains his mother's carcus folded around him to form a protective barrier.

The real problem with a "comedy" like this is that the humour has no value, it just isn't funny. Mike Myers style is offbeat and random, which works when it has a good basis as it did with the James Bond nods in previous incarnations. The basis for this was low grade Howard Stern toilet jokes, one after another, nothing else. His "Goldmember" character was just.....odd. Not funny, not even interesting, just bewildering. I really believe the target audience for this one is composed solely of uncultured morons. It's really a shame because the first two Austin Powers flicks had a least some intellectual credibility to them. Myers has proved before that he can take something silly and obscure and make it appealing. This has no appeal. None. This is all about let's be as disgusting and stupid as possible and expect that everyone will love it because it's Austin Powers. And for that this film is immensely impressed with itself.

		<shortDescription>Some laughs to be sure, but the weakest of the three...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Goldmember in New York on July 10 at an exhibitors screening. I'll admit I laughed quite hard at certain points in the film. However, on reflection, I can barely remember what it was that made me laugh, which suggests it wasn't really all that funny. After a pretty darn entertaining opening sequence, things take a turn for the sour - the character Goldmember is remarkably unfunny - I don't think he gets a single laugh the entire film, the product placement and obvious "MTV video" moments from The Spy Who Shagged Me are back and even more prevelent than before.SPOILERS - some of the cameos were extraordinarily humorous, without naming names, but the Britney Spears appearance was cold, calculated, and incredibly unfunny (the audience didn't react at all). And the Osbournes really need to go away. END SPOILERSEveryone is probably going to go see this movie, so go right ahead. But Beyonce, for all her attractiveness, is a worse actress than Heather Graham (Believe it! It is actually possible to be worse than Graham was in the second film), and there's just a lot less to laugh at.Michael Caine is a highlight as Nigel Powers. And I enjoyed Mini-me more in this one than in the last. And as I said before, there ARE some good laughs. It just doesn't hold a candle to the hilarious first film... and it isn't even as good as The Spy Who Shagged Me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film offered contrived cheap laugh after contrived cheap laugh. This often ridiculously badly written movie had me literally fast-forwarding what felt like about every ten or fifteen minutes, just to escape the stream of bad dialogue and really embarrassing songs. I will admit that there are a few funny scenes, especially involving "Mini-Me", but they really couldn't slow this movie's descent into terminal velocity right into the recycle bin.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The attempted jokes come thick and fast and thin in this third and to date last outing for Mike Myers' parody of swinging 60's spy-romps, but by now familiarity was starting to breed contempt and as is usual the third time around, some situations are just pushed too far, going well beyond, for me anyway, acceptable boundaries of taste. And yes, I am thinking of what I'll politely call the bodily functions jokes which are played out for too long, outstaying their welcome every time. Add to this the mile-high overblown prologue where big-name Hollywooders demean themselves in knowing cameos, a plot that just won't start and some obvious in it either for the money casting (the Robert Wagner and Michael Caine pension schemes) or for the exposure (Beyonce Knowles in a part completely unsuited to her) so that you're grateful when the odd genuinely amusing moment does come along. Me, although I saw the punchline coming minutes before it arrived, smiled most at the Styx-ian pun on Mr Roboto, although I doubt many others outside North America would get the gag and there were a few other funny lines scattered throughout, but the law of diminishing returns was well in evidence to the extent that I think we can all be glad that Powers didn't return in "Austin-pussy" or "Thunder-balls".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dorky movie hidden behind the word : a comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, this was said to be a comedy, so, I watched it as a comedy, categorized it as a comedy and criticized it as a comedy. Still, I couldn't help but feel insulted and as if I was a complete fool having watched it through. The emotions that this movie raised weren't positive at all. I hated this movie.Here is the main reason: the cast didn't take anything seriously. Everyone acted like they knew that they were in a comedy. This is a humor killer for me. I hate watching people mug at the camera and being complete fools. Every time when I look at something like that, I always think: "Wow... These people really get millions for doing this..?". Their responsibility is to take the audience seriously. It doesn't matter if it's a comedy, drama or a thriller. If they don't care, why should I? Second, the intelligence levels were just obnoxious. The writers clearly just threw whatever mediocre they could had come up with and trusted that the audience was ignorant enough not to realize how dumb it was. Comedy movies can be clever and funny. There have been many which have challenged the viewer to understand the stuff at the screen. That's respectful and enjoyable.Final words: There are so many other options where you should rather spend your time and money. Actually, this movie would probably harm the IQs as well, so it might be dangerous as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The series is beginning to look like a personal challenge to Mike Myers. How many characters can I play in one film? How many parodies and cameos can one squeeze in? This is the territory of Airplane, where gag density is of uppermost important. Luckily, the basic idea (Bond parody married to generic 60s movie anachronism) still has legs. The addition of Beyonce is a welcome refresher (amazingly she's dreadful in the generically comparable Pink Panther remakes) and the new character, Goldmember himself is sufficiently surreal to absorb any franchise-fatigue cynicism. The gangsta-rap parody is my favourite sequence. That that comes at the beginning of the movie shows how my tolerance waned over the rest of the film though. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No wonder this is rated the worst Austin Powers movie, I still wonder how it got so much money, probably from a lot of people expecting to see more of what was in the first two movies of the series, which isn't the case. For me, LAME is the perfect word to sum up this movie.The next few lines will contain the few spoilers I'm prepared to give: The start of the movie couldn't get any worse, the "celebrity appearances", the faces of Austin Powers and Doctor Evil, such as Doctor Evil's changed eye color, not to mention Austin Powers looks like an old pervert that had botox injections(you could argue that it's to add to the comedy but he still looks different from the other movies), rater than a middle-aged secret agent, and ,the fact, that it's weird for a British secret agent to wave American flags, especially since he never did it in the other movies and it's unrelated to spying or comedy(what this movie is suppose to be about).Also, let's not forget the main plot: nothing special, funny, smart, well made or original about it, "son goes to find his father".It's unlike the first movies and it wasn't enjoyable, even if I'd pretend the other movies didn't exist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An improvement on the second film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Austin Powers in Goldmemeber is an improvement on the disappointment that was Austin Powers: The Spy who shagged me. Austin Powers in Goldmemeber isn't in the trilogy curse. I don't think it's the best in the trilogy but it's still better than The Spy who shagged me. The reason why it's better is because it tones it down a little on the immaturity. Am I saying that the film isn't immature? No. I'm just saying that there's not as many gross moments. In the last film, they introduced a new character named Fat Bastard, who is in this film also. But not as much. Fat Bastard is absolutely gross, and one of the reasons why I didn't like it as much. Also, there is a scene where Austin drinks Fat Bastard's crap. And said it's a bit nutty. That's just gross. That was the humor that that film stuck with. i liked it, but it was very gross at times. Austin Powers in Goldmemeber is an improvement for many reasons. It makes you laugh a bit more. The jokes aren't that as crude and I prefer some of the new characters. Or, new character. Michael Caine, the great Michael Caine, plays Austin's father. Just the fact that Michael Caine is in it makes it an improvement. The fact that Scott Evil is turning evil is kind of funny. Austin Powers in Goldmemeber will make you laugh many times. Also, I prefer Beyonce over Heather Grahm. Heather Grahm wasn't bad, but I preferred Elizabeth Hurley and Beyonce. Austin Powers in Goldmemeber isn't a bad third part. It's one of the rare good third part. It's obvious that you should see it. The Plot: In the third part of this famous trilogy, Austin realizes that his father has been kidnapped and is being held in 1979. Dr. Evil and Mini Me are in prison. Austin travels back in time and reunites with his old girlfriend Foxxy, who is working undercover for Goldmemeber in the 70's. Austin and Foxy team up and try to stop Dr. Evil and Goldmember from using Preperation H, which is their new plan for destruction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching this movie was like eating a whole $3.79 bag of Doritos in one sitting. It starts out okay but by the end you feel mildly sick like that was too much, really. The bathroom humor was overdone, and they should have left Fat Bastard in the deep freeze. This was a conglomeration of Dr. No, Goldfinger, and Silence of the Lambs, among others. Low points? The mole joke, Goldmember eating his own skin or fat bastard with too much skin, and father jokes. It is good Myers reincarnated Fat Bastard as Shrek because one sequel in this series was quite enough. In short the movie contained too many shitake mushrooms for any sensible person to take.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not usually that funny, definitely the weakest of the three</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember the first time I saw this third installment in the Austin Powers franchise. It was New Year's Eve in 2002, and I was sixteen years old. Before then, I had only seen bits of the first two. (I never watch sequels to movies I haven't seen anymore, but sometimes did then.) My first viewing of "Austin Powers in Goldmember" was definitely a good one, so I watched the first two within the next few weeks after that, in reverse order. For a while, I was a big fan of the franchise, but watching the entire trilogy again in recent years, I have discovered that I now think the first one, "Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery", is the best, and the two sequels (1999's "Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me" and then this one), each brought the franchise down a step.As usual, Dr. Evil has another plan for world domination, but soon after he announces it to his colleagues, Austin Powers comes to arrest him! However, the British secret agent is soon informed that his father, Nigel, has been kidnapped, so he goes to talk to his foe in prison! He learns that a Dutch man from the 1970's known as "Goldmember" was involved in this abduction, so he travels back to 1975! At Goldmember's club, Powers meets Foxxy Cleopatra, an FBI agent working undercover. They witness Nigel Powers captured and taken through a time machine to 2002, so Austin then takes Foxxy back to 2002 with him. Dr. Evil and Mini-Me soon escape from their maximum security prison, and join Goldmember in a dastardly plot to cause a global flood! Obviously, it's up to Austin Powers and his new sidekick to try and stop them! Mike Myers played two roles in the first film (Austin Powers and Dr. Evil), and added a third alter ego (Fat B%$#&amp;*%) in the second, so it's no surprise that he plays a fourth one in this third installment, Goldmember. I no longer care much for Fat B%$#&amp;*%, which includes his appearance in this film, with scenes involving more toilet humour, and jokes about his sumo wrestling diaper, but Goldmember might be worse. I don't think I was ever a huge fan of his, but used to find him more acceptable. His exaggerated Dutch accent is supposed to be funny, but it's actually perhaps a little irritating. The film isn't completely straight-faced, it has its moments, such as Austin Powers unable to keep quiet about the mole on Number Three's face, and another crude shadow gag (like the one in "The Spy Who Shagged Me"). However, the laughs in this film are still smaller in number than they are in its two predecessors, and it may get even more juvenile here than before. In the role of Austin Powers' sidekick, Beyoncé Knowles puts on a better performance than Heather Graham did in the first sequel, but that doesn't make this film superior."Goldmember" is obviously partially a spoof of "Goldfinger", the 1964 adaptation of the James Bond novel of the same name. Unfortunately, this third Austin Powers installment is far inferior to that third James Bond flick from 38 years earlier. On the other hand, "Austin Powers in Goldmember" is definitely better than "Die Another Day", the Bond film which came out the same year. If you ask me, that film, the twentieth installment in the franchise, and Pierce Brosnan's last outing as Bond of four, is undoubtedly the worst Bond flick to date! Nonetheless, this second sequel to Mike Myers' James Bond spoof showed that the series may be wearing thin, and although it's been nearly seven years since it came into theatres, it looks like a fourth Austin Powers movie has been confirmed. I'm not going to ignore it when it comes out, but since each of the two sequels brought the franchise down a step, it wouldn't surprise me if Austin Powers 4 brings it down yet another step, then it would follow the pattern.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An average comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love the Austin Powers series, but I feel like this effort was my least favorite of the three thus far. If you were to watch the first movie, then the second, and then finally "goldmember," you will undoubtedly see how the characters become so overblown by the third film, drastically different then how they were in the first film. Take for instance Dr. Evil, who in the first movie was almost serious, and anything comedic was often very subtle, not trying for the laughs, but getting them in a unique fashion. In "goldmember," however, evil is completely out of character and it gets almost ridiculous at times. Although these characters are all funny, they've all gone through their own "personal evolution." "goldmember" is filled with many memorable moments which is why I still have respect for the series. The opening of the movie is probably one of the greatest openings for a comedy I have ever seen. I'm sure many can agree to that. The whole part with Mr. Roboto is witty and smart, poking fun at our use of subtitles. The movie also has another great scene behind a curtain, which mirrors another scene in the second movie, where it looks like heather graham is pulling grenades, rats, umbrellas, and other objects out from Austin's behind. However, the scene in "goldmember" involves Austin and Mini Me in a hospital room during a rountine physical. I also have respect for Mike Myers himself, who plays the parts of 4 characters in Austin, Dr. evil, fat bastard, and goldmember. So all in all, an alright comedy. It has its moments, but it also has those moments that just go too far and are completely off base with what the first movie in the series was trying to illustrate. I've heard that a fourth picture is most likely in the works, which I hope they can turn around the series with a final movie that Austin Powers fans truly deserve.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"They're using the same !@$$!@$ jokes that they did in the last Austin Powers movie!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having the characters in the film acknowledge that the format is stale does not disguise the fact, even if it's Ozzy Osbourne.While I rated both a five, this is a marginal further drop from The Spy Who Shagged Me, a further increase into its own sense of self and reheated jokes. I said when reviewing the original, and best, film that I couldn't decide who was funniest out of the two lead characters. This is virtually nul and void here, as while Austin still raises a smile, all the scenes with Doctor Evil are laboured, flat and badly paced. A new addition to Myers's cast of characters - the absurdly unfunny title character Goldmember - adds little to proceedings. An apart script editing blip even sees them use the humorous "smelting accident" gag a second time.Beyonce and Michael Caine add some spice to the film and there's a fun cameo role from Heroes's Masi Oka, but this is a franchise running on empty and really just stuck on repeat. Quite improbably, a fourth film is listed as being in production for 2009. Maybe the subsequent seven year lay off will have reheated Myers's muse... though judging by "The Love Guru", probably not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Embarrassingly Unfunny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film ranks up there (or is it down there) with some of the worst films I have ever seen. This undistinguished list includes this film, "Black Sheep", "Superman III", "Q &amp; A", and on and on...Unlike the previous two AP films, I did not laugh out loud once. I loved the Jerry Springer bit in the 2nd film, as well as the "Alan Parsons Project" as well as the interplay between Dr. Evil and Scott and other bits too.This one was completely awful. I sat there wanting and expecting to laugh and it never came. I wouldn't doubt if another film was released only not to have this piece of rubbish as the epitaph.But the best observation I can make is that there is no direct relation to how much money a film makes (or for TV shows, how high the ratings)and the quality of the film. Case in point: this film made much more than the first two, and yet it blew. Also, consider the fact that the best Star Wars film (which almost no one contests) was "The Empire Strikes Back". This film made the least money of all the Star Wars films. A TV example is "The Simpsons". The show is almost unwatchable now---just a collection of gags and every one of the family acts like an idiot. Contrast this to the first few seasons, where Marge and Lisa were the sane ones in the family, and the shows actually had a believable underlying plot. Now it's total chaos on the show, and yet it still gets ratings. I think that the general public is behind the power curve, because I'm not certain what they're laughing at--maybe the history of the show. I think it's the same with David Letterman--he used to be much, much funnier when he was on NBC. He was irreverent, and now he's a left-wing Ed Sullivan. The audience laughs at jokes that are just not funny. Again, it's the expectation and the fact that people are behind the power curve. And it's no different with this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not A Movie.. It's a Momentum of Dirty Sexual Jokes !!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a fan of Mike Myers and his good work as a writer or as an actor, as Austin Powers or as anyone. Definitely the first Austin movie was nice, although just a joke after another but they were good jokes and yes so separated but so is every single sequence of a Bond movie except we're talking here comedy not action ! The sequel (Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me) did nothing but repeating the first with much of absolute dirty jokes and heavy human excrement humor. I didn't like it but it did very very well at the box office though. HERE, at the third one, you won't find any respectable comedy at all (even by the Powers/Myers's measurements !!). Save just the intro, it's a flood of pure filthy verbal or visible jokes, and very unfunny ones by the way ! It's disappointing because Myers got no new thing to present, and because THAT KIND OF JOKES is pretty easy &amp; truly nauseating. I was sad to see (Michael Caine) doing nothing but commenting about Mini-me's penis, Mini-me showing his naked butt to the people, one character eating his skin, or Myers's endless dry jokes about moles. It's bad tasting at its top and its failure too. So how about being the totally unfunny installment of what used to be nice parody!Now what you'll say if you knew that there is more than 60 minutes of deleted scenes as well ?? Of course the question will be : is it the REAL good thing which we've never seen of Goldmember ?, or it is more and more of the gross comedy which we get it from any dirty-minded young man with too much of empty time!!?Once I heard that the talent of comedy is a proof of being intelligent. Myers confirms here that he's turning into idiot! It's clear that in his third movie as Austin he ran out of good ideas so he easily chose to take the staircase of dirty jokes, but in this very case he got the way down! One last thing : I'm totally crazy about Beyoncé Knowles (Foxy Cleopatra indeed !) her voluptuous body, her good singing and dancing (or her dancing booty in specific.. Ahh!). But here she is doing the big nothing ! Just beautiful eyes, a nice smile, and not even much of a role (like the one Elizabeth Hurley had at the first movie !!), or a good sexy shots (like what Heather Graham got and delivered in the second one !!). I hoped for some sweet dancing or some of her famous booty SHAKING which is great (the booty and the SHAKING !) but there is nothing at all!Finally, I'm sad to say that I didn't enjoy it AND I'm trying to forget it too !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not a bad movie at all. Pretty funny, but not as funny as Austin Powers 2: The Spy Who Shagged Me.Should've given more dialog to Foxy Cleopatra (Beyonce Knowles from Destiny's Child); instead, she's just the next girlfriend for Austin, and not a more fleshed-out character, like Heather Graham or Elizabeth Hurley before her.The character of Goldmember, while not in the film a lot, could've been cut down a bit more. He isn't particularly interesting. He's not as evil as Dr. Evil, and not as disgusting as Fat Bastard, and comes off as a washed out amalgam of the two.Fred Savage, from TV's "The Wonder Years," is good in his two scenes as "the Mole." It's Dr. Evil, as usual, who steals the show, however. And it's a pretty good show.Rating: BF.Y.I.: While in the movie we hear ELO's "Evil Woman," King Floyd's funk classic "Groove Me," and Bobby Darin's "Beyond the Sea," Darin's song is not on the soundtrack, and absolutely awful cover versions of the first two make the album. Avoid this soundtrack at all costs!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This time, Mike Myers plays Austin Powers, Dr. Evil and Fat Bastard, plus one new character: a Dutch guy named Goldmember who wants to help Dr. Evil take over the world. That's the main plot, but the movie is really an excuse for a bunch of silly gags (namely the subtitles). The female interest this time is Foxxy Cleopatra (Beyonce Knowles), whose cool never ebbs. The other addition is Austin's father Nigel (Michael Caine).Anyway, "Austin Powers in Goldmember" is raucous fun from beginning to end. You just have to remember not to take anything seriously - and believe me, you can't. Reprising their roles from the earlier movies are Seth Green, Michael York, Robert Wagner, Mindy Sterling and Verne Troyer, while the guest appearances this time are Fred Savage, Steven Spielberg, Tom Cruise, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kevin Spacey, Danny DeVito and Britney Spears.And that's life, baby!</fullReview>

So once again he must go to the foxxy 1970's to once again do his trademark funny work. Teaming up with Foxxy Cleopatra(Beyoncé Knowles) and surprisingly even Mini Me. So what happens when Dr.Evil turns surprisingly good? All go on to defeat Goldmember(Michael Myers) and live happily after ever. Or maybe they won't. Scott Evil(Seth Green) in this installment turns evil.This movie stars some of the most aspiring actors ever. Seth Green, Michael Myers, Verne Troyer, Michael Caine and Beyoncé Knowles. So you have got to know that with that combination you'll have a movie to have a lot of laughs and giggles about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some funny bits, and mostly it delivers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought that one of the cleverest ways to attack this movie is just what Mike Myers did. He made fun of the fact that he was re-using the same jokes over from the last two Austin films. As in the part where he very randomly starts in on Scott for no reason, and Scott's reaction is "Oh wait this is very familiar, let me do what I do". Brilliant. However there are parts in the movie where this concept doesn't carry as well as it does there. The Fat Bastard bits seemed forced, although the wire gag was funny. The shadow puppet bit that was done much better and funnier in the second movie. What saves this movie really from being a re-run is the conflict with Austin's father, and the new villain Goldmember. Michael Caine is excellent and refreshing as Austin's father, although it was almost a little too much drama than I wanted when i pay to see an Austin Powers movie. But Goldmember is spot on. He is hilarious, and the best part about him is he's original! Loved every scene he was in and thought that he was VASTLY underused for having the movie named after him. It was like here's DR. EVIL! DR. EVIL! DR. EVIL! and oh yeah Goldmember, but look over here at DR. EVIL!! Also as a side note I thought that all the good Mini-Me stuff was in the second movie.Quote that I though defined the movie: Ozzy Osbourne saying "These filmmakers are boobs, they are using the same jokes as they did in the last Austin Powers movie."My Personal Favorite: "Dominoes, Mother&amp;#%*!"</fullReview>

Micheal cane as nigel powers was pure genius and keeping all the originals around was great(major props have to be given to seth green,robert wagner and mindy sterling) they play off myers perfectly and it wouldn't have been the same movie without them support mr powers...i mean...mr myers;) the only complaint i have with the movie is beyonce as the new powers girl. she does do the part well but she is just so dam annoying, but she stays out of the way enough not to make it a big detriment on the film as a whole. i just can't say enough about this movie. its one of those movies you can laugh at over and over again and even find something new that you missed the first dozen times you watch it. i suggest if you haven't seen this movie go out and rent it NOW!..and watch it at least twice cause you'll miss some really good plans...err....dialog from laughing so much.my rating is 10/10 a perfect comedy</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You're probably all familiar with Austin Powers and his travels. If not, think James Bond meets 60's porn star, with a little chest hair, rather large glasses and a great set of teeth thrown in for good measure. The previous two films saw Powers battle with world-domination freak Dr.Evil (played by Myers again), and in the third he is well and truly back again.After a brilliantly creative opening sequence featuring some of the best spoofs of recent times as well as a handful of star cameos, we learn that Dr.Evil is again making crazy attempts to conquer the world. Mini-me, his trusty sidekick is well and truly back, though he never reaches the same heights as the previous film. When Austin manages to foil Dr.Evil's plans early into proceedings you'd be forgiven for thinking the story is about to go absolutely nowhere. And in true Austin Powers style it doesn't, though there's still some semblance of a plot so that all those familiar situations from the last two films can be rehashed.The film isn't without it's flaws but you can never go past the fact that it's just plain fun. Most of the old jokes aren't nearly as funny the third time around and some of the new jokes fall flat but there's still some really funny stuff in there amongst it all. If only Myers hadn't taken tired gags from various other sources to pad things out a little then it would've been as original as his previous two Austin movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Star Power Worthy of Watching !!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Third in the Trilogy of Austin Powers films created by Mike Myers,"Goldmember" has Star Power and fine performances, but fails when it runs out of ideas . The opening sequence comes out swinging.It is one of the most creative and inventive uses of the medium. As a matter of fact the first half of the film is very good, unfortunately, it fails to maintain the same creative energy, when Myers goes back to using bodily fluid jokes ad infinitum.The character of "Goldmember"(Mike Myers),threatens the world with demolition, if his demands are not met.Austin Powers teams up with his father Niles Powers(Michael Caine)and Foxy Cleopatra(Beyonce' Knowles), Austin's current Love interest, to defeat Goldmember, Dr. Evil and the rest of the Clan.Their adventures take them thru time to the swinging 60's and back to the present, with a major twist in Dr. Evil's lair near the end !Michael Caine has great comic timing, when he has material to work with, he should have been given more. Beyonce' steals her scenes with terrific moves and talent that just radiates from the screen . Verne Troiyer is wonderful as the vertically challenged Mini-Me. Watch for the transformation of Seth Green into a Ron Howard lookalike.Unfortunately, with all of the Star Power, the script lags the talent, and you have too many people , standing around as filler. All in all, a fun time, if you can forgive the script and Myers for not providing more for the film !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Austin Powers 3 was hilarious. It is extremely entertaining and I laughed all the time. There are some new interesting characters including the latest villain Goldmember, also played by Mike Myers, Cleopatra, a foxy sidekick of Austin's, and Austin's equally horny father Nigel. There is also a cameo of Britney Spears in which she performs a dance-off with Austin. But there are still the same hilarious characters including Fat Bastard, Mini-Me, Dr.Evil with his quirky buddies, and more. If you've seen the first two Austin Powers movies, you must see this one because it is the funniest one of all. Plus, there is a huge surprise ending that is too good to say. I recommend this movie for anyone up for tons of comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than "Spy Who Shagged Me"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...but still not even a third as good as the original. There really aren't a whole lot of new joke concepts in this one. It's mostly recycled material from the first two. The only real new joke is the one with the Japanese subtitles, and even that fell a little flat. The plot is slightly better than "Spy who shagged me", but nowhere near as imaginative as the first one.(It is also strange to note, that in the third installment, they have strayed completely from the storyline of Austin being a fish out of water after being frozen for 30 years. Perhaps they were hoping we would forget?)Still, Mike Myers portrayal of the villain Goldmember is one of the few saving bright spots of the movie...a welcome addition to Myers' family of his characters.Overall, I give this one four out of ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>funny but weaker...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Austin Powers is funny. Kind of silly funny, like almost every character associated with Mike Myers. and, as much as I enjoyed Goldmember, I felt is was likely the weakest of the trilogy. Myers returns as the swinging sixties sexy superspy, and this time he finds that Dr Evil and a villain named Goldmember are in cahoots to, once again, try and hold the world ransom, lest terrible things happen. Teamed up with Beyonce Knowles as the sexy agent Foxy Cleopatra and the cinema superstar Michael Caine as his father, Austin has to defeat Dr Evil and Goldmember. So, the humor came rolling a mile a minute. Problem is, some of the stuff is only funny the first time you see it, and then you have to wait a really long time to forget about it before watching it again. And that's partly the problem - a lot of Myer's humor is repetitive, and more often than not vulgar (although it's guaranteed to get laugh from the 13 year old boys demographic). And some of the characters were excessive to the already packed runtime. For example, Fat Bastard, the portly Scottish lackey, didn't even need to be in this movie - he didn't exactly contribute much to the plot. To a lesser extent, there was less focus on Dr Evil than on Goldmember - you'd expect this, because of the title, but it just seems to grind away at the movie. Overall, I have to say it's not the best Austin Powers film, but it's funny when it needs to be. It's what I'd call a really good time-waster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the funniest of the three installments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>AUSTIN POWERS IN GOLDMEMBER(2002)*** Mike Myers, Beyonce Knowles, Michael Caine.Dr. Evil and Mini-Me have somehow escaped from a maximum security prison and the duo team up with Goldmember. Together they formulate a plan for world domination. And this particular scheme requires a large amount of time-travel, and kidnapping Austin Powers' father, England's master spy, Nigel Powers. As Austin chases Dr. Evil, Mini-Me and Goldmember through time, he stops in 1975 to "connect" with an old girlfriend, detective Foxy Cleopatra, and requests her help to track the villains and save his father.In my opinion, this series is overrated. But I would have to admit, this was probably the funniest of the three. The other two I gave **1/2 stars, I gave this ***. This is probably the least crude(in sexual terms, although it still has some) and the plot is the best for this one. And the girl character in this one was the least annoying. So, this is the funniest, and my favorite of the three: a light spoof.PG-13: crude humor, some sexual innudeno, comic violence, and language.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can put up with the over-indulgent flatulence/feces jokes to see stuff like the inspired "Prison Rap" with Dr. Evil and Mini-Me...and I'm not even a rap fan! From the Babes shaking their booties, to the part where they have to "bleep" out what Dr. Evil is rapping (I swear I hear him say "splooge" in there!) it is by far my favorite part of the movie.Austin movies are all pretty much pop culture fests wrapped in the guise of film-making anyway, and you can't take it too seriously, of course.Fans familiar with Mike Myers' interest in hockey may recognize the sweater/jersey that Mini-Me is wearing during one part of the prison rap...behind the giant bling-bling chain around his neck is a Toronto Maple Leafs logo! Leave it to Mike to sneak that in his movie.I enjoyed this one at least as much as the first two...love it when Fat Bastard is hanging from the wire and says "Oh, isn't this magical!" It's moments like that keep me coming back to the A.P. trilogy. Oh, and Beyonce is a total babe! Not much of an actress, but what a Babe, and what a voice too!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Starring: Mike Myers, Seth Green, Michael Caine and Beyonce KnowlesGuest Appearances by: Tom Cruise, Britney Spears, John Travolta, Kevin Spacey, Danny DeVito, Gwyneth Paltrow, The Osburnes and Nathan LaneGenre: ComedyRated PG-13This is the third adventure of Austin Powers! In this third installment of the Austin Powers trilogy, Austin Powers' (Mike Myers) father, Nigel Powers (Michael Caine) has been kidnapped by Goldmember (Mike Myers)! So then Austin goes to get information from Dr. Evil (Mike Myers) on where to found Goldmember and that was 1975. As Austin chases Dr. Evil, Mini-Me and Goldmember through time, he stops in 1975 to "connect" with an old girlfriend, detective Foxy Cleopatra (Beyonce Knowles), and requests her help to track the villains and save his father. In this movie Scott (Seth Green) finally decides to become evil and follow his father's foot steps! Dr. Evil's plan in this movie is that he is going to have a meteor hit the Earth by pulling it down with a magnetic laser. The funniest part in this movie is when we see Fat Bastard (Mike Myers) in a sumo-wrestling contest in Tokyo. Another funny part is when Austin and Foxy are at this place in Tokyo they were trying to talk to this guy and he is speaking in Japanese and some stuff keeps blocking the subtitles and it makes him look like he is saying nasty things! They were lots of other parts I liked! Another thing is that in this movie is that Dr. Evil finally gets what he had wanted which was sharks with laser beams attached to their heads. There has got to be 4th Austin Powers movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>IMDb mark: 6I don't understand why people like the Austin Powers movies so much. I don't understand why I like them. They are very silly, they are vulgar and they are rude. Or maybe that is exactly why I like them... 'Austin Powers in Goldmember' follows in the footsteps of the previous two incarnations and yet it still is appealing to the public. But I don't know whether the makers of the film are still mocking James Bond movies, or if they just saw that the series is a success and are trying to squeeze as much as they can out of it.-Humour: There are some great jokes in this movie. Many of them are just updates from the previous films, but there are some new ones, too, and the new ones are the best, in my opinion. The lines are still racy, of course. Look for the line I chose as the title of this review. 21/25-Physical Comedy: Not too many moments of physical comedy can be seen, given that the Austin Powers movies have always been about funny expressions with double meaning, which is why they are surely not as popular among people who don't speak English. Mike Myers and Verne Troyer, who plays Mini-Me, provide basically all of the physical comedy. They still couldn't find a funny female character, even though Beyonce Knowles is a bit better than the totally unfunny Elizabeth Hurley and Heather Graham. 7/20-Plot: By the way they advertised the movie, the plot was supposed to be that Austin goes back in time to save his father. But that really is a small part of the whole film, the rest being a sequence of events quite hard to follow logically. 4/15-Ending: I liked the ending a lot. Of course, taste varies. 9/10-Theme: A spy who has everything tries to get a little more and to save the world, while he's at it. But it's not a bad idea for a parody and, as long as it's funny, it's all good. 9/10-Nudity: There is no nudity in this film. 0/8-Cast: This is very impressive. Mike Myers in multiple roles, Beyonce Knowles, Seth Green and Michael Caine are all fairly well-known stars. But there are also great cameos, by Tom Cruise, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kevin Spacey, Danny DeVito, Steven Spielberg, Britney Spears, and more. 8/8-Genre: This is a comedy. 4/4--&gt;Overall: 62/100It's a good continuation of the previous two parts. I'm sure it won't disappoint the fans of the series. But the type of humour might not please everybody and, just for the record, my personal favourite is still part two, The Spy Who Shagged Me.

Dr. Evil again is tremendously hilarious like he has been in the past Austin Powers film. I don't really like when Dr. Evil becomes good because I have always liked him better as the bad guy but he is still hilarious. Scott was even funny in this, like when he was running away in that weird kind of run. That was hilarious!! Oh and can you believe it, Mini Me was really funny too because I really didn't like him in the second film that much. Pretty much all the parts in the film were hilarious like when Austin and Dr. Evil are younger and numerous of other extremely funny scenes. Highly recommend.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is funny. Anyone would laugh, but it was not as good as the first two movies because:a) We hardly see Fat Bastard. In the second movie, he was funny as hell and now he is cut down to two scenes?! Bulls--t!b) The ending was creepy. I'm not going to ruin it, but when you watch the end, you'll also think it's creepy.Besides those two faults, this movie was very funny. But there weren't many appearences by celebrities as the first two. In this movie, there was only Nathan Lane, John Travolta, Burt Bacharach, Britney Spears, The Ozbournes, Kevin Spacey, Rob Lowe, Steven Speilberg, Gwyneth Paltrow, Danny DeVito, Quincy Jones, a return appearence by Clint Howard, and Tom Cruise. I wish that Felicity Shagwell(Heather Graham) of the second movie was in this, though. Her and Austin make a better team than Austin and Foxy Cleopatra.Final comment: This movie was very funny. All of the main characters, especially Mini-Me, were hilarious. And Mike Myers is the man playing four characters(Austin, Dr. Evil, Fat Bastard, and Goldmember). I recommend this movie to everyone.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A weak follow up to a hilarious series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a fan of the Austin Powers films, I anxiously awaited the release of the third film, 'Austin Powers in Goldmember'. I very much liked the parody of spy films (the James Bond series in particular), and I also liked some of the originality that Myers added in. However, I was heavily disappointed. On first glance, I enjoyed it, but on the second and third viewing, my opinion severely dropped. The characters from the previous two return, of course the main characters being Austin Powers (Mike Myers), Dr. Evil (Mike Myers), and Fat Bastard (Mike Myers). But this time, Austin Powers also plays a secondary villain, named Goldmember. The plot of the film is that Powers must stop Goldmember from using a satellite to destroy the world, and Dr. Evil from helping him. Along for the ride is Mini Me (Verne Troyer), Power's new sidekick Foxxy Cleoptra (Beyoncé Knowles), Scott Evil (Seth Green), and Nigel Powers (Michael Caine). The cast works out well, Myers does well (as always) as in the multiple roles, and Caine is a nice addition to the cast. However, the character of Cleoptra annoyed the hell out of me. It was the exact cliché 70's female action star, and she pretty much went through out the film practically yelling lame bits of dialogue. The script stooped, and it seems that not quite as much energy was put into the third as much as the first two. The film felt just.. dumb, there was no more of that hilarious original humor Myers managed to inject into the first two films. Instead, it's lame joke after lame joke after lame joke, and the humor gets much more raunchy. Fortunately, the film has its moments and Roach at least tries to hold the film together. 'Austin Powers in Goldmember' is a very disappointing end(?) to one of my favorite series. The humor just wasn't as good, and the film just lacked the creativity of the first two. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weakest of the 3 but still fun (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Austin Powers: Goldmember is the third film in the series and once again stars Mike Myers as several of the characters. In my opinion, it is probably the weakest of the three movies but also contains one of the best opening scenes I have seen in a film of this sort. We are used to Austin Powers films starting well but I feel in this case that the film does not build on its strong start and fails to capitalise on its momentum. By catching Doctor Evil early, the usual driving force behind the films is lost. Also, the Dr Evil-Mini Me song and dance echoing the second film is not as good as the previous incarnation.However, that is not to say that there are not good points in the film. Beyonce Knowles plays Foxxy Cleopatra well and is an improvement in leading ladies - she is funny and sexy as would be expected but also adds more meat and bite to the character than other "Austin girls". In particular, the Nathan Lane cameo scene is very funny. In addition, there are the usual amusing sight, flashback and language gags which still work as well as they did in the first movie.There are some characters that don't work in this one though. Michael Caine plays Nigel Powers, Austin's father and in my opinion is just a weak parody of his own persona. He appears happy and at ease hamming it up but he acts like he's in a joke that no-one else knows and too often is left without a laugh. Likewise, Goldmember is a weak character and there are periods of time where the movie goes by and he does nothing. Finally, Fred Savage as the mole. I just don't find the joke funny and it breaks up the narrative of the film too often.Overall, it is still a likeable movie and fans of the other Austin Powers movies will still like this, just maybe not as much. It is an easy, fun movie and as such, is watchable.6.5/10</fullReview>

I hope there is and is not going to be a fourth film, I hope there is because I would love to see what's next in store for Austin and his brother Dr.Evil, but if there was to be a fourth I would just like to know why this movie could not have been saved til the last film in the series, because with Austin and Dr.Evil turning out to be brothers just makes me and lots of other fans begin to lose interest since Daddy Powers was brought into the series. I hope there is not going to be a fourth Austin Powers film because it just would not be the same with Dr.Evil now as Austin's brother. Should the truth behind Austin and Dr.Evil have been revealed? Is this the end? Who knows. Frankly I would like to have found out that Dr.Evil and Austin are brothers at the end of the series, I do believe there could have been a few more movies before this one. Whether you agree with me or not, that is your opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In many ways it is, in a few ways it isn't. The main plus for Goldmamber is the character, 'ooooooooooh, thatsh a keeper'! He saved this film, along with Caine, from mediocrity. Dr. Evil is good in this but i've seen enough of Austin Powers' character. He has become to predictable. If Myers is going to make another film a spin off involving maybe DR. Evil could be the answer. Also I wasn't particularly impressed with Beyonce.Still very funny in parts though, and very quotable.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Easily the lesser of the series, its probably about time Austin bottled his mojo and retired. Lame joke after lame joke masquerades as a storyline in this 3rd outing for the goofy James Bond wannabe. Myers plays no less than 4 characters here, but again - its Doctor Evil that steals the show.Worth watching only for the hilarious cameos at the beginning and the gorgeous Beyonce Knowles, who proves that she can actually act as well.All in all very average, but anyone under 16 will probably love it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must admit that I came to this film as a complete ?Austin Powers' novice and I was totally amazed when I discovered how many characters Mike Myers plays in this movie. I could have sworn Dr. Evil was being played by Paul Reubens - I was flabbergasted when I found out otherwise. This is an amazingly surreal movie and the gags are endless but what a pity so many of them are at the level of toilet humour. This guy has so much talent it's a crime to waste it on so many crude and disgusting jokes. Even so, I laughed myself silly at many of the situations especially the ?medical check-up' scene and the scene where Nathan Lane acts as the ?third party' in a conversation with Foxxy Cleopatra. The musical score is ?groovy' (`It's A Hard Luck Life' sequence is hilarious), the costume design sensational and Foxxy Cleopatra is divine perfection - hey, that wasn't Mike Myers as well was it?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Weakest Austin Powers Movie Is Still Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the title suggests, I think that the first two Austin Powers movies were better than this one. Having said that, what's really not to like about a movie that continues to have me laughing on a fairly regular basis every time I see it?Mike Myers has this part - or should I say these parts - down to a perfect "T." His portrayals of Austin and Dr. Evil are hilarious. In this movie he adds the character of Goldmember to the repertoire, and also reprises the role of Fat Bastard. It was only this latter part that I found him disappointing in. Fat Bastard wasn't nearly as funny as he was in the second of the series. I liked Michael Caine's portrayal of Austin's father Nigel, and the exploration of the relationship between the two, with a resolution that wasn't entirely a surprise. I did wonder why in the world it was felt necessary to open and close the movie with the portrayal of a fictional movie (within the movie) that Steven Spielberg was supposedly directing about Austin Powers' life. It gave the opportunity to allow for some cameo appearances by some big name actors (John Travolta, Kevin Spacey, Danny DeVito, Tom Cruise and Gwyneth Paltrow are all supposedly acting in this fictional movie) but it tended to confuse the issue a bit, and the cameos weren't really necessary; neither was the fictional movie integral at all to the actual movie.Having said that, there are some hilarious moments here. The fight between Austin and Mini-Me; the "shmoke and a pancake" scene which for some reason had me hooting; and the priceless physical that Austin undergoes on Dr. Evil's submarine. As per usual for Austin Powers, the humour is sometimes crude and sexual innuendo abounds, but this is nevertheless a very funny movie.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though the movie IS better than the previous sequel (which isn't saying much), it still was a waste of time. I think Mike could be much more clever than poopoo and peepee jokes. His talent is going to waste with these Austin Powers movies. The first was great and none could really top it. The sequels are just pure stupidity. Perhaps they are meant for kids? Do yourself a favor and don't even waste the money to rent this one (or the previous sequel). It does have SOME humorous moments but they are too far and few in between the mindless childishness. Mike.. have some dignity please.</fullReview>

For those of who who think Myers is a genius and the Nathan Lane bit in this 'comedy' was funny, go dig up a copy of AFTER THE FOX, starring Peter Sellers and written by Neil Simon. You will see that Myers theft of this gag is an absolute sham and less than a pale imitation. In the original, it's clever, surreal, and very very funny. In Myers', it's turned senselessly around, badly done, and in such a way that it destroys the entire premise of the gag! Does Myers even know how to write comedy? Myers' best work was the first half of SO I MARRIED AN AXE MURDERER, he should have quit back then.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Over-the-top silliness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you were a fan of the first two Austin Powers movies you're going to love Goldmember. It's a continuation of the over-the-top silliness that made the first two so popular. Many of the same elements are in place from picture to picture ? the forced perspective sight gags, the rapid fire banter between Dr. Evil and his son Scott, elaborate dance numbers ? but somehow instead of feeling like we've seen it before it seems fresh. For the most part it is Mike Myers (in four, count ?em, four roles this time) and his unerring sense of `the silly' that makes this material so watchable. Myers can push the envelope further than almost any other comic, and still come off as cute. Myers has elevated bathroom humour to high art. He's Benny Hill, not Tom Green. Destiny's Child lead singer Beyonce Knowles is Foxxy Cleopatra, Austin's love interest in Goldmember. This is her feature film debut, and she handles herself nicely. She doesn't have a great deal to do, but she has a lot of charisma and looks great on screen. The full Austin Powers' repertory company is back, Michael York, Robert Wagner, Verne `Mini-Me' Troyer and Seth Green, with some new faces added. I won't spoil the movie by giving away the cameos, but I will advise you to be on time and not miss the first 15 minutes of the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>James Bond is so over the top anyway that any spoof needs to be completely ridiculous. To be fair, Mike Myers has never aimed for anything else, but the first Austen Powers film ran out of steam about halfway through. This, the third installment, is actually much better, relentlessly piling on inventive but terrible gags and aided by some hilarious celebrity cameos, with Michael Caine's self-parody the best. The humour is never less than crude (sample joke - first Japanese girl: "I am Fook Mi"; second Japanese girl: "And I am Fook Yu"). Yes, it's that awful, but somehow you still have to laugh. Better than it should be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Austin Powers has indeed got his mojo back...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll be honest with you here. I totally DESPISED the second installment of the trilogy after really enjoying the first, and as a result I had no intention of seeing "Goldmember". However a mate of mine lent me the DVD yesterday and I thought I'd give it a go - although I was fully expecting to hate it. I was wrong - this made me laugh a lot, especially some of the cameos early in the film. Plus of course, you could actually have sympathy with Austin again due to the father-son relationship wonderfully played by Michael Caine. The only thing that detracted from my enjoyment of the film was the inclusion of Fat Bastard, who remains as unfunny as a terminal illness. Still, this is six billion times better than the spectacularly lame "Spy Who Shagged Me" and purely because it won me back over after such a travesty I will give it a satisfying 7/10.</fullReview>

No plot (almost), celebrity cameo and of course the rude word quick cutting (not in the first, but it was funny). Not the rehash that was 'The Spy Who Sh*gged Me', 'Goldmember' also has the advantage of Micheal Caine's hilarous turn as Austin's father. Meanwhile, two supporting characters (Scott Evil &amp; Mini-Me) get two subplots to chew on and dig that opening (rent it just for that).

		<shortDescription>Embarrassing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an embarrassing film. Mike Myers can do funny sketches but funny sketches do not a film make. Apart from the intro and the sketch where Austin stands on Mini Me's shoulders I can find nothing to recommend in this film. OK, colours and clothes, but those are fluff (get over Moulin Rouge, Australia). The script is weak and the whole thing goes from lame to embarassing in about 15 minutes. The only script jokes that aim above the teen belt are passe, post-modern cleverisms that aren't real wit since post-modernism is now a fact of life. On the whole, I like a bit of culture-bashing but there is no flattery in the imitations here, something that is essential for the humour to come out. It smacks of laziness to get into the psychology of the nation/character (Scheisse is German not Dutch for God's sake). The bashing comes across as mean, without being funny which is unforgiveable for 'comedy'. Add to that a lot of Myers self-indulgence and you'll cringe off your seat and leave early.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mr. Powers said it himself - "That is SO not funny."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Austin Powers in Goldmember" starts off with Steven Spielberg directing "Austin Powers in Austinpussy" with Gwyneth Paltrow as Dixie Normous (har de har har) and Tom Cruise, Kevin Spacey, Danny DeVito and another well-known performer - not revealed until near the end - in the roles played by Mike Myers, Mike Myers, Verne Troyer and Mike Myers respectively (oh, all right - Austin Powers, Dr. Evil, Mini-Me and Goldmember). In fact, the movie's insistence on cramming in several cameos in the first ten minutes along with an overelaborate "Soul Bossanova" musical number indicates a motif that runs through the movie - self-indulgence.I purposely avoided "Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me" as part of my refusal to see anything involving the presence of Madonna, but this movie might not have been much worse had she been involved. The storyline of Dr. Evil retrieving Dutch criminal genius Goldmember from the past (why?) and having him kidnap Austin's father Nigel as part of his plan to flood the world just lies there - the problem is that the movie knows it's a rehash and a send-up, and in gleefully playing up its phoniness (not least in Fat Bastard's joke about wire fighting) there's barely a single sincere moment in the entire movie, a fatal mistake given that father-son relationships are a major plot point.The movie's knowledge of its repetitiveness doesn't excuse its laziness either; had the jokes been funny it would have been another matter, but too many are DOA, tasteless or both. Plus it's hard to ignore the suspicion that Myers is enjoying himself a lot more than the audience (what was the point of the "It's The Hard Knocks Life" number with Dr. Evil and Mini-Me?), and Goldmember himself is painful and surplus to requirements. It certainly does well on the eye-candy scale - Britney, Gwyneth, Beyonce Knowles - but other than Seth Green as Scott, the only time the movie genuinely works is when it goes to 1975 all too briefly, featuring the only time Beyonce sings on screen in the movie and the movie's one truly hilarious scene (involving our hero having to talk to her through Nathan Lane). And just when you think it can't get worse, up pop the Osbournes...Since even "1941" was better, it's too bad Spielberg didn't direct for real. (And if I were George S. Clinton - who scored all three movies - I'd not be too pleased at seeing Quincy Jones conduct the scoring orchestra in the opening.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first seven minutes--a parody of `Mission: Impossible II'--is chock full of celebrities. After that, there's virtually no reason to keep watching--it's another `Saturday Night Live' sketch that goes on far too long. Mike Myers' indulgences remain as unchecked as ever which means that skits he thinks are funny, regardless of what anyone else might think, are included in all their humorless glory. Myers is probably the only comedian in movies today who doesn't seem to have the slightest notion about timing--all he wants to do is focus on scatological and homo jokes--and how he can be proud to deliver a comedy with so much dead air is beyond the ken of this reviewer. There are only two good lines and they are `Preparation H feels good on the whole' and `You're a cunning linguist and I am a master debater!' Now you don't have to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Austin Powers - you either love it, or you hate it, and they're only getting better.If you're already a fan of Mike Myers, are familiar with his background and the type of movies he has already done, you can appreciate his humour even more.Austin Powers is best watched multiple times, as the catch phrases get in your head, which make them funnier each time you hear them. A picture of Austin doing his little groovy-baby sneer can make me laugh in an instant.The first time I saw 3 I was a little disappointed with the Goldmember character (he was just sortof dumb-gross), and I'm not really a fan of Beyonce, but watching it again after it was released on video, I enjoyed it 10x's more, and the Infinifilm feature on the DVD release is great. Michael Caine is a great addition (I hope he appears later), as well as Fred Savage, what can I say? Mo-le Mo-le Mo-le! I can also do without Britney Spears, but her appearance was an interesting idea.Don't watch any of the Austin Powers' movies out of order, and if you are not familiar with Mike Myers' brand of humour, they will not make sense to you. Goldmember was an A+ addition to the series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Austin Powers!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the amazingly funny 'Austin Powers' and the average 'The Spy Who Shagged Me', everyone was wondering what could Mike Myers do to keep it fresh. Well, he made a damn good film that's for sure. World famous super spy Austin Powers (Mike Myers) is living a happy life in 2002. He has defeated Dr. Evil (Mike Myers again), put him and Mini-Me (Verne Troyer) behind bars and he is to be knighted. Things go wrong when his father, Nigel Powers (Michael Caine)is absent at the knighting ceremony and kidnapped by Goldmember (Mike Myers' newest role, a freaky Dutch disco dancer in 1975. Austin travels back to save his father and teams up with the sexy Foxxy Cleopatra (Beyonce Knowles). Between all this, there are a pair of Japanese twin sisters called Fook Mi and Fook Yu, a dance number which helps Dr. Evil escape, a crazy Sumo scene involving Fat Bastard (Mike Myers yet again) and a submarine in the shape of Dr. Evil himself. 'Goldmember' is the best film in the Austin Powers series and one of the best comedies of 2002 full stop. Everything from Goldmember trying to explain who Austin's Fahza is to Foxxy communicating to Austin through a hilarious Nathan Lane, every joke is milked out of the Austin Powers phenomenon and it's worth every penny. This film had me in tears with laughters. I mean, the smallest things like the way Dr. Evil and Frau (Mindy Sterling) say 'ya!' to each other or the fact that Scott (Seth Green) is so evil he's losing his hair had me rolling about the floor in laughter. Few comedies reach the near perfect mark but 'Goldmember' is one of them. To be honest, I wouldn't mind seeing an 'Austin Powers 4' right now considering how good this is. In the previous film, Mini-Me's scenes felt somewhat unsettling but here he is original and amusing. It's pure genius this film and to try to sum that up would be hard. The only part that really lets you down is Britney Spears' cameo. They were obviously just casting her to get a bigger audience. At least she had a funny joke during the end credits. Jay Roach returns behind the camera in what is his funniest film yet, and that's counting 'Meet the Parents'. Mike Myers and Michael McCullers once again write the screenplay and it's a real zinger. With cameos from everyone to Tom Cruise to John Travolta, it's sure to entertain!</fullReview>

The second one, in my opinion, was the crown jewel in the series. I saw that one on opening night and it brought the house down. Rarely have I ever laughed so hard at a movie. I can't explain why, but the second AP movie is extremely funny, and almost is worthy of the title of comedic genius. This entry, however, was a huge dispointment for many reasons.I, like many others on this site, got this as a Christmas present. I was really excited to see it since I missed it in theaters and I loved the second one so much. The simple truth is that this movie really isn't that funny. The opening is hilarious with all of the cameos, but then, it just goes downhill. There are a few scenes, however, that ARE laugh out loud hilarious, but they are few and far between, especially not what we would expect from an AP movie. These scenes, too, are mostly borrowed and expanded upon from other 'sight' gags from the first two, which were extremely funny. They're funny this time around, and are appropriately paid homage to, yet, when elaborations on existing jokes from previous sequels are the best part of a sequel, then something is terribly wrong. There is no plot in this one, though the other two had razor thin plots, at least they were coherent. This one, to me, made no sense. It seemed like too many scenes were tacked together or not well thought out. And the Goldmember character...totally not funny. I know, it was a shocker to me too, since Dr. Evil, and yes, even Fat Bastard, to me, were both incredibly hilarious. What was supposed to be funny about him? The fact that he speaks crappy English? The fact that he eats his own skin? The fact that people keep making 'Stupid Dutchman' remarks? The fact that the filmmakers thought we, the audience are too stupid and braindead to realize the difference between an inteligently played and scripted animated character, and a pathetic excuse for one? I think the latter of the four questions holds the most merit. And making Dr. Evil and Austin brothers? Congratulations! You've officially ruined the franchise! Yes, all of the old jokes and the times where Mini-Me gets the stuffing beating out of him weren't enough for them to ruin a good franchise, b\c now, they totally ruined the rivalry between Austin and argulably one of the funniest villans in movie history. Hopefully, they will read reviews like the ones on this site and NOT PURSUE an AP 4. I'm sorry, but Seth Green is not much of an actor and just can't compare with being the bad guy like Dr. Evil can.Overall, a below average movie. Why do I say this? Comedies are supposed to be funny. This is one of those movies that the producers knew that people would flock in droves to see just b\c of the title rather than the content. And they succeeded, since this movie made a boat-load full of cash. This series has run its course and has officially kicked the bucket. What amazes me is that word of mouth (usually reliable with movies) did not prevent millions upon millions of devoted fans and moviegoers alike to be treated to 95 minutes of bordom and pure disapointment. I rarely say this, but anyone who gives this movie better than average praise truly has no taste in movies. Trust me, there are silly AND intelligent movies out there (Naked Gun, Airplane, Monty Python and the Holy Grail, Blazing Saddles to name a few). This movie, save for a totally wasted Michael Caine, is totally recycled from the previous two movies. No originality at all. At least the first two had a sense of class to them. I am so shocked to see that this one has a 6.5 rating on IMDB! Maybe there truly is no hope left for Hollywood being able to dish out good movies anymore. For those of you who don't believe me, go ahead, I invite you to see for yourself who lame this one is, but if you do, make sure you rent it first and not buy it. If you made the same mistake as the person who got it for me did, you would be inadvertantly rewarding stupid and lethargic filmmakers who I know can do much better. Shame on you, Mike Myers! You have so much talent, and this is the best you can do? Well, maybe the last laugh is on me, since I know this one made mad cash at the box office, but if we as a society keep rewarding mediocrity, then that is what we will always receive. To be fair, I was thinking about giving it a 4/10 since it did make me laugh really hard about three times, but that rating is truly pushing it mainly b\c of the added disgust at knowing that I've been had and knowing that the filmmakers were capable, and compared to the previous two films, in a way, obligated to make a much better film. Overall, a complete waste of time. 3/10 stars. That is my story and I'm sticking to it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All of the above correctly describe "Austin Powers in Goldmember." It is, by far, the worst of the three Austin Powers movies. The events of this movie--the revelation that Dr. Evil is Austin's brother, the transformation of Mini-Me from villain to good guy--seem to close the door on the possibility that there will be a fourth Austin Powers movie. Given the disaster that is "Goldmember", the potential lack of a sequel can only be viewed in a positive light.The far-too-numerous celebrity cameos (Donna D'Errico and a cast of thousands) seem to be nothing more than filler--they obviously didn't have enough of a story for the allotted time--and a distraction from the fact that "Goldmember" was little more than a recycled version of the first two movies. The philosophy behind "Goldmember" seems to have been, "Let's dust off the same old characters and have them do the same old things as they did in the first two movies and see if people still find it all entertaining." Granted, there were some variations in "Goldmember" on the first two Austin Powers movies. Beyonce Knowles was brought in as Foxy Cleopatra, the newest love interest for Austin, and Michael Caine appeared as Nigel Powers, Austin and Dr. Evil's father. Beyond that, "Goldmember" did not break much new ground, with the exception of the title character, a Dutch roller disco fan responsible for the kidnapping of Nigel Powers (Caine). Goldmember took a lot of the focus away from Dr. Evil who, in "Goldmember", seemed to be a mere shadow of the hilariously clueless dolt he was in previous Austin Powers movies.If you haven't seen "Goldmember" yet, do yourself a favor. Don't watch it. You'll have wasted 95 minutes that you won't be able to get back. Surely you have better things to do with your time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I find it hard to believe that this film gets a rating over 4 and that there are so many positive comments. I thought it was awful. It's a movie of nothing but pee and butt jokes, some which aren't even actually jokes, but more like just comments I assume uttered simply for the sake of shock value. It's not like Michael Myers is a dumb guy. He's capable of writing better stuff than this. Nothing the Goldmember character says is remotely funny, as is the Fat Bastard character, who is there simply to gross out. The two main Myer's characters basically do what they've done in the first two films. The only time I laughed was during the cameos of big name actors. The film itself is just terrible, but I guess there are enough 13 year old kids out there who liked it enough to warrant another sequel. Blah!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many problems with this one starting with the Toilet humor. Most of which I found to be stupid. Myers did okay but adding Goldmember just made every other character that much weaker. The ending was also pretty stupid. In my opinion this series should have stopped at 2. It was obvious that this movie had no point to it besides making the trillions of dollars that it did.Beyonce was okay for a first movie although she didn't impress me she didn't do a terrible job with what she had. No chemistry was made between Austin and Foxy even though they had history. There was just something wrong with this whole movie.The cameo's were okay I guess although didn't really have a purpose. Tom Cruise and Gwyneth were good. Devito was strange as usual. I was very disappointed in the Britney Spears one where Austin basically humiliates her before blowing her head off. Why would you do something so cruel as a cameo?Overall not a disgraceful movie. Don't get me wrong not good either. 4 out of 10</fullReview>

The ending is horrible. It's pretty much saying there will be no more Austin Powers movies. But what made me still like this movie was how extremely funny Mike Myers can be and was in this movie. The movie was almost like an episode of Saturday Night Live where each scene was like a skit. This made the movie very funny but it lacked so much that forces me to give it **1/2. But if you liked the first two you should definitely see this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Simply put, I was VERY disappointed in this movie. I didn't want to be, but wow, I just was. Really, I don't know if they COULD have out down the first two, but it seems here that they didn't even try. It's flat, dark, and dry.To start things off, I can't say how disappointed I was in Dr. Evil in this movie. In the first two movies, he was so amazingly funny, every word he said was laugh out loud funny, it became part of his character. What in the HELL happened to him in this third one?? Honestly, It seems like Mike Meyers forgot how to make him funny. He doesn't talk like Dr. Evil, he doesn't act like Dr. Evil, and he doesn't even look like Dr. Evil. Maybe i'm being a little harsh here on this fact, because I thought the Dr. Evil in the first two movies was SO funny, that he was really the only reason I was so excited to see this movie. I was just disappointed. Really, it's just Mike Meyers wearing a big nose in this one. It's just flat. (And did anyone else notice how Dr. Evil's eyes were glowing bright blue in this one, not that it matters, it was just weird). Where has Dr. Evil gone?! What has happened to him, I hope they find out, and bring back the REAL Dr.Evil for the next one. Now that i've vented my anger at the un-funniness of him in this movie, I'll move on.In the second installment, they started to repeat the same jokes from the first one, and it got kind of repetative and annoying, in this third installment, it's just down right rediculous. Why are they STILL doing the gag when Frow yells her directions so loudly, that everyone else jumps in fright. I didn't think that was all that funny in the first one, and after doing it so many times in ALL three movies, it's just humiliating now. Also, the gag when Scott is trying to talk, and Dr. Evil won't let him, if you've seen the movies, you know what I mean, it was classic in the first one. Just great in the second one, and it WOULD be funny in the third one, but like I stated above, it's just not the same Dr. Evil that i've grown to know and love. And we're just waiting for it to happen. I felt that way through most of this movie. I was just waiting for the jokes that I KNEW were coming, and they always came. There was nothing new.Don't get me wrong, I did laugh two or three times in this movie, but for the most part, it was just kind of embarrassing. I still love Mike Meyers, I just think they tried, and missed the mark with this movie. He should give us one more, and really give it a punch, like in the first two.All in all, dissapointing.</fullReview>

The best thing about the first two was that almost everyone in the films had a legitimate role. But this one had celebrities everywhere and had nothing to do with the storyline.

It's no wonder that this third film had to rely on adolescent humor to win it's audience, since most of the viewers who'd enjoy it aren't probably familiar with the films that spawned Mike's original idea (CASINO ROYALE, OUR MAN FLINT, DANGER DIABOLIK and the like); although capitalizing on 70's chic like that 70's TV show probably made it work for some younger viewers.

		<fullReview>Back in 1997 Austin Powers created quite a buzz as a really funny James Bond parody that was a sleeper hit, I saw it and thought it was incredibly original and generally laughed my ass off for the entire duration. The characters were incredibly entertaining and fun and the movie didn't feel forced.However, this movie is the definition of forced. In the very opening you get Tom Cruise and Gwyneth Paltrow doing a very very unfunny Austin Powers movie parody (Note to writers: Self parody does not work in a parody!), and the movie proceeds to Austin powers opening by dancing for no reason (you can't really level the same claim at the first one because the scene was appropriately goofy and relevant for what it was) and for whatever reason Austin walks in on Britney Spears's set and blows her head up. Huh? Oh yeah, and there's a LOT of product placement in this movie, a LOT, to the point where it's annoying the viewer.Some of the bits that would've been funny for instance some toilet humor involving a fountain and a shadow puppets scene behind a curtain would've been very funny if they didn't go on for like 10 minutes and seems to drag.I won't even bother ragging on Beyonce Knowle's acting because her lines were incredibly stupid to begin with and she didn't have a very significant role, either she is really that bad or she's just there to cash a check.Overall the main problem I have with this movie is that all the characters were basically destroyed by it and the series has self destructed while they already intend to make new ones. Goldmember picks at his skin, can bend into gross positions, and has well, a gold member. Why am i supposed to care about this character? Do they intend to make him a recurring villain, because he's awful. Dr. Evil and Scott pull a role reversal, Fat Bastard is stretched (pun intended) beyond the bounds of all stupidity in this one, and he was a really awful character to begin with.Stay away from this tripe, I can't even lay blame squarely on the writers because even Michael Caine and Mike Myers sounded wooden and were just rattling off catchphrases. Don't even bother spending money on a rental.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Generally, I don't mind silliness if the creator is successful in carrying out his intent, but most of AUSTIN POWERS IN GOLDMEMBER relies on potty humor that takes a great deal of patience to watch after a while.I liked the cameos with Tom Cruise and Gwyneth Paltrow. If the movie had continued in the vein they were going, it would have been much more sophisticated. Mike Myers's versatility in characterization is nothing short of impressive. His Scottish accent is absolutely amazing; however, you can catch that in SHREK and avoid the scenes in GOLDMEMBER that make you want to vomit. I'd like to see Myers in some more mature material, ? la Blake Edwards.One of the reasons entertainers frequently deign to such crudeness is because this subject material is the type a broader range of his audience will understand. Now that he has amused those of baser tastes, I challenge Myers to come up with something for his more intelligent fans. Shakespeare proved that you can write to the masses without disgusting others who prefer something more stimulating.</fullReview>

But I just thought I should see it and see what it is like in case I was wrong. But it turns out I was right! 'Austin Powers In Goldmember' was the worst Austin Powers so far. I hope the supposed 4th movie that is coming out in a few years time is MUCH better.There were a few funny jokes such as Fat Bastard singing on the toilet and the funny text on the bottom of the screen during the conversation with Mr. Roboto the Japanese guy. But the characters had no meaning! Austin was hardly a sex symbol in this 3rd installment (he was a 'sexy beast' in the other two films), and Mini me turned to Austin's side and Scott turned evil! They lost the characters completly. I could on for ages about the characters stupid transformations. They even had hardly any 70's music where as in the first 2 flicks, they had great music for the era known as the 60's. But I gotta admit...the celebrity appearances were quite good.I ain't knocking Mike Myers. He is excellent and even Beyonce Knowles who plays Foxxy Cleopatra was pretty good at acting but I didn't think much of the movie at all. They made huge mistakes. They even deleted Heather Graham's appearance as Felicity Shagwell, Austin's second leading lady from the second film.To those who haven't seen the previous Austin flicks, and are about to see the 3rd please.......See the 'Spy Who Shagged Me' first, as that is the FUNNIEST of all Austin Powers flicks.Very disappointing...............</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whereas the difference in quality between,say,Jaws or Jaws 3-D,or perhaps Jaws:The Revenge or in particular any of the Friday the 13th horror flicks(not to mention The Nightmare of Elm Street trilogies)or Psycho,Psycho II or Psycho III:The Nurturing,can only be measured in light years within a third dimension,but the three films in Mike Myers' Austin Powers series have been remarkably consistent,each one alternately soaring and sinking for the same reasons indefinitely. In relating to the groovy adventures of the 60's-era British secret agent who finds himself transplanted in today's modern society,star-creator Myers and director Jay Roach will feature a great gag and then repeat it until its completely run into the ground;this modus operandi alternates with the pair likewise taking a terrible gag(usually soatological in nature)and milking it fior what little its worth and then some. If we must compare,the third(and possibly the last in the series for good)entry is not as better as the first installment,but not as sharp as the second. The high points will consist of a terrific opening sequence featuring several surprising cameos(including a few Oscar winners),the addition of Micheal Caine as Austin's spy daddy,and an expanded role for Verne Troyer,again stealing all the scenes as the diminutive Mini-Me. Myers,as usual,has plenty of opportunities to mug it up,playing not only Austin but also his ultra arch-nemesis Dr. Evil,returning as villain Fat Bastard and a new criminal mastermind known as Goldmember(the least not in my interest funny of the lot). His female companion is not very good(played by Beyonce Knowles in her feature film debut as Foxxy Cleopatra)since the female leads were as bad as the second installment which had Heather Graham and in the first one which had Elizabeth Hurley. The soundtrack to the film has little interest.How much you enjoy this will depend on your acceptance of the film's ratio of hit-to-miss nyuks.</fullReview>

It recycles countless gags from the first two films because the writers are, quite simply, hard pressed for originality. Here's what Myers and the other writers must've been thinking (this will be most of my review):"Ok, the mini-me/Dr. Evil rapping gag worked great the first time around, so we'll have do that again, we're gonna need another Zip it/ Shhh, joke, instead of a penis shaped space vehicle, we need a breast shaped space vehicle! genius! we'll have to cap it with a half hearted self awareness joke mocking how blatantly recycled the it is, just so we don't look like we've run out of ideas. Oh, and how could we forget, there has to be another sexual joke featuring shadows that look like something else. It is imperative that every other word out of Austin's mouth is "yeah baby!" Goldmember and Fat Bastard should be as disgusting as possible, wit and creativity be damned! We need to have a time traveling sequence, whether it bears any relevance to the story or not, we must mock another decade simply for the hell of it. Oh, right, characters that Mike doesn't play! We'll need one scene where Number 2 tries to give Dr. Evil quickly disregarded advice, then we'll need a scene where Frau and Dr. Evil nearly have sex, and of course, Basil has to show up for 30 seconds and tell Austin what to do. We'll definately need someone twice as bland as Heather Graham and Elizabeth Hurley combined, hmmmm, that chick from Destiny's child, she definatley can't act, she'll do! Oh, and we need product placement for Heinekin and 7 billion cameos!What few original jokes they're were fell flat on their face (not even ten minutes in, and I almost walked out at 'Oops, I did it again baby!'). No one besides Mike Myers is given anything to do in this movie, Beyonce Knowles is there simply for the sake of being there, as mentioned, other great characters such as Basil and Number 2 are given nothing to do in this film. Also, the film looses sight of the original concept of Austin Powers, sending up James Bond, aside from Goldmember, there is nothing in the movie that sends up James Bond, and without it, the film pretty much goes nowhere. Of course i'm sure no one cares about this in Hollywood, unlike the first two, which were focussed in their purpose, this film was clearly made for the sole reason of making money. The sad thing is, me being 15, that more than half the people i know can't shut up about how funny this movie is. I hate to sound like a snob, but are our standards that low?! New Line, stop wasting your time with this crap, you have great movies like Seven, American History X, Magnolia and Fellowship of the Rings to be proud of, why are you still wasting money on this?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Goldmember was one of the best of the Austin Powers series. Again, it is crammed-packed with plenty of crude jokes and fun humour. This is the #1 best in the series. Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me #2. and the original is #3, which is very suprising. It isn't very likely for the two sequels to a film to be better than it. This is a very strange case though. This is a great and disgusting movie. I give it a 10 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The third in the series. The second one, `The Spy Who Shagged Me', was a re-hash of the original. This is a re-hash of both. Hmm.Plot? Blah. In Austin Powers the plot is thinly strung around the gags. Things occur for no logical reason other than to amuse. The script wanders off aimlessly at times in search of a gag (sometimes failing), before shuffling back to the thin concept of Dr. Evil trying to hold the Earth hostage. Who cares?The acting? Myers. is Myers. This time he's doing four roles. Three of them - Dr. Evil, Fat Bast*rd and Austin himself - are done with enough comic finesse to distinguish them. Goldmember himself is. forgettable and comes across as forced.. Beyone Knowles, as Foxy Cleopatra, has great zest in her role, with a great tongue-in-cheek underplay. She's by far the best thing here. Michael Caine. seems almost in self parody mode here and doesn't expend much effort (perhaps a fault of the script). Troyer, as Mini-Me, is amusing again, even if he seems somewhat over-the-top.However who cares as long as it's funny? Austin is, again, very much a hit-and-miss affair. Some gags are knowingly self-parodying (with an annoying tang of smugness), while others are just lame (a lot of Goldmember's material) or just gross (pretty much everything else). One of Myer's tricks is to re-use the same gag sequentially in the hope of driving it home (such as `zip it' from the previous instalment). This can work or just serve drive you insane. I did laugh at this movie, and you would too when in the theatre. but it doesn't really have very many comedic gems. There's potential there, but the series seems to be currently threading over old ground, and that's not a hopeful sign.Should you see it? If you liked the first two, then by all means do. You'll probably enjoy this one. If the series is already leaving a distaste in your mouth, then this will do nothing to change your mind. For everyone else. you can safely wait a bit until it's on DVD or TV. Disappointing, with too many misses - 4/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The groovy spy Austin Powers is back, this time teaming with Foxy Cleopatra (Knowles) on a much more personal mission to stop Dr. Evil who teams with a sinister Dutchman named Goldmember and orchestrates the kidnapping of Austin's father. Well-produced and laugh-out loud funny, this sequel opens with a bang and features some memorable, genuinely hilarious cameos, but like its predecessors there are too many lapses and the film runs out of steam long before it reaches the finale. As expected, there are plenty of amusing sight gags, along with an enthusiastic cast, but the humor is raunchier than it needs to be, and?oddly enough?the new addition Goldmember provides the least amount of laughs. **</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's funny, but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a big fan of the first two Austin Powers movies, and I found this one to be quite funny as well. However, I think it's time they put the series to rest. Although the movie was decent, the jokes were all rehashed versions of ones used in the previous movies, simply because they worked well before. Very little of the material is actually new. I fear that if they keep making Austin Powers movies, they will become less and less funny and will always continue to rely on the same gags. I don't want such a funny series as AUSTIN POWERS to fall prey to the POLICE ACADEMY trap (i.e., a barrage of lame and unfunny sequels ruining a once-good concept).And, honestly, does this movie really need all the fart and poop jokes? We all know those stopped being funny once we turned 12. If they DO make more sequels, I sure hope they put that Fat Bastard character to rest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you have seen the previous two Powers movies, you know that you arent going to see the next offering from the Bard of Avon. Mike Meyers is very talented comedic actor. He enjoys his characters and the fun is obviously contagious. I have seen a lot of the summer faire this year-MIBII, Bourne Identity, Minority Report, Blood Work, Signs and others, to be frank it has been less than a banner summer. The one movie I was really looking forward to deliver a good laugh, was Powers and he did just that. Yes, some of it is really gross, some of it is sophomoric, but damn it is funny. So go grab a box of popcorn, a cold drink and leave your critics shoes at home and go have some fun this summer and see Goldmember. Yea Baby, yeah!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Series Running out of Gas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before you ask, yeah I liked the movie. With some good funny moments. It wasn't truely memorable and I think Myers is overplaying the one-line joke way too much. Why does he feel the need to play EVER character. There is no need. Aren't there other funny people you can employ or is the budget only to feed Myers' inflated ego?Myers is not another Peter Sellers and won't ever be. Sellers was and continues to be funny and doesn't rely on one-line jokes. Myers does.Sure Caine's involvement is very good and the characters are stupidily funny - but the numerous cameos (were they really needed?) kinda ruin the film. Why are they there?There are too many plot holes and problems. But the window dressing of juvenile toilet humor and silly jokes that parody earlier films dross over the plot and story.But Myers can't keep doing it. I mean the series is running out of gas. You can tell this when he's reusing old jokes and then telling you its old recycled jokes. This is not a good sign. I'm begining to wonder if Myers is SO funny, why didn't he write the script himself.Anyway, its an okay film. But only that. You might enjoy the toilet humor, the parodies, the cameos and the jokes - but all in all I feel its underplayed and perhaps only a cash cow for an already overpaid and over-rated "comedy" actor.Overall: 4/10</fullReview>

"I thought I smelled cabbage!", and Michael Caine added a lot to the story in the kind of role that he alone can excel in.The number of characters that Myers is playing himself is starting to take some shine off Powers &amp; Dr Evil, and the character of Goldmember is not particularly funny -- with Fat Bastard going nowhere as a character also.All this aside, if you go expecting to see a typical Mike Myers film, you'll enjoy this.</fullReview>

The jokes fell flat, the plot was too contrived to be cute, and the sight-gags were few and far between. What is onscreen is a mess of skits thrown together to form a not-quite cohesive movie.When walking out of the theater moments ago, my friends and I admitted that there were a few moments that were funny. I said, "the other movies were GREAT, and this one was just okay with a couple of GOOD moments." My friend replied "Mike tried too hard".

		<fullReview>While the first two installments to this film series was fun and innovative, Mike Myers created something much more in Goldmember. Dance routines, outlandish set designs, wild clothing and one of the best opening sequences in the history of cinema (you can quote me on that!) help make this film a winner.Sure, it won't win any Oscars, but this is one of those films which encompasses more than just humor, but seeks to take it to another level. Technically, the film has very little to offer (with the exception of a few cleverly devised scenes), but the deadpan performances of Myers and Michael Caine and their interaction truly makes for some good comedy. While most of the movie feels like a collection of short vignettes, it does manage to flow succinctly and evenly. Overall, I would see this film multiple times.</fullReview>

Austin (once again) must stop him with the help of the beautiful Foxxy Cleopatra and his father, played by Michael Caine in a useless performance.Does this sound familiar? This is the same story I've seen in the first two movies and when you consider that everyone seems to be in on this fact combined with their phoned in performances, you see how unnecessary this sequel really is.What can you say about this: It's not funny, it's limp, the cameos are useless with a few exceptions, and the story often makes no sense. Myers struck out and maybe that's for the better. We've since been spared a fourth entry.</fullReview>

I was laughing just as bad as the first two films. Once again, Mike Myers reached my expectations as his many characters. Beyonce was a surprising hit as Foxy Brown. Seth Green and Vernbe Troyer are just a few notable actors that performed well. In my opinion, the jokes got funnier. The shadow jokes were the best jokes of the movie. There is also a bit of a surprise when Mini-Me went from evil to good. The music was good as well. I liked the song at the beginning when "A Hard Knock Life" was performed. The script worked well. There should be another sequel. I give the number three and final movie of the series 9/10.</fullReview>

Even in its current form, GOLDMEMBER is about ninety minutes too long.

But tearing into GOLDMEMBER would be like kicking a sick puppy...just too easy. Where to begin? The terrible performances, the retarded sense of humour, the self-congratulatory back-slapping showbusiness cameos, the enormous ego and miniscule talent of Mike Myers, or the fact that Jay Roach's approach to direction and editing makes Michael Winner look positively restrained by comparison?

The jokes are awkward, the plot cliche and just very haphazard. The dialogue is filled with the usual tired risque humor that we have all come to know and love from the Austin Powers persona, but here, they seemed to deliberately act as ridiculous as possible, rehashing old plot threads and playing around with the familiar characters that we've laughed at from the start. In a nutshell, Goldmember is awkward, poorly written and stupendously unfunny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My preferred title: "The Man with the Golden Schlong"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Comedy has been heading in this direction for quite some time, and it's finally arrived. Welcome to meta-comedy. This is a film consisting entirely of second-order jokes about how lame its first-order jokes are.The previous film was already pretty close. Mike Myers would leadenly deliver some time-worn quip - he seemed to actually PREFER jokes we'd already heard - then pause and surpress a weary sigh, to let us know that HE didn't think much of the quip in question, either. (I couldn't help thinking that if he'd been able to think of something amusing to say in the first place, he would have said it.)There's a scene in "The Spy Who Shagged Me" that breaks free from this deadening treadmill. It's the series of words-that-mean-"penis" jokes ("That rocket - it looks like an enormous..." "Wang?" -but we've cut to another scene, and "Wang" is simply the name of a Chinese schoolboy, who will point to the rocket outside that looks like an enormous... etc.); and this one good idea is recycled here, too, with a series of words that mean "breasts". But it's not a long series, for it ends fairly abruptly with Ozzy Osbourne (a film with fifteen celebrity cameos only two of which are the slightest bit imaginative, and this isn't one of them, is definitely struggling) saying "Boobs!" ...and it turns out he's referring to the film-makers, for recycling the same gag they used last time. Please let me out of this postmodern hell.(To be fair, another good idea is introduced in this film: the subtitles that appear to be saying something risque because bits of white background obscure key words. This is funny. It would be funnier if it weren't undermined by the same "Look! We're making a lame joke" presentation.)"Goldmember" does not just pad out its running time by spending twice as much time referring to its jokes as making them; at times, it positively flirts with surrealism. I haven't seen a film by Bu?uel but I doubt he has a single scene that will make me scratch my head and go "Huh?" as much as the moment when the film turns, without warning, into a rap music clip. I think Myers has been influenced, in precisely the wrong way, by Monty Python. They, too, were into bizarre, dadaist changes of pace and scene; they too loved meta-jokes; and they too (to use the hateful modern phrase) "played with the conventions" of comedy. But is this why anyone remembers and loves them? Is this why they were funny? Of course not. What was funny about the parrot sketch was the brilliant writing and the acting of the sketch itself, not its absurdity per se, and certainly not the way it abruptly morphed into... whatever it morphed into; nobody even remembers.Mike Myers, by contrast, has a painful dearth of good material to begin with, and he can't deliver a line to save his life. He thinks that if he consciously draws attention to the fact that he isn't funny then somehow he'll be funny. Or maybe if he consciously draws attention to the fact that he consciously draws attention to the fact that he isn't funny, he'll be funny. He should give up and go home; it's never going to work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mike Myers makes us laugh with the last and definitive again (or not) the secret agent's movie, bumpkin and English Austin Powers in this Goldmember. Myers returns with its jokes something clownish but very good and it also returns with its parodies of James Bond with the character Goldmember and the fictitious movie of Austin Powers (AustinPussy).I love the movie because it also combines jokes and references of the previous Austin Powers (The joke of the satellite and those of the sharks with laser), one can also see the father of Austin Powers (Michael Caine) paper that was about to incorporate is Connery. The movie also includes, for my, the best girl of the Austin Powers' saga, the singer Beyoncé Knowles (Foxxy Cleopatra) much better than Heather Graham and Elizabeth Hurley.Not alone the humor of this film resides in the versatile Myers and in its characters (Dr. Evil, Fat Bastard...) but we can also spend well them with Mini-me (now Mini-Austin) and their endless weeds with Scott.A very good blow of freshness for film is the one of including cameos like Steven Speilberg, Tom Cruise, Danny De Vito or Britney Spears (Uaauuuuhhh!!!).This is Austin Powers!!! Glamour, Amusement, Laughs, Action and a lot..... of Gold!!! This is the new movie of Myers with we can laugh it, the question that it comes us to the head is: Will there be Austin Powers 4?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a disappointment: 3/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a fan of the first two Austin Powers films, I was eagerly awaiting the release of Goldmember. After seeing the film however, I am very disappointed.The movie, to me, seemed very 'incoherent'. The plot did not seem to run as smoothly as the last two. It seemed to be just thrown together haphazardly. It is although the producers thought "oh oh, what was funny from the last one? ok, that bit was, we'll put that there... and this bit there... and we'll slightly change that bit and put it there... and we'll add a couple of new things here and there." And that about sums up the movie: tired old worn-out gags and jokes, and a couple of new things for a chuckle or two.The 'plot' itself, if you can really call it a plot, was introduced incredibly fast, with no real reasoning or explanation. I guess it's a case of "yes, we're the bad guys, and we're going to destroy the world" once again, but at least in the last two movies they actually seemed to mean it. In this one, it was as though Dr. Evil and Co. weren't even trying.The best part of the whole movie, in my opinion, was the opening sequence. Very funny and very witty - pity the rest of the movie didn't follow suit. If you do see this movie, see it for the first five or ten minutes, then walk out or switch it off.Goldmember himself as a character was just... very, very odd. I don't know that many Dutch people, but I'm sure the producers have never met one in their life judging from their "typically Dutch" Goldmember. He didn't really do anything dramatic throughout the whole movie until the very end, and seeing how the film's title was "Goldmember", you'd expect him to feature just a little more than he did.Other flaws I noticed include:* What happened to Heather Graham's character after the last movie? Has she just vanished? I have heard she was supposed to get a cameo but they cut it.* Where was Mustafa? With all the re-used bits from the past two movies, surely they could have thrown him in there too for a couple of chuckles.* I didn't mind Austin's Dad being there so much, but something I learned a long time ago is that when family members of main characters in a TV series or in films start being introduced, it's usually a sign that the TV or film series is dying. If this movie is anything to go by, I'd say that Austin Powers' days are extremely numbered.* A certain play-on-words joke failed in Australia because we don't have a product on our shelves with the same name... the audience worked it out after a little while, but it didn't have the desired effect... they need to be more careful with word gags like that... with the last two movies they picked things that were more well known.Finally, perhaps the biggest flaw of all: AUSTIN DIDN'T GET A SHAG! The poor old chap! Third movie and he's over the hill, eh? He had the incredibly attractive Foxy Cleopatra at his side throughout the entire movie, and not once did he jump on a revolving bed and say "DO I MAKE YOU HORNY, BABY? DO I MAKE YOU RANDY?" Not once! Oh well Austin, time to hang a certain Swedish "adult product"... looks like you won't be needing that anymore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Austin Powers third film and perhaps the best out of the three. In fact, I loved this movie so much that I saw this movie three times in the theater. It just gets better everytime I see it. With all the cameos and great actors and a great crew, this film is the best. Jay Roach (the director) does it again. He knows how to shoot comedies and Mike Myers knows how to make them. So, this Austin Powers movie should be seen by every person in the world. They can make a million of these movies and it still won't be enough. So, I hope there's more Austin Power films to come around. Yeah Baby!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mike is pure genius. Students of film could use the A.P. trilogy to study comedy and or sequel writing. Not a second of celluloid goes by that is not important to complete the movie. The movie could have ended after the opening number and I would have gone home happy. Like it's predecessors, "Goldmember" begins with a Broadway-like production. This time it's bigger and better than ever. A hell of a grabber. Being number three is hard to pull off. The movie humbles itself with obviously blatant yet unashamed reprisals of characters and skits from the two previous A.P. movies. However, by delving further and further into the world of Austin Powers Myers reveals a masterpiece of a world present only in his mind and on film, thank goodness. Watching "Goldmember" was fun. So many guest appearances I got lost. Ahhh, what a fun movie. You know that those guest stars were thinking," Man-o-man, and I get paid for doing this, too!" I mean John Tavolta dances in "Goldmember", aint that great!Mike Myers is a frigin' genius.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen this movie twice now, and both times of watching it left me laughing histerically! SPOILERS. Upon realizing his father has been kidnapped, Austin Powers travels back to 1975 to stop Goldmember, a Dutch, dead skin preserving, leg rising, gold loving mad man. All of the original roles are still in this movie (whew!). But I think that some of the elements changed a bit. I never realized how blue Mini Me's and Dr. Evil's eyes were, and for some reason I think that Dr. Evil's voice changed a bit. But not to worry! It's still a great comedy! And on a sadder note, I've heard that this may be the last of the Austin Powers series. Mike Myers is simply a comic genuis and I have confidence if he tried hard that we will be seeing A P 4. Even with some crude humor and that whole thing with Goldmember keeping and eating dead skin that peeled off of his body, Goldmember is in my view is the absoulute best of the Austin Powers series!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps the worst movie I have ever seen....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This one has to go down as the worst movie I have seen since Bill Murray's "Where The Buffalo Roam". "Plan 9 From Outer Space" is like "Citizen Kane" compared to "Goldmember". I don't think even Ed Wood would have ever touched this project if something like it were ever offered to him during his career.When producers and directors have to drag out actors (and morning TV hosts) whose careers are in utter decline as a draw for a picture, you know a film is in deep trouble. Eighth-grade humor is fine in proper context, but eighth-grade humor that has been tried, retread, and worn out is just plain abominable. This film is full of recycled tripe.Watching this film is like watching a really bad Bob Hope Television Special with the added effects of bathroom humor and foul language. I was actually thinking the coming lines in my head before the actors said them. My thinking the lines is a sign that a film is embarrassing poorly written or that I have a great career ahead of me as a screenwriter. I sincerely doubt the latter of those two alternatives.About the only redeeming slapstick element in this film is the "small" part of Mini-Me by Verne Troyer. If Troyer gets paid only scale (as he was in his first film appearance) and Myers gets paid 20 million, Congress should immediately launch an investigation. That pay plan would be a bigger crime than anything Ken Ley or Sen. Ted Kennedy were ever involved in. While Troyer may suffer the fate of all actors who serve bit parts in serial films, he can certainly perform first-class physical humor. He should try one of those groin punches in real time to Myers offstage if he gets stiffed in the wallet for his performance.Myers is so incredibly predictable in this film, it is beyond description. His humor is both badly timed and gratingly repetitive. It amazes me how people see him as being humorous. Michael Caine should have his knighthood (and other things) removed from him for just showing up for the casting call.Do yourself a special favor. Don't go see or rent this film. Save your money for a better time somewhere else....YEAH BABY!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of the funniest film of the year so far; though not for everyone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm sure there's an audience out there not for the comedic taste of Mike Meyers- there are more flatulence/penile/bowel movement/general excrement jokes to fill three other movies, and it's all crammed into a 96 minute piece. With that said, I loved it; I've been a big fan of Meyers through his career and with this third installment I can faithfully say I laughed more during this than Spy Who Shagged Me (the laughs grow less and less since I first saw that three years ago), although it doesn't top the first if only because it still stands strong as a solid comedy with originality as its strong suit, not gross out, albeit hilarious, gags. This time, Meyers adds the eccentric Goldmember (said title), from Holland, he has his private area submerged in gold and can lift both legs up at will; he plots to destroy the world with Dr. Evil and Powers teams up with Beyonce Knowles (Foxy Cleopatra) and his father (Michael Caine in the slyest role of the movie).With cameos from the likes of Tom Cruise, Britney Spears, Kevin Spacey and Ozzy Osbourne, and a moments where laugh a minute is more than literal, this is a highly recommended flick on the front of strange and funny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funniest Moments Of All The Austin Powers Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Goldmember may not be as well written as the other two films in the Austin Powers series, but it gets the funniest laughs. With the addition of his new character, Goldmember, Mike Myers is sure to make your sides hurt from laughing. The crazy Dutchman, Goldmember, is so weird and crazy you will want to see more and more of him.Of course, all the old regulars return: Austin Powers, Dr. Evil, Fat Bastard, Scott Evil, Frau Farbisinna, and Mini Me. Again, Dr. Evil and Fat Bastard are absolutely hilarious. Unfortunately, Mini Me is not up to par in this film. Making up for him, however, is Nigel Powers played by Michael Caine. Caine's scenes with Verne Troyer actually make Mini Me respectable in the film.Beyonce turns in a decent performance as Foxy Cleopatra, and again, brings us a super hot Powers Girl. If you are looking for some great laughs and don't really care about how stupid the story is, then go out and buy this DVD. It is one you can watch over and over again. Rating 9 of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A series that began so well with the genuinely funny and inventive first film has now slipped into mediocrity with this third instalment, and it's probably time that Mike Myers tried something else because he does have a lot of talent, although its wasted in this movie.What little plot there is seems to revolve around the valuable genitals of Mr Goldmember (hence his name - [snigger]). Everything else in this dire movie is just a series of pointless cameo's by the likes of Kevin Spacey, Danny De Vito and even the Bleeping Osbournes. Why these scenes have been added is anyone's guess. Presumably the plot is just so thin that the makers decided to show just how famous the Austin Powers franchise is by shamelessly wheeling these people in, perhaps to pad the movie out a little bit as well.Michael Caine joins in, hamming it up in great style playing Austin's father and there's a very predictable revelation at the end regarding Dr Evil. Beyonce Knowles tries her best but she's only really as expressive as Heather Graham was in the second film, i.e not very good.The overall feeling is that all the actors are just going through the motions in the knowledge that this is a bit of a turkey, albeit a very well paid one. Some of the sexual innuendo, both visual and verbal, is just plain embarassing and the whole exercise has the feeling of being a money-making exercise, with very little thought given to plot or character building. 2.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm completely amazed that so many people claim to have laughed so hard at this lame comedic attempt. I thought the first two installments of the series were both full of hilarious slapstick, ("They're always after me lucky charms", and "What the hell did you eat?") which gave me high hopes for this one. All the media hype and critical acclaim helped to reinforced my expectations. The opening scene was well-done and hilarious. Then, suddenly, the whole project died and rotted in a stinking heap. Jeez, I even TRIED to like it, but finally had to give up. All those stupid cameos seemed to have been thrown in out of desperation, to draw in stargazers and make up for a marked lack of writing ability. I got the feeling that all those stars just HAD to jump on the Austin Powers bandwagon to be in vogue Then, lines had to be written in for them, no matter how little they contributed to the quality of the film. Not one of the Myers characters had any decent lines. Corny, but not funny-corny, just groaner-corny. Fat Bastard's new personality didn't suit him at all. The thing that made him so funny before was his mammoth self-confidence that ran counter to his grotesque ugliness. He's not even good for a chuckle as the repentant, considerate type. Goldmember himself was just plain disgusting, with no comic value, and Dr. Evil's jokes just seemed to fall flat, one after the other, as did Austin Powers.To sum it all up in one word...BORING.</fullReview>

All the ingenuity that was in the original (and Dr Evil WAS one of the great comic inventions of the decade) has by this sequel to a sequel to a parody dribbled away in a long line of excreta gags. Goldmember's accent is not Dutch; Fat Bastard was never funny; eating flakes of your own skin is not funny; and most movies actually do better when a plot is used. Myers ought to be ashamed but I guess the cash-registers are ringing too loudly for him to hear the little voice in his head saying: "For love of humanity, stop!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, this is a true story:I enjoyed the first two Austin Powers movies for what they were. Well made, unpretentious romps.So, tonight I watched Goldmember on Stars cable channel. When it was over, the screen said, "Coming up next: Halloween, The Curse Of Michael Meyers."-And it suddenly dawned on me: I had just SEEN the Curse of Michael Myers. Arrggghhh.Beonce Knowles is worth a look, though. She's hot, adorable, and can even act, at least within the confines of her limited dialog in this movie.Actually, the best part of this movie is the very last song under the credits, with Susannah Hoffs singing "What's it all about, Austin" -A somewhat veiled pun, as "What's it all about, Alfie" was the theme song from one of the earliest movies starring Michael Cain, who of course plays Austin's father in this flick.-and that's the best part.Really.Stay tuned for "Austin Powers 4, the revenge of the script writers."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now I have no problem with raunchiness, but this was just too much. Other than that, this was a very funny movie and I thought much funnier than the first two. Now that the lines and gags like "Yeah Baby" and "Behave" are well established, the first two movies don't hold up. Myers had to come up with something fresh for this one, and he did. The man is a comic genius and continues to impress, but I agree that he should retire the series.Also, what's wrong with Michael Caine being in this movie? This is better than Jaws 4. If I were Michael Caine (with my position already established in film history) why not have a little fun? That's what DeNiro is doing. What would you rather be, austere and respected or approachable and respected? There is nothing wrong with not taking yourself too seriously. I enjoy it when serious actors do things like this. Take Christopher Walken in that Fatboy Slim video. hilarious. 7/10 for Goldmember.</fullReview>

The first half is really funny ("Master Evil" "Fook Mi" etc.) but the characters get old pretty fast, and Goldmember, the Dutch villain, just isn't funny. Part of the problem is that we're too familiar with Austin, Dr. Evil, Mini Me, etc., and part of it is the 1960's spy formula is wearing thin. I hope this is the last one, the first two are great and worth seeing, but see this one only if you must see the third installment. 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought the first two films were hilarious, but this has got to be the best. When I saw this at the cinema four years ago, I was surprised to see the Austinpussy film-within-a-film but I soon realised it was part of the actual film itself.Beyonce makes a great sidekick for Austin and she is especially helpful in the scene in Mr Roboto's Headquarters where the subtitles look dogdy (for example, "Please eat some s**t," becomes, "Please eat some shitake mushrooms.). One of the best puns in this film is the name of Gwyneth Paltrow's character, which is Dixie Normous. My dad found that name terrible yet funny. I also liked the scene where the Japanese twins ask for Austin's autograph and they tell him their names are Fook Yu and Fook Mi, which is similar to the Dixie Normous joke, but they sound a lot ruder because they sound like the F-word.People who already like the first two films may like this as well because it's just plain hilarious. 9/10.</fullReview>

But not Beyonce, she headlines beside Mike Myers himself as the Austin beauty, and kills it. All the scenes without Beyonce were funny in this movie.

		<shortDescription>"Hi, I'm Dixie ... Dixie Normous." &lt;Paltrow&gt;</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of the three Austin Powers movies, I like #2 best, followed by #3, Goldmember. If it had in fact been the first, we all probably would have enjoyed it more, because of the invariable recycling of many jokes, in slightly different forms. Still, this one is perhaps 80% good, original and fun silliness, the other 20% is just crude, unfunny silliness. I guess that averages out to a rating of "8", doesn't it? Beonce Knowles is the latest cute girl and she does very well, she seems like a very natural actress. The DVD uses surround sound very well, and the picture is very sharp with brilliant colors. It is an Infinifilm, which means you can play the whole movie, or scenes, with the ability to take a short branch into a "making of" sequence, one of the best ways to display "extras." Also, the ending credits feature outtakes from Goldmember. The critic Ebert has a good, complete review.some SPOILERS follow, for my benefit, please read no further.In a novel opening, and a tribute to the openings in MI:2 and Charlie's Angels, we see a driverless car following a motorcyclist chased by a helicopter in Canyonlands Park in Utah. As Austin Powers paraglides in to the rescue, and to destroy the 'copter, we see Tom Cruise as Powers, and Gweneth Paltrow as Dixie Normous, plus Kevin Spacey as Dr Evil and Danny Devito as Mini Me. Cut to a wide shot, it is a movie backlot, making a Steven Spielberg film "Austinpu$$y", about the life of Austin Powers. Following the very last scene of Goldmember, we see Powers, Dr Evil and others in the audience of the screening of the finished movie. Between the opening and closing, the real movie happens. Other cameos are played by Britney Spears, whose head explodes, newswoman Katie Couric who plays a prison guard, Quincy Jones, doing the score for the Spileberg film, Spielberg himself, and the Ozzie Osborne family.The complete story is too convoluted and silly to detail, but Dr Evil has enlisted the help of Goldmember (lost his 'member' in a gold smelting mishap) to develop a "tractor beam" which will pull a 22K "pure gold" meteor to the Earth, melt the Arctic ice cap, and flood the world. (A couple of errors - pure gold is 24K, and a meteor is the flash of light we see when a metorite burns up.) There are a couple of musical numbers, including "A Hard Knock Life" from Annie, by Dr Evil, Mini Me, and the other prisoners. In the final scene, where the laser destroys Midas 22 before it hurls to Earth, they even poke fun at "cold fusion."Some of the funniest scenes revolve around bodily functions. Like the one where Powers, in a long coat and standing on Mini Me's shoulders, must give a urine sample. So he gives Mini Me a drink of apple juice, and the technician only sees a profile shot of yellow liquid being spit into a plastic cup, then spilled all over him. Or the one in the sumo dressing room, Austin in a laundry cart, and wrestlers throwing their dirty 'diapers' into his face. The third one, from Fat Ba$tard, made him gag and jump out.As it turns out, Austin Powers and Dr Evil really are brothers, as revealed by their dad (Michael Caine) near the end, which results in their all sitting, like one happy family, watching the Spielberg movie, AUSTINPU$$Y, at the very end, where we see John Travolta playing the part of Goldmember. Plus, Fat Ba$tard shows up skinny, with lots of skin hanging everywhere. Quite a romp, for anyone who enjoys this type of movie.</fullReview>

It are the jokes that make the movie. The best thing about silly movie's is their silliness and Goldmember has plenty of that! There are lots of scene's that make you laugh out loud, something that the other 2 Austin Power's movies at times lacked.If you didn't liked the previous 2 Austin Power's movies then simply don't watch this one.

		<shortDescription>"You want fries with that?" A sequel made to order...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is what one perceives, and what one receives. If the two mesh, you got a sequel worthy of its predecessor's namesake. Usually sequels pale in comparison to their predecessors. There are very few rare exceptions compared the pile of unworthy swill. Occasionally a sequel will improve upon the formula of the original (Aliens, Indy &amp; Last Crusade, Back To The Future 2, ST2 Wrath of Khan, Army of Darkness) but more often than not it's the opposite. Sequels attempt to recreate the success of the past by regurgitating similar plot elements in vaguely innovative ways. The result often falls flat (Star Treks 1, 3, 5 &amp; 9, Indy &amp; Temple of Doom, all the Jaws sequels, Highlander 2, Die Hard 3, Men In Black 2, Ghostbusters 2, Poltergeists 2&amp;3, Weekend At Bernie's 2, the Police Academy sequels, Blair Witch Book of Shadows, anything with Jason, Freddy or Pinhead, etc etc ad nauseum), causing one to contemplate why anyone bothered to financially back such worthless drivel.Then there's the rare gems. The ones who manage to pull it off. The sequels which are not better or worse than their predecessor, but rather successfully ARE what they claim to be. If you go to a favored restaurant a second time and order the same thing, you won't necessarily want a "new and improved" hamburger unless you specifically ordered that. You want what you got the last time. That's why you came back. Fast food &amp; Hollywood sequels operate under similar principles. These rare sequels which hit the mark without going over, don't improve upon the formula. They also don't fail to entertain. They ARE the formula. Most noteworthy among these rare gems are the James Bond sequels. The brand "James Bond" is as delicious to some as the thought of a submarine sandwich or a good year of fine wine. One knows what to expect when they see that name, and rarely does an installment of the James Bond franchise disappoint. The Lethal Weapon series of films is another perfect example. Each film can stand alone but are also episodic. They deliver what they promise. Nothing more. Nothing less. If that's what you're in the mood for, pretty much any of the sequels to Lethal Weapon "taste" the same as the original, so you probably will not be disappointed, provided you like that flavor.I'm not saying this is bad or good. I'm not saying this makes any sequel ART. It doesn't. I'm saying if you liked the first one of these rare gems, you'll like the rest, because they're prepared and delivered to you in much the same way a McDonald's delivers a Big Mac to your hands. They know what works and they stick with it, and give the audience what it wants.All sequels seek to hit the mark of past glory, and the vast majority fall short. A precious few prove to be more than their name brand advertises and how can one argue against that? It's like ordering the Value Meal and getting it Biggie-Sized for free. Then there's an even smaller percentage that are precisely what you ordered. Goldmember is just such a creature.If you liked Austin Powers &amp; The Spy Who Shagged Me, you'll like Goldmember. It has something to offer newcomers to the series and also diehard fans of Myers. It's episodic but also stands alone. The casting of Michael Caine is sheer brilliance. Seth Green's given a chance to show his comedic chops. Some of the more juvenile blue humor seems forced and falls flat, but that's ironically part of Myers' charm. He's bucking against this trend I described above, which ironically works to his advantage. Goldmember laughs in the face of the odds stacked against it. It knows its a greedy attempt to rest on the laurels of its predecessors and it basks in that decadence, thus making it even more amusing for its very existence. After all, the Austin Powers films are ultimately designed to make fun of the very concept of sequels, lampooning perhaps the most successful series of films of all: James Bond. So how can it not fail to entertain even when it fails to be worthwhile? It's making fun of itself and every other sequel, good or bad, that's ever been written. Quite a task. However, the novelty of this parody is wearing off, and the next Austin Powers film will either have to reinvent itself, or fall into repetition in a way that'll make Police Academy 5 look almost like art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Austin Powers Film So Far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>this is by far the best powers movie yet they just keep getting better and better first one was ok second one was good this one is great i hope there will be a forth and final one here`s hoping eh :).((a slight spoiler)) Mini Me gets whats coming to him in this one because if you remember he pummeled Austin in the 2nd one well he gets it twice as bad as Austine got it in the 2nd one it`s even more hilarious than when Powers got kung-fu`d from Mini Me i`ll not say any mmore incase some of you haven`t seen it yet.there is more humour in this one i thought which is good there should be more humour in the next sequel if there is one there was more in 2 than the first and there`s more in this one than the first two. Mike Myers does it great when he impersonates a scots man as i`m from Scotland i think his Fat B*st*rd character is really funny it is one of the better parts of the movie that and Scott Evil.there is one funny part that sticks in my mind it`s where that chick ``Foxxy`` is walking down the hall and hears a noise and opens the air vent and next thing you see is Mini Me shooting out it and being smashed off of the wall across the other side of the hall (ouch) :).if Mr Myers does make another Austin Powers movie then i hope it ends with the next one dont want it to keep running on and on one more to finish it go out with a bang finish it with the biggest and funniest of all Austin Powers movies.this is one comedy that everyone should watch it`s hard to see how anyone could dislike it or any Powers movie still there must be some out there who do but it`s to be expected not everyone is going to like every film.rating for this movie 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Austin Powers Goldmember has all the hallmarks of the first two film. It looks great ,it is funny and it has no story worth speaking about.This is better than the first but does not quite live up to the second. The problem being the story is very week but what it lacks in a story it makes up for with gimmicks , none more so than the first 10 minutes when we see an array of stars making the Austin Powers film which is directed by Stephen Spielberg. Now thats a film i would love to see!! There are some very funny moments such as the time Austin is behind a screen and gives birth to Mini Me and the camio appearance of the Osbournes. When Mike Myers makes Austin Powers 4 i just hope he spends a little more time on the story. 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A REVIEW of the FILM: AUSTIN POWERS in GOLDMEMBER by JOHN ULMER (sk8boarder1088@aol.com) AUSTIN POWERS IN GOLDMEMBERStarring Mike Myers (x4) Michael Caine Beyonce Knowles Robert Wagner Seth Green Mindy Sterling And Verne J. Troyer as Mini-meAustin Powers is back, in Austin Powers in Goldmember. This time, Mike Myers is playing 4 characters, Austin, Dr. Evil, Fat B*s&amp;t^a%d, and the aptly named?Goldmember. Seth Green returns as Evil's son, Robert Wagner as Number 2, Mindy Sterling as Frau Farbissana, and Verne J. Troyer as Mini-Me, a clone 1/8 the size of Dr. Evil.  In this supposed last entry into the Austin Powers franchise, Austin (Myers) must use the help of Dr. Evil (Myers) to find an infamous villain from the seventies, named Goldmember (Myers) , an eccentric Dutchman who loves gold, and also has a disgusting habit of eating his own peeling skin, to rescue his father (Michael Caine). After traveling back in time to the seventies, and going to Goldmember's club, Austin accidentally meets up with an old flare, Foxxy Cleopatra (Beyonce Knowles of Destinys Child), who is undercover. The two team up, and rescue Austin's father from Goldmember, only to learn Doctor Evil's new plan. After traveling back to 2002 with Foxxy and his father, Austin attempts to foil Goldmember and Dr. Evil's new plan before it's too late, and they'll also find out the truth between Dr. Evil and Austin!  With more cameos in the first 5 minutes than any movie I've ever seen before, and hilarious jokes, Austin Powers in Goldmember lives up to the other two films. With excellent interaction and chemistry between characters, and a great ending to the trilogy, this is not a let down to the fans. There were only a few things about this film that turned disgusting. One is with Fat ^&amp;^$%^ and a sumo `diaper' as he calls them, and another especially with Mini-Me and Austin behind a curtain. Other than this, Austin Powers in Goldmember is great, and is filled with non-stop laughs from beginning to end. One of many absolute hilarious scenes occurs with a remake of the song `It's a Hard Knock Life' from the broad way play, Annie, but in this remake Dr. Evil and Mini-me rap it, and it's hilarious! See this movie for laughs, plain and simple. Powers fans, won't be let down. An ending to end all endings occurs, and pleased me very much. Cameos. Humor. Good movie. What more could you ask for, baby? 4/5 starsJOHN ULMER</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The most notable thing about GOLDMEMBER was the amount of fun the actors seemed to be having on screen. With the exception of a few sight gags and one joke though, the audience wanted more and instead received next to nothing. The characters (whom many were pleasantly bland in the first place) have been hosed down to nothing, particularly Austin Powers and Dr. Evil themselves. Congratulations Mike Myers, you boldly went where BILL &amp; TED were too fearful to go.Austin Powers' father has been kidnaped by a maniacal Dutchman named Goldmember, and only Dr. Evil has the clues.Many cameos appear this time around. It helps make the movie something to watch for the first five minutes. But the music videos just do nothing but take up space, and are useless novelty items to possibly hide a horrible fact. One of the more peculiar (if not weird) moments was seeing Beyonce's noticeably modern body in 70s outfits. GOLDMEMBER was tiring, and without a couple merits, it really stunk.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>AUSTIN POWERS IN GOLDMEMBER (2002) **** Mike Myers, Beyonce Knowles, Michael Caine, Verne J. Troyer, Michael York, Seth Green, Robert Wagner, Mindy Sterling (cameos: Tom Cruise, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kevin Spacey, Danny De Vito, Steven Spielberg, Britney Spears, Quincy Jones, Nathan Lane, John Travolta; Ozzy, Sharon, Kelly &amp; Jack Osbourne; Burt Bacharach. Yeah Baby! Myers returns as the dentally challenged time-traveling shagging British spy this outing saving the world from Dr. Evil (Myers again) &amp; the titular Danish porn flake (Myers again) while putting Mini Me (Troyer stealing the show again) and slovenly Scotsman Fat Bastard (Myers for the unprecedented fourth time!) at arm's length as well as locating his kidnapped secret agent paterfamilias (inspired, uncanny Caine). Knowles sports a mean 'fro as Foxxy Cleopatra in an affectionate nod to Pam Grier et al and providing the soul with a dash of spicy sex appeal in this uproarious chapter of the ongoing franchise of naughty mirth. Myers - who co-wrote the hysterical screenplay with Michael McCullers - reunites with director Jay Roach (whose real-life wife, rocker Susanna Hoffs cameos and sings a new version of `Alfie' in the closing credits) adding more mojo, side-splitting double-entendres, mistaken identities, scatological humor by the toilet bowl, bad puns, bone-rattling slapstick and knowing asides to keep the audience in stitches. The cameo filled appearances by the biggest names in Hollywood also adds to the miscellaneous merriment at hand.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you like Austin Powers, see this movie. If you don't like Austin Powers, don't see this movie. That's all you need to know as "Goldmember" is a simple albeit extravagant sequel and cash flow conduit from the &lt;30 crowd into Hollywood bank accounts. Just more of the same potty/crotch humor, sexual innuendos, genital joke retreads, and shagadelic nonsense. (C+)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've never liked the Austin Powers movies (or Mike Myers for that matter) as they have always come across as being the product of an over-indulgent, but not very bright, imagination. They'll all so flimsy and crudely stapled together that it baffles me why people adore them and spend $200 million+ at the box office. Are we so braindead and slovenly that utter, utter garbage like this is what passes for our collective sense of humor? As previously, the film is just random scenes of nonsense connected in the most superficial of ways with a moronic 'plot'. And don't give me 'but that's the point', because I don't think that excuses it for having absolutely no class or sophistication whatsoever. Everything, from the camp static sets to the pathetic widescreen photography reeks of Wal-Mart movie making. It's all so amateur.I actually walked out of the 2nd Austin Powers film (and I really should have just switched this one off but Michael Caine kept me watching) as the character of Fat Bastard seriously offended me. I don't think it's fair to make Scotland the butt of such a vile, xenophobic joke. But, I guess that's as far as Myer's imagination goes when creating characters as everyone here in this film is nothing more than a cultural stereotype. Quite irresponsible for a wannabe-blockbuster.I wish I could say that if I ignore a monster such as this, it would go away. But that just won't happen. Let's just thank our lucky stars that no more Austin Powers films have been made since this drek.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who the hell thought this was funny? I'm not a Mike Myers fan (I hated "Wayne's World" and "So I Married an Axe Murderer"), but a friend of mine dragged me (kicking and screaming) to see it. Obviously, I'm not the best choice to see this film but I tried to view it objectively. Well...I hated it.The film looks fantastic and (with the exception of Myers) has a great cast, but the plot is all over the place, the "jokes" are pretty stupid and Myers has a very unhealthy fondness for fart jokes--there are TONS of them. They're not even remotely funny--they're crude and stupid. I dozed off halfway through the film...I also noticed people walking out of the cinema--that's never a good sign.There are a few cameos at the beginning that are slightly amusing but that's it. For Mike Myers fans only.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Austin Powers in Goldmember</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the third of the Austin Powers spy spoofs. Mike Myers returns Austin Powers, Dr. Evil, Fat Bastard (from The Spy Who Shagged Me) and a new character called Goldmember (hence the title). Dr. Evil plans to take over the world with the help of Goldmember's plan. With the help of Foxxy Cleopatra (introducing ex-Destiny's Child singer Beyoncé Knowles) from 1975 he attempts to foil his plan. As the film goes on he is accompanied by his father (like most trilogy's in the third film). His Dad is played by the well suited Michael Caine. As the film goes on Dr. Evil's son Scott (Seth Green) starts to turn evil too, and Dr. Evil starts to ignore his clone Mini Me (Verne Troyer). So Mini Me decides to help Austin and Foxxy. A very good comedy with many famous faces, including Michael York as Basil Exposition, Tom Cruise, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kevin Spacey, Danny DeVito, Steven Spielberg, Quincy Jones, Britney Spears, Nathan Lane, The Osbournes and John Travolta. Mike Myers was number 46 on The Comedians' Comedian. Good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite enjoying the sequel more than the original I thought GOLDMEMBER was the weakest in the Austin Powers trilogy possibly due to the air of entire self indulgence that runs throughout the movie . This is personified by the appearance of Michael Caine as Nigel Powers . You can just imagine Caine picking up the script and reading : " Nigel is surrounded by four sexy skimpliy dressed bimbos in knee length boots " and Caine thinking " Well I grew up in absolute poverty and fought in The Korean war so what have I to feel guilty about " In other words the cast are in serious danger of enjoying themselves far more than the audience and you do get the feeling the film is more for the people who worked on it rather than the worldwide audience Take the highly intrusive self referential pre title sequence cameo appearances . How does the film benefit from this ? It doesn't . Likewise there's some clumsy continuity from Jay Roach . For example Austin is in the villains base and chase's after the villain , the only thing is the base is crawling with the villain's henchmen and at no point do they interact with what's going on . I should also confess that having seen this movie several days ago only one funny sequence sticks in my mind . One where Austin grabs the wrong end of the stick involving Mini Me while there's several scenes that stick in my mind because they're painfully unfunny like the subtitles and the joke that was recycled from the previous movie . Watching GOLDMEMBER isn't quite a painful cinematic experience but certainly the producers could have come up with something far better . Hopefully this will be the last ( And it's certainly the least ) in the Austin Powers franchise</fullReview>
