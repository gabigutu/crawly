		<shortDescription>Larry Flynt, Great American</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this one fully expecting to like the heck out of it, and I wasn't disappointed. No one had to convince me the message was a valid one, but I still thought I'd drop a line to say that I thought it was a very well done movie. It shows how a right that is supposedly near and dear to us all is often skewed in favor of mollycoddling lots of hypocrites who has the ridiculous audacity to think they have the right and the obligation to tell the rest of the world what to think of as moral or immoral. I loved the scene where Woody Harrelson, who does an absolutely bang-up job, gives a speech about how explicit depictions of death, murder, and war are considered appropriate while sex is considered filthy. "Sex or war" indeed. The more of Harrelson I see, the more my respect for his work grows. I must also mention Courtney Love, who is terrific as Althea. Great movie, I thought. Most of the people who don't like it are probably also the very ones it portrays as being the "bad guys"-the religious right, of course. Larry Flynt may not be admirable in the type of lifestyle he and Althea lived, and his magazine is, to my mind, entirely repugnant. But if Larry and Althea truly had the sort of relationship portrayed they loved each other beyond all reason, and what he did makes him a great patriot. How many people would do what he did in defense of such an idealistic belief? Not all people who do great things for great reasons are great people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unusual, audacious film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As Larry Flynt is hardly the usual type of person you think of when you think of the word "hero," it's fitting that this biopic opts not for the standard approach, but to make an offbeat comedy(as writers Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski did in their screenplay for ED WOOD and the upcoming MAN ON THE MOON, about controversial comedian Andy Kaufman). You may not like him(and one of two faults I had with this film was I think the filmmakers lionized him a little too much), but certainly any society which calls itself free needs to make room for him. Harrelson does a good job in the title role, but the real force for me came from Courtney Love, in an astonishing performance as Flynt's wife, and Edward Norton, one of the best new talents, as Flynt's reluctant lawyer.Besides that it does lionize Flynt a little too much, there is one problem I had, though. If you believe the film, all of Flynt's opposition came from right-wing blowhards like Charles Keating and Jerry Falwell. Certainly, they did have the most publicized tussles with him. But to ignore the problems he had with feminists makes it rather limited. I don't agree with Gloria Steinhem's contention that the film ignores his depraved side, but I think the film would have been more interesting if it had addressed the opposition he had from both the left and the right. Still, this is a terrific and important film to remind us what freedom really is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Your Typical Patriot.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Idealized biography of Hustler magazine mogul Larry Flynt (played superbly by Oscar nominee Woody Harrelson) which finally ends up focusing on his legal battles to publish his pornography via the free speech laws of this land. Along the way he marries a bisexual wild woman (Courtney Love) who shares his unconventional views on free love, priced pornography and drug abuse. The character also survives an assassin's bullet, paralysis, imprisonment, endless court battles against the Reverend Jerry Falwell and even his own destructive nature. Edward Norton (a relative newcomer when this was released) shines as Harrelson's young attorney who tries to overlook and overcome his client's tirades. Director Milos Forman (Oscar-nominated) does a good job creating a cinematic story about a man who is hard for most in mainstream society to understand or relate to. Flynt is humanized and so are those who cross his path throughout the picture. The movie is not as wild and crazed as one would think. Instead Forman uses well-timed comedy with drama to get the major points across effectively. Overall one of the better films of 1996. 4 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shocking Expose</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone familiar with Milos Forman's work will know how much he likes to discuss and examine controversial real-life characters and make them the focal point of his films. Amadeus for one was a powerful expose of the legendary composer; Forman was able to extraordinarily add so much spice to the script that the end result was a harrowing documentation that genuinely moved us. We didn't need to know anything about the composer or even like his work or personality; Forman craves on these sorts of challenges. He likes to make films about characters that the audience may not identify with because it heightens the overall achivement if the film is a hit. With Larry Flynt he's done it again.Flynt is the story of Porn magazine chairman larry Flynt who amidst an era of overwhelming decadance launched Hustler magazine, a porn magazine that broke all taboos and crossed all boundaries. The magazine was a huge hit that transformed Flynt into a powerful figure in the American Community. Needless to say though, Flynt (superbly played by Harrelson) faces insurmountable odds from everyone to keep the business running. Politicians, reverends, mass public opposition et.al.. Flynt is accompanied along the way by his junkie wife (played with real panache by Courtney Love) and a reluctant lawyer (dependable performance from Edward Norton Jr.). At the midway point of the film Flynt is shot and paralyzed and consequently the fight to stay on top is made even more challenging.This story is intriguing because is dares to break universal taboo's. It shows Flynt disassociating himself from the norms and traditions of society and really willing to take genuine risks that could blow up in his face. Before Hustler was formed, Playboy was the porno pioneer. Playboy was subtle in it's nudity, preferring to call itself a REAL magazine rather than something trashy. We notice that Playboy was afraid to overstep the barrier. Playboy was a magazine that was restricted in it's disclosure of barenaked ladies because of the shape of society at the time and the values the society had come to embrace. To call yourself a porno magazine was unthinkable with unthinkable consequences! Hustler dared to step over those lines and bear all the consequences. Flynt was not necessarily a likeable man but he cannot not be admired. He was a risk taker, an enterpeneur, a man with a vision, and a man who believed that oe should act on one's desires and ambitions.The mass hysteria the swamps the society as a consequence mainfests how powerful yet dangerous a little "acting on ambition" can bring. Flynt's idea is impossible to resist; the public cannot stay away from the controversial impact of the magazine. As the fan base grows, so does Flynt's empire, and so do the forces determined to suppress him. Flynt's meteoric rise is unprecedented, and made all the more shocking by the fact that the evnets are real. His opposition ranges from hypocritical politicians to dubious religious figures, all of whom are hell-bent on the abolition of Flynt and his tremendous reach.The film earns huge plaudits on the entertainment level. This is undisputed!! The acting demonstartes tremendous range from all involved and Flynt is an offensive yet endearing, and very funny figure. We grow to really love and root for him as the film develops. The points that necessitate discussion however are the legal and moral issues that are debated by Flynt, his lawyer, and the opposition. The freedom of press, of speech, and the freedom to exercise your FREEDOM are all fiercely debated. Flynt vehemently defends his position because he feels that the world is afraid to agree with him, that the world is afraid to speak out. The world is polluted by hypocrits; he's the only pure seed. This presents tremendous irony because Flynt is a low-class pervert up against scholars, and politicians, and bureaucrats, and yet he's claiming that he's the real deal and they are all phonies. He has a point; what's the point in looking presentable and being well-educated if you are banal, hollow, and insipid and cannot open your mind to new ideas?? The film asks that question; we see how closed off the men in power are to Flynt's ideas and we grow to hate them. Then we are torn because we are reluctant to accept the values of a porn fiend. The fact that we cannot resist Flynt's pulling power is the sign of the film's success. We start off opposing Flynt, unable to identify. Then we try and take a neutral stand as we discover the ugliness of Flynt's opponents. Finally, after Flynt is paralyzed and yet continues to defend his honour, we can no longer resist the seduction.The film has Flynt giving amazing speeches about why he is doing justice to himself and the people. He's giving them what they want,they are taking it,and yet they are determined to censor him. He debates this point to manifest the outstanding hypocrisy that lies at the heart of society. Flynt is such an important character because he speaks for all of us. On countless occasions, we all seek to expose the two-faced ugliness of those around us. We just can't because not enough people are listening. Flynt however gets eveyone's attention and defends his honour, preserves his integrity, and succeeds in winning over the justice system. The final speech given by Issacman, his lawyer is very insightful and very powerful for it argues this very point: 'We don't need to like what Larry Flynt does, but we should like and appreciate the fact that we have the right to make that decision on our own, and that's what makes our society great. We have the right to accept or reject the offer on hand. We may well reject it but we and we alone need to have the choice made available to us. If that right is taken away, then we wither away as a people and our individuality is nullified' The speech is amazing because it demonstrates how the right to accept a porn fiend and his work preserves the democracy of the Western World. Truly Shocking but brilliant!!!I haven't discussed the other characters all that much and I'm not going to except say this: All the characters are multi-dimensional because what we see on the outside is never what we get on the inside. Flynt for all his crude, perverted behaviour is an admirable, likeable, highly identifiable personality. His wife, for all her vulgarity and drug addiction is an endearing, loyal,intelligent personality. Issacman, the lawyer, for all his traditional, stiff boring work ethic, is an idealistic, shrewd, and deeply committed man....The list goes on and onI loved this movie because our hero is not perfect; he's anything but!!! Movies that depict the hero as a flawed individual stand a better chance of being embraced by critics and audiences alike. Flynt thrives on this! And exposing hypocrits for their true selves is every cynics (and I happen to be a huge one) dream. Flynt's journey is whopping emotional tour de force!!!! You don't have to like Larry Flynt as a film, but I love the fact that I had the right to make up my own mind!! Society, you ignore that at your peril!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good autobiographical drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before watching this movie, I had nearly no idea who Larry Flynt was. I read a quick summary a few minutes before watching it, but I hardly knew any specific details. After watching it, I know exactly who he is, and what he stands for. He stands for freedom of speech. Some might call him a pervert. Others call him a patriot. I believe he is the latter. While I don't know the exact story of Larry Flynt from any other sources than this movie, I don't know if it's completely accurate. The plot is great, for a biographic piece, the acting is superb, by most actors, especially the three main characters. Most of the cinematography fits the movie perfectly. The only thing that bothered me a little, was there was relatively little information about why Larry Flynt did what he did, believed what he believed so strongly. I sympathized with his character in several scenes, but I never fully understood him. The director should have had at least a few more emotional scenes with Larry, to explain his actions better. Overall, a very good drama. Recommendable to most fans of the genre, as long as they can stand what the movie shows them. If you have an open mind, you're not too easily offended and you're into autobiographical dramas, this is a good film to watch. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The People vs. Larry Flynt" is already 8 years old, and the subject it talks about is even older, but it still hasn't lost anything of it's relevance. This isn't a movie about Larry Flynt, the porn king. It's more a movie about the right to say what you want to say, without having to think of every person's opinion first. You may not like the man or what he stands for, but at least he has the guts to stand up for what he believes in. He defends his right to speak freely and doesn't mind kicking against the shins of the ultra conservative Christians. In a way today's America needs more people like him instead of acting like a bunch of sheep being brought to the slaughterhouse by their government...The acting in the movie is very good, but especially Woody Harrelson as Larry Flynt and Edward Norton as his lawyer were excellent. Courtney Love isn't really an actress, but still did a good job (not that hard to do when you play a role that you are quite familiar with in your own life.)All in all this is a very enjoyable movie that will be loved by some and hated by many. Personally I liked it and I give it a 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Career milestone for Woody Harrelson &amp; Courtney Love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE PEOPLE VS. LARRY FLYNT (1996) **** Woody Harrelson, Courtney Love, Edward Norton, James Carville, James Cromwell, Richard Paul, Crispin Glover, Vincent Schiavelli, Miles Chapin, Brett Harrelson, Donna Hanover, Norm MacDonald. Superb biographical account of smut publisher Larry Flynt (portrayed by Best Actor nominee Harrelson in arguably the role of his career) whose bouts with the courts regarding libel, pornography and ultimately first amendment rights to the freedom of speech are captured like a tempest in a teacup that depicts the rise and near fall of Flynt (who was paralyzed in an assassination attempt) and the uncomparable love affair with his doomed yet dedicated wife, bisexual, drug-addicted and tragically AIDS afflicted wife Althea Leasure (Love in a toweringly brilliant turn at acting that deserves all the recognition she mustered) who stood by her man as she withered away. Funny, insightful, important and some masterful filmmaking overall thanks largely to the cleverly constructed screenplay by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski ("Ed Wood"), costumes by Theodore Pistek and Arianne Phillips, and all too believeable production design by Patricia von Brandenstein. And yes that is real-life Flynt as one of the judges passing sentence and yes it is real-life brother Brett of Woody playing siblings. Kudos to Best Director nominee Milos Forman (who was sorely passed over in the Best Picture nomination as well as practically getting shut out come to mention it) for pulling off a difficult hat trick: making scum respectable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oscar Winning Milos Forman's The People Vs. Larry Flynt is a fascinating (if not too trashy) look at how without the first amendment, people like Flynt would not exist. We see an expose on the man, myth and legend of master porno publisher Larry Flynt (played to damn close perfection by Oscar nominated Woody Harrelson) who releases Hustler (in my opinion the best porno mag ever, but that's just me) and gets severe backlash from censors, church people and just people in general. But, we see his struggle to fight back at any cost (even his legs) to send a message- just because you don't like doesn't mean you can't let me publish what I want. Forman directs this pumped drama with 5-star performances from Harrelson, Love (as the tragedy queen girlfriend) and Especially Norton (as the suffering yet compelling lawyer). Never ashamed and always On the edge, this film has a place not only in film history, but in Hustler magazine's also. The real Flynt appears as a Cinncinatti judge and Norm MacDonald appears as a reporter. A+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>it is unfortunate that when one thinks of the movie 'people vs. larry flynt' the first person to come to mind is courtney love. not that she does an less then stellar job, rather by focusing solely on her, the rest of the richly deserving cast are overlooked. woody harrelson is genius as larry flynt. despite my liberal leanings, before seeing this movie i had made peace with the fact the flynt was a scum, but i would support him on the basis of free speech. after seeing this movie i was able to gain insight into the parts of his character which make him whole person. instead of seeing what Christian-right zealots, or bleeding heart liberals, tried to force upon me, i saw the entire man and all he brought with him. granted this was shown primarily thru scenes written and directed by milos forman, however, it is harrelson who brings them to life and convinces me of their sincerity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Finest Biopic Till Date.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Larry Flynt is surely a cult figure, he believed in expressing thoughts, he made America a better place, in a way. Hustler Magazine, agreed it's damn explicit, but it's sells... and has made Fylnt a bloody rich man.While watching 'The People VS Larry Flynt', I was stunned by the way the biopic has been executed by legendary filmmaker Milo? Forman. A highly-entertaining, highly-intriguing &amp; a highly-gripping film. This film shows us the rise &amp; rise of Larry Fylnt, the man who believed in doing what your heart says. An incredible film! 'The People VS Larry Fylnt' is a film that leaves behind a lot of questions? Example, Fylnt says that WAR is more homely a talk than SEX... Now that's something!SEX is something that everyone wants, but when it's shown on TV or in a Movie or in a Magazine, everyone seems to be getting uncomfortable? Fylnt knew what he was doing... and he proved right after all the Court-Cases, and despite being a paralyzed man. 'The People VS Larry Fylnt' is a must watch film.... because it shows a man who did what he had to despite everything that happened to him.Woody Harrelson's performance as Larry Fylnt is exemplary. Any compliment won't do justice his portrayal. Courtney Love is fabulous as Fylnt's lady love. Edward Norton is fantastic as Flynt's lawyer. Larry Fylnt who makes a brief appearance as a judge, is perfect.'The People VS Larry Fylnt' cannot be missed by anyone... watch the amazing life of a man amazing man right now! Two Big Thumbs Up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sexual acting out posing as sexual freedom</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We sometimes have trouble in our patri(matri)archal political and social structures thinking outside of dualisms. For example, if a person is shamed and repressed by the archy, it often seems like the only way to freedom is through rebellion. Thus, in movies like "The People Versus Larry Flynt" and "Quills" we get sexual acting out, sexual excess and sexual abuse presented as sexual freedom. The archy loves this: It needs an "enemy" to continue thriving. The archy creates the conditions for rebellion to thrive. The archy also secretly likes to glorify this "rebellion." So, in movies like "The People" and "Quills", we also get stories glorifying pornography in such a way that strips it of its true ugliness and tragedy. These movies make pornography seem "cool." "The People" operates on the premise (even if it is supposed to be done with humor) that Larry Flynt, our flawed "hero," is standing up to sexually repressive American Christian Fundamentalists such as Jerry Fallwell. Flynt does this by exploiting and victimzing young women who are victims of the very system he is supposedly trying to "liberate" everyone from. I am all for more openness and less shame in the handling of sexual matters on a mass cultural level, but I do not see pornography and the exploitation of women's bodies as the best means of doing this. On the contrary, pornography is merely the flip side of sexual repression: It is sex seen as "dirty", tainted with the stink of patri(matri)archal shame. Hopefully, in time, we can all move beyond such dualistic ways of thinking and realize that true freedom lies in respecting everyone's needs and values from the time they are brought into this world and not getting lost in this eternal game of repress-rebel that has been responsible for so many of our world's ills over the last two thousand years. Long live empathy and compassion!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie for the first time in fall of 2005 when I was given a copy of it from Jimmy Flynt. I am a Christian, I work for the church, and I have been a mission worked in a third world country. That being said, I must also say that I cringed many times during this movie. I do not live with blinders on, but this movie made me feel like I do. That was the biggest shock of anything for me.I completely support Jimmy and Larry for standing up for their rights and for what they believe in. I don't know Larry, but I find Jimmy to be very much like his character in the movie. It was fun seeing the movie "after" I had become friends with Jimmy. He's a wonderful man, very kind, and very down to earth. You would not think this about him by knowing only his reputation (name).This was not a movie I would have ever made an effort to see, but was very happy that I did. Like it or not, freedom of speech is why our country is the best country in the world!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Courtney Love is the worst part of this movie. She's terrible, hard to stomach, and can't act to save her life. THAT SAID....This is one of the best movies I've ever seen, and it really makes you think about what it means to live in the USA. For those of you out there reading this review who do not live in the USA, you've no doubt heard about how we Americans like to pride ourselves for being so freaking awesome... until someone points out how backwards and self-absorbed we really are. That's not to say Americans are bad (quite the contrary), but we definitely have a problem admitting when we're wrong. This movie makes no apologies, and goes straight for the jugular. And thanks to Milos Foreman, and Larry Flynt himself, this movie asks us to consider just how fundamental the right of free speech, and the freedom of expression, is to society. And yes, it relates to hardcore porn.Without delving too much into the technical aspects of the movie, let me just say that if you watch the Edward Norton courtroom scenes (the first where Larry Flynt himself is the judge, and the last one when he's arguing to the Supreme Court), and the epic speech our protagonist gives on "sex versus death," you are going to start developing opinions. It is going to make you think, and it might challenge your comfort zone. And for all those reasons, this movie is worth every moment of your time... including those painful scenes involving Courtney Love.I still think about this movie sometimes, whenever I hear people arguing about their First Amendment rights. Larry Flynt might not be a knight in shining armor, so to speak, but what he stands for is more than just porn - it's freedom of expression, and Americans have to accept that that doesn't necessarily mean something tame or conservative. It's an important lesson, and a movie that should not be missed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"If the First Amendment will protect a scumbag like me, then it'll protect all of you -- 'cause I'm the worst," declares Hustler Magazine publisher Larry Flynt in the midst of one of his many court cases. The People vs. Larry Flynt is a biographical drama film directed by Milo? Forman about the rise of pornographic magazine publisher and editor Larry Flynt, and his subsequent clash with the law. The film stars Woody Harrelson, Courtney Love, and Edward Norton.The film was written by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski. It spans about 25 years of Flynt's life from his impoverished upbringing in Kentucky to his court battle with Reverend Jerry Falwell, and is based in part on the U.S. Supreme Court case Hustler Magazine v. Falwell. Forman's film follows Flynt from his childhood in Kentucky, where he made extra money for his dirt-poor family by selling the moonshine his father brewed, into adulthood as he manages a strip club in Cincinnati. While the club does middling business, the experience changes Flynt's life in two ways: he meets Althea, an exotic dancer who becomes the love of his life, and he gets the bright idea of starting a magazine to promote the club. Marketed as a crasser, less pretentious alternative to Playboy or Penthouse, Hustler becomes a huge success after Flynt runs a photo series of Jacqueline Onassis sunbathing nude. However, while plenty of people are buying Hustler, there are also plenty of people who don't care for it, including Charles Keating, leader of a watchdog group called Citizens For Decent Literature. Keating spearheads the first of many legal attacks on the magazine, one of which reaches the Supreme Court as Alan Isaacman, Flynt's lawyer, debates the finer legal points of bad taste with the justices of the highest court in the land. Meanwhile, Flynt makes a fortune, loses the use of his legs after an attack by a sniper, embraces and than abandons Christianity, and eventually loses Althea, who succumbs to AIDS after a long addiction to drugs.A brave, spectacularly entertaining -- and unexpectedly stirring -- account of Flynt's life that asks us to regard the publisher of Hustler magazine as an invaluable champion of our First Amendment freedoms.It's a modern-day Capra film, about an unorthodox businessman who's persecuted for his originality but eventually is recognized for the lovable, rugged American individualist he truly is.Woody Harrelson plays Flynt with energy, and Courtney Love does at least as well as his wife.And special mention also goes to Edward Norton.The screenplay, by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, is rich in detail and dialogue.But still,the movie is not compelling enough to generate interest and great entertainment to the viewer.But still,it is a good movie to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why I love movie biographies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The genre of the movie biography is often marked (or marred) by hero worship, historical inaccuracy, and more clichés than one can tolerate. Usually, a director has a specific reason for selecting a project about a particular person. Biopics are usually about heroes, or at least about misunderstood good people. When such a picture is attempted about a villain or ne'er-do-well, a very fine tightrope must be walked between whitewashing and playing it safe with a politically correct hatchet job.With THE PEOPLE VS. LARRY FLYNT, director Milos Forman treads that tightrope with confidence. His protagonist is a man whom millions have condemned as a vile pornographer and character assassin. Telling any kind of story from the perspective of Larry Flynt or anyone like him is dangerous. But Forman is careful to be thoroughly analytical in his examination of Flynt's life. He does not try to lick the publisher's boots, but simply presents him as he was (albeit in a heightened fashion). Forman's Flynt is a man whose ambition, bad temper, and appetite for anarchy get him into a lot of trouble; at the same time, he is not devoid of relatable human feeling.Almost as if to parody Abraham Lincoln's beginnings, Forman first shows Flynt as a Kentucky youth living in a log cabin. Eager to get ahead in life, he haphazardly concocts his own moonshine and peddles it to local drunks. A few decades later, his fortunes have improved somewhat: he now operates a low-rent, semi-successful burlesque house in downtown Cincinnati. But far from being content with making enough money to live comfortably, Flynt is on the cusp of unleashing on the world his own redneck manifesto. Condemning Playboy as an elitist publication, he vows to create a men's magazine that values the beer-drinker over the martini-drinker. The result is Hustler - which, far from being just another girlie magazine, vents Flynt's class anger by lashing out in vicious mockery of a world that he and his clients never made.As his recreational tastes begin to run to the abstract, Flynt becomes increasingly outspoken about his supposed relevance as a spokesman for First Amendment rights. When his magazine is banned in some cities, this confirmed hedonist transforms into something of a pagan pulpit-pounder. His barnstorming eventually brings him into contact with a more traditional kind of pulpit-pounder: Moral Majority leader Jerry Falwell. Under pretense of jesting, Flynt low-blows Reverend Falwell with an obscene and slanderous ad parody. The stage is now set for a somewhat farcical battle of wills that manages to mount high enough to reach the Supreme Court.Whether you admire Flynt or not, it is easy to take away from Forman's movie the basic message that his rights as a publisher were just as precious as anyone else's. Problem is, Larry seeks not just vindication but domination: he is hell-bent on testing the very limits of constitutional license and public tolerance, repeatedly daring an uptight world to silence him. His megalomania causes him to be far more concerned about all the free publicity his magazine receives from the controversy than with anything as elevated as constitutional freedoms. Woody Harrelson must be commended for capturing with aplomb the audacity of a man whose circus-like antics masked a ruthless determination to hype and exploit himself no less sordidly than any of the naked women in his magazine. That this man has become an icon for the rights of American democracy and capitalism is a bitter irony for many to stomach, but it is no less true because of that.The real-life figures portrayed in this movie are rendered without compromise and with an eye toward objectivity; Forman resists the urge to place anyone on a pedestal or drag anyone through the mud. Harrelson convincingly brings to life a colorful and imaginative man who gradually becomes emboldened, then intoxicated, and finally consumed by his petty sense of self-importance. And Jerry Falwell, far from being demonized, is portrayed with great tact and understanding; that he sometimes comes across as a glad-hander may not always be bearable, but it is believable.THE PEOPLE VS. LARRY FLYNT reminds me of why I so enjoy modern Hollywood biographical films. They are always about figures who live their lives to the fullest, often with complete disregard for the consequences. Larry Flynt inhabits a world that is totally his own, and he will not rest until every inch of that internal experience has been projected onto the outside world in all its tawdry glory. "I turned the whole world into a tabloid!" he exults at one point. Watching it all on a screen, safely quarantined by the passage of time and by ironic distance, it is hard not to share in that exhilaration.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most likely the first film I saw on a movie theater in US, it struck me deeply as an excellent film showing some basics of American spirit. Namely: the First Amendment of the Constitution (Freedom of Speech etc) and the first sentence of the Declaration of Independence: "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness."A must see film. Be careful if you see it with your parents though: You need to later explain it to them...Everybody, from actors to director and screenwriter is at his/her best!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Idealised Account of a Not-So-Ideal Man!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Milos Forman's biographic drama, though a little dragging and momentumless towards the middle, is a well-made movie, with incredible acting to steer it through.The movie misses the point, and tries to portray Mr.Larry Flynt as such a likable honest man. Larry Flynt, who had countless number of wives and divorces, whose ex-wives claim he was a beater, whose own daughter accused him of sexual abuse, who disowned his own daughter, whose magazines are a bit too sexist... is idealized a bit too much in the movie. But for what purpose? Why not show him the way he is? The whole point is to concentrate on the importance of the first amendment; no matter what kind of person it is, and what he/she is trying to express, the amendment gives them the freedom to do so. If the story was told from the neutral point of view of the lawyer (played by Edward Norton), with the magazines and the religious institutions on either side, it would have made a more compelling point.The acting is top-notch, and the only thin which holds the movie together. Woody Harrelson is a delight to watch, and Courtney Love is surprisingly good in her acting. Mr. Nortan does a charming supporting role.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Harrelson is Outstanding in an Academy-Award Caliber Performance of a Not-So-Outstanding Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is an old adage stating that in dramatic presentations, audiences should be empathatic with the main characters. Actors dream of getting roles with which audiences will strongly identify and earn them strong accolades, such as Atticus Finch, Anne of Green Gables, or even Forrest Gump. Woody Harrelson, in probably the role of his career, beat the odds and attained deserved recognition by portraying a self-centered, egotistical, rude, violent, and amoral peddler of "sexploitation" for which no one in their right mind would have any empathy. If there is anybody on earth that probably does not deserve to be lauded with a biographical film, aside from televangelists and makers of sugar cereals, it's Larry Flynt. But what Harrelson does is give you not only an honest portrayal but a very compelling performance of one of the most unsympathetic of human beings in the field of smut publication. Flynt, who would probably be in more suitable company amongst a pack of wolverines, deserves nothing (except maybe the Dick Cheney Citizenship Award) but his story is worth telling because of the issues of freedom of the press.Personally, I am not a fan of pornography and I definitely loathe the material contained in the likes of Hustler Magazine. However, I found the film compelling because of the interesting aspects of the lawsuits and political dynamism that erupted from a magazine that millions of people decided to buy. The film chronicles the rise of Flynt, from the owner of a girlie bar to one of the best-selling smut magazines in the history of pornography in the United States. I should also mention his love interest, Althea Flynt, played with stunning believability by Courtney Love, as the porn print model who becomes addicted to painkillers late in the film.The fascinating aspect of the film (probably the only reason I would watch such a movie) is the myriad of lawsuits and criminal indictments that came knocking on Flynt's door when his magazine became a hit. Ironically, the lawsuits which began to achieve national attention helped sell more copies because there is really no such thing as bad publicity, especially in the field of bad taste. Hustler Magazine was not targeting people who read Better Homes and Gardens. How could the publicity of lawsuits not help this magazine aimed at people interested in porn? Edward Norton plays Flynt's attorney who is the most level-headed of all the key players of this strange drama in American pornographic culture consumption. In one of his first arguments to a jury, he explains that he is not defending Flynt because he likes Hustler Magazine. In fact, he doesn't like Hustler Magazine. He is defending the freedom of the press and the ability to engage in free expression.The film goes on to chronicle Flynt's court appearances in which he makes the likes of John MacEnroe seem like a cultured gentleman. ("You can not be serious!" would have been tame by Flynt standards.) The film climaxes with the ground-breaking lawsuit in which the late Reverend Jerry Falwell sued Larry Flynt and Hustler Magazine for a fabricated account of Falwell's early sexual encounters. The case went all the way to the Supreme Court and was argued by Flynt's attorney, which was my favorite part of the film.The other aspect of this strange man and his strange magazine that the film does a good job of conveying is that no matter how outraged those on the religious and political right felt about the publication of Hustler, they could not stop the sales. Which is the main point of the film I think, and that is if there is a market for something, even something in such bad taste as Hustler, someone will work to feed and profit from that market. Everyone knows but does not affirm that if Hustler had failed to sell copies at newsstands, no one would have cared. If the magazine hadn't sold millions of copies, there would have been no lawsuits and no investigations. Only when the magazine found a readership did the political/religious right take notice.People dream of becoming famous, either as a prominent entertainer, a musician, a politician, an athlete, or as someone who performs an heroic act. And among those who have achieved the recognition to put them into the spotlight of celebrity, these people probably dream of having a film made about them. Larry Flynt himself did nothing positive to deserve a film being made about him. The reason the film has merit is not because of Flynt but because of the larger issue of free expression. I may dislike Hustler Magazine but I will reluctantly agree to its circulation in the name of freedom of the press. Flynt deserves no recognition in my opinion, except maybe the Hugh Hefner Award for Sexploitation. The real honor goes to Woody Harrelson who may the only person daring enough to play such a role in the name of freedom of the press.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I admit I enjoyed this movie because it tells an interesting story of one man's fight for free speech. Nonetheless, it doesn't make Larry Flynt a hero in any way. In Canada, we get a version of Hustler that's quite different from the U.S. version. We can't sell the U.S. version here because it's considered too obscene. As a devoted Catholic, I'm against pornography in all its forms.For example, wouldn't you be shocked if you looked at a cartoon in a 1976 edition of Hustler that shows a Santa Claus with an extremely large penis?Larry, if you ever come to Canada, don't expect us to roll out the welcome mat for you!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a mixed biography for one of the kings of pornography</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Czech director who emigrated in the USA in the seventies, Milos Forman, these last years specialized in biographies: "Larry Flynt" (1996) and he was to shot "Man on the Moon" three years later about the life of the comedian Andy Kaufman. After a seven year absence (his last movie was "Valmont" in 1989), "Larry Flynt" was released in 1996 and we all have in our minds the poster because it caused a scandal. Larry Flynt, one of the kings of pornography depicted as a crucified Christ on the string of a woman! After I watched this movie which relates the chaotic career of this man against the establishment, it left me a bitter taste, in a major part caused by the script.It is not a matter of chance if Forman hired Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski as the scriptwriters. Both concocted the screenplay of the delicious "Ed Wood" (1994) one of Tim Burton's peaks in his work. So to write the script of "Larry Flynt", they used the same methods as "Ed Wood"'s: to relate his life as precisely as possible. If it had wonderfully worked in Burton's movie, here the mayonnaise isn't thickening for Forman's movie. I think that it is due to a difference of personality with the two quoted characters. Indeed, Ed Wood was an eternal loser but the scriptwriters had made him endearing. Moreover, Johnny Depp had rendered his personality in a convincing way. As for Larry Flynt, he was a winner although he has had trouble with the law and he built a real empire based on a vulgar exploitation of the woman body. At once, we deal with an ambitious but hateful character. Woody Harrelson's efforts to make him nice are ineffective, either in dramatic moments (Flynt's wife who commits suicide) either in funny sequences (Flynt's excess in court). Besides these last sequences aren't even funny in the way Harrelson goes over the top.As a result, the movie loses a lot of its appeal and you just glance through it. By way of consolation, we can save Courtney Love who for her real first role in screen offers a decent and sometimes harrowing performance. There's also a decent performance from Edward Norton but he will find the role of his life three years later in "Fight Club".A mixed biography which shows that the presence of two excellent scriptwriters in a film doesn't always contribute to its success.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The People VS Larry Flynt (1996): Dir: Milos Foreman / Cast: Woody Harrelson, Courtney Love, Edward Norton, James Cromwell, Richard Paul: Rousing film about Larry Flynt and his constant battle with society and what is morally acceptable. He is the creator of Hustler magazine, which rivals Playboy in its pornographic expectations. He argues that the female body should not be disregarded but lands in court on numerous occasions. Eventually he ends up in a wheelchair after an attempt is taken on his life. He lands in court again to answer a lawsuit by a religious leader. Then his wife announces that she has A.I.D.S. Some may see it as a celebration of repulsive behavior yet the film is provocative with director Milos Foreman presents strong arguments. Foreman is at his best with material such as this especially when one looks at Amadeus, arguably his best film. Woody Harrelson delivers a flawless performance displaying Flynt's ego and arrogance. Courtney Love is superb as Flynt's unstable wife whose health suffers. Edward Norton is excellent as Flynt's frustrated lawyer who does much damage control. James Cromwell delivers interesting supporting work as well as Richard Paul who plays off the religious right wing agenda of Jerry Fawell whom Flynt mocks. Portrait of a man with questionable ethics and an argument for free speech. Score: 8 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I could never understand why so many people can be so pompous and arrogant as to actually believe that their own personal opinions upon things that they don't like should supersede the opinions of those who like them; and, deprive the latter of such things!?!?This movie shows how people who are uptight, rich, pious, power-hungry, and/or flat-out crooked can manipulate the system and trample the basic rights of others; and, the rights of those who are new entrepreneurs of things these headhunters don't like, as Larry Flynt was. The same thing happened to Preston Tucker for building a better car than The Big Three - Chevrolet, Ford, and, Dodge; and, to Francis Ford Coppola for starting his own movie studio. The rich and powerful keep everyone else in check!Pornography really isn't my bag...neither is rap music; psycho-slasher movies; and, other things...hominy grits...but, I'd never be so smug as to actually start a petition to ban any of them because "I" don't like them!?!? It's not important to me to do so. Nor, would I write any negative reviews about them on IMDb or anywhere else. I simply stay away from them; change the channel; etc! I cannot believe the time that people waste writing long and tiresome reviews on IMDb about movies that they don't like - how boring can their negative lives possibly be? I only write reviews about movies (and, other things) that I like...and, I "LIKE" this movie.This movie is about much more than the right to sell and distribute, and, buy and enjoy pornography; it's about the right to have free choice, free speech, and, anti-censorship...to name a few.The decision that the supreme court made at the end of this movie was one of great importance because it upheld the First Amendment; and, discarded the frivolous opinions of thin-skinned people who are offended by things that don't concern them. If you don't like it, avoid it! That crook, Charles Keating, should have avoided this, and, Playboy Magazine, altogether, for his own good; but, for everyone else, it was a blessing and a victory! It showed what kind of person he 'really' is, and, what he did later. He puts all of his power and energy into banning pornography...then, becomes the central figure in the Lincoln Savings and Loan scandal that cost American taxpayers over 2 billion dollars!?!? 'These' are the kinds of 'smut peddlers' (crooked people in government) who not only manipulate the system, but, run it!?!? 'They're' the people to watch out for!As to the movie itself, Woody Harrelson, Courtney Love, and, Edward Norton are fabulous in their acting...especially Harrelson and Love in the courtrooms!!! Even Larry Flynt, the 'real' Larry Flynt, plays Judge Morrissey of the Cincinnati Court who sentenced Larry Flynt to twenty-five years...priceless contradictory acting! Kudos to Larry Flynt! :)As I wrote before, I, personally don't look at pornography, nor, do I think it's 'dirty,' but, I have nothing against it either (why would I...I love the female form and I love sexual encounters with it); but, if someone wants to buy 'adult' pornography, they have that right to do so.As far as sex goes, Woody Allen inadvertently protected and supported Larry Flynt in an unknowing way by answering the question "Is sex dirty?" by replying..."Only when it's being done right."This is a monumental movie that 'should' show people that if you 'stick-to-your-guns' and 'fight for what you believe in,' maybe, just maybe, you'll win; and, by winning, you'll help others enjoy something that some other powerful and socially-boring and intellectually-retarded stuffed-shirt prima-donna tried to ban.If it doesn't hurt anyone, it should be legal!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A partially idealized film of the controversial pornography publisher (Woody Harrelson) and how he became a defender of free speech for all people.Whether or not you like pornography or even care about it, this film is interesting and important. First, it makes the case that Flynt made: the First Amendment should be protected, even when the Amendment itself protects things we find objectionable. (Now, how much he believed this and how much it was a legal ploy is open to debate.) But he was also a big figure in America history, connecting in to Jimmy Carter, the AbScam case with the FBI, and various other important events. There was the question of organized crime connections. They are brushed aside here, but the question remains. When Flynt passes, the FBI files on him could be fascinating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Intriguing Biopic Loaded With Excellent Performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"All I'm guilty of is bad taste," Larry Flynt (Woody Harrelson) shrugs. He has recently founded pornographic magazine Hustler, and after just a few months of success, he finds himself in the middle of a court case ? the religious zealots, helicopter parents, and anti-pornography activists of the world are his enemies. They find Flynt's magazine to be even trashier than Playboy. It's understandable: who wants a beloved figure like Santa Claus to be in the center of a severely lewd cartoon?Hugh Hefner's ideals seem saintly in comparison to the more adventurous Flynt. Hefner can get past the censors by squeezing in "articles" in- between the nudes, the nudes themselves being somewhat playful rather than severely hardcore. Flynt, on the other hand, is much less conscientious. He wants high quality pictures, ones that are no-holds barred and as explicit as possible. He doesn't have time for articles nor does he much care about the sensitivity of the public. He wants to give the perverts of the nation what they want.Now in his 70s, Flynt has been sued an obscene amount of times, whether it be regarding the magazine itself, the individuals he lampoons within its pages, or the people he offends. You can tell that The People vs. Larry Flynt is a great movie because, for two hours, we actually see Flynt as a sort of anti-hero, an advocate for free-speech and a man unafraid to push boundaries (even if the boundary line is so far away it looks like a dot). The film spans decades, covering his poverty coated childhood, his early days as a strip-club owner, his bombastic marriage to the unstable Althea Leasure (Courtney Love), the assassination attempt that paralyzed him from the waist down, and his court case filled '80s. He begins as a surprisingly smart businessman but declines after he is nearly killed. The People vs. Larry Flynt is an ingenious comedy for the first hour or so, treating Flynt's down-and-dirty business with a tongue-in-cheek manner that fits like a glove. In his early years, he was eager to please, slightly na?ve, and even charming. The transition from black comedy to wearisome drama would normally feel jarring, but Forman's direction is never purposefully funny or purposefully dark; he tells it like it is, and it just so happens that Flynt's life is just as full of laughs as it is of tragedies.The post-assassination life of Flynt is what hits the hardest, considering it follows such a bubbly, ballsy first half. Althea has adopted a severe drug habit and Flynt himself rides around in a gold wheelchair, his speech slurry and out-of-control. Hustler, if possible, has become even more tasteless, and Flynt's once impressive mansion is crumbling with the depressiveness of Norma Desmond's humble abode. As his life spirals out of control, we are reminded that one can hardly handle a great number of court cases, a near-killing, and pills and still be eager to please, slightly na?ve, and even charming. But you can hardly be a pornographer and avoid the eventual grease that will consume your every move.Harrelson is like a chameleon, adopting every single one of Flynt's mannerisms and then some. As the film travels through time, the titular figure changes his characteristics at a constant rate, but Harrelson doesn't merely change the way he talks and call it a day. He exudes Flynt's transitions so naturally that it is as if he's captured the man himself. Love is equally as terrific, giving Althea an infectious charisma that makes her final years all the more affecting.The People vs. Larry Flynt may cover too many bases to be consistently enthralling, but rarely has a film made a controversial figure so likable, so compelling on the screen. Larry Flynt is a scumbag, as one character puts it, but never has a scumbag been so multi-faceted, so utterly eccentric. And, kind of brilliant. Read more reviews at petersonreviews.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great film that portrays the United States Government's attack on free speech rights, in the form of it's attempts in prosecuting Mr. Larry Flynt, publisher of Hustler Magazine. Obviously Mr. Flynt is not someone most people would admire, and the film doesn't attempt to portray him as an angel by any means. What the film does portray is that the First Amendment of the United States Constitution was put in place to preserve our natural rights of freedom of speech. Any speech - as Ron Paul has stated, "The First Amendment was not put in place to protect our rights to talk about the weather." Mr. Flynt was jailed for publishing a magazine the government found to be indecent. Fortunately, for the preservation of Americans' rights, Mr. Flynt fought for his rights. When speech such as Larry Flynt's is protected, all of our speech is protected.Milos Forman does an outstanding job of direction, and Woody Harreson's performance was definitely worthy of it's Oscar nomination. Courtney Love is excellent as well, although you have to wonder how much of her performance was "acting", and how much was just Courtney Love being Courtney Love. Ed Norton as per usual puts in a stellar performance, playing Larry Flynt's abused lawyer. This film has consistently been in my top 10 favorites list not only for it's message, but it's entertainment value as well. It receives my highest possible recommendation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Documenting a chapter in American censorship</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film feels almost like a documentary in the sense that it does not contain much emotional content. It details the happenstances of Larry Flynt's life without asking us to love the guy or identify with him. But it does ask us to identify with his ideals, which are the core of the film.Flynt is well portrayed by Woody Harrelson as a self-interested entrepreneur, a self-invented man who found success in the publication of erotica via a circuitous route. He is also a man who goes out of his way to tackle controversy and ruffle feathers. Like Hefner and Guccione and others who work in the porn arena, Flynt waves the American flag and champions Constitutional rights, especially first amendment rights. Flynt also had the misfortune of beginning his crusade in Cincinnati--a very nice area that also has a deserved reputation of prudishness, based upon several notable cases of censorship.Courtney Love plays Flynt's (third) wife Althea, and delivers a tremendous performance of the complex woman who stood by Flynt during the worst times.The story is mostly fact, not fiction. Those unfamiliar with Flynt's battles with the law and his historic court cases can learn about a chapter in America's struggle to escape the influences of self-appointed moralists. In retrospect--given the availability of porn today--this story may seem unreal to some, but the battle lines and the consequences were as real as a sniper's bullet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, considering I'm a law school student and I have always enjoyed 90's courtroom dramas, Larry Flint's story couldn't stand only in my wish list. That being said, last night I rented it and had a good time. "The People vs. Larry Flynt" differs from the main movies of the genre due to its eccentric characters, professionally portrayed by Woody Harrelson and Courtney Love. Harrelson's character is a man who does everything in his power to innovate and provoke the society, in order to expand the idea that we can't just accept what people say to us; we have to use our minds and do what we feel like doing, as long as it doesn't negatively affect other people's lives-- and that's an ideology I've always agreed with. His wife, on the other hand, is an uneducated girl who spent her youth years working with him in the pornography industry, never seeming to care whether it was right or wrong, good or bad. Also, she is the one who helps Larry Flynt's fell apart, abusing of prescribed drugs. One sad thing I have to admit is that I actually LAUGHED at her behavior; I mean, she looked so junkie and crazy, mainly in the court scenes, that it felt absurd to see her that way. The juridical aspect of the movie isn't very elaborated or analyzed, given that the dramatical aspects of Flint's life are more in evidence than anything else. So, if you're looking for strong courtroom dramas, there are several better ones out there, like "Red Corner" and "Primal Fear". In case you'd rather see a drama involving someone's life, including its problems with the judiciary, this film is a good choice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The People vs. Larry Flynt" tells the story of self-proclaimed "smut peddler" Larry Flynt, an entrepreneur who was quick to capitalize on the predilection for sex and sexy things in American culture. He knew it was a natural part of life, yet naturally came under fire from conservative and religious leaders who were convinced that his product poisoned minds.Played as a thoroughly unpredictable, off the wall character by Woody Harrelson, who delivers a truly tour de force performance, Larry finds it a constant battle to keep his magazine, "Hustler", on the stands, and is always obliged to defend his choice of material. It falls to his long-suffering lawyer, Alan Isaacman (an excellent Edward Norton) to go to bat for the publisher, which proves to be a challenge given Larry's antics in court.All of the acting, really, is first-rate in this compelling biographical drama. It's deliberately paced but masterfully crafted by filmmaker Milos Forman ("One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest", "Amadeus", et al). Harrelson and Norton form a solid star trio with rock celebrity Courtney Love, who shows off some real chops as Althea, Larry's free spirited wife. Many familiar faces in the large ensemble include James Cromwell, Crispin Glover, James Carville, Donna Hanover, Vincent Schiavelli, Miles Chapin, Oliver Reed, and Norm MacDonald. Larry's brother is played by Harrelson's own sibling Brett; the real Flynt has a cameo as a Cincinnati court judge.The film doesn't go into a lot of detail on Flynt's life, showing a brief childhood vignette, then cutting to his life in adult entertainment. Still, it covers a fair bit of ground, including his unconventional marriage to Althea, the incident wherein he was wounded and crippled by an assassin's bullet, and the lawsuit filed against him by religious leader Jerry Falwell (Richard Paul). Particularly engrossing is Nortons' true showcase scene at the climax when Alan is arguing Larry's case in front of the Supreme Court.Regardless of how one feels about Larry's line of work - even Alan admits he doesn't necessarily like what the man does - this is as good a drama about First Amendment rights as one will ever see, and an interesting examination of matters of taste vs. matters of law.Eight out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great film about our most precious right...freedom of speech</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The People Vs. Larry Flynt" is a film that might make you angry, or it may make you glad that we, as Americans, have the most cherished right any person could ask for: The freedom to voice an opinion or an idea, regardless of how unpopular or unappealing it may be. So it is with the true story of Larry Flynt, notorious publisher of the porn magazine "Hustler". It is essential to know that at no time does "People vs. Larry Flynt" try to depict it's title character as a saint, or a hero, or even someone you'd take to a family picnic. Flynt, by his own admission, acknowledges that he, and his magazine and it's content is the most provocative and blatant of it's kind in the field of pornographic material. But even more importantly is Flynt's assertion that if the First Amendment can protect someone like him, then it can protect each and every one of us who call ourselves Americans and our citizens' rights, for which countless men have fought and died to preserve. (Just for the record, I myself don't particularly care for pornographic material, but that's MY choice. I do not want nor will I abide any federal, state or local government invading MY life, telling me what I CAN or CANNOT partake of. If you want to talk about obscenity, I put it to you, dear reader, that the most obscene act a government can perform is to control the thoughts and words and ideas of it's own people. To do so is to hearken back to the days of Hitler, and other "thought police" who attempted to regulate free speech and independent thought. OK, rant over.) As to the film itself, the easiest way to describe it is that this is a top notch biographical story, filled with five star performances all around. Woody Harrelson, playing Flynt, does perhaps some of his greatest film work. Ed Norton, who plays Flynt's attorney, turns in yet another stellar job, and Courtney Love, who plays Flynt's wife, dazzles us by displaying, ironically enough, most of the same qualities that actually made her infamous in her own personal life. In the context of this film, however, those negatives of Love are exactly what was needed to recreate this character. The story, in a nutshell, southern Ohio club owner Larry Flynt gets the bright idea to base a magazine off of the type of entertainment he provides at his clubs. The magazine becomes a sensation, but also a perpetual target of moralistic crusaders who believe that material such as that produced by Flynt has no place anywhere in society; at least, in their eyes at any rate. And there is the conflict which drives this movie. Obscenity vs. Free Speech. Director Milos Forman gives us both sides of this argument throughout the film, but drives home the point that "American freedom" includes allowing others to voice opinions or present concepts that, while offensive and repulsive to some, are still just as worthy of protection as any other American's right to say what he or she feels. We follow Larry and his contemporaries through the rags to riches journey, and the ensuing attacks upon it by those who sternly disagree based on their own personal tastes. And "personal taste" is subjective, and therefore cannot be regulated to only one viewpoint. Late in the film, Flynt's case is brought before no less then the Supreme Court, stemming from an earlier court battle with evangelist Jerry Falwell. The ensuing decision from the High Court, which I'll leave for you to see for yourself, defines the very nature of the prospect of freedom of speech, and more importantly, the most rudimentary of basic civil rights as we know them in the United States. Whether you like or hate Larry Flynt, Hustler Magazine, or pornography of any kind is irrelevant. What one must accept if they wish to abide by our constitution, is the inalienable right of every man and woman to be free individuals in terms of their opinions, expressions and thoughts. To do otherwise is a slap in the face to every person who has ever fought for the American way."The People Vs. Larry Flynt" is a magnificent tale of not just one man's fight for the freedom of speech, but the entire thought process of how strongly we wish to continue to be a free country.Watch it, and be glad you're an American with rights.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This tragic story provides many fantastic performances.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Woody Harrelson delivers his best performance in director Milos Foreman's tragic true story, The people vs. Larry Flint. All of the actors give their best in this occasionally funny and sad true story.Woody Harrelson gives his best as Larry Flint, who starts the film off with owning a strip club with his brother. Then, Larry comes up with the idea for "Hustler" magazine,which i'm sure everyone has heard of.The film starts off sort of fun. But it takes a tragic turn when he is arrested. And after his arrest, his marriage to his stripper wife(Courtney Love, giving the most realistic and greatest performance of all) falls apart,and they try to find as many ways to arrest him as possible.I can't forget the performance by Edward Norton. Norton gives a lovable performance in everything he's in. Even if he's playing a bad guy he's lovable. And his performance here is both lovable and real.What a sad film. Really, it is. America destroyed Larry Flint. And it's tragic to watch cause the majority of the characters are so likable. And it's very sad to see all of their lives slowly fall apart throughout the years.The people vs. Larry Flint is a fantastic.It's funny,sad,powerful, and well acted. Courtney Love gives us the best performance in the film. Yes,better than Edward Norton. This is a forgotten classic that must be seen.The people vs. Larry Flint:4/4</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie some years ago and I can say it's one of those Hollywood's efforts to keep the faith in the movie industry. I mean, it doesn't stands for clichés, conventionalisms, no, it deals with a plot that would have been banned in another times.Larry Flint is a hero in my opinion. He stood for his work, his vision, his unique vision towards sexuality and how it can be enjoyed through his work.The dialogs are great. The Direction is solid, elegant although the events of the movie are crude. The acting is also very good, very real.This is one of the 90's best efforts. Watch it with an open mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good film about the people's want to censor, Flynt's want to modernise and everything else that could possibly enter someone's life in this situation.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I suppose someone like Larry Flynt is always going to attract attention of some description, what else is going to happen to a guy that founded a risqué yet somewhat groundbreaking magazine that focuses on the subject matter of sex and general pornography. I think The People vs. Larry Flynt is a good film, but I cannot help but feel it sort of sugar-coated Flynt's life; making it look colourful and dare I say, a bit of a laugh. The atmosphere throughout the film is relatively light and only threatens to creep into a dark and disturbing aesthetic when certain pushes come to shove later on, but that's part of the problem: it only threatens. But while it's all well and good saying what you would've liked to have happened in a film, for what it is The People vs. Larry Flynt is a very intriguing and when it's not being funny, it's quite tragic.The film is a tale of The American Dream at its bare bones, but not the sort of American Dream that involves what we've come to expect those sorts of quests to revolve around. Here, Flynt (played brilliantly by Woody Harrelson) is more concerned with moving into the print industry, with reference to both the media and journalism industries also. We get the perfect introduction to Larry Flynt as a very young boy living amongst his backwater roots, trying to earn money through selling drinks to whomever ? it is a statement on how far he will go through determination and hard work. But the film is a celebration, apart from being a celebration of someone's life, is more so one of the breaking of taboos in the country known as The United States of America. The nation of America is celebrated, none more-so than Flynt himself with a couple of scenes dedicated to characters waving miniature flags and Flynt himself taking part in a July 4th march complete with outfit and larger American flag. This gets across a sense of patriotism that is perhaps within Flynt, something that other Americans in the film fail to recognise in their assault on his material and ideas.What this suggests is that Flynt is a patriot and that he loves America; so much so that he wants America to keep up with any other nation in advancing issues of censorship or the breaking of taboos. The way he does this is by way of creating a magazine; a mere tool by which he can get across his patriotism and spread modernity in print. But the film's greatest triumph in my opinion is its women. After thirty minutes or so, I began to think the women of the film would cause a problem in the sense they were dumbed down and being shot objectively perhaps for our mere pleasure. But rather than act as mere objects or as assets for the protagonist to keep his business alive, I feel they exist for the sake of oppositional reading. What I mean by saying this is that any film revolving around the topic of sex or pornography has to conform to certain stereotypes or archetypes within its own universe. To complain the women are 'too loose' in the film would be like complaining femme fatales in film noirs are 'too seductive' or Stallone's Regan-era fuelled propaganda Rambo character is 'too invincible'.One other reason I feel the women are portrayed in the negative and objective light they are has something to do with Flynt's own life later on. When it is made apparent that his wife Althea Leasure (Love) has AIDS, it is a sad and stark reminder of what may become of you if you live by the sword too much. The very thing Larry promoted through his magazines and ideas years previously have caught him up. It's almost like a warning that if you do act or get involved with this mentality or lifestyle, be wary of how things could turn out. This is further emphasised later on when we witness the sad sequences of Larry practically destroying himself. From the early portrayal of Larry and his wife as either smart, with ideas or as an attractive and proud person; they have become bed ridden, odd to look in their appearance and eccentric in their actions, despite the big ideas and theories.So if The People vs. Larry Flynt sounds like a large group vs. one man, then it could be deemed about right but it's the savageness at how they will not quit that sticks. Even when times move on, Larry is battling himself and drug addiction ? the man cannot rest without a war with someone or something. If we look at society in England or any other country and how the threat of Americanisation perhaps has overcome it, then this film is a look at how America itself became 'Americanised' through one man and his beliefs that the print industry should not be ashamed in publishing, entertaining and telling people how it is through the opinion of one man. The film may seem to be all about the people's want to enforce censorship but it's really a stark and interesting tale about Larry Flynt, a man whose life and actions certainly had an impact.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another masterpiece from Milos Forman!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film shares the same golden trait as every other Milos Forman film i've seen (and i've seen them all). That golden trait is: There isn't a boring moment in the entire film. From beginning to end great acting, great directing, and a great story keeps the audience interested and entertained. The People Vs. Larry Flynt is the only film of it's style that i've given an 8 to. It's very hard to make a masterpiece with this subject matter. Showing excessive nudity and many scenes in strip clubs is often the trademark of a cheap American film, but not when in the hands of the master Milos Forman. He can make any movie. It's really astonishing the variety that he can do. Anyways, my advice, see this film! It is a masterpiece in every way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is about a porn magazine guru fighting for his freedom of speech and freedom of press against the state and religious leaders.It is for sure that this film is not easy to make. It is difficult to have a balanced portrayal on this topic. Pornography is tainted with moral issues, and hence this film is likely to be judged on the grounds of morality than its cinematic achievements.I find this film strong and persuasive. The pace is very fast, which is a change from the usual courtroom drama. The choice of Edward Norton as the barrister is interesting. He was a newcomer at that time, and he looked too young and fresh for a barrister. However, his speeches and his performances in the film are impressive. There are many memorable scenes in the film, the most striking one is Larry Flynt discovering his wife's body. The emotions are piercing to say the least. I enjoyed this film a lot. It is a drama packed, intense film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb and underrated movie with superb acting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The People vs. Larry Flynt tells the story of Larry Flynt and his slow but hard fight for free speech. Although some people say that the movie is a little too idealized, director Milos Forman did a great job and delivered a superb masterpiece. In this movie, Woody Harrelson gave his best performance of his entire career. Whether or not he should have won his Oscar nomination for Best Actor in a Leading Role, his role will always be remembered as one of his best.Besides the earned Oscar nomination of Woody Harrelson, this movie was also nominated for Best Director. Personally, I think there should have been an Oscar nominations more than the 2 the movie was nominated for. I was stunned by Courtney Love's performance and I wondered why the Academy didn't give her a nomination for Best Actress in a Supporting Role. The way she acts in this movie is just simply amazing and not so easy as it might look like. An Oscar nomination would have been great, but apparently Juliette Binoche, Joan Allen, Lauren Bacall, Barbara Hershey and Marianne Jean-Baptiste did a better job than Courtney Love in the eyes of the Academy.And then there's Edward Norton. In his first movie (Primal Fear) he played an accused man, in his second movie (this one) he played a lawyer. In Primal Fear he made quite an impression with his stunning performance and even managed to get an Oscar nomination for Best Actor in a Supporting Role in his first movie ever. A nomination he definitely earned. And in this case I think it's too bad that an actor can't be nominated for 2 different movies at a time, because to me he deserved to be nominated for The People vs. Larry Flynt too. His role of Alan Isaacman was very convincing, but his role in Primal Fear was indeed more convincing. Edward has got a very impressive career and with the successful movies he already did, he's got a nice future ahead of him.The People vs. Larry Flynt is a movie that has to be seen by everyone. It's almost perfect. Not only does it tell a true story about free speech, it's also a tribute to the real Larry Flynt, who saw this movie and felt honored to be the inspiration of a great cast and crew.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK a lot of what Larry Flint stand for is bad taste - but this is an undeniably good film. I've read a lot of the bad reviews of this film on this site and a lot of them have a political slant - they simply didn't like the idea of porn or Mr Flint himself. Fair enough, but that should not influence a review.Anyway, I really enjoyed this film, as did my girlfriend, because it is not only interesting but is also a dialectic on exactly what freedom of expression really means. It also hangs a question mark over what America (and most of the world) considers obscene - Images of love (sex) v. images of war (death). It also argues strongly that in order to have freedom of expression, that means we all have to put up with things that we consider bad taste.Courtney Love puts in an excellent performance (as a drug-addled slapper - actually one could argue she has been method acting for this role for 20 years) as does the consistently brilliant Ed Norton. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good film about a very bad man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In discussing this film, you have to separate the Larry Flynt of the film with the Larry Flynt of real life.First, the movie version. "The People vs. Larry Flynt" is actually a very well made film. Harrelson does a very credible job portraying the wild, unconventional figure, and the other actors - Courtney Love, Edward Norton- are also excellent. The story is interesting and really holds ones attention the whole time. By the end, I felt like the Flynt portrayed in the film was certainly an oddball, but someone that the film genuinely made me care about.For that reason, I'm giving the film 7 stars out of 10 - for artistic reasons.Unfortunately, the image of Flynt as a man who happened to like kinky pictures of women and unconventional sexuality doesn't correspond to reality. Yes, "Hustler" magazine showed *some* pictures which were not really objectionable, just a little kinky. But it also had a history of showing truly abhorrent stuff, like simulated rape scenes (some of which were copied in real life) and wildy racist imagery. Larry Flynt, in other words, was hardly just a guy who put out a racier version of "Playboy" or even "Penthouse" who was being put down by prudes like Jerry Falwell.Now, I happen to be a big believer in the First Amendment, so I think that even material as evil as the stuff Flynt put out should be legal. But that doesn't change the fact that Larry Flynt and his magazine are utterly revolting.If you don't believe me, go look on the internet for the incident around Hustler and the Portuguese-American woman from New Bedford, Mass. If that doesn't make your stomach turn, you probably need to see a psychiatrist. And there's a lot more where that came from.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flynt Was Right All The Way, And I Thank Him</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The point that the right to freedom is vital to the existence of the American nation is at the heart of this film. This is a freedom that comes in many degrees. It's the freedom to agree or disagree, to like something or dislike the same thing. Myself, I've been fighting for the First Amendment for what seems like forever, although on a lesser scale than Larry Flynt, but the message remains the same. I enjoyed this film tremendously in part because it struck a chord so familiar to me, but mostly because it showed some indisputable logic behind freedom of speech--who was it that said "I may dislike what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it"?Unfortunately, I don't think this film will get enough exposure in the parts of the population which most need an eye-opener. This is another tragic case of "preaching to the choir"--those of us who are liberal and do support First Amendment rights actively already know the lesson the film teaches. Honestly I'd like to see more conservative sectors made to watch this film, and then have its principles--freedom of expression--applied to what THEY consider important. Freedom isn't for one side or the other, but for both.The performances in the film are excellent, particularly Courtney Love in what could not have been an easy role. When Althea, Larry's wife, finally dies of AIDS, and then a bit later we see Flynt watching Jerry Falwell rant about AIDS being a scourge against the "unholy", I had to cry. These underlying messages--like how can a "man of God" speak with such hatred against the sick and dying--are throughout the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know, I didn't even know Larry Flynt, before I watched this film for the first time (probably because I live in Europe), about three years ago, but after it I must say, I remembered him. Later, of course I saw the actual Larry Flynt on TV. That was after the Clinton scandal, when he offered 1 million dollars to everyone, who could uncover, that someone of the ?party' that had hunted Clinton for his adultery, had committed adultery as well. In the weeks after that numerous hypocrite politicians resigned. Well done Larry Flynt, you have not only shown, how much hypocrites and liars are in politics, but you have shown your teeth again and you have shown that you can bite too.Now on to the film, this is really a good film, about a kind of sad, yet very meaningful life. It is a man who fought for his ideas and ideals. He was a man who risked everything for his and other people's freedom of expression. OK he was a bit of an exotic bird you may say, but do to him what was done to him, no way. He didn't do nothing wrong. It is sad, what the juridical system did to him, only for spreading a badly tasted pornographic magazine.Apart from that the actors are really great and that means everyone, but there are two whom I must name. First of all Woody Harrelson (Larry Flynt), who delivers a really great Flynt in all of life's perspectives. He is funny, mad, loveable, an a..hole and not to mention an irritating little controversial pimp. He is great and he would have deserved at least the Golden Globe. I love all of his ways, all of his phrases, all of his actions, he said whatever he thought, to whoever it concerned (even judges) and that takes balls. You know this is a controversial film, but this film has taught me something: It is a great good that I have the freedom to choose whether to see this film or not. That is what Flyn fought for. He indirectly fought for me to see this movie.Courtney Love (Althea Flynt) however was much better (I loved the hair, especially the one, where the pony was white and the rest black, with, pink and blue extensions). She deserved an Oscar for the role of Flynt's drug addicted wife (something she played very well, maybe she was addicted once herself, but nonetheless, great work). Well, I guess the film was just too controversial, with all the fuss about the film's poster (we see a lady's slip, which is the American flag and Woody Harrelson lies on the woman's crotch in a Jesus-on-the-cross like manner) and all of the contents of the film.8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Historical facts are played with in a very loose manner for this biopic about Hustler magazine publisher Larry Flynt and his struggles with censorship, but neither that nor the film's cloying over emphasis on turning Flynt into a cuddly hero can prevent it from being a highly intelligent and entertaining film. Woody Harrelson gives his finest performance to date as the famed publishing magnate, a self-made man who believed strongly in his work and its right to liberal expression; but it is Courtney Love as his wife Althea who stops the show. Edward Norton is also a breath of fresh air as Flynt's long-devoted lawyer Alan Isaacman (in reality he's an amalgamation of three or four of Flynt's lawyers). Director Milos Forman's use of Flynt's trials as a representation for all artists who have their work challenged may not go over well with the film's entire audience, but it's a worthwhile rental all the same. &gt;</fullReview>

The film portrays him as a defender of the civil liberties fighting for his, and other Americans', right to free speech. However, the supporting caste (if played accurately) pull down this icon.His wife, an alcoholic drug-taking nymphomaniac, and others suggest the the real Flynt was a lucky man that stumbled into a vast money making machine. Using the law to his own advantage, he succeeded in maintaining the cash flow in his favour. It's too bad we don't see the real Larry Flynt. Performances by the leading cast are superb.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ugly but worth the viewing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Strange bedfellows, those two, Jerry Falwell and Larry Flynt. I never liked either one of them, which is why it has taken me so long to get around to watching this movie. Make no mistake about it, the central point here is that Falwell and Flynt are two sides of the same coin: pick your pig.Milos Forman's direction starts slow and is almost without distinction nearly three-quarters through, yet the entire movie is saved by that last quarter after Flynt is shot. I think there is something to be said for boring your audience a little in the beginning, showing them only the tired and ordinary just so they will better appreciate it when the going gets good. And it does. I think this strategy worked on me: after rot gut even vin ordinaire can seem like the ambrosia of the gods.Turning Larry Flynt into an American hero, as this movie does, may seem a bit of a stretch, yet consider the obverse: Jerry Falwell as our hero. Now THAT is a bit scary.Courtney Love proves herself to be a wonderful exhibitionist (but we knew that) as well as a natural and talented actress (we didn't know that) who knows how to have a good time in from of the camera; and I think that is half the task for an actor: love the red light; love the audience looking at you. Woody Harrelson, in keeping with Foreman's direction seems to be walking through the part in the beginning, looking almost like a clone of himself from Natural Born Killers (1994) with a fey hair style; but he picks up steam, and as the paralyzed Flynt really comes to life and gives a fine performance. Ed Norton is also excellent and so believable and winning as Flynt's lawyer, especially in the scene before the Supreme Court. Think about it: in this movie the lawyer is the good guy!Politically speaking this is a no brainer, a shoot the fish in the barrel exercise: First Amendment wins out over public figures wanting to manage their images. Thank you. And what IS more obscene, sex or war? Strange that that should be a question, but it is and has been for at least a couple of millennia. When I was young I used to wonder why. Wasn't it obvious that sex was good and war was bad? However, it is not so simple. It turns out that sex (which leads to the creation of new karmas) is really just the obverse side of the coin of war. You make 'em, in some circumstances, you have to kill 'em. That's why the other guy's sexuality is offensive, and why we have prudes. Sex really is war by other means. I always think of the example of Easter Island where initially they practiced a fertility religion until the island's protein resources ran out, and then came the repression of reproduction and sex. Christianity is a religion one step removed from the old fertility religions in this sense. It is paranoid (in its more conservative forms) about sexuality because it has evolved to fear unbridled reproduction. Of course its practitioners, like Jerry Falwell, have no understanding of this: they are just social and political animals acting out their social and political roles.In short, like most things in life, this film is a flawed but interesting venture. Incidentally, the so- called "unusual" marriage between Flynt and Althea Leasure is one of the things that makes this movie good: their marriage is a lot more like real life than ninety percent of what we see in the movies.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"

		<fullReview>Milos Forman does a great job in this one, his portrayal of the characters and the events is simply wonderful. There are some scenes that go to the top of moviemaking. MF is helped by the great performances of the three leads (Woody Harrelson takes the film on his shoulders and Courtney Love was much a surprise for me). Unfortunately the movie is not based on plain facts but to an embellished version of reality and it has some problems of objectivity. I'm the first one to laugh at all those religious freaks, but hey it's not THAT weird to sue someone who writes to a magazine you're committing incest with your own mother!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's a lot to like about this film, namely Milos Forman and Woody Harrelson. But there's one major flaw: Courtney Love. I haven't figured out why she's been given such great reviews for her performance. She plays a drug-addicted slut locked into a destructive, co-dependent relationship, sucking whatever fame and glory she can from her successful husband. That wasn't much of a stretch for her acting-wise, now was it?I was looking forward to Forman's "Man in the Moon" until I heard Courtney was going to be in it. Check out Nick Broomfield's fabulous documentary "Kurt &amp; Courtney" if you want to see super bitch in all her glory.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Forman's best, but still a film by Forman.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movies like Amadeus or One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest wouldn't be compared to this film. But the fact is that this film would be one of the best of 1996. Larry Flynt, who is he? He's actually the maker of Hustler magazine. I don't know if I like him. I think I actually hate him. But the freedom of speech should be applied to Hustler too. If Play Boy had some sexy nudity, Penthouse had something plus alpha. And when Penthouse had plus alpha, Hustler had some gross, and yet disgusting pictures on that magazine. Some may be offended, but it's a free country. Everyone says that, and everyone wants that. But why only to Flynt? Nice humor, jokes, and acting. As I said before, it wouldn't be Forman's best, but it still would remain as an excellent movie. I give it 3.5 out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The People Vs Larry Flynt follows the real life trials and tribulations of pornography publisher Larry Flynt. Milos Foreman doesn't screw movies up and he tells a very entertaining story supported by a good screenplay and acting by Harrelson, Norton and Love. The relationships between Flynt (Harrelson) and Isaacman, his lawyer (Norton), and between Flynt and his wife Althea (Love) are very well written and acted. The Flynts' ups and downs from making millions in pornography, the temporary born-again conversion to Christianity, the constant court trials, and the murder attempt are all played out. That is my only criticism, and its not insignificant...that is in attempting to cram all of Flynt's life into a single film, the "why" to many of his activities is never explored.</fullReview>

We all have the choice not to buy his magazines-- but he still have the right to sell them. This film realistically portrayed the industry as it must exist, but it also made important points about law and liberty. Courtney Love stole the show with her fine performance. Edward Norton shows sparks of the heights he will later reach. And Woody Harrelson is just right for beingLarry Flynt- someone who is reviled- but had the gumption to stand against adversity for the first amendment.

		<fullReview>The People vs. Larry Flynt is one of the most entertaining, original and, above all, interesting movies of our time. Superbly directed, bravely acted and well-told, it is the story of the infamous pornography Larry Flynt and his meteoric rise to commercial success and his parallel plummet into legal trouble, physical ailment and personal crises.To say that Woody Harrelson's role as Larry Flynt is his most stirring and memorable ever doesn't do his performance justice here: it is acting at its best.Of course, The People is largely a political movie and that accounts for a lot of the fun. But it would be dull without the gritty humor and array of characters that grace the movie, including those of Crispin Glover, Edward Norton and Courtney Love, who seems more suited than most to play Flynt's wife.It is too bad so many have a knee-jerk reaction to how Flynt earns a living that they are unable to appreciate that his is a story that could take place only in America.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film is a must, since it's Forman. But the factual side can't be trusted.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since Milos Forman is one of the greatest film directors of our time, this film can not and should not be missed. It's truly a masterpiece, and it's especially enjoyable, once you are ready to regard it as a work of pure fiction, ignoring any resemblance between its characters and real persons, dead or living. But please beware of regarding this film as a reliable source of information about Larry Flynt, his legal woes, battles, victories and adversaries. Many facts, pertaining to specific lawsuits, verdicts, plaintiffs and defendants, had been intentionally distorted in the quasi-documentary movie script, to make Flynt look as a first amendment champion even in those cases when he was tried (indicted and sentenced) for his part in an organized crime syndicate. If you need bare facts about Flynt - all verdicts are online, check for yourself. Also don't forget to make a check on Keating, who was in fact acquitted of fraud charges, while the movie states (in the epilogue) that he was found guilty as charged.These discrepancies are worth mentioning, because Forman himself kept repeating in some interviews, that the movie is supposed to advocate free speech. Which is a noble cause indeed, but it doesn't justify such blatant distortion of events. The rationale behind free speech protection is our right to know and tell the truth. This right can hardly be protected by means of distorting the truth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great movie about America. It takes on the First Amendment, and shows us how uncomfortable that right can become but how necessary it is to keep the American Dream alive and well. Grandiose sub theme, but the story itself is a doozie all on its own. Poor boy becomes rich off pornography, and almost dies protecting his right to be outspoken and offensive. In the meantime, he loses the only person he loves. Woody Harrelson and Courtney Love play the oddest couple of the year, but they both amaze you with performances that are so real and caring. These two -- Larry and Althea -- could have been one dimensional smut-peddlers and drug-users, but in the hands of Woody and Miss Love we come to care about them despite their shocking habits. Courtney Love did deserve a nod from Oscar, and she becomes the heart of this movie and Woody and Ed Norton the body and mind.Excellent movie, well worth your time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw The People vs. Larry Flynt, I thought I would be seeing a lot of skin and not much else. Well, if that's what you want to see, just go *buy* Hustler and quit futzing around. On the other hand, if you want to see a simple truth portrayal of one of the more controversial figures in the last thirty years, check out this movie.Woody Harrelson does a strong, credible job as Larry Flynt, and particularly notable are Coutney Love as Althea (Flynt's wife), and Edward Norton as Flynt's lawyer. I didn't think Courtney Love would be any good at acting, but she was definitely well-billed in this appearance.Most of the movie is about Larry Flynt's life, about his struggles for freedom and against censorship, about his love life, about his reintroduction to Christianity, about his time in Jail and his troubles with drugs.Top it off with some amazing courtroom scenes (the Supreme Court scene near the end is my favorite in a very long time) and you've got a winner of a movie. I don't think the movie tries to make you like Larry Flynt. If you don't like him before you see it you probably won't like him after you see it. But it will make you think twice about opposing the things he stands for.By the way, Larry Flynt doesn't look anything like Woody Harrelson, but he does talk a little like him. A piece of trivia - Larry Flynt has a cameo in this movie, as the Cincinnati Judge, Judge Morrissey.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although the original controversy over this film was about the First Amendment and the "real" Larry Flynt, to me, the more interesting aspect of the film was the love story between Larry and Althea Flynt. Forman's genius has always been finding human elements in tales of rebels who changed the world -- "Amadeus," for example, is more interesting as a saga of the jealousy of Salieri than as musical biography. "The People Vs. Larry Flynt" is gaudy where "Amadeus" was gorgeous (compare the long shot through Flynt's mansion with the shots of Viennese palaces in the other film), and Larry and Althea's love story is at once timeless and a product of the self-indulgent, tragic 70s and 80s, and Harrelson and Love turn in two of the best performances of the decade.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little too long but fascinating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movie about Larry Flynt--publisher of "Hustler" magazine. He's played by Woody Harrelson and it follows him from 1972 to the 1980s and deals with him defending his magazine against obscenity charges. It also details his wife Althea (Courtney Love) and their relationship.I've heard this movie was an idealized version of the true story but I knew nothing about Flynt before I saw this movie so I saw it with no preconceptions. It's episodic but compelling. Harrelson is GREAT in the title role. He does not turn Flynt into a saint--he's portrayed as obnoxious, controlling and a real jerk at times. However he does make it clear that "Hustler" should not be banned or considered obscene and he makes his case well. Most of it is through his lawyer Alan Isaacman (Edward Norton) who's very good in his role. But top acting honors go to Love who is just incredible as Althea. You see her character very convincingly age during the movie and you see her love and frustration with Flynt. Just a great performance which was totally ignored at the Academy Awards. Also it was great to see great character actors like Crispin Glover, Vincent Schiavelli and James Cromwell in small roles. It was well-directed by Milos Forman and shows the decades it takes place in very well. (There's fantastic use of the 1970s song "Dream Weaver") It's just a little bit overlong. The multiple court sequences get repetitious by hammering the same concepts to us again and again. Also it gets VERY depressing during it's last hour or so. Still, I found it fascinating and compelling. You may not like Flynt or his magazine but it makes a good case for admiring him for what he was fighting for. I give it an 8.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That's how Larry Flynt described the Supreme Court back in the 80s. To their faces! Yes, Flynt was and is a remarkably vulgar and insensitive fella. His contributions to publishing are not the worst things out there (after all, he does put out magazines for "straight" interests as well), but he delighted in not just pushing the envelope, he had to tear it up and throw the paper bits at his opponents faces. To the point where his freedom wasn't merely up for grabs, his whole life came within a hair of ending.Almost everybody has an opinion about this country boy who started as a preteen bootlegger from the poorest county in the USA, later joined the Army, then the Navy, got in the bar business, was married many times, got into publishing as a marketing tool for his "Hustler" clubs and turned both middle fingers in the direction of the right wing who wanted him locked up for life. He has done more in one sordid lifetime than a dozen average Joes. Unfortunately for Larry, he never sees how much pain is going to be inflicted on himself and his loved ones until it's too late to stop the madness.Woody Harrelson is at his best in the title role, with real brother Brett as Larry's younger sibling, Jimmy Flynt (there was also a Flynt sister who died young). His subject is such a part of American,"if you don't like it, don't read it!" simplicity and his naive belief in free expression leads him to his ultimate legal battle and then some kind of victory towards the end. That case which rose (or sank, depending on your position) to the Supreme Court involved the late Jerry Falwell and the mock Campari ad that "Hustler" openly borrowed the premise of from Al Goldstein's "Screw" magazine. Al was the focus of ridicule in his own publication, but Larry fired both barrels from a porn shotgun at a prominent voice among his many non fans, one of the leaders of the new religiously fired up conservatism.That cases' verdict (unanimously in Flynt's favour) was fundamentally about the satire of public figures. And Falwell's putting on the airs made him not well liked by many people, especially Larry, who saw the Reverend as a man living high on the wealth many of his largely poor audience provided for him. The subject of satire doesn't get as much time as it should in debate, not without many loudmouthed talking heads thinking their celebrity is sacrosanct. Well guess what? Being in the public eye isn't a cloak of protection, it's opening oneself up for constant criticism and often, vicious comedic attacks.Milos Forman was roundly booed by many for making this, after winning Oscars for "One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest" and "Amadeus". Gloria Steinem in particular was quite vocal about the depiction of a man she saw as pond scum receiving sympathetic treatment. She got a bit overexcited in her diatribe, mistakenly saying Milos had never even seen "Hustler", when what he actually said was he'd never bought a copy.Larry was and is a hot potato, now taking on the last vestiges of "community standards" interfering with "Hustler" stores being able to conduct business without 21st century legal problems. And who knows where that will take him?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well acted, but horribly white washed tale of Larry Flint (Woody 'Boyd' Harrelson) finding his fourth wife, Athena (Courtney Love), starting his Hustle enterprise, being shot (sometimes bad things happen to bad people), and his subsequent Supreme Court case brought about in part by Jerry Falwell (another evil man). By painting Larry in such broad flattering strokes as to make him practically into a saint of the First Amendment right and a fabled crusader of free speech and the American way. In doing this in such a horribly one-sided way, Milos Forman doesn't do the film any favors. I hesitate to even call it a Biopic for it's so lopsided. That said, and if one just watches it for entertainment value ALONE, than the film succeeds greatly. Just remember that ANYthing even remotely connected to Oliver Stone is going to be completely factual and great liberties will be taken.My Grade: C+ Special Edition DVD Extras: Commentary by screenwriters Scott Alexander &amp; Larry Karaszewski; Second commentary by actors Woody Harrelson, Courtney Love &amp; Edward Norton 2 featurettes (:Free Speech or Porn?, &amp; Larry Flynt Exposed); 2 deleted scenes with optional commentary; New York Times review; Filmographies; Theatrical trailer; and trailers for "Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle" and "Auto Focus" 6 Easter Eggs: In the Audio set up menu highlight a hidden campaign button on James Carville's suit for a vintage campaign ad from Flint; In the subtitles menu there's a second vintage campaign ad; a third one in Courtney Love's filmography page; yet another in the main menu, STILL yet another in the special features menu; and In Woody Harrelson's Filmography page there's one egg that doesn't have to do with Flynt's campaign thankfully</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This certainly was an interesting film about the real life magazine "hustler" and it's notorious creator Larry Flynt. I have got to admit first that I liked it. It was an unusual idea to get to grips with, and I am still not sure whether it has a genre. It could be a comedy/satire, one particularly funny moment being when Larry throws am orange at a judge, during one of the many trials he participated in. Maybe it is drama, and there is a deep cry being exerted, as Larry's right to free speech is fought for. Maybe a mix, maybe in a whole different category. It is not constantly funny, and probably is not meant to be funny. It is not strictly a drama, although Courtney Love dying is a particularly dramatic part, yet it seems that such a film as this is not being dramatic, but making a statement about this extraordinary mans life, surely it is a biopic. Yet I just think it is amazing that Milos Forman and Oliver Stone could have come up with something like this. The acting is top notch, and Woody Harrellson should be proud, it also gave us the likes of budding star Edward Norton. I know that to praise something in such a flimsy way isn't too good, but I think that when rating this film it is hard to do so because to be honest with you I feel as though I am condone the XXX material that Larry Flynt was so notorious for publishing. And so I will close with two points and that is. 1)This film is very good and imaginative and 2)Hail. Free Speech.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Funny that as I study for my Media Law and Policy final, this movie comes on HBO. Now to go from the ironic to the sublime.To a big first amendment supporter such as myself, this film acts as both an affirmation of my support and as an amusing take on how laws and the Supreme Court works. Others may find this not nearly so amusing, especially if they feel that their group is attacked, but then I find these people to be over sensitive.Woody Harrelson's reputation seems to seep into this character, as if they were made for each other. Larry Flynt's cameo was funny. While both might have gone slightly overboard, there was Edward Norton to calm us down. And Courtney Love was a breath of comedy-in-tragedy whenever the story got too serious. Some people may put this film down for its lack of reproach towards Flynt's lifestyle, but what are films if not canvases for artistic license?The movie is unapologetically pro-Flynt, but I don't believe that Jerry Falwell is put in a light that he doesn't put himself in already. I must give this film a 7 out of ten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well very rarely do you find movies where every single cast member performed well ? and this is no exception. A great movie and a great story and never failed to deviate from it's plot ? being a biographical movie. Woody Harrelson's performance was OK- however in multiple scenes it seemed as if he deliberately had food in his mouth, so that he could sound more like the Larry Flynt ? that was quite distinguishable. The person who I was most impressed with was Courtney Love who gave a striking performance as Althea Leisure ? Flynt's stripper bride ? that performance was Oscar worthy. Edward Norton also gave a good performance as Flyn'ts lawyer. This is a movie which I would recommend for anyone who wants to watch a really great drama ? but if your target is chick flicks- don't bother.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Pervert Is Back! *SPOILERS*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*SPOILERS*With this entrance into his own building to retake it from his own people Larry says "The pervert is back! The pervert is back!" "What's your name?" "Sophia." "Tell everyone the pervert is back!" This line was the funniest thing I have ever heard and Woody Harrelson was the obvious candidate to play Larry as Woody is eccentric himself to say the least. Bravo! This is the story of Hustler Magazine founder Larry Flynt, who started from humble beginning to achieving fame and fortune as one of the world's largest porn empires. Larry is a slimeball, everyone knows he is a slimeball, and he admits he's a slimeball. But ironically he is the one who is pushing for free speech, fighting his way all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. His legendary court battles with Jerry Fartwell I'm sorry Jerry Falwel made media headlines and started a legal war with repercussions for the entire nation. "All I am guilty of is bad taste!" he says after being arrested for the first but not the last time and is one of the best lines in movie history. This would have been the funniest movie I have ever seen if it wasn't so full of tragedy i.e. his being shot and paralyzed for life then being sent to prison several times, legal problems galore most of which were his own doing, his drug addiction, his wife's drug addiction and her getting AIDS and committing suicide. But it is a humorous telling of what would be an unfunny story because Harrelson is funny very funny and so is the real life Flynt. He is a scumbag, but a likable scumbag nonetheless and Woody plays him to the hilt. An engrossing look at one of America's most infamous personalities even today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An incredible story of a man we should all owe thanks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>About three quarters of the way through The People vs. Larry Flynt, Woody Harrelson (Flynt) looks at his lawyer and explains why he is the perfect client. `I'm the most fun, I'm rich and I'm always in trouble', he jokes, and there is probably no better tagline for Milos Forman's unauthorized biography of the second most notorious smut-peddler in America.The People vs. Larry Flynt is a three act film. Part biography, part courtroom drama and part love story, the life of this incredible man and his fights with the courts over the freedom of speech amendment is another feather in the cap for already acclaimed director Forman (Amadeus). The story begins with the Flynt brothers selling moonshine to local yokels and follows their rise through their investment in a bar with nude dancers. This ultimately becomes the turning point in Larry's life as it was here he both meets his future wife, Althea Leasure (played by rocker Courtney Love) and also has his first notion of what would become known as Hustler magazine. Not long after the magazines initial launch, Flynt found himself in a publishers' wet dream when he receives photos of former first lady Jackie Onasis in the nude while staying at a European villa. The inclusion of these photos doubled the circulation of Hustler magazine and made Larry both a popular celebrity and also a target of angst among the Biblebelt southern United States. After Larry leaves the courtroom where he fought off attacks on his rude pictorials, he and his lawyer are shot by an unknown gunman. The result of the attack would leave Larry paralyzed from the waist down, and begin his drug dependency that would keep him paranoid and in his mansion for three years.The film then follows Larry through his operations, his addictions, his constant court battles and the death of his wife to AIDS in the mid-1980's. Actually, it seems that there isn't much of Larry's extraordinary life that hit the cutting room floor. Intertwined, but essential in story development are Flynt's relationship with Ruth Carter Stapelton, his conversion to religion, the infamous Iacocca cocaine tapes and his legal battles with religious figures, in particular, the reverend Jerry Falwell, who objects greatly when Hustler lampoons him having sex with his mother.This may all seem to be a little much to keep within the frames of the same film, but Milos Forman does an excellent job of keeping pace and our interest in the many characters that are paraded through Flynt's life. But giving credit where credit is due, the acting of the major leads was what gave the film so much life. Woody Harrelson who was on the tail end of his seventh film in three years, does an exceptional job as Flynt and was later nominated for an Academy Award for his masterful performance. Equally entertaining and gripping in her depiction of Althea was the untested Courtney Love, who may have had bit parts in five films previous to People vs. Larry Flynt, but never before was she counted upon for carrying such an emotional load. Even the very young Edward Norton, cast before his breakout performance in Primal Fear, does a superb job. Note: the DVD reveals two interesting casting points, one being that some of the cast and production crew had to front their own money to get Courtney insured due to her reputation as a drug addict, and that Woody was in the running for Flynt with funnyman Bill Murray.Released in 1997, The People vs. Larry Flynt was one of those rare times in Hollywood history where a director was nominated for his film, but the movie failed to garnish a Best Film Oscar nomination. Some felt this was due to a less than flattering article by Gloria Steinem and her opinions of how the movie tries to make a saint out of a pornographer. Awards or not, The People vs. Larry Flynt is an exceptional film. On most critics lists as one of the best of the year, the film shows how one man stood up to the establishment and paved the way for many in his wake. Like him or hate him, we all owe Larry Flynt thanks for proving through the courts that every man has the legal right to his freedom of speech. Well done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A True Story?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hadn't heard of Larry Flynt, so I guess I was able to come to this film with a fairly neutral attitude. I didn't have any idea what the plot was, and was lured by the prospect of seeing Edward Norton in action.I really didn't like Flynt, although some of the situations and dialague were quite amusing. I could see that the film presented him in a fairly good light, as the porn King with a heart of gold. Maybe that was the point, to show how such a reprehensible character should still be protected by the law. But I really felt that at no time did the film ever consider the responsibility that might mirror Flynt's right to publish pornography. It felt a bit to me like the American gun lobby's attitude that it isn't guns that kill others, its the person pulling the trigger. The comparison with Flynt's line, something about not banning Budweiser because some kids get drunk, seemed stark to me. The film is thoroughly well acted, and Woody Harrelson in particular puts on a surprisingly good performance. I also thought Love as his wife was very convincing, and the relationship between the two was one of the most convincing aspects of the film. I thought Edward Norton was coasting.But reading that this "true" story is significantly embellished and that Flynt's character in particular is presented in an unnaturally good light does detract from the film. If he had been portrayed in a truer, "worse" light I don't think it would have detracted from the message of the film at all. I'm tired with anything that purports to be based on the "truth" that contains factual innacuracies, its just so self-defeating. There's enough artistic licence with the actors portrayal of characters, without messing with the "truth" to make life eaiser for the filmmaker to get his point across.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Passionate defense of free speech</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Woody Harrelson stars as Larry Flynt, the real-life publisher of Hustler magazine. The story follows him through his dirt-poor beginnings, the start of the magazine, and his constant battles with the authorities that try to censor his magazine. He is supported through all this by his lawyer (Edward Norton), his wife (Courtney Love), and his brother (Brett Harrelson). You have to watch the movie to see what happens next, but you can be sure that Flynt never gives up.Harrelson's performance carries this film. There's plenty wrong with this porn pusher character: he embarrasses his employers and his friends, and refuses to respect the very courts he relies on to protect his rights. But his tenacity, courage and refusal to accept his peers' self-contradictory rules inspire admiration, if not respect. Oddly, his porn-pushing is not at all his most disagreeable trait: he merely caters to the sick feelings of many Americans. Flynt inspires hatred because his success shows things about American society that most of us would rather were not so: there are a lot of people here who enjoy seeing sex in a leering, degrading light. Censoring Flynt is merely shooting the messenger.Like most films with a message, THE PEOPLE VS. LARRY FLYNT fails to present the case fairly. As Flynt's lawyer, Norton gets huge hunks of screen time to argue for free speech, but his opponents don't. A film that takes a stand on a controversial issue should not be afraid to give both sides their say. Forman's film thus suffers in comparison to Danny Kaye's TV-movie SKOKIE, in which the case against free speech was allowed equal time, and the victim of censorship was not a mere rascally smut-peddler like Flynt, but a vicious self-proclaimed Nazi. Flynt is not "the worst," as he seems to think.At times, the movie steps over the line from simply defending free speech into actually defending Flynt's pornography. Flynt bravely takes the stand to say that it's more obscene to shower the public with pictures of violence than pictures of sex.Flynt is right that violence is obscene, but he misses the point. Hustler is obscene, not because it portrays sex, but because of the specific way in which it portrays sex. It shows sex stripped of love, tenderness, and affection. It shows the female body as an object of contempt and degradation rather than beauty. Its pictures provoke a leering, snickering response from its readers, an attitude much like that of little boys vandalizing fences or bashing mailboxes. In short, it's intended to give the readers the sense that they are getting away with something naughty - something wicked. And in this important respect, Flynt and Falwell are the same. They both portray humanity's greatest physical and emotional pleasure as evil. Falwell rejects it while Flynt promotes it, but their moral view of it is no different. That is the true obscenity of Larry Flynt.But if Flynt and his magazine are obscene, that only makes his ultimate point stronger. If the right of free speech protects scum like him, it will protect most anyone else in America. Flynt is a small price to pay for freedom.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good film about some white trash.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think Forman has been out of the movie business for so long that he's out of touch; he must have thought that the only available "actresses" or candidates to play a major female role were ugly, talentless whore widows of dead rock stars. I mean, how else can we explain the casting of Courtney Love (and what kind of a dumb name is that...? Her real name must be Deirdre Wiley)? The role of Flint's wife was a good role, and there are real actresses out there that should have been hired for the job. Not that she was bad - she was mediocre. And any of those so-called film-critics out there who thought her "performance" was terrific shouldn't forget two things: 1) it's easy to make the audience feel sorry for a pathetic junkie HIV person, and 2) playing a pathetic whore junkie couldn't have been much of a stretch for her, now could it; this woman has built her whole career on being a dumb whore junkie.Another thing about Deirdre: this nauseatingly ugly eight-foot-four monster has the kind of awful body that rapists would steer clear from; her legs and arms are bony in the most scary sense of the word, and her small, immobile silicon breasts aren't too much of a pretty sight, either. Her first scene in the movie - as a nearly underage stripper - is RIDICULOUS. She has the kind of body that wouldn't land her a job in the most run-down white-trash strip joints somewhere in the middle of Alabama. Plus, she doesn't look anything like an underage girl (or thereabouts) in that scene: she looks like she's at least in her mid-twenties.As far as the film itself is concerned, the big question is just how truthful and unbiased Forman's portrayal of the characters and the allegedly true events really is. I really wouldn't know since I am not all-too familiar with Flint, apart from seeing him in the occasional interview, and the rumour (or fact) that he sodomized a chicken once. So how biased is it (the film, not the chicken)? Judging from Hollywood's past record on bias, the movie must be extremely one-sided, and more fiction than fact. (Nothing new there, unless you're a gullible fool.) The film's title itself already suggests whose side the film takes - making Larry Flint seem like a martyr - not to mention the fact that he was actively involved in the making of it (which included a cameo as a judge, where he lay rest to any hopes that he can act - if there were any such hopes among anyone).Having said that, I have absolutely no qualms about the film poking fun at organized religion (or any kind of religion, for that matter). One of the most amusing moments in the film is when Harrelson says 'no' when asked in court to swear to tell the truth, under oath. He explains that he is an atheist, so he can't do it. In fact, there is no doubt that the highlights of the film all lie in the scenes that take place in court; these scenes are humorous, and wonderfully ridicule the trials themselves, and the entire judicial system as a whole (the formality, the ludicrousness of it all). However, Forman creates suspicion that he comes from Mars; he sincerely expects the audience to care about rich and depraved white-trash freaks. Sorry, but apart from the HIV and the shooting incident I really don't feel sorry for any of those people, and that includes the helpless lawyer, well-played by Norton. Harrelson is quite solid, but not terrific. Casting him makes more sense than casting Richard Gere, but even he is still far too pretty to play a Jabba the Hut-like character such as Flint. And the casting of James Carville provides another major annoyance to me; this man is one of America's most notorious left-wingers, and he clearly can't act - not even under an experienced (though a little rusty) director. Casting liberal mutants like Carville only serves to make the film appear even more biased than it already seems to be. The rest of the cast is partly good, and partly not so good. Overall, I expect the acting to be on a somewhat higher level from a director who enjoys the kind of reputation that Forman seems to have.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Obviously, Larry Flynt really splits the public, with feminists complaining about his portrayals of women in his magazines, prudes objecting to the lewd content, and free speech advocates idolizing him. I am in the latter group, and the individuals behind "The People vs. Larry Flynt" clearly are. Mainly what we see is that not only did the government keep going after him, but how he challenged everything. Some of what he does at the trials may lead you to crack up (I certainly started cracking up). But the movie also shows how many of his antics nearly ruined him.As the titular character, Woody Harrelson does a perfect job, as do Courtney Love as his hubby Althea Leasure, and Edward Norton as his lawyer Alan Isaacman. Also starring are James Cromwell, Crispin Glover, Vincent Schiavelli, and even Woody Harrelson's real-life brother Brett as Larry Flynt's brother Jimmy.Yes, Milos Forman accomplished another good one here. So why did he have to follow it up with the worthless "Man on the Moon"?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ignores the issue of Flynt's material and shows it's bias but it is still an enjoyable film with a level of intelligence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Larry Flynt is the owner of a small strip joint decides to use an extended flyer with nudie pictures to promote the club. When it seems to go down quite well he tries a bigger print, only to have it struggle to sell. However when he gets access to nude pictures of the first lady it turns his magazine into an overnight success. But with success comes persecution - from the moral majority at first and then from the law. So begins the first of many trials and court cases where Flynt and his lawyer defend the magazine's content on the grounds of free speech. This is a fascinating film that manages to be interesting, thought-provoking and fun all at more or less the same time. The film tells the true story of Larry Flynt in a very fast paced film that focuses more on the issue of free speech than it does on the content of Hustler magazine. In this regard the film works pretty well, even it is pretty clear which side of the argument it comes down on. For this reason the film will likely put off those who are anti-pornography for to call this film sympathetic is to really do down the sheer whitewashing it does. In one of the early cases in the film Isaacman (the lawyer) basically says that it doesn't matter whether or not you like what Flynt does, but you do need to defend the right for him to do it. In a way this film would have been better if it had taken it's own advice and taken a slightly more objective view of Flynt. It shows this bias in the rather jokey tone of the film, the casting of the good looking Harrelson and the fact that the film never gives the objectors to his magazine a fair break in terms of how they are presented. For my money though, this was a minor problem because the bias is clear for all to see and it maybe affects how the `true events' are presented but doesn't take away from the validity of it's points on freedom of speech. The only thing that is clear is that this is maybe not the best film to come to if you want a balanced view of this man. Pornographer or patriot? You won't get the answer here - or rather you will get the answer but it won't be a balanced one. The upside of this bias is that the film is surprisingly fun to watch considering the material. This sense of fun is also helped by a pretty great cast. Harrelson is nothing like Flynt in terms of looks and his casting is part of the film's spin, but he does a good job in the lead and his Flynt is OTT and unconcerned with the constitution unless he can use it to defend himself - not exactly a balanced view but it gets better towards the end. Love is hardly a great actress but she is very good here and is very convincing in her gradual descent into drug addiction etc. In yet another great performance (in his second film) Norton plays it balanced and pretty much steals each scene he is in and really makes the court cases a lot more enjoyable when Harrelson's histrionics threaten to make them too silly to support the free speech argument. The film very much belongs to Harrelson and Norton but the support cast is good and includes good turns from many well known faces including Cromwell, Glover, Schiavelli and Flynt himself. Overall this is not a perfect film - far from it. It is too biased and unwilling to actually consider that both sides have points to make - instead of looking at the limitations of free speech it chooses to spin Flynt as a patriot and the moral majority as a bunch of fascists. Despite this it is great fun to watch if a little overlong. Harrelson is fun to watch and Norton's great performance carries the message side of the film perfectly - keeping it light and fitting the tone but without cheapening the point. As character history I suspect it is rather kind, and objective it is not but it is an interesting, funny film that will provoke thought (even if it could have really asked more questions itself).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I cannot believe a movie like this ever got made at all, well I take that back, with Hollywood the way it is! Woody Harrelson is eccentric to say the least but he is a good actor who does fine work. He gives an outstanding performance as the self-proclaimed "smut peddler with a heart" Larry Claxton Flynt. This film follows him from his founding of Hustler magazine, to his brief born-again Christian phase, to his shooting and crippling and finally his many legal battles that climaxed with his fight with Jerry Falwell. I want to make one thing clear right now, contrary to what this film would have you believe, Larry Flynt is no hero. He is not someone who USES his first Amendment rights, he ABUSES them. His is not an exercise of one of our most precious liberties and freedoms as Americans, it is an abomination of it! He would make our forefathers turn in our graves. I find it offensive to the extreme for the makers of this film to try to pull the wool over our eyes and portray this vulgarian extraordinare as some kind of a patriot. I cannot believe that the man who directed Ragtime and One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest directed this monstrosity posing as a film. Maybe he wanted to send a message, well it is a dangerous message. Larry Flynt's daughter exposed him in a book where she talked of his physical and sexual abuse of her. This man is a first class scumbag. Also, while were on this subject, I could not stand Courtney Love in this film. She is not an actress of any kind and is terrible in the part. Well, on second thought let me say that she is in a way EXCELLENT in the part, because she plays a trashy, drug addicted messed up person. Come to think of it Courtney didn't even have to act! That is exactly what she is in real life! I could not believe that she admitted taking heroin when she was pregnant. I mean most pregnant women crave ice cream and pickles Courtney craves heroin! Her and Curt Cobain made a perfect couple dumb and dumber! I think Rush Limbaugh (a real patriot) said it best, they were both human trash with money!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forman Kinda Misses the Point</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Larry Flynt beat and divorced several wives. His daughter has accused him of sexual abuse. 'Hustler' is a sexist, often misogynistic magazine, that has published violent porn and romanticizes rape and violence against women.Formans film however, portrays a man who is, in his own way, a loving and devoted person. An entrepreneur of sexual liberation, who publishes dirty, but quaint, nudie-pictures.I think that Formans beautification of the life and deed of Larry Flynt does damage to the point he seems to be trying to make. The point is that freedom of speech is precisely for the views that we do not like. So why does Forman then go out of his way to make Flynt into a likable, albeit quirky, guy? This entirely misses the point. Why couldn't Forman show Flynt as well as the Christian right, both, as the reactionaries that they are? Perhaps from the perspective of the lawyer - Nortons character? Is that really too much to ask? I know this is Hollywood but... Formans own sexism may enter into this. The scenes at Flynts strip club shows a boss, Flynt, who has sex with his employees, the strippers, but the film never makes an inkling to reflect on the unequal power relations or exploitation. Instead all we get to see are always willing and happy women, eager to satisfy and serve men. In Formans 'Man on the Moon', prostitution is, in a smaller scene, also depicted as something harmless, quaint and fun.'The People vs. Larry Flynt' is well-made though, and Harrelson, Norton and Courtney Love are entertaining to watch, though their characters sometimes tend to become caricatures. The story is told with a nice drive to it. And the film does make a certain, but as said above, quite shallow point about freedom of speech.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Racy yet fascinating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Say what you will about the subject matter of this film, it is very good. The People vs. Larry Flynt is about the creator of Hustler magazine, an extremely racy pornographic magazine that was way ahead of its time, and the legal battles that ensued upon its creation and development. It focuses on aspects of Flynt's home life as well as his business. His offensive magazine was condemned by onslaughts of disgusted American's, and this lead to Larry Flynt being a figurehead in the battle for free speech. The film tells a very interesting story with a colorful cast of odd characters, including the obscene and bizarre protagonist himself.The story that this film tells is not one that you will hear discussed in everyday society. It just isn't something that can easily be brought up, because of its raunchy subject matter. And that's why I enjoyed this movie so much, because it told a surprisingly fascinating story. There was a lot more to this legal battle than meets the eye. There was a surprising amount of aspects to the story that I wasn't expecting. The movie told a very interesting story about a very interesting man. The film covers a lot more ground than is to be expected. It begins with Larry and his brother running a small time strip club. Not long after the movie begins is Hustler created and Flynt begins to thrive. The main focus of the films conflict then starts to arise as Flynt is attacked by naysayers who are disgusted by what he is doing. From here a lot of things happen, some good, others not so good. There is plenty of comedy, drama, and even tragedy in this unorthodox story about a very unorthodox and yet fascinating man.I think I've made it clear that Larry Flynt was a fascinating character to watch unfold in this movie, but that doesn't mean he was a likable one. To put it lightly, Larry Flynt was a jerk in this film. He was vulgar, rude, and obscene. He objectified women and had little to no respect for authority. There were times where he became unbearably obnoxious in the film, but it all played in to what the character was all about. He undoubtedly developed issues as he grew older. He suffered one physical tragedy that left him impaired physically, but also drove his mind into depravity as well. But despite all this, I can't say I disrespect him for being so determined to exercise his first amendment rights. Considering the situation, you really can't argue with the points he makes in the film, whether you agree with him or not. The tagline of the film says it best. You might not like what he does, but are you prepared to give up his right to do it? This sums up what the legal battle the film focuses on is all about. He has the right to do what he does whether you like it or not. The film delivered very interesting battle of wits and morals.The film boasts a fascinating story with a variety of different characters, and it thankfully has the cast to hold up this aspect of the film. Woody Harrelson plays Larry Flynt, and he does an incredible job. Flynt goes through a lot of changes, both physical and mental, throughout the course of the film, and Harrelson conveys those changes extraordinarily well. It is definitely one of his finest leading roles. Courtney Love plays Flynt's wife, Althea. Now, I have absolutely no expect for Courtney Love. She is a disgusting and tasteless woman with no redeeming qualities except for her performance in The People vs. Larry Flynt. As much as I dislike Love, she does a fantastic job as Althea, a troubled and emotional character that isn't easy to access or understand the motives of because she is really just a nutjob. The character is very multi-dimensional, and Courtney Love does a surprising job at conveying it. Edward Norton plays Flynt's lawyer, Alan Isaacman. The character is another very interesting one. He shows how difficult it is to be the lawyer for a deranged man like Larry Flynt, but his will and determination give him an insightful and compelling edge that I really enjoyed. Plus I love Norton in everything he does, so loving him and his character was a no-brainer.I really loved this movie. It isn't perfect but what it delivers is excellent. The narrative has some issues. In the beginning of the film conflicts seem to arise and then just disappear without another word. There are some abrupt cuts that give the film an uneven feel and pacing. But by the end of the film these issues are easily forgivable because of how much I liked the overall story this film delivers. I really liked everything about this film and could easily see past some of its imperfections. The story is unique and interesting, and so are the characters that are portrayed by a great cast. Don't be turned off by this film's subject matter. You don't want to miss it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, Milos Forman has proved his worth as a director. To be able to make a hero out of somebody like Larry Flynt requires great skills. Not to mention that he made an excellent movie even with Ms Courtney Cox in it. (why did he cast her in that movie - did he lose a bet or was that a contractual thing for casting Mr. Harrelson? Or was Tabu unavailable?) At the end of the movie the audience are most likely to come to the following conclusions: 1. Larry Flynt is a courageous, in-your-face, kind of entrepreneurial genius. 2. People such as Larry Flynt are the key to the success of our country and to the elimination of poverty 3. Larry Flynt is a hero of the poor people fighting for them against the club going, golf playing, influenced by the west, rich clique who prevented others from coming into their group with the help of the license raj, 4. People who stand up against corruption are honest, good people but really who are we kidding, do we really need these jokers? and 5. a small side issue is that the role of good women is at the side of their genius husbands even when they are treated as start-up capital. However, these are my questions: 1. If the poor are poor is it really because they are either lazy, or scared, or simply idiots. I wonder what would Mohd. Yunus of Grameen Bank have to say about this? 2. According to the movie people like Larry Flynt benefited 30 million people. In a country of 1 billion is 30million that much? It is just 0.3%. Not to mention these "poor people" had to be people who were at least of middle class status and living in cities. 3. Yes, it is true that the license raj did fetter the rise of dynamic capitalists - but will somebody ever talk about those toiling masses of this country who work until death to make this country run and people like Larry Flynt trilionaires? 4. And will someone ever say anything against making heroes of not only persons who are geniuses at exploiting others but also those who take dowry? what happened to all that social conscience of ours? It makes me very sad when talented film makers such as Milos Forman make such movies.Miracles can happen and may be Maniratnam will find his conscience....someday....</fullReview>

From what I had always heard about the man, I fell into the trap of assuming this movie would be nothing more than a self-serving, contrived view of his life. Boy was I mistaken. This was a very good movie, thanks in part to an excellent performance by Woody Harrelson as Mr. Flynt and a wonderful supporting cast.The film chronicles Flynt's struggles as a poor boy growing up deep in the hills of Kentucky to his transformation into one of the most influential advocates of the freedom of speech in the world. Along the way, Flynt meets some very interesting characters, including his soon to be wife Althea (Courtney Love) and the sister of President Jimmy Carter.The People vs. Larry Flynt contains elements of a Hollywood classic. It is the story of a man who, although quite eccentric, conquered the world. He turned a few seedy bars in southern Ohio into a multi-million dollar publication almost overnight. But just when you thought he was on top of the world, he suffers a devastating loss when appearing in court in Georgia. Flynt kept a low profile for several years, becoming sort of a recluse and became addicted to painkillers. Larry Flynt definitely had his share of personal demons, as we learn that fame and fortune almost always come with a price. His life was so surreal that at times during the movie I asked myself 'Did this really happen?' I am almost convinced that some portions of this movie were embellished a little to make the film more dramatic (especially the courtroom scenes) but for the most part it is historically accurate.Directed by Academy Award winner Milos Forman (for One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, 1975), the film is aesthetically pleasing. Forman really knows how to get the most out of the actors in his movies. At times you forget that Woody Harrelson is portraying a character, you actually begin to think that he really IS Larry Flynt. There are also notably good showings by Love, Edward Norton and even a cameo from the real Larry Flynt, who plays a judge.I'm giving this movie a score of 8/10. The People vs. Larry Flynt is one of the better comedy-dramas of recent years and definitely worth checking out. If you are a defender of our First Amendment Right and a proponent of free speech and press, then you will enjoy this film. I only regret that I didn't watch it sooner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth watching for the supreme court scenes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally rented this movie after 9 years. The main reason was because Milos Forman, the director has only made one film (Hair) that I didn't like. Some of the sleaziest scenes with Courtenay Love were kind of gratuitous and didn't really make any strong point. A better and more rounded approach would have been to explore other facets of Flynt's personality - such as whether he really was a diagnosed bipolar disorder sufferer - he could not have been detained in a psychiatric prison for 15 months without the court first sending him for psych evaluation. Also, what about Flynt's degenerate gambling, another possible symptom of bipolar disorder? On the whole I'm pleased with Forman's efforts, the earlier parts were occasionally irritating and depressing but their shortcomings were more than compensated by the penultimate scene where Flynt's lawyer (Norton) delivers his defense to the US Supreme Court. That was pure magic - absolutely brilliant script writing. Now, if only Alan Isaacman had been around to defend Lenny Bruce . . . Oh well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Freedom of speech is a subject that still causes controversy. And So to does Larry Flynt the creator of Hustler Magazine. I was looking forward to seeing this movie, it sure dealt with interesting subject matter.That said, you'll either love or hate this movie-and I loved it. One of The main reasons for that I'm sure was the casting(I have to admit Courteney Love was excellent here). Also the movie was engrossing, so many "controversial" movies can also get absolutely boring, in their attempts to be controversial sometimes the interest level and pace of the picture get thrown out the window.Not here-I didn't have any gripes with this, this is not a movie for everybody, if you have to much trouble with Larry Flynt and what he stands for maybe not a good choice because the movie will get pretty graphic in scenes. But it is a compelling and interesting film from beginning to end.Although everyone was good in this I choose to single out Courtney Love because she was the "wild card" here. I really didn't know she had acting talent before I saw this but she does and she was excellent. All performances were great. All in All I'd say this is a very good, if controversial, film, with excellent performances from an excellent cast. This was a very good movie and I'd give it an 8.5 of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, What a Film! This film is suitable for people who fight for the basic human rights and for the people who have developed a passionate hate for the U.S Government! For me, the humour was recieved through the brilliance of Woody Harrelson and Courtney Love. They were both marvellous because their roles suited their character. The jokes were political but easy enough to understand. It's a story about a man who is just wild and unique. He let people know what he thinks thorugh his foul mouth. It got a little much in the eyes of many people but because of his nature, the limitation boundary explosively dissapeard. I love this film for it's humour, Woody's stance for the freedom of speech in the most unfashionable and often ugly way. If you decide to watch this film then you will find out if he finds success through his stance with such outrage behaviour in the American society back in the 70s. Also a must for all Edward Norton lovers. This film also makes a great case study for those who is studying or is planning to study Tort of Defamation. Peace.</fullReview>

I didn't like the fact that feminists were protesting the film, calling it a "white-wash" of Flynt's career. But who cares? They get mad at anything.

		<shortDescription>"The pervert is back" ? the making of a martyr</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie presents Larry Flint, successful owner of a porno magazine publishing house, as a guru ? or even a messiah. He often refers to god's nature and is surrounded by a ragged group of his devoted disciples who obey him unconditionally. And he fights bravely for civil liberties ? in the interest of all humankind. He goes to prison, but he stands by his believes. Then he gets shot ? probably because of what he stands for. As a consequence, Larry Flint remains a cripple for the rest of his life. This gives his words and actions still more weight. Now he is a martyr of the American constitution which guarantees the right of free speech.The synopsis is biased, I admit it. But I guess so is the movie. Only in brief spells does it make clear what Flint is really after: Money, power and more money. There's nothing wrong with that, it's perfectly legal, and I am convinced you can earn money in many more despicable ways than by selling smut magazines. What makes me uneasy here is the "inverted demonization" of a person who basically is a powerful and skilled businessman and uses court action as a means to gain publicity. Looking at it this way, the movie is part of the Flint propaganda machinery.It is in parts quite a good movie, though: Woody Harrelson is riveting as Larry Flint, but the moral baggage is carried almost exclusively by Edward Norton, playing Flint's lawyer Alan Isaacman, having for once a good, intelligent script to work with. The real Isaacman must be really pleased with Nortons performance as a young, shy yet intelligent and tenacious crusader for civil liberties ? what better kind of publicity can one imagine? Norton's performance makes the viewer understand, that the movie carries an idealistic cause that cannot be dismissed. Courtney Love plays Flint's wife ? a character that is either noisily unpleasant or else just boring. Frankly, the couple's domestic troubles are neither interesting nor overly exciting.I think it was a mistake to have someone play the anonymous gunman who permanently disabled Flint. As I understand, no one knows who fired the shots. The actor who was chosen has an uncanny resemblance with the late Henry Fonda who I am sure was no bigot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the best movies on the topic (freedom of speech, I mean... not pornography) I've seen. Even though it is a bit idealized, it nevertheless is controversial, interesting, smart and not "moralizing" (something that I really hate about movies on democratic freedoms - they are way too simple and spit the message right away). Definitely worth watching.Oh yeah.. I was surprised by the number of people here doing pretty much the same thing that "the People" did in the movie - expressing their hatred towards Larry ("I wanna blow your godless head off" type of hatred... a sign of a true christian, by the way). Whatever happened to "Blessed are the meek...etc." (Larry's paralyzed, as far as I know) and "Love your enemy"? Personally, I think that hating a movie because of the main character is a very, very stupid thing... Anyhow, if you consider yourself a "devoted Christian", I would advise renting "Ten Commandments" (starring our good ole' friend Charlton Heston... in 1956 he was preaching "Thou shalt not kill" from the screen...now he's trying to get every American to have a gun as a head of NRA) instead of "People..."

This can only be done, so it seems, by creating a biography, fictionalized a bit or not. Besides a good story, PEOPLE puts together some terrific acting and solid direction to make this a recommendation.The story of Larry Flynt's life up to this point, including his magazine HUSTLER, wife, and the shenanigans he pulled during his trials.LARRY FLYNT gradually morphs into a story of rights and the basis of the First Amendment of the United States. Whether that makes us want to like Flynt is beside the point, because the writers of ED WOOD and MAN ON THE MOON made this movie another brilliant portrayal of a person usually disassociated from society.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is just my 2 cents on this film.I don't agree with what Larry does. I think he's a vile, dispicable man and that Hustler is every bit as horrible as many of the characters in the film (and people in real life) believe it to be. I, myself, am a Christian in fact. I didn't really enjoy seeing the aspects of Larry's life that are portrayed. However, I don't think he was really portrayed in a positive light anyway.But here's the thing. Just because you don't like someone doesn't mean you can take away their right to voice their opinions. I totally agreed with everything that Edward Norton (by the way, he was the best part of the movie. Terrific actor... too bad he didn't have more screen time!) says in the film about freedom of speech. This movie kind of reitterated to me something I truly believe: If I take away other's right to free speech, I take away my right to free speech. As a Christian, I want to be able to voice my opinions, which are unpopular sometimes. If I want to be able to do it, I have to allow people on the other spectrum to do it. That's what America is all about.Ironically, this movie is all about allowing everyone to give their 2 cents.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Insightful biopic with something to actually say</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The People vs. Larry Flynt" documents the story of Larry Flynt, publisher of the American pornography magazine "Hustler". The main junt of the story centres around his battles in the courts to protect his right to free speech in the magazine. Along the way he is supported by his wife, Althea Leasure (Courtney Love) and defended by his lawyer Alan Isaacman (the ever strong Edward Norton).The movie's strongest point is the great performances given by the cast. Norton isn't much of a surprise - he never ceases to be anything less than excellent and, once more, he makes you actually believe he's the character rather than an actor-playing-a-character. His lawyer character, a man of principles but also of loyalty, is good though doesn't give this talented man enough to stretch his true abilities that we see in the likes of "American History X". Harrelson is at his peak here, as the smarmy but strong minded Flynt. He's quite well cast and genuinely convinces you that he *believes* in free speech and that Flynt was a man who loved what life could give you, casting inhibitions aside. But the real gem here is Courtney Love who shows she's more than just a screeching rock chick - she plays her vivacious, almost slutty, character with panache. She's a woman who revels in her own sexuality but yet shows a genuine love for her husband. Her eventual illness is harrowing to watch.The script and direction are all grand. Some of the speeches have genuinely interesting dialogue and the movie's theme - free speech - is argued fairly well and makes a lot of sense (it's very clear where the writer's stance is on the issue). The script lags now and then, and doesn't exactly astound but the performances help buoy it up. Likewise the direction is steady, observed, without ever going above the "good" threshold."The People vs. Larry Flynt" is an enjoyable bio-pic. This is perhaps due to the strong cast, rather than an average script and direction. It's not utterly memorable but it has something to muse over for awhile - 7.3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Milos Forman is by no means glorifying Larry Flynt. Flynt is portrayed as a misogynist--an abusive, obnoxious, sexist pig who has a lot to learn about life and how to treat people and who almost inadvertently makes a difference. I, myself, totally disliked his character from the beginning of the movie, but that's irrelevant. It's his plight and determination that Forman is applauding and it's interesting how such a "morally repugnant" person can still be a positive, relevant figure. So... the "true" Flynt story was somewhat stretched or changed, that's the movie business. Name ONE movie (excluding documentaries) that sticks to 100% of the facts as they really happened?... Didn't think you could. It's just sometimes necessary for directors and scripters to be a bit manipulative to get their point across.Anyway, the three leads are excellent and this is a wonderful exploration on the importance of free speech and press and the cruel, thoughtless nature of our politicians and religious "leaders" (I hate using that term, but for lack of a better one...). Interesting now, too, especially the scenes involving self-serving religious leader Jerry Falwell. Shown here, in the 1980s, Falwell was busy getting rich off his "5 million" followers by contributing such insight as AIDS being God's way of "punishing" sinners. Then, remember, in 2001, he blamed abortion doctors and gays for the 9/11 terrorist attacks? The fact this twisted, nasty, vengeful, misguided man is one of the more respected religious leaders in the U.S. is enough to make me puke.Score: 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ONE TRULY INCREDIBLE MOTION PICTURE!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though Woody Harrelson is an actor known by many, I don't think he gets the recognition he deserves--acting-wise. If this movie doesn't prove his brilliance as an actor, then I don't know what will. Woody doesn't look the slightest bit like Larry Flynt, yet I don't think they could've picked a better person to take on that role. Now I feel like I know Larry Flynt in mind, body and soul. And I have to say, though I may sound politically incorrect by saying this, he is a deeply fascinating individual. You can't complain about Flynt. He is simply acting out every one of our deepest desires. Freud said it himself, everyone thinks about sex all the time, whether it's on a conscious or unconscious level. If people disregarded their inhibitions, led by their superegos, this world would be one big orgy. Flynt has no shame in his game. He says what he feels and never, NEVER holds back. And there are many times where he actually makes a great point. That proves, just because a man is vulgar and unconventional that doesn't make him lesser of a human being. There are politicians in this world who lie, cheat and steal to get to the top, but get away with what they do because they graduated from the most prominent universities and put on big, fake smiles for the American people. I think the best scene in the movie is the one in which a cameraman is taking photos of a naked woman on a bed for the magazine. He makes a big fuss, asking her to pose in certain positions and everything, while Flynt just wants him to take the damn picture. The cameraman wants to keep the photos tasteful and doesn't want to show the woman's vagina. Flynt goes up to him and asks, "Are you a religious man?" He replies, "Yes." "Well, if vaginas were evil, then why did God create them?" He brings up a great point. Why do we try our best to hide male and female genitalia, when it's what God gave us? What's evil about it? My second favorite scene is the one in which Flynt is looking through a "Playboy" magazine and sees all sorts of articles about politics, news, how to make Martinis and things like that. He comments, "Do people really want to read about this? It's like they're saying, if you're not rich you don't j**k off." This movie has everything you can want in a motion picture. It's dramatic, it's moving, it's powerful, yet at the same time it's extremely funny and extremely entertaining. All the vulgarity and perversity is tempered with great comic relief. The cast is first-rate. I like how Woody used his real-life brother, Brett Harrelson, to play his brother in the film. The two of them look almost exactly alike. It just kinda bugs me out when I see siblings in movies who look hardly a damn thing alike. Since Forman directed--and did a hell of a job, like usual--we have Vincent Schiavelli in the cast, who's been in his films ever since "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest." It's always great to see Vince on screen. I also have to give kudos to Crispin Glover, who's actually given a much better role than the airhead roles he usually plays. He does a real fine job. Edward Norton does a good job, though I wouldn't say this was his best performance. Then again, this is considering I've seen every other movie he's been in: "Primal Fear," "Fight Club," "American History X," "The Score," etc. If I saw this movie before I saw the ones aforementioned, I probably wouldn't be as disappointed. Courtney Love does a great job, though I wouldn't say she deserved QUITE as much appraise as she got. But considering she's a rock star and she hasn't exactly had a long list of movie roles--I'm guessing none that required her to play a character--this is a big step up and I think she can really make it as an actress, especially now that she's cleaned up. Of course, Woody gives the best performance of all and I wouldn't say he upstaged everyone--it is a team effort--but he's so great that everyone else can't help but pale a little bit in comparison. It doesn't matter whether you're a porno freak or not--this is not a porno movie! It's about freedom. Freedom of speech. And the boundaries society puts on freedom. There really is no accounting for taste. Needless to say, if you don't like pornography, don't pick up a "Hustler" magazine. There's a scene where Flynt compares the selling of pornography to the selling of alcohol. "If some young kid purchases alcohol under age, they don't sue Budweiser!" Yet if the same kid is exposed to his magazine, they have the right to sue Flynt? I'm not going to put words in everyone's mouth and say whether pornography is a good or bad thing, and this movie doesn't do anything to glorify it. You be the judge! But do we have the right to vanish all pornography from newsstands everywhere because the moral majority doesn't approve? About the only thing I felt was missing was the lack of development of Norton's character. I didn't really get the idea of why he wanted to fight thick and thin to defend Larry. This is a guy who just got out of law school, and he's continually defending the man who everyone loves to hate? The man who fails to swear his oath on the Bible because he's an Atheist? The man who feels no shame about using profanity in the courtroom? I just wanted to know why he was so dedicated--what motivated him? "The People Vs. Larry Flynt" is a thought-provoking, controversial film that I think everyone should see. Not only is it beautifully done and beautifully acted, but it arises all sorts of questions that we find enlightening but never really thought hard about, prior to watching the film. See this movie! You'll never see anything like it!My score: 9 (out of 10) </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Milos Forman takes us into the perverted world of the publisher of Hustler magazine. Forman does well by stopping short of making Flint a heroic figure (a paladin he aint) and keeping the focus on the true cause of freedom of expression. Harrelson once again proves his worth in a role of depravity, this time opposite the equally adept Courtney Love. A well made film that reminds us that freedom extends to all segments of our society. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>terrific movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film is about the freedom of speech. The speech can be acceptable (i.e. normal, within the acknowledged by the society scope and manners) and non- or partially acceptable. It's obvious, that with the first one, in general, everything is OK. The second option requires support, as the society generally not favors non-ordinary behaviors and utterances. This requirement for the support comes out of the principles of democracy. The United States, as a distinguished democratic country, has properly documented such rights in the Constitution. Theoretically everything is all right. The film shows that in practical life it's not as easy, and you have to fight out this very important right: the right for the freedom of speech. And Woody Harrelson, Ed Norton and Courtney Love, through a brilliant acting, confirm the adherence of their country to the highest standards of democracy and freedom: Mr. Flynt, convicted initially, was eventually acquitted on appeal by the US Supreme Court. It's a State thinking, and it's democratic. Often the people reluctantly agree that such freedom in behaviors, speeches, etc is essential for democracy. At the same time, deeply in their hearts they don't want such freedom. Apparently, this split of personality for the intellectual part of the society is unavoidable, but one has to remember that it's a price you have to pay for democracy, with all possible further consequences and feedbacks, which are to be mostly positive, and for your benefit in a long run and in a wider understanding. In many other countries the process of acknowledging the democratic valuables would possibly be even more difficult to proceed with.The film is not about pornography. It is also least important who was Larry Flynt and was he beloved by the people in real life or not. To be focused on this means not to be able (or not willing) to understand the film and its main concept. The real names and partly the real histories in the movie are shown only for giving the film more authenticity.It is a powerful movie, excellent in every direction, praising freedom and democracy, and in this sense it is a typical Milos Forman film with thematic links to his other outstanding movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most important film of the 90's ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A few years ago, I went to a DVD grocery store, eager to buy Tex Avery's collector DVD box, featuring all his hilarious MGM cartoons. Two cartoons were missing though and I found out they were banned because of racial stereotypes' portrayals on black people, and that they would never be put on DVD, or TV again, despite all the fans' protests and all the petitions: these cartoons were judged too offensive. No offense, but this is just bullshit, the only word to describe this is censorship: pure and simple. And in 2004, its reign of terror wasn't over yet ?I'm evoking this anecdote just to highlight the sad reality that we still live in a world governed by a scandalous hypocrisy disguising censorship under the mask of political correctness. Lenny Bruce was censored because of his use of profanity and Larry Flynt for his pornographic images. Now that the Internet trivialized sex, the new taboo is communities. The 21st century is religious, racial, sectary and unfortunately, the fight featured in "The People vs. Larry Flynt" had only changed the field. The War is not over; the nonsense is still governing non-independent media, and we're still brainwashed ?This is why "The People vs. Larry Flynt" is probably one of the most important films of the last two decades. It reveals the disastrous sickness that poisons America and Occidental counties in general: Political Correctness, the new dictatorship against every single principle that makes freedom of speech applicable. The message could be summarized in a simple point, in the case of absence of malice, one should make fun, mock, ridicule whatever people, institution, he or she desires. It's not up to the offender to anticipate the harm he will cause, it's up to the offended to accept the idea that whatever allowed one to talk against him, it will allow him to retort, in a satirical, serious or whatever tone he chooses to use. In one word: it's called tolerance.That's exactly why "The People vs. Larry Flynt" is not just a pamphlet written by Milos Forman using profanity, sex, lust, and nudity as so many punctuation marks. It's an inspirational message inviting us to question our approach to tolerance, and not in a preachy way. Larry Flynt is not a model, he's a dirty mind, but as he says, "he's the worst" and as the worst, he'll be the perfect thermometer to measure the acceptance of a country when it comes to the use of humor. But as I also stated in a previous review of Fosse's "Lenny", any simple form of thought is necessarily subversive. Any artistic creation offends a certain established order, otherwise, it's just creation but not Art. Larry Flynt offended, he broke a new taboo, but have we all forgotten that many today's standards were yesterday's taboos?! The philosophical value of "The People vs. Larry Flynt" is undeniable but I guess people were blinded by the profusion of nudity and lust at a point they didn't get how the film is incredibly brilliant in the demonstrations it tries to make ... sometimes in an explicitness I would have judged extreme if the course of the recent events hadn't proved how the point of the film was totally missed. Flynt paved the way to a certain philosophy of freedom that could allow many irreverent entertainers to undermine the image of sacred public, figures or institutions and even, for our delight, respectable cultural figures. But, there's more to that -something that'll make me venerate the film forever- it's the denunciation of an extreme contradiction that could threaten the application of freedom in a whole country: nothing is sacred enough not to be turned into derision. And if one thing shall be sacred, it's this principle.The title sets the mood of the film which is an endless fight through so many judiciary cases involving the 'good people' and Larry Flynt, another title could have been "Larry Flynt, Public Enemy N°1" but this would have been wrong as Flynt had some fans interested on boobs, vagina, and fornication. And in a way, Flynt had done a great service to his country by desensitizing them about the dirtiness of sex. While many citizens were brainwashed to believe that Wars make heroes, in one of the most obscene masquerades that lead American to an humiliating defeat in Nam, Flynt unmasked the ugly face of American pride to reconcile it, with stuff that reaches a lower level ... only to prove there's no reason to feel guilty about loving harmless stuff just because good society says so. Especially when desensitization from violence can have even more devastating effects.And on a technical level, "The People vs. Larry Flynt" is certainly one of the most brilliant scripts ever written swinging between an outrageous and a thought-provoking tone until getting to its point, which is the inspirational denunciation of the hypocrisy governing our world. And freedom of laughing is indeed a way to fight taboos by their own weapons. I did not take Woody Harrelson seriously in the first notes of this brilliant symphony but how wrong I was, he was quite perfect in that role, and I can't go without mentioning Edward Norton as the struggling personal attorney Alan Isaacman, and to conclude Courtney Love in what I consider one of the greatest female performances ever, and I say it again, ONE OF THE GREATEST FEMALE PERFORMANCES EVER, I wonder how she didn't get and win an Oscar. Too trashy? Gimme a break, her devotion and sincere true love towards her husband made Larry's fight so endearing, she was the soul and heart of this film, while Norton was the brain. And Larry was the guts, that despite a tragic handicap was an inspiration to every citizen, to believe in his right to please his basic instincts ... it's basic principles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK as entertainment, but there's less to it than meets the eye...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's the problem and it's one which is often shared by many other films. The People v. Larry Flynt is well-made, well-directed, well-acted, a great deal of care has been given producing it and, finally, it is entertaining. But is it a good film? Well, yes in one sense, but no, not really, in another. And the reason for that is the theme and subject matter which this film chooses to cover. As has been remarked elsewhere in these viewers' reviews, the portrayal of Larry Flynt has been idealised a great deal. Here he comes across as a good ole' boy, not above a little innocent mischief-making. What is not shown, though neither is it denied, is the intensely graphic nature of the pornography he produced (which, though, incidentally, is far surpassed in 2008 and might even seem a little tame by modern standards). Flynt's life story has also been re-written: in in real life he was married several times and, most importantly, he has five children, yet no mention is made of this in the film. Furthermore, the truth of how Flynt developed from an innocuous owner of several bars, to starting his porn empire is also somewhat syncopated and, if anything, the truth is more interesting. Is this important? Not particularly - after all, the producers are making a film, which at the end of the day is a piece of fiction based on fact. Yet this film, starting with its title, gives the impression of wanting to see itself as more than just a biopic. It seems to see itself as portraying how a landmark Supreme Court ruling was reached and, in a sense, even regards itself as a part of that process. That a pornographer of the most extreme sort should prove to be the vehicle by which a democratic freedom is not only re-established but strengthened adds a kind of piquant irony. However, if the film, for artistic reasons, allows itself to play fast and loose with the facts. Another example: Alan Isaacman is shown to first link up with Flynt as a rookie lawyer whose only experience is in public defending. In fact, he wasn't hired by Flynt until much later in the careers of both men according to the accompanying bio of Flynt on the DVD. Does that matter? Well, the battle which eventually went to the Supreme Court needed a talented lawyer like Isaacman just as much as it needed a stubborn man like Flynt, so I would suggest that it does matter. Just how much can this film be trusted and how seriously can we take it when it recounts the battle to bolster the free speech? Not a great deal, in my opinion. That battle - especially because of the irony that it was the smutty, nasty pornographer Larry Flynt who was its main protagonist - deserves a far weightier film and far weightier treatment than this film. To put it bluntly, it's all a bit lightweight. Whether or not, given the subject matter, that bothers you or not is up to you, but I must say, it bothered me. I saw this film on DVD which came with various special features, including a reasonably straightforward biography of Larry Flynt. He comes across as an intelligent, in many ways thoughtful and self-aware man with a well-defined sense of humour. It's just a shame that the film was not able to treat his story with much more of the same virtues. Having said that, The People v. Larry Flynt is entertaining and so you won't feel you have wasted your time watching. But don't expect anything more than a very well-made TV movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw The People v. Larry Flynt in my Modern Constitutinal Law class and I am thoroughly impressed with Mr. Flynts gumption and his lawyers tenacity. The added bonus, my personal favorite, is the unique love and togetherness Mr. Flynt shared with his wife Althea. The way they loved each other is not my business (or anyone else's), however, they taught me that TRUE love transcends ones faults and frailties.Thank you Mr. Flynt, sharing your life has taught me a great deal and has truly enhanced my life.In closing, I am a Christian, I feel very badly and I humbly, sincerely apologize that you've had an extremely unpleasant experience that propelled you to renounce Christ.

		<shortDescription>A lot better than you might expect.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The People vs. Larry Flynt is one of those movies that you just expect to be full of tasteless and unnecessary nudity, but that turns out to take itself a lot more serious than that and ends up being a lot more respectable in the end, kind of like Boogie Nights and not like the Howard Stern movie. Of course, Howard Stern's Private Parts is in a whole separate category from movies like Boogie Nights and The People vs. Larry Flynt. You can tell just from the title that the Howard Stern movie does not expect to be taken seriously. Howard wants to tell his story in the same 4th-grade humor way that he runs his radio show, but The People vs. Larry Flynt is a movie that wants to tell the story of Larry Flynt in a way that presents his life and his struggles with the religious and moral right in a much more serious way.Sure, he wears to court everything from diapers made of the American flag to t-shirts that say `F*CK THIS COURT,' and does everything from spitting water everywhere to throwing oranges at the judge, but at the same time, the movie as a whole takes the story that it's telling very seriously, which is what makes this such a good film. Larry Flynt, as is one of the overall points of the entire film, is not what every American citizen would call an admirable man, but he is protected under the Constitution of the United States just as much as everyone else is. What we get in this film is the story of Flynt's struggle to prove that he has the right to say and do something that another person or group of people might not like or may find offensive. The film argues through the story of Larry Flynt against censorship and for the right to choose for ourselves. That is a fundamental right promised to Americans under the constitution, and Larry Flynt's profession tests the limits of that law.Besides being a look into the true workings and limits of the Constitution, the film presents a much more in-depth look into the life of Larry Flynt himself than just about anyone would otherwise have seen. This is a complex man that has had a rough life, and whether you agree with his lifestyle and his products or not, it sucks to realize that he's been through so much and is still seen by the American public in such a negative way. This man was shot by a sniper and confined to a wheelchair for the rest of his life, and the only thing that most people think about him is that he's the biggest pervert in the country because he makes his living selling pornography. I have no sympathy for him being considered a pervert, because if I learned anything about him from this movie, it's that it doesn't bother him in the slightest to be considered a pervert, but no one should have to be stuck in a wheelchair. Just wondering my entire life who did it would be enough to drive me insane. It's not easy to make a good legal thriller. I wouldn't exactly call The People vs. Larry Flynt a legal thriller, but there is definitely a lot of thrilling legal content in the film. Edward Norton's role as Flynt's attorney, Alan Isaacman, doesn't even begin to compare to some of his later roles (such as his towering performances in movies like American History X and Primal Fear), but he successfully captures the young attorney who has found himself involved with an out of control client who behaves like he's above the law throughout much of his legal proceedings. Courtney Love delivers a shockingly convincing performance as Althea Flynt, Larry's increasingly sickly wife, showing the world that she has some talent as an actor and is not just trying to make up for her lack of much talent as a musician. The People vs. Larry Flynt is not a curiosity piece just because it deals with such a powerful and famous pornographer, but is rather a fascinating biography of this man mixed with the presentation of his involvement with American laws and politics. As Flynt states in the film just before the final verdict is released, `If the First Amendment will protect me, then it will protect all of you. Because I'm the worst.' Maybe not the most eloquent or noble thing to say, but it's definitely true.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinatingly captures the bizarre events of Flynt's life, but a bit jumbled as a whole</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The life of Hustler publisher Larry Flynt has almost too much good material. It's one thing to grow up selling moonshine, buy up some strip clubs and launch one of the most explicit pornography magazines ever created. It's another to also be a one-time born-again Christian, bipolar painkiller addict and the unsuspecting bastion of First Amendment liberties. As such, watching "The People vs. Larry Flynt" is like watching at least three different movies: You have the rise of the boundary-pushing magazine editor, the drug-addled romance and the courtroom drama. So many events in Flynt's life and facets to his personality warrant a deeper look, yet there's just no time. Writers Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewksi and of course two-time Oscar-winning director Milos Foreman make the most of each part, but the whole product lacks the unity of a masterful biography.At the time, Woody Harrelson proved a curious choice to play Flynt, but he nails the bipolar aspects of the master pornographer. We have so much trouble determining his motives, digging for some sign of logical thought. In most cases, this makes for a frustrating case study, for which you might normally blame the actor for not taking us deep enough. Considering how the film jumps from one aspect of Flynt's life to the next in addition to how completely unpredictable of a character he is, Harrelson deserves praise. He keeps you on your toes like the crazy uncle who jokes so much you can't tell when he's really serious.Then there's Courtney Love. Playing Flynt's stripper girlfriend-turned-wife, Althea, Love gives Foreman more than he bargained for. Hiring a drug addict to play a drug addict is a dangerous game, and not when it comes to working with that person. It's tough to divorce love from Althea, such a controversial public figure at the time and even to some extent to this day. She's frighteningly real as Althea at some points, especially once she starts mooching off Flynt's painkillers after the assassination attempt.Some of the most compelling drama in the film comes in the courtroom scenes. Those fascinated to any extent with free speech law and censorship will crave more from "The People vs. Larry Flynt," especially when the title seems to promise it in higher doses. Edward Norton nabbed a career-making role as Flynt's attorney, Alan Isaacman. Getting noticed by Milos Foreman and Woody Allen ("Everyone Says I Love You") at the same time is pretty impressive. He delivers an expert closing argument in the film's first trial that will have you convinced he wins the case, as well as a powerful yet light-hearted opening speech in the Supreme Court's hearing of the infamous Flynt vs. Falwell case, a landmark win for First Amendment rights."The People vs. Larry Flynt" touches on so many fascinating aspects of this enigmatic figure, but it sacrifices some depth and consequently the emotional pull. Flynt's life blurs by, and though the writing compensates with some nice transitions, there's no substitute for getting Q.T. with Flynt. The Hustler empire appears to be built in a day a scene in which Flynt tells a photographer that "a woman's vagina has as much personality as her face" is the most insight we get into his mind as editor. Good writing there, but a fleeting moment in the bigger picture.The second half of the film, essentially Larry's life after becoming a paraplegic, feels so radically different. Larry's stroke garbles his speech and Althea's addiction has her looking like a flying monkey in the "Wizard of Oz." Two people who once seemed to have their wits about them become such filthy and disturbed characters. At that point you start to identify with Norton's character instead, as he's the only one who understands the balance between defending free speech and making a complete mockery of the judicial system.You'll want this film to be more of everything, particularly of Flynt as the unorthodox crusader for free speech and the magazine publisher who works the line between genius and insanity. The individual moments or scenes of such captivate, but get lost on the whole. The challenge of boiling a fascinating man's life down to a series of striking moments can sometimes be too immense for even the best of filmmakers.~Steven CThanks for reading!

		<shortDescription>Good Account Of A Bizarre And Contradictory Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is most certainly an interesting account of the life of Larry Flynt - the publisher of Hustler Magazine, perhaps the trashiest "mainstream" porn magazine ever published. Beginning with Flynt as a boy selling moonshine to his neighbours, the movie ends with Flynt triumphing over the Reverend Jerry Falwell in a case before the United States Supreme Court. What we see between these two events is disturbing, shocking and sometimes even funny. Flynt is anything but an attractive personality. Evolving from the owner of struggling strip club to a millionaire porn merchant, I suppose one has to respect the man for his ability to achieve his dreams and the triumph against the odds, but the "me against the world" persona wears thin after a while. Flynt comes across through most of this as self-absorbed. He claims to be fighting for the freedom of speech, but one really has the feeling that he's fighting for it not for the sake of anyone but himself. I didn't get the sense from this movie that Flynt had any sort of "greater good" at the forefront of his thoughts, although in fairness he has remained active in this area. There's an interesting look at his temporary conversion to Christianity, and his growing relationship with Ruth Carter Stapleton (Jimmy Carter's sister) who converted him to Christianity, which becomes quite humorous as he struggles within himself to reconcile his newfound faith with his work as a porn publisher. The movie also deals with his rejection of that faith and increasing bitterness after the shooting that left him paralyzed. There's great emphasis placed on his personal life and in particular with his wife Althea, who became a drug addict and an AIDS victim. (Interestingly, there's no reference to the fact that she was his fourth wife.)There are some great performances in this. Woody Harrelson offers a superb portrayal of Flynt (perhaps Harrelson's best acting) - sometimes in total control, other times totally out of control. Courtney Love was totally believable as Althea - devoted to Flynt but rapidly spiralling out of control herself. Edward Norton was fine as Flynt's long- suffering attorney Allan Isaacson. Flynt actually appears in this movie as the judge at his own first trial (at least the first one portrayed in the movie) in Cincinnati.Still, this is a difficult movie. It's fascinating for a while, but becomes a bit tiresome and repetitive after a while. Flynt repeats the same antics over and over again and after a while they lose their impact. The lead up to the court fight against Falwell - who sued him for libel for a satirical article in Hustler that accused him of incest - took up a lot of time, but it was hard to feel passion about it. Neither party is particularly attractive to me. Personally, I think Flynt's depiction of Falwell as a hypocrite was bang-on, but Flynt himself is just not a likable person, and it's hard to root for him against anyone - even Falwell. This is a good account of a life that would have to be described in many contradictory ways: a success story, but a very sad one. The guy who pushes the envelope beyond the breaking point but then objects when anyone pushes back. The guy who stands up for free speech and ends up front and centre in the midst of the battle, except that you kind of wish he wouldn't exercise it for himself. He's a strange guy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Patriotic Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The rise of Larry Flynt from a little moonshiner to big time smut peddler is interesting if not a fascinating story. Larry Flynt shows himself as a visionary business man who's willing to fight for his right to run his porn business in the face of some powerful opposition as he pushes the limits of what is socially acceptable.The story goes thru the up's and down's of Larry's life as he gets charged with indecency and his business seem's to barely survive these problems. He gets the high profile nude pictures of Jacky O' and hits the jack pot, but not without trouble from moral hypocrites like Keating that seek to undermine his magazine.His problem with Jerry 'Fartwell', a famous preacher,was pretty amusing as HUSTLER magazine decides to run a very sexually lurid, yet obviously fictitious story about him. Jerry decides to sue him for personal distress and Larry counter sues as a result of his story being re-printed and re-distributed without his copyright permission. Larry loses in court and pays him 200k, but then goes after him again in the Supreme Court.This movie was aimed to entertain as far as I can see, and I don't know how realistic this portrayal of Larry Flynt is, but I can say that I was entertained by lots of good lines, dialog and storyline that kept me interested.'Woody' plays a great portrayal of Larry, and Courtney also performs well, especially as she spirals into a convincing drug addict.This movie was well made and should appeal to anyone with even a remote interest in protecting civil liberties.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It seems that most people who hate Larry Flynt give this a negative review and most who like him give it a positive one.In truth, this isn't a bad film but has nothing special about it either. Taken as a documentary it's interesting enough. But as a film it's not as provocative or as powerful as it should be. Even the sniper attempt, which could've been riveting, fell flat. The writing, directing, acting, editing - the entire project seems very half-baked, even down right bad at points. It's very dull, straightforward and never really takes off. The choral baptism scenes are so out of place - Forman is clearly still living in the shadow of Amadeus.To see what this could've been like, check out Oliver Stone's JFK and Jim Sheridan's In the Name of the Father.</fullReview>

Anyone who's even glanced at a copy of Hustler knows that girls showing their "you-know-whats" is not the only thing that's offensive about it. The magazine is filled with racist and sexist cartoons and jokes that the movie conveniently never mentioned. Also, I'm not a big Jerry Falwell fan, but could they have villified this guy any more? What is the movie saying? If you are a reprehensible human being you deserve to be made fun of? They play the sympathy card enough with Flint (who had sex with a chicken, "not that there's anything wrong with that") that you consider him the hero and never truly question "Should he be allowed to do that?" This movie is just a white wash of Flint's questionable actions during his prolific career filled with melodrama and devoid of meaning.BOMB out of FIVE STARS</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An enemy of an enemy is...Larry Flynt?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's face it, this film exists not because Larry Flynt is such a swell guy, but because Jerry Falwell isn't.Flynt is a liberal's nightmare: first off, he is a white male, the personification of evil to the left, but more than that he is a capitalist who has made his wealth exploiting women as sex objects and by preying on the lower classes, both as fodder for his pictorials and as patrons of his pages. But, it is the convention of modern film that in order to justify glorifying a bad person, one has to come up with a person who is even worse to serve as an adversary. Falwell is a conservative, a Christian minister and a white male capitalist. In the strange thinking of liberalism, that makes him infinitely worse than Flynt. One of the film's many perverse messages is that Flynt may be the scum of the earth, but, golly-gee, at least he's not a TV evangelist.But even so, the makers of THE PEOPLE VS. LARRY FLYNT have to bend over backwards and tie themselves into knots in order to somehow rationalized portraying Flynt as a great American hero. Merely serving up Falwell as their satanic villain isn't enough, so they skim over Flynt's worse qualities, give him a makeover as a jovial jokester and try desperately to make him seem like a crusader for civil rights. It is amazing how completely some people will sell out their beliefs for a fleeting public relations coup.The film, while slickly made, does a rather poor job of explaining the true confrontation between Jerry and Larry; keeping the drama at an us-vs.-them level makes it easier to ignore all the reasons that they should consider Flynt to be part of "them," not one of "us."Larry deals in porn. Jerry publicly denounced Larry for dealing in porn. To get revenge, Larry published a satire in "Hustler" magazine implying that Jerry had drunken, incestuous sex with his own mother in an outhouse. Jerry -- justifiably insulted -- sued for defamation. Larry won the case, because Jerry is a public figure, satire is protected speech and because the lies that Larry printed were so over the top that no one in their right mind would believe them anyway. Even so, Jerry was awarded damages for defamation. Larry won the case, but was punished anyway. The ensuing case was not about freedom of the press, as the film implied, but on a secondary issue involving how openly dishonest the press can be and not be held accountable.The irony is that while the left gathered around Flynt during and after the trial, showering him with praise and rose petals, his battle for civil liberties was as bogus as his satirical attack on Falwell. The film argues that by securing Flynt's rights, the courts have secured the rights of everybody. Truth is, it is the other way around: because everybody else has fundamental rights to free speech, so must Flynt. He did not lead the way, he rode to victory on the coattails of others.If anything, Flynt should be a hero for the right: His battle was for capitalistic rights. He wanted to sell an inferior, defective product to any sucker stupid enough to pay for it, without expecting to be held responsible. The product just happened to be a magazine, and therefore it is singled out in the Constitution for special protection. He was fighting for freedom of the press only because that is where his money came from. He was not a crusader for political, philosophical or even sexual freedom, but for economic advancement.In theory, Flynt's victory should make the world a better place; in practice, it probably won't. It was more a victory for those who would happily abuse press freedom, not those who would cherish it.So be it. But, had the plaintiff in the original case been anyone other than Falwell, this film likely would not have come about. An enemy of my enemy is my friend, so the logic goes. Flynt beat Falwell, so the film co-opted Flynt as a way to gloat over Falwell's loss. Had Flynt used his magazine to defame someone else, like, say, The Reverend Jesse Jackson, even with the same outcome, I doubt that the filmmakers would have wanted to waste their time deifying Flynt.I am not an admirer of Falwell or his politics. Nor, for that matter, am I an admirer of Flynt and his ilk. But in this case, I think Falwell was right ethically and morally, while Flynt was legally in the right. Oddly, the losers in this case are the American people who have even less protection from the type of "humor" that amuses Flynt.The one good thing from the controversy is this film. Director Milos Foreman and company have put together a colorful and amusing slice of history. How historically accurate it is, is anybody guess. But then again, truth and honesty were never one of Flynt's big concerns either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible Film. Why Did This Film Have To Be Made?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another film about sexually-perverted, drug addicted not-normal people who reach success. This is very rare however. The only normal people who are in this film is Edward Norton's character, reporters and The Supreme Court. This is a bad film. Why did this story have to be told? Why make this a film? With all due respect to Mr. Larry Flynt, I am not against the publishing of his Hustler publications. Who hasn't read or looked at the magazine a time or two. The magazine clearly is for adults only. You buy it or read it by choice. I myself have seen the Jackie O. pictorials and the "George"/"Georgine" from England pictorials when I was young. But minors should not see the publications nor this film. Definately for mature adults only. Edward Norton offers a fine performance in this film. I was not impressed with Woody H. nor Courtney Love as I feel it was not acting on thier part. They were just playing themselves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Only Thing Worthwhile About This Movie Is The Importance Of Rights As Americans!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only thing I thought was worthwhile about this film was The Importance Of Our Rights As Americans! Other then that this film is pure trash. Larry Flynt is nothing but a primitive scumbag.Larry is a pig who writes obscene literature and obscene photographs. I would not buy Hustler magazine if you paid me. Larry thinks he can make his own rules and that he does not have to follow the laws of the land. I especially hated it when that photo of Santa Claus is shown. This is disgusting literature that even for porn is unacceptable. I sure as hell hope he never had kids. He should have just stuck to managing strip clubs and joints.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No wonder many Americans feel Hollywood hates our country</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remembered when this film came out how the film reviewers nearly orgasmed (this word is fitting based on the movie in question) when lauding The People vs. Larry Flint. Huh?! Raising a dirty little lecher to hero status?! Come off it--there are millions of Americans infinitely more deserving of praise!! A hero for his love of the first amendment?! Come on, Flint just wants to make money---period. If he thought it would pay, he'd feature necrophilia or child porn in Hustler. He is certainly no hero. If this is their vision of heroism, then I can see why Hollywood always seems to be out of step with the nation.Since this movie raises Larry Flint to hero status, maybe the studio might want to try the same with Jeffrey Dahmer, Joseph Stalin or even John Wayne Gacy.</fullReview>
