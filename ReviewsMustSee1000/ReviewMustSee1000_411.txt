		<shortDescription>Different movie than the trailer...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought I went to go see Paranormal Activity 3... you know, like the one in the trailer with a seance gone brutally wrong, house on fire, jumping girls from the upper story, medium coming to rid the house of bad spirits, closet ghost knocking games, crying girls huddled in cars, mom being flown out of bedroom, and water being thrown on a ghost to reveal that its shape is actually there. But no, I ended up seeing a crappy excuse for producers thinking they are being creative and edgy by changing it from the trailer and making it a story about satanic women rituals. I've already seen that horrible remake. I wanted to see a Paranormal Activity, not "The Wicker Man / The Last Exorcism".I hope someone sues the creators for false advertising by not making ANY scenes from the trailer into the final cut. That honestly makes me mad. The Paranormal movies were made on the premise of being about a haunting of demons; adding in the "cult" aspect just changes things. We were drawn in on the fear of the supernatural, not satanic women. I want to see the movie from the trailer, not what they decided was the best and scariest cut for theaters, because that version was terrible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Couldn't believe this.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not a professional critic, nor am i a critic in a general circumstance. But after watching this film it really inspired me to create an account on this site to express my views and opinions.Well i understood the story line of this film and thought it could be a great concept, going back to before all the shenanigans of the first and second paranormal activity to when Katie and Kristi were children who are influenced highly by a spirit called "Tobi". Which in turn gave me great expectations for this film, i was terribly mistaken. The first hour of this film is filled with nothing more than the usual scare tactic employed in the last 2 films which does work to a certain degree but also grows old very quickly as its all be done before in the last 2 films. A slight mix up was the camera attached to a fan trick, which i did find a good idea although even that wore thin. Also took away from the fear aspect of the film was the comedy factor which they seemed to incorporate which personally i believe has no place in the PA films. I also thought that the scene in the kitchen was a ridiculous play on the scene in the 2nd PA, could have been a bit more creative there.After the first hour passed i believed the film was beginning to pick up and bit and actually had me frightened for a short period of time. Before i continue after this is a SPOILER!!. Why this film turned into somewhat of a cult film was beyond a joke. It completely took away from the main isolated fear aspect that the film was famous for. The ending was completely ridiculous leaving and unbelievable amount of questions unanswered.1. Where does it show you anything to do with the house burning down?2. Why weren't any of the clips in the trailers in the actual feature?3. It never explains what the entity actually is?4. How did the mother actually die in the film? And where does it show that she is actually dead at the top of the staircase?5. Why does the ghost haunt the children although it is meant to haunt the first born son?6. Where did a cult ever play a part in any of the other films?All in all this film was a complete let down, and i wouldn't recommend anyone to pay any amount of money to go and view this, even just to understand the story its not worth seeing, as it does not answer any of this.P.S as well as all of this, the reaction of the people in the cinema watching this took away from the fear as a lot of laughs were had.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only if you liked the first two.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of Paranormal Activity 3, I can tell you this much: Chances are, if the first one didn't do much for you and you found the second one to be kind of blah and repetitive, there's no way you'll like the third one. That's a fact. The setup and premise are familiar, even if the characters are not. So as such, I can understand someone's not liking this one much at all. But. I personally found the first and second ones to be pretty scary ? even when, in the second one, I knew stuff was going to happen. It has to be a good film when you're surprised even when you expect something, right? So, right or wrong, I loved this movie. It gave me what I was seeking, and more.Whereas the second film was set shortly before the first one, this film takes a look at the childhood of Katie, the protagonist of the first film. You may recall that as the first movie progressed, Katie became convinced that something was after her specifically ? but she couldn't imagine why. This movie attempts to resolve that issue. And you sort of have to give credit to a movie that resolves some things while leaving other threads dangling just enough to make one wonder what the hey is going on.It's 1988. Young Katie lives with her younger sister Kristi, her mom Julie, and Julie's boyfriend Dennis. Strange things are afoot in their house, around the same time that young Kristi begins communicating with an imaginary friend named Toby. Is it a normal kid phase, or is it something more sinister? As with the other films, cameras are placed around the house to capture anything odd that may happen during the night. (In a clever bit of ingenuity, Dennis takes apart an oscillating fan and places a camera on it so that he can pan from living room to kitchen and back.)What makes a movie like this work for me is the same thing that made The Blair Witch Project work (and its sequel not work at all) ? it feels voyeuristic, as if we were simply peeking in on some family's everyday lives. Reasons are given for the constant filming (Dennis tells Kristi, for example, that he's "testing" his new camera as they have a tea party.) We're automatically drawn to the video footage. What will we see? We're now ready for something ? will it jump out at us? Will furniture be overturned? Or something even worse?The mood is another huge selling point. People react as you'd expect them to. Dennis is obsessed with finding out what's causing those noises and other disturbances; Julie thinks he's completely off his rocker and becomes more testy as time goes by. People who also experience the occurrences, like a babysitter and a friend of Dennis, are stunned to the point of not wishing to discuss the matter further, hurriedly leaving as soon as possible.Now, I can't say that everyone, even those who love to be scared, is going to love this as much as I did. For me, since we see almost everything through the lens of a camera, the terror ? and the anticipation ? are grossly heightened. When that door is opened, what will we find? It's not going to be pretty, but unlike a standard horror film where one can simply slough off a shock as being too fantastic, here we're so easily drawn in by and engaged with our surrogate family that we feel as terrified and mystified as they do.Paranormal Activity 3 won't answer everything that the first two may have left unsolved, but it does offer hints as to why, in the present day, these events are still occurring to Katie and her family. We see a part of that genesis, and it's not really what I expected. I was unsettled and thankful I hadn't seen the movie at night. Okay, that might be a little hyperbolic, and when some of you actually watch the movie you'll laugh at me for being skittish. I don't care. I enjoyed the movie, and that's all I'm concerned with.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Herculean Waste of Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My sons and I are avid movie goers and especially like scary movies. We saw PA and PA2 together. We saw the trailer for PA3 and were ready for what looked to be a solid scary movie with some tying up of loose ends with the plot. What we found was a tired rehash of the same plot with a few new characters. The pivotal scenes from the trailer were completely absent from the movie. 1) the knocking game at the closet 2) Kristi walking along and jumping off the ledge of the girls' bedroom 3) the film of the mother watching this in horror 4) Kristi throwing water on "Toby" to show him to her mother 5) the paranormal investigator who comes to the house and has his head slammed into the table 6) the lights exploding one by one down the staircase 7) the house burning down 8) the mother being thrown back when she says she wants to leave All the scenes from the trailer that made me excited to see the movie, inexplicably absent. This movie would have been much better with these scenes added. Instead, the movie ends terribly. What could have been a real blockbuster ending, tying the three movies together, was actually a complete dud. These guys and their franchise will never see another dollar from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Long Live the Reigning King of "Gotcha!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reigning king of the "Gotcha!" moment, Paranormal Activity is back ? and though the premise may have worn thin, (how many compulsive videographers can one extended family have?) its minimalist scare tactics are as effective as ever. Scream for scream, the theater experience is without rival; hushed gasps, nervous tittering, and shrieks of surprise are empirical evidence of the films' effectiveness. Hence the backlash when Paranormal Activity hit home video: these movies cater to a crowd.A prequel of sorts, Paranormal Activity 3 rewinds the franchise to 1988, illuminating the origins of the Presence that ran amok in parts one and two. Helmed by Catfish directors Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman, the flick treads familiar territory, but keeps the audience on its toes. One of the major criticisms leveled against Oren Peli's original was its predictable cycle of daytime exposition and midnight scares. Rinse and repeat.Screenwriter Christopher B. Landon, who also wrote the underwhelming Paranormal Activity 2, does a better job this time of pitching the odd changeup. With an omnipresent atmosphere of unease, no moment feels entirely safe. And it goes without saying that the freaky stuff is much more explicitly freaky. Rest assured the Rey family doesn't own a pool, let alone a cleaning robot.Probably the single most brilliant technical addition to the Paranormal Activity repertoire is the oscillating camera. Panning ominously between kitchen and living room, the simple mechanic works like a suspense machine. Joost and Schulman certainly get their money's worth out of the gimmick, milking it for some of their whitest white-knuckle moments. Fashioned from a tabletop fan, the device is a perfect metaphor for the franchise itself: cheap, homemade, effective.But for ingenuity and inventiveness, the original is still tops. For all its merciless suspense, Paranormal Activity 3 falls back on a few too many false alarms ("Gotcha!") and bad payoffs, and offers no real innovations in imagery. From Poltergeist to The Exorcist, it's easy to tell where the directors pulled inspiration, almost copy-and-pasting classic moments into the found footage aesthetic.Then again, anyone expecting real innovation from the third Paranormal Activity film is barking up the wrong tree. Part of the fun is how loosely defined the abilities of the otherworldly antagonist are. It possesses, communicates, and manipulates. But wait, there's more! Paranormal Activity 3 plays like a grab bag of horror ideas and iconography. Like any grab bag, not everything inside is interesting.For one, hand-held footage plays a more prominent role than ever, which strains the believability of some key sequences. Then there's hokey filler like the "Bloody Mary" urban legend, which squarely fills the vacancy left by the Ouija board on the Paranormal Activity blueprint. And who could forget Randy (Dustin Ingram) and his transparent, annoying attempts at comic relief?Paranormal Activity 3 doesn't reinvent the franchise. It's not even the best Paranormal Activity film. It doesn't need to be. Its aim is to refine the series' mechanics and reinvigorate audience interest, and it succeeds. So what's next? Likely what keeps Paramount executives up at night is how to squeeze the supernatural saga for every penny it's worth. Long live the reigning king of "Gotcha!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So scary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Never so quickly have I seen a franchise get whored out in Hollywood. A couple of years ago the world was hit with Paranormal Activity, making you wonder what happens when you're asleep. It's the most successful independent movie ever, with a small budget of fifteen thousand and making over a hundred million is just incredible. But with big hype comes a lot of back lash. I personally loved that film and it's one of my favorite horror movies, taking the simplicity of what's in the dark fears from our childhood and making our imaginations go crazy. Since the film was a huge success, Hollywood naturally called on a sequel. Paranormal Activity 2 was released a year later, pretty much claiming the Saw franchise money. Paranormal Activity 2 was an alright film, it wasn't as scary because we knew what to expect and with bigger budget the effects could be a little too over the top at times. Paranormal Activity 3 was advertised and I was thinking that this film was a mistake, but I was just curious where they were taking the story so I saw it opening night and this film blew me away. What a scary movie and so perfect to add to the franchise making me want plenty more.In 1988, young Katie and Kristi live with their mother, Julie, and her boyfriend, Dennis. Kristi begins interacting with an invisible friend named Toby. Dennis notices that since Kristi's friend appeared, strange things have been happening in the house. While reviewing some footage later, Dennis notices a strange incident with presence being shown on camera. He invites his friend Randy over to view the footage, who suggests that Dennis place cameras throughout the house to capture any other incidents. After more disturbed nights and strange occurrences, Dennis discovers a strange symbol in the girls' closet. He finds the same symbol on a picture of women in a book about mysticism. Dennis explains to Julie that the symbol belonged to a witches coven that brainwashed young girls into having sons. Thus explaining more about the two previous films.A couple of flaws with the film being that one being based in 1988, the film sure does look very crisp with it's picture. Wonder where the guy got his video, obviously not Wal Mart. Secondly, there are still some questions left unanswered, maybe due to the overwhelming success of the first film the writers had to do what they could with Katie's story. Only explanation being in this film is that the cult brainwashes people, so maybe Katie and Kristi had a different story in the previous films due to the spell. However, this film scared the heck out of me, which takes a lot. The beginning does start off a little silly to me, since again, you know what is going to happen. But not even 25 minutes into the film, it does pick up again. The last fifteen minutes had me frozen to my seat. A lot of people are complaining that the trailer has completely different scenes than from the movie, I personally like it that way because it keeps the film fresh and has you guessing. The "bloody Mary" scene in the film is much more scary than in the trailer in my opinion. Paranormal Activity 3 really did raise the bar and I'm so glad. The characters a likable and the effects are actually top notch and done effectively. There's a scene with the babysitter where the demon is wearing a blanket and is standing right behind her, believe me you'll have such major goose bumps from that scene. If you like scary movies, you're going to love this film, I can't wait for the fourth one and I'm glad that we finally went back to the basics of a good ghost story. Though my suggestions to the characters: stop filming the demon! That's obviously ticking him off.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delivering The Scares</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be honest, I never liked Paranormal Activity movies. It's about people who lived in a house with cameras and there are evil spirits haunting them then all of the events are caught on tape. The idea is interesting but the execution always end up being unsatisfying. Paranormal Activity 3 is the very beginning of the series. It's not actually a prequel. It's more of a backward trilogy to make the ending of the rest of the Paranormal Activity films mysterious. Although, the twist is a little bit predictable but Paranormal Activity 3 has a decent story to tell with these found footage. And it really has the scares. Finally, this series has a genuine scare.Paranormal Activity 3 reveals all the mysteries of the first two movies. Unlike the first two, instead of watching the lives of these people and wait for the spirits to come out, this one really tells a story through the videos. The story is not anything new though but the execution is decent. The second Paranormal Activity narrates almost everything in the story. Here you don't need it, you just have to look at the video footage to know the story.Aside from its storytelling, Paranormal Activity is all about the scares. They improved the scares by moderating the slow burns and keep the objects floating. The ghosts aren't quite invisible like the first two. Here, it's campy. You can see its shadows. And of course, there's a lot of threat from the ghost. The scares are more than just jump scares. It has more terror and gumption to the thrills which is kinda fun. The cameras are well shot. Everything is well made. But the twist remains predictable for some reason.Paranormal Activity 3 is not earning the fear anymore. It's now earning the scares. It's great to see Paranormal Activity with exact scares than wait for more than five minutes to be scared. It's not the scariest horror movie of the year but it's the best part of the series and also the most decent horror of the year. I still wanna see the parts on the trailer that wasn't show in the actual film but Paranormal Activity 3 is satisfying enough in its short runtime. Decent enough as a found-footage-horror-film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What you don't see scares you the most</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Horror movies tend to polarize opinions all the time... Far more than the majority of movie genres. What one person might find scary may be humorous to another person... So when I left the theater after a packed screening of this movie , the audience seemed pretty polarized in their opinions. It really is an example of a 'you either love it or hate it movie' (Although some people may not take either extreme which is absolutely fine) .I am one of the people who came out of the theater loving it.Paranormal Activity 3 is a prequel that goes back to the year 1988. It follows the sisters Kristi and katie (from the last 2 movie's) 18 years before the events of Paranormal activity 1. Its an origin story that gives us a little more information but still leaves us feeling confused and uneasy. The new cameraman (Dennis) acts as a foster father to Kristi and Katie (The whereabouts of the real father remains open to debate) works as a wedding moviemaker. This gives a decent enough explanation as to why he seems to have top of the range filming equipment (for the era) . His character comes across as more caring and less irritating than Micah from PA1. The Mother of Kristi and Katie (Julie)came across as caring towards her children. The children who play Kristi and Katie actually come across and fairly decent actors.The basic plot is like the last two movies. Strange occurrences are happening at the house they are staying in. Dennis out of curiosity decides to set up cameras around the house to hopefully find something unusual. The greatest improvement of this movie over the other movies is probably the pacing. I wont ruin anything (that hasn't been in the trailer at least) but the younger daughter kristi has a seemingly imaginary friend, called toby ,that she talks to at night. As the movie progresses things get out of head fairly quickly and this imaginary friends becomes something real and horrific.The movie does a good job of taking us out of our comfort zones. We feel confused and that confusion adds a sense of helplessness. While we may know the formula of the last movies we know little about the monster. What we don't see ,but know is there, usually scares us the most. The camera footage itself comes across as grainy and lower in quality than before (Again the trailer is rather misleading) . It makes it feel more authentic. While you know its not real you cant help getting sucked in by the movies world. There are also some clever shots and effects (Scenes with the oscillating camera are ingenious at times) .The main complaints that I have with the movie are that sometimes the actions of Daniel can be questionable and the ending left me feeling a little unsatisfied.That being said it doesn't detract from my own experience of the movie. I was terrified! It may not terrify some (the ratings on IMDb show some that already) but I think the best thing to do is go watch it and make up your own mind</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As I said in the title, if you enjoyed the first two films, this is well worth seeing. Yes it does re-hash some concepts from the previous two, yes there are some laughs, you may be left with some un-answered questions, and yes, a lot of the scenes from the trailer aren't in the actual film.But you know what, if you want to see a masterpiece in inventive horror, watch a DVD of The Exorcist. If you want to watch something that will scare the crap out you psychologically, watch The Ring or The Shining. This film is exactly what it says on the tin, the third installment of a pretty decent series of films.So some of the frights have been used before, they still made my heart skip a beat when they were on a big screen. And the scenes from the trailer weren't in the film itself, so what, the scenes that made up the film itself were done well. I'm guessing if you're still reading you're a fan of the first two films, if that is the case, ignore the iffy reviews and go see.If you want to be anal about trailer scenes, plot holes and "what is the answer" questions, wait for the DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not worth the admission price</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone who believes that this a good movie needs to get out more. Firstly I an not sure whether the version we got in Australia was the same as the US but 75% of the decent scenes from the trailer were not in the movie. How does that work. There was minimal effort put into this movies and it shows. You don't watch these types of movies for the acting so when the rest of the movies fails to deliver then you have a bomb. The effort to build up tension and suspense was underwhelming and it was so poor that at times I found myself laughing. How many times do people walk around their house with the light off in the middle of the night, especially when the house has a bad spirit. The failure of the wife to watch videos where it is clear that there is something going on. Give me a break. The scenes from the trailer were far more entertaining but obviously made it difficult to create a fourth movie. I recommend that if there is a directors cut with the original scenes in it, wait for it to come out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My opinion about the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hey everyone, i watched this film in the cinema today, and i have to say, it is one of the most Horrific films I've ever seen. by horrific i mean Awful. they could have made it far far better, Don't get me wrong, the film did have its moments where it made me jump, but nothing like what it was built up to be. There was parts in the Trailers which weren't in the film. Like the whole Bloody Mary scene was different, which was one of the moments i was most looking forward to. You didn't get to see what the demon looked like, they kept reusing ideas from the other two films, for instance, in paranormal activity 2 all the drawers and cupboards opened at once. Whereas in this film all the stuff in the kitchen was stuck to the ceiling and then fell to the ground with the majority of it smashing. Again this was very predictable. The majority of the audience i was with laughed at the film, there was even a girl who wasn't even phased by this so called 'horror' what was even funnier she predicted several things that happened. If you want to see this film, i would highly recommend watching it for free online something, because the film isn't worth money at all. Thanks for reading.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Demon Cometh</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am over thirty years old and I have seen a lot of horror films (including the first two Paranormal Activity films) and if you asked me what the scariest film I've ever seen is, I will search through my memory banks and pick out a film and say, "Well that was scary if that happened in real life." But not really putting the film in the same category as "hold your breath and walk out feeling drained because it scared the heck out of me" type of film. Finally, I was able to see a film that legitimately scared me, and it happens to be a third film in a franchise. Who says sequels are always bad?The film is back to being a prequel, focusing on Katie and Kristi when they were little kids. They have a skeptic mom, and a dad who looks suspiciously like Micah from the first film. He's a videographer and he likes to record things all the time (like the first two movies) and after an earthquake erupts, he discovers that an invisible figure emerges from the dust. So naturally, he wants to keep recording to find out what it is, and what he discovers is that its an invisible friend named Tobi who has some connection with the little daughters.Upon watching Paranormal Activity 3, it felt like there was a board meeting after the second film and they listened to all the bad-mouthing, spoofs, and also took in an account of what scared people (prepare for an homage of the kitchen scene of the second film) and culminated all of this together into an Alchemy Pot and born what could be the scariest film to date. The theater I saw it with was screaming at all the scary parts, especially when the demon terrorizes the little girls; all the way up to a tension filled ending that left many not wanting to look at the screen. The filmmakers knew how to use timing and tension to generate the scares, and that's really the fun of these movies. It's the tension building and the creative payoff on what they provide for scares. My friend said it best where she said, "It was like a roller coaster ride that I couldn't get out of." It's really that intense.The only thing that sucks is that some of good parts in all the trailers didn't make it to the final cut. I'm hoping for an extended release on the DVD like they did with the last film because it will make it that much more exciting. Seriously, forget your complaints from the last two films and give this film a go. There is a lot of fun to be had, and it's a great way to celebrate Halloween this year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thoughts and Opinions on PA3</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, this is my first review on IMDb. I guess I'm a long time reader, first time contributor. This movie didn't "infuriate" me enough to write my first review, it just happened that I didn't read an accurate assessment before I paid to see it and I was thoroughly disappointed. Times are tough, I don't want to waste my money on a mediocre flick. I read all reviews and watch all trailers before doling out $30 to go see a movie. So here is my assessment.I enjoyed PA1 and PA2. I care about plot development when it comes to scary flicks, but I do get enjoyment from purely frightening imagery. The trailer for PA3 is misleading. I'd say about 20% (that's being generous) of the material from the trailer actually made it into the film, and what you saw in the trailer was the scariest material.The movie started off well, sticking with exactly the same video imagery as the first two films. We're introduced to young Kristie and Katie, their mother and new stepfather, all of whom live in their family home. Several times I found myself confused at the house, it seems like they combined the house from PA1 and PA2 into one massive "super scary" house. The scares in the first half of the film are all similar to those from the first two. They're predictable, with a few jumps and jolts that were unexpected. They introduce the presence of "Tobie" who is communicating with Kristie. Mom seems to think he's just an imaginary friend, and for quite a while he seems to be just that. The relationship is seemingly harmless for the most part, albeit slightly creepy, however things start going downhill when Kristie tells the spirit (We never find out what exactly he is) to leave her alone.The movie picks up in the second half, several scares and jolts abound. However, the movie suddenly goes downhill at a rapid pace. After a few frightening incidents: kitchen scene, Katie being dragged into Tobie's hidey hole, Blood Mary scene (you aren't missing much it's nothing like the trailer) the family packs it all up and heads to grandma's house. Here things get...odd. We find out that grandma belongs to some kind of witch coven. This, however, leads to more questions than answers which is what I wanted from this movie. If you're looking for answers to any of these questions...please don't waste your money to see it in theaters:1. The house burning down? Not even addressed or covered. 2. What the heck is Tobie? A demon, a spirit? Mostly he's just an invisible pedophile. 3. Supposedly all of the family pictures and heirlooms were lost in the fire, however in the beginning Katie drops off a huge box of VHS tapes to her sister. 4. What happened to the baby from PA2? No idea, not even mentioned. 5. Did Katie and Kristie's mom have no idea about grandma's coven? Wouldn't she be involved? Clearly the little ones are. 6. Why is Tobie pestering the girls if the coven only cares about a son?My final assessment, if you're in it for shocks, scares, and jolts I'd say go see it. Make sure you keep an eye on the light bright in the girl's room, it helps you understand the ending a little bit better. There were several times I was peeking at the screen through my hands. However if you thought PA3 would answer your questions from PA1 and PA2, I'd say avoid this like the plague or wait until it comes out on Redbox. It's a great Halloween flick but it left a bad taste in my mouth. I thought this would tie it all together, but in retrospect I left confused and irritated with all the unanswered questions. Happy Haunting!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm disappointed, different movie from the trailer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The trailer convinced me to go see this flick, and I left somewhat perplexed and disappointed. Frankly, it seemed like a different movie from what was portrayed. Most of the scenes in the trailer were not in the final cut, which is a shame because the film itself felt very incomplete.Tension was built through the movie, but it felt like there was never really a climax, and that the pacing was uneven. The intensity and suspense of the movie built up well, though I can't help but feel that there were at least a couple scenes missing entirely. While the last part of the movie was without a doubt very intense, it brought absolutely no sense of resolution, and was entirely dissatisfying.It was like listening to a piece of orchestral music that dramatically builds up, but is then cut off short. Beyond that, I felt very deceived. The trailer was practically of a different film, and I feel like it was very dishonest to market it that way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The reactions to this movie are so strange. First, your opinion of the movie should not be based on its commercials. I'm guessing they didn't want to give the movie away so they showed alternate scenes or something. Regardless, it is an excellent scary movie.I think the most important thing to remember is that you need to watch this by yourself, at home, in the dark. If you have no attention span and only get freaked out by dumbed-down "gotchas" then you will probably be disappointed. Like the first two, it reminded me of being afraid of the dark when I was little. Has anyone else laid in bed at night, staring at the dark and looking for any movement? If so, then you should watch this.But if you have a loud mouth next to you who keeps talking and making comments, then the suspense will not be allowed to build. It's those silent moments when nothing is happening that make this movie truly scary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Runs In The Family</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>PA3 is a prequel to the previous two films in which we find out the origins of the paranormal entity that haunted Katie and Kristie when they were adults. It is safe to say that there will be many moments in the film that will make you jump out of your seats and make your jaw drop in pure terror.This is the third film in the successful PA franchise that has since replaced SAW as the annual Halloween event. The formula has been established, and perhaps you already know if you'll watch this film or not. However, let me say this: the trailer is misleading. If you know me, I'm very much against movie trailers that spoil almost everything, so I loved how the marketing team approached this film. About 90% of the scenes in the trailer don't appear in the film, so the scares are actually much more satisfying, effective, and shocking this way, and thank goodness for that because I felt that the trailer was way too cartoonish and cheesy.Suffice to say that this film is successful in almost every way. Because this is the third film in the series, you may think you know what's going to happen. However, the film pretty much plays against your expectations on almost everything. For example, minimalism and subtlety is pretty much thrown out the window. If you were tired of the doors opening and shutting and the lighting flickering on and off in the first two films, PA3 will show you things you would never have expected would happen in a PA film. I'm not going to lie, there are some pretty elaborate and creative scares here, and most of these scares come from the genius addition of the oscillating fan camera, in which the camera rotates left to right. This not only makes for great use of effective jump scares, but also for the building of suspense and dread as we see things the characters don't.In terms of jump scares, there are many that appear. While many people might complain about this, the film really succeeds in building up the tension that we know that something startling is going to happen, and that's what makes it so fun and unnerving to watch. This may be counterproductive because what made the first film so scary and unique (to me) is the lack of jump scares and the lack of anything elaborate in general. In PA, the simplicity is what makes it so great, relying on the viewer's imagination to create the fear so showing all these scares in PA3 pretty much goes against everything established in PA. However, I'm not going to hold this against the film because the scares are orchestrated so well with the timing and editing that it doesn't matter at that point.I also want to point out that the scares come earlier than expected. It seems as if the directors know what the audience wants, so they're giving it to them. Not only is the quantity of scares much higher than the previous two films, but the quality of them are pretty great too. There is surprisingly a lot of humor added in the film as well. The film seems self aware of itself and has some fun with it. The character development is much better here than that of the second film. The parents are good as they are, but I have to say that the two girls were pretty great. This film proves that just because there are kids in a film doesn't mean they have to be bad and annoying.The only flaw I can find about the film is the climax because it was eerily similar to another horror film that was released a couple of years ago. However, I will say that PA3's climax was very terrifying to watch. Overall, if you didn't like the first two films, you'll like this one the most. If you're a fan of the series, you'll obviously like this one. And if you want to watch things that go bump in the night, PA3 is one of the best out there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst Movie of the 3</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must have watched a totally different movie than others on here, because this movie is LAUGHABLY the worst of the series. It isn't the scariest movie ever, and the last 15 minutes didn't scar me for life. In fact, it left me annoyed that it would stray from 1. the storyline and 2. the trailer.Nothing about it was new, or scary. The only time I jumped AT ALL was when the babysitter jumped in front of the camera. Ridiculous to make the worst scare a human one in a movie about a ghost/demon. Sloppy, horribly written, boring, and far from being scary. If you are a fan of being scared or feeling uneasy, pop in the first one and don't waste your money on this lump of crap in a shiny PA package.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It makes you laugh, it makes you jump! What more do you want?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Action: 6 / 10. There's a lot of dead space where you're waiting for something to happen, and it doesn't. I suppose this sets up the times when something does happen, but when the dead space is seen by way of a jittery camera, it's tough to take.Plot: 3/10. We've seen it before both in this series and in many others. You've got your invisible poltergeist, your young child who can see it, your adults who can't and don't believe it's real...Scares / Entertainment Value: 7/10 here. This part is a tough call since what scares you might not bother me and visa versa. I will say though that it's very rare for anything of this type to catch me off guard, but this one did once so props to them for that.It was entertaining though. We went late at night and got lots of laughs and much fun commentary from the audience, but I think we had a fun group in the theater to make it happen. I didn't find it very scary, and it was rather predictable, but I guess I'd say I had fun.Duration: 5 / 10. It's pretty short by movie standards but actually right on the length of the other two. I believe it ran just shy of 90 minutes.Character development: 2/10. There was very little, and what was there was hardly made believable. In fact, it took me until an hour after I got home to recognize a couple of the movie elements and put them into place in my mind's sequencer. I guess in this kind of movie though, maybe we just want to be surprised so character development isn't a priority.Actors: No one in particular.Synopsis: My 17 year old son and I saw the movie together and had a great time. Like I said earlier, we had a fantastic audience group which really helped so if you catch it late night, it'll probably be more fun. This movie will make you laugh throughout, and there are probably half a dozen startling scenes, but for the most part they are as predictable as the rising of the sun. It is entertaining, but it's not great, and the jerky camera scenes, which accounted for about 20% of the footage, were a bit hard on the eyes. There's little depth, and the parts that were probably supposed to psych us out really weren't that threatening. The one thing that *was* truly scary -- is that it sets up a fourth movie! All things considered, I'd say it's probably worth somewhere between a 5 or a 6 so I'll give it an 6/10 just to be nice! Whatever you decide, have a great time with it, and enjoy this Halloween season!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't believe the trailers or the hype this time around</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>False advertisement is the film's biggest problem and is likely to upset a lot of fans off as it did to me and it should be illegal and considered as fraud!!!!! I don't know if they where trying to trick people to think what's going to happen to make it more suspenseful or a bad last minute decision but they took the worst possible direction ever borderline the horrible conclusion of The Last Exorcism. It had the whole feeling of tense unease going for it and a couple of cheap but clever scares and the whole planting the camera on a rotating fan is brilliant and the scariest parts of the film as well as one bedroom scene with the little girls and the clever babysitter scene but then they go to grandma's house and the direction and tone changed for the worse for me and I just didn't buy it for a second! This series use to be effective, raw and unrelenting but now it's just plain silly but the curiosity still remains with even more unanswered questions about this ghost tale that might lead to another sequel in the near future but for now I'm done with these type of movies because after this disappointing one that leaves you on a sour note this trend is fading rapidly. Another thing that it has going for it is the involvement with the audiences and knowing more than the characters making you scream at the screen waiting for something bad to happen which is more fun and playful spook this time around than being truly frightful but the acting and characters is probably the best of the series but it doesn't help the film's many problems and I'm officially Paranormal Activity out and I dare them to change my mind! Overall to basically not show anything from the trailers is criminal and a bad trick to me and shows that the directors don't give a damn about the fans and thanks for ruining a potentially good horror sequel, good job. Don't treat us fans like we are nothing we deserve better than this, shame on you guys for lying to all of us and getting away with it and shame on me for believing it, I'll learn my lesson for believing the hype! Don't waste a dime on this one! For once I believe the haters. I personally think they should be accountable for their false advertisement actions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1988, in California, the cinematographer Dennis (Chris Smith) moves to the house of his girlfriend Julie (Lauren Bittner) to raise a family with her daughters Katie ( Chloe Csengery) and Kristi (Jessica Brown). The little Kristi has an imaginary friend named Toby while weird things happen in the house. Dennis decides to place cameras in the round to capture images during the night and soon he finds that there is an entity in the house. Dennis's friend Randy Rosen (Dustin Ingram) researches the events and learns that his house might be a coven of witches and the children may be in danger."Paranormal Activity 3" is a horror movie with a senseless story. I am not fan of this franchise and the camera "? la Blair Witch Project" is irritating. However the special effects are really scary and startle the viewer along the film. The story never explains who Toby is and the conclusion is a sort of rip-off of "Rosemary's Baby" does not make any sense and spoils the movie. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): "Atividade Paranormal 3" ("Paranormal Actiivity 3")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What did I just see??!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Halloween night me and some friends thought it would be fun to see part 3 of Paranormal Activity.Going into the theatre knowing that most sequels suck, we as a group saw the trailer a month before which implied this being a original and well thought through movie.Boy, what was this a letdown! Besides the major plot holes and easy scares this movie just doesn't live up to it's predecessors. We ended up leaving the cinema with a feeling to ask for a refund (which I never, never, ever do or even think of doing)!We sat down and saw 2 trailers and all of a sudden the movie started. At some point you go back in time and that is when the true horror started... We see all these people who we don't know and these people are never properly introduced. The acting is just hideous. I never believed a thing that these people did or didn't do. The main character is a wedding filmer who likes to film himself working/editing (How many filmmakers can you have in one family?!). Naturally weird things start to happen and he decides to put up several cameras and watch what happens.We are introduced to "ghost" Toby. One of the girls can communicate with Toby. And here is where I started to think where are they going with this? Couldn't they find a better child actress for this role? The way the 2 girls act is just not believable and looks directed. When the girl is talking to Toby for the first time, I started laughing. A scene which is supposed to be really scary just turned into pure comedy for me and at that point I've lost interest and just started to see the big flaws of it all.For a film that has a huge budget, the special effects are cheap. We've all seen these effects before in many movies and they didn't scare me.. Sound effects are descent but not as good as in the other 2 films. Most of the scare moments work, but sadly you see it coming 5 miles away (when you go look in a closet of course something comes out of it!). The look and feel of this film isn't '80s. Clothing and the way the house is decorated is a mix between the '80s till now. Only the babysitter really looks '80s. The actors never seem to make any effort to make it believable and that shows. I feel like the writer couldn't decide where to go with this story and decided to make an easy escape and to pave the path for part 4. When you watch the trailer you tend to think that this could be a good sequel. Sadly when you see the film nothing that you saw in the trailer comes back and that is a huge letdown. The trailer had so much potential and the movie doesn't live up to it.Acting 1/5, Special effects 1/5, Sound effects 2/5, Story 1/5, Look and feel 1/5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just returned from paranormal activity three. at first i was like no i will not see it. i saw the first and had to sleep with my light on for a month. i saw the second, which was just stupid, and then i was like fine ill go see it. so i went to the movies and (SPOILER) it starts out with Katie and Kristy (i think her name is) in Kristy's home going through old boxes (present time) and they find video tapes, and watch it then the house shakes and the tapes are gone...which makes no sense. so the video starts. heres the thing. i get that its 1988 but it doesn't seem like that. i don't care about the whole hd camera thing, they don't seem like their in the 80s. what ever. the movie is about Kristy who has a imaginary friend who haunts her. i guess. and all the hauntings go on with the boy friend watching them. some scares here and there. to be honest the part where Katie runs into the "wall" and gets pulled by her hair made me laugh so hard i peed. and the part where flys across the room..i died. that part all good. then they go to the grandmas to get away from the supernatural. this is where it just gets dumb. you know the usual grandma starring at the camera. so the bf runs through the house looking for everyone and sees that the grandma is an devil worshiper and the mom starts floating. i don't know if she dies. and then a bunch of old ladies out of no where come and chase the bf then the grandma does some powers on him and hes dead. heres the parts that pisses me off: 1. is the mom dead? 2. if they were watching this movie (in present time) wouldn't they have seen all this and could have prevented it from happening in the second and first movie. also in the first movie katy says the ghost mainly haunted her, but in this one the ghost haunts kristy. 3.the truth of the matter is only the first one was scary. yes this and the 2nd had its fair share of pop ups. but the first is the one that just scares you and makes you think. thats the one that makes you buy a night light. the other 2 are just regular horror movies. but that is that. it is definitively worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Please excuse my typos its 3:34am For everyone complaining about how the quality was HD and not legitimate 80's taping, It's a movie, I know i wouldn't want to watch horrible quality film for an hour and a half. Even with the HD with a 80's cinema style template overlay I had trouble seeing in the dark scenes. I'm glad they did what they did. For those of you who have seen Quarantine and saw the ending of the movie in the trailer I like how they left everything in the movie fresh for your eyes to see. Sure they left out pretty much everything in the trailer but who cares you know where they would fit in the movie, don't be lazy, have an imagination. In my eyes the PA series gets better with each movie. i had high hopes for PA1 from the reviews but i felt let down. I came into both the 2nd and 3rd blind from reviews to be unbiased. the 3rd left a lot of unanswered questions though. I can easily see a forth film happening to end off the series. all in all i thought it was a very good addition to the series and the little girls were very good actresses. watch the movie just to watch them. plus little girls are freaky.Questions(spoilers) what we all would like to know is how does the house get burned down? what i think is that since they do the rituals and from what Dennis reads is that they erase your memory, they burn down the house to get rid of all the evidence they left behind from the "wedding". If it wants the first born son, why does it stick around for Kristi and Katie? I really don't know, maybe it thinks that if it befriends them now they will join the covenant and willingly give their first born son. it was always asking Kristi to do something that she finally said she would do when it started messing with Katie.How did the mother die? she went to check out what happened Toby got her broke her neck and threw her down the staircase. No ones neck looks like that.Where did the cult come in to play? The grandma was always at the base of the haunting. and she was part of a worship cult which adds deeper story(PA4 in my opinion)and why do people do the worshiping? for Power or Money. which is probably money which is why Lois, Julie, Katie, and Kristi have ridiculously nice houses.Why did Lois keep trying to have a son? maybe it had to skip a generation? there was no sign of a dad of Julie, maybe she lost her chance when the dad left.How do they not remember all of this from their past? very good memory deletion How did we see the last bit of footage if they burned down the house? This is my own question. I cant think of anything.If both their parents died who raised them? This might of been answered in the other films but I'm too lazy to re watch them right nowWho is Toby? some kind of goat bull thing that can take the form of a small human? if there is a 4th they will probably answer it thereWhat was the "marriage" I have no idea what the grandma took them upstairs to do with Toby. all i know is the grandma had Kristi in a wedding dress in the movie and she said she was going to marry Toby.Too many unanswered questions but still a good movie. I say go watch it.</fullReview>

I sat at the edge of my seat always ready to see something. I don't know if this is really a spoiler but in the trailer you saw the little girl throwing the cup of water on the "ghost" and the 2 girls playing Bloody Mary, these did not happen in the movie.

They've used the trailer to help set up a good movie, and instead, you get an amazing movie! By not using the stuff thats in the trailer, you are way more tense and on edge, because the whole time your waiting for something to happen thats not going to. I thought this also seemed like a good idea, because how many times have you gone to see a scary movie, and it was ruined because all the scary parts were in the trailer, so you knew when things were gonna happen? The second paranormal activity was like that for me, because they showed us all the cabinet doors bursting open and the mom getting dragged downstairs... After seeing the commercial, i could pretty much call when that stuff would happen in the movie, and it ruined the scare for me. The appeal of these movies is that we don't know what the hell is going on! And thats what makes them scary!</fullReview>

There are terrifying jump scares in the film than the other films including Julie (Katie's and Kristi's mother), wearing a mask, suddenly startles the men in the cabinet.There are also activities that never happen in the first two: - a ghost is shown with a cloth and staring the babysitter. It suddenly vanished when the babysitter turn around.- the ghost is seen in a dark figure and moves very quick.- the ghost kills Dennis by breaking his back (because the ghost never kills the characters without any possessed bodies are used) But it never shows how it began.

		<shortDescription>Spooky movie of a family possessed with video cameras</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So this movie does scare you enough to have your money worth. But Paranormal Activity 3 has to be the most inaccurate prequel to the storyline of the first two movies. Frankly the trailer was more accurate than the movie itself. From what I decipher from the first two movies, during their childhood, Christie and Katie's parent died when their house was burned down. They did spoke about being raised by their grandmother, but nothing related to it. Well, the script writers changed the script completely and still managed to win over.By now the fans of the most surprising movie franchise of the decade knows that Christie and Katie had experienced incidents of paranormal nature during their childhood. The story thus takes place during their childhood, staying with their mother Julie and her boyfriend Dennis who coincidently for the sake of us all happens to be a guess what, movie-maker. He shoots marriage videos and Christie and Katie's mother has given him his own editing room inside the house. Now, we got the cameras and a natural enthusiast, who loves shooting videos. So let just get down to scary business and set the cameras up; but before that, sex tape! Yay! Nope wait, just as it really hots up there is an earthquake and the couple flees the room, leaving us to witness some strange wave of dust falling from the ceiling. After that Dennis concludes immediately that there is something wrong in their new home. Julie plays the role of the usual naysayer, but manages to pull off the biggest fake scare of all during the early sequences. But that ends up being the biggest scare of the movie before the final reel rolls in. As Dennis sets up multiple cameras in search of the invisible member of the family, young Kristie has him 'Toby' playing with her some tricks during midnight hours. Toby leaves with the young girls in their dark storage room and happens to dislike cameras a lot. His antics begin to rage and somehow become very camera friendly, especially for the camera set on the moving base of a portable fan. To watch him at one position and as the camera switches back to the same point finding no movement of him is more funny trickery than scary. And it all continues till Julie had enough of it when Dennis presents a theory that her family past had members in some witch coven and Toby brings down the kitchen. Frankly both were a stretch for the audience as well as it takes the storyline in a very different direction but in good fun.Many people expected audience to be exhausted of these camera tricks and stories based on our childhood's bedtime scares. But the paranormal activity movies have become a habit for the blood thirsty horror fans, which are drained of good horror movies recently. Off course, sometime we all hope that Dennis would put down the camera and help his scared kid or wife hanging in thin air; but then we won't have a movie to enjoy. It is good fun and a decent time at the cinema where you watch a horror movie get scared and somehow come out of the theatre smiling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing this movie and being a little skeptical, i thought it turned out great. It was way better than the first and second one and kind of tied in more with the story. The idea of seeing the girls when they were young was a pretty great idea and it was way more scary. But there are a couple of things i wonder, Wouldn't the girls remember what happened with grandma and or even mention it in the first or second one? I am kind of also wondering what Kristi agreed to do with Tobey. But i guess my questions will be answered by the next movie. I also thought that the smoking marijuana was kind of weird to happen in this series and kind of showed something new in the series. It showed more partial nudity which kind of gave it more of an excuse for R rated but not enough. All around, it was scary and even funny. I enjoyed it a lot and cannot wait for the 4th one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into Paranormal Activity 3 thinking it would be the scariest movie I've ever seen. The trailers claim that the "last 15 minutes will ruin your life" or something like that. It wasn't. But I did thoroughly enjoy it. And I'd see it again. As a huge fun of paranormal shows and movies, the Paranormal Activity franchise has always been a favorite of mine. (side note: I'm a huge chicken. So if you're wanting to see this movie and worried about being scarred for life, it's okay. You won't be)The characters introduced are much more dynamic than in the previous films. We feel a real family bond between the girls' mother and her boyfriend, Dennis. Young Katie and Kristie are absolutely adorable too, which makes you feel especially anxious for them. Dennis's friend Randy is also a great character. At some times I was a little confused as to why a grown man was hanging out with Randy, who looked like a gawky teenager. But whatever, he was funny. There's also an absolutely ridiculously 80s looking babysitter. Which is always a bonus right?There are some great aspects of this movie. The footage is visually more grainy than in previous films, which for me, worked. I really believed we were watching a home movie at some points. There are great camera tricks, including a camera attached to an oscillating fan. The amount of anticipation this builds when it moves back and forth between rooms is incredible. I was definitely a fan of it. Pun intended?Unfortunately the film bordered between scary and cheesy. There were scenes where I jumped (and at one point screamed out loud). But, there were some moments when I felt the movie was going for cheap gimmicks and scare tactics. I wasn't impressed at times and actually laughed at the ridiculousness of several scenes.***SPOILER ALERT*******If you're going to see this movie, do not base it off the trailer. Virtually no scenes shown in the trailer appear in the movie. No house burning down, no children crying in the car, no mommy flying through the hallway. This worked sometimes, as the Bloody Mary scene in the bathroom happens differently as I thought it would, which caught me off guard. However, there were some scenes I was looking forward to see, and I didn't. Disappointed. I also felt dissatisfied with the ending. The whole "cult" idea was cool, but just not what I was wanting. ****END SPOILERS****All in all, I'd say it was a good movie. I enjoyed it and would see it again. But if they make another Paranormal Activity, I would question the quality of it. It seems they've explored every aspect of this family, and I don't know if I want to see anymore. Not the scariest movie of the year, as it claims. But it's thrilling, believable and done very well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen a lot of movies in the theater, and it seems every one of them had least one clip that was in the preview and not in the movie. These days they wind up as deleted or alternate scenes on the DVD.But nearly the entire trailer left out? I guess that's going to be some whopper of a directer's cut when the DVD comes out. That being said, what was actually on screen was pretty darned good.Had some issues with the way it started and ended (see SPOILERS below) but the actual content was both creepy and had some shock value. Plenty of jump out your seat moments, but what I love about these films is the way the tension slowly builds during a scene, until you know something is going to happen, you don't know exactly what, but you want it over with to get on to the next tension builder.OK Rant time (SPOILERS) First scene shows Katie dropping off the box with tapes at Kristi's. Second scene shows Kristi and husband surveying the damage after the apparent break-in in PA2. They discover the box of tapes is missing.Then all of sudden the 1988 tapes start on screen. Who's watching these tapes? Where did the box of tapes go? These questions are never answered at the start OR at the end. After that last (admittedly really creepy) segment I thought we might get taken back to the beginning for some kind of resolution, but the movie just . . . ends. I hope if there is a PA4 we get a few more answers and less questions.However, this movie was still a pretty decent way to have a good fright near Halloween, or anytime you want to have the sh** scared out of you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paranormal Activity 3 was not bad for a threequel. There were a lot of scenes that gave me the chills and that made me jump. But, the entire time I watched the movie, I felt that there was something missing. There was so many missed opportunities in this movie that would have made it a lot more scarier. The fan camera was a great idea for a camera to use, however, I feel that they could have done SO much more with it rather than just two scares. Very original idea though. One thing that bothered me was the height of the demon when he appeared under the sheet. Christy, the daughter, had describe him as very tall. But, under the sheet he couldn't have been more that four and a half feet tall. The acting was very believable. The parents and the girls did very well, very believable. I won't go on a rant about the whole, "HD camera", thing. In the movie they did show a very big camera. In the eighties they had big cameras. So that made it believable. But, then again, horror movies are never believable. Paranormal Activity 3 is definitely worth the 10 to 15 bucks. However, if you're one of the strict horror movie watchers, you may not enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty scary, could have been a little better though</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Im a big fan of the PA series because I liked to be scared. The other reason these movies were better for me was because it had an interesting and very mysterious storyline.When it came to the scares, this movie beats the first 2 because I jumped a lot and there was fairly creepy scenes, also very cool (bedsheet scene is a simple but really cool idea) and also the kitchen scene in PA3 really takes the one from the 2nd movie and makes it even crazier and scare the hell outa you. It was also very funny to see this in theaters and see everybody jump and scream at parts.The storyline was pretty decent but left many questions still unanswered, but then again this is Paranormal Activity and mysteries open up to future sequels. SPOILER this movie does explain in more detail what the grandmother was really involved with and why the demon may have been haunting these girls, and I have to say, its pretty messed up what their grandma is involved with.The worst thing that probably gave this movie a lower rating was because there was so much in the trailer that looked awesome, but was not in the final movie. That really disappointed me, including the girl throwing water on the demon and showing the mom he was there.Overall a decent horror movie with great scares, i was pretty creeped out when I went to bed. but it lacked a little in the story, but more of the story will most likely be explained the sequels. So if you want a fun time at the movies, go see this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Paranormal Activity 3 gets back to creepy/suspenseful roots! Better than 2!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What started out as a low-budget innovative style in the horror film making genre, "Paranormal Activity" backed by a major studio , Paramount Pictures, quickly turned into a lucrative franchise. The third installment to the story of main character, Katie returns to keep fans hooked on what happens next."Paranormal Activity 3" ties story lines from parts 2 and 3 in a way that digs even deeper into the complex origin of the demon that haunts Katie (Katie Featherston) and her sister Kristi (Sprague Grayden).The film starts-out with adult sisters Katie and Kristi going through old family belongings when they come across a box of VHS cassette tapes. The movie then transitions to the past to the year 1988 when the tapes were created by their mother's boyfriend, Dennis (Christopher Nicolas Smith). Dennis was fascinated by strange happenings their new house just as Katie's boyfriend was in the first "Paranormal Activity" film. The progression of filming heightens the demon's presence. The demon, who goes by the name of "Tobi" can only be seen and heard by the youngest sister, Kristi.There are many new surprises in "Paranormal Activity 3" which opens a new chapter to the unraveling of the history of Katie and Kristi's family background - main family member in question is the grandmother.The movie does a great job at recreating the look of the 1980s decade very authentically through the styling of hair, wardrobe, props, interiors, furniture and even down to the look of the footage of the tapes being recorded by Dennis."Paranormal Activity 3" pleasantly gets back to the classic slow and suspenseful built-up of the demon haunting that thrilled fans the same way as in the first one. Viewers will see a progression in the evil energy residing in the home of the sisters, with a slew of evil climatic events during the final act. The film also explains the story of where part 2 left off at when it was revealed that the demon had a history with this particular family and an agenda.Fans can expect to see a part 4 which will hopefully dive further into greater detail to how the demon attached itself to this family to begin with, and how the grandmother got involved in a witch coven. I was left a little bit confused at the end of the movie trying to patch pieces of the story together from all parts of "Paranormal Activity". I think the best way to watch them is in the following order: Part 3 first, then part 2, followed by part 1."Paranormal Activity 3" opens in theaters Friday, October 21, 2011.www.HollywoodJunket.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is how you turn these into a series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set in 1988, this prequel focuses on Katie and Kristi as children, as the latter talks to an imaginary friend at the same time as odd, unexplained phenomena are noticed around the family house. This follows the formula of the first two, but it doesn't make the mistakes of the second(going bigger, and presenting a too similar situation with less likable people) and, also unlike it, proves itself a worthy addition to the franchise(and I'm now a lot less unhappy about the decision to make more than one of these... while the original can stand on its own, if one genuinely wants more, this provides a solid entry). As with 2, we get new information that contributes to the overall mythology of these(and they can actually be watched independently of one another, you don't need to see all three or to do so in any specific order), and it's immensely creepy(not all of what we got in the previous installment was), as are a lot of things in this. We again get a minimalist approach to horror, with us spotting shadows, small movements and the like that we cannot understand as anything natural, as well as noises. The viewer ends up scrutinizing every frame, trying to figure out what it is we're seeing and where exactly it is. On occasion, they will show us something, never overtly or believing their FX(which are literally invisible in this, nothing comes off as fake) or designs could somehow outdo the individual imagination of the audience members. The acting is great, including the kids(with some exceptions, a bit of their delivery is a tad off), and the characters come across as real(and we are introduced to how they relate to one another), with personality(if Dennis is arguably not terribly dissimilar from Micah) and they're affable(within reason, they're human beings, what I'm getting at is they're not obnoxious). The scares are effective, a couple of new ones(as well as some that we've already seen in these, though it doesn't feel repetitive or unsatisfying... I could barely feel time passing in the theater), and they still do not go too far. Obviously they work at all on account of the gradual build-up of atmosphere, something this does impeccably well at. The tension is palpable. This is a truly terrifying movie, that may rekindle a fear of the dark, and of your own home. The camera technology being different back then is addressed. There are a handful of scenes where you wonder why they'd actually film that. They don't detract from the whole. There is a ton of disturbing content and a little brutal violence and sexuality in this. I recommend this to any fan of these, and/or of the "found footage" subgenre. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy once again, but unconvincing storywise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In PA1 a young woman and her partner record their visitation by something unseen and malevolent on home video. In PA2 the young woman's sister's family record their earlier visitation by something unseen and malevolent on home video. In PA3 we see the two sisters as small girls, as their mother and her partner record their visitation by something unseen and malevolent on home video. In this case the unseen and malevolent thing takes on the guise of Toby, an imaginary (but all too real) friend for one of the young girls.PA1 was, in my book, a film of genius, reaping huge box office rewards for minimal cost (filmed in the producer's home with a cast of 2 and a single video camera). PA2 had a cast of 6 and a number of cameras and did a decent job of developing the story while delivering more of what had made the first film so powerful. PA3 does its best to pull the same trick, and succeeds to an extent.More cast, more locations, and an effort to develop the unfolding prequel story are all evident. The latter is not wholly successful, mainly because it leaves many questions unanswered. In fact, the story element is generally somewhat unsatisfactory, but I suspect that it is the least important element of these movies.Developing the static camera idea by bolting it to a fan is a good idea. The main strength of these films is not in what they show you, more in the unbearable tension generated by your apprehension at what they are just about to show you, and the oscillating fan is a brilliant way of cranking this up - you just know something is going to be there when it reaches the right hand end of its sweep - OK, maybe next time. These films have absolutely excelled in the way they have generated that sort of fearful tension. They have also delivered some decent "made you jump" moments, and some "very brief" moments of sheer shock horror.But the impression left on me by this film is the performance of 10 year old Chole Csengery, playing the young Katy. If the film-makers did not actually scare that child out of her wits and beyond them, then she is one of the most promising young actresses I have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must say, I was pleasantly surprised by Paranormal Activity 3, it takes you back to where 'it all began.' Young sisters, Katie and Kristine are the victims of the evil embrace. With a very disturbing, horrific ending PA3 does its job, very well. I did think that this was the best out of the 4, although its also the worse for certain reasons. The lighting and effects in this film were terrible. Compared to PA2 I wasn't visually impressed by the arrangement of things in the 3rd installment of the series, although the acting from the 2 young girls in this film was fairly surprising, they were brilliant. And they definitely gave me the chill. I didn't understand where the Grandma come into it, that kind of did spoil it, although I don't want to reveal anything, I'll let you watch it for yourself.Overall I really enjoyed PA3 and it is definitely the best. Some very jumpy bits and the last 15 minutes are possibly the most disturbing 15 minutes of any horror film. Absolutely terrifying.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Compared to the other Paranormal Activity's what have being absolutely crap, this one is simply the best. I can easily say THIS IS ONE OF THE SCARIEST FILMS I HAVE EVER SEEN. I screamed several times, and I'm really good with coping with films. I even considered turning it off within the last 15 minutes, does the job a horror should. Absolutely terrifying! Very glad I bought this, best ?5 ever spent on a DVD! Some of the film is quite slow, and lets it down but once the action kicks in its absolutely fantastic! Nothing like the other Paranormal Activity's. Its as if it's from a different film series. Honestly. Its really that good. After the terrible Paranormal Activity 2 you're probably not wanting to see 'another one of them films' but trust me when I say this, its fantastic and definitely worth a watch. I'm not over exaggerating, I literally screamed at some of it, while my auntie sat laughing her head off watching Four In A Bed, I was staring at the laptop in utter fright.

		<shortDescription>Best So Far and a Marvel of a Stand-Alone Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my first time reviewing a film, but I find it appropriate to do so to praise this work and respond to bitter followers of the Paranormal Activity flicks who have given it an unfair assessment. As my title summary states, this movie is the scariest of the three. I'm rather impressed how the makers of PA keep setting the bar higher with each succeeding film. They've simply outdone themselves with this ever-eerie thriller. The previous two movies decided to go a horror route and inject into their movies ridiculous human feats induced by demonic powers. It was pretty Hollywood, and very Hitchcock. Even though I'm referring to the ending scenes of both films, these instances allowed me to wake out of the broadcasted nightmare and bring me back to reality. And that's what sobered the experience. But with PA3, there's just something about demonic children that unhinges me, and maybe others as well. I won't give it away, but the end scene of this prequel is just freaky. Judging by most of the negative reviews, loyal fans of the first two pictures seemed to be let down in their expectations by scenes that they were given a taste from in early trailers. Also, the most annoyed followers were bent out of shape by a lack of answers desperately sought from the plot of the first two films. Sure, I can see their point, but I'll quip with "so what?" I saw this movie without consulting any previews and all the more glad for it. I do not need a continuing plot to carry my interest during a horror flick. Just give me a good scare and keep to a formula. This movie did that. My argument to others is to measure the effectiveness of this film by the same formula as its predecessors. Hold this movie by its own merits: It's timeless- taking place in the late 80's- which gives it something extra in mystique. It sets a sinister tone throughout--we are never quite sure what is in the house, but we know that it has to do with the little girl's imaginary friend (which is heart-seizing itself!). It's freightening, mostly not going for the obvious scare--but when they do, its pulled off brilliantly (the kitchen scene, for one, is a jumper). And the end takes the cake. Watch it. I cannot believe the low amount of stars haters have given this instant classic. But for me, in my opinion, what we have here is finally a perfected rendition of the Paranormal Activity franchise instantly worth any Halloween party's queue. I hope you enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And so it begins...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When watching a film or reading a book one might ask, "How did it all begin?" How did the characters become the way they are and end up in their current situation? It's natural to be curious about this, but sometimes we're better off not knowing. It's nice when they leave it up to our imagination. Sometimes though, seeing the beginning of a story can be rewarding too. Prequels are a rare thing in movies, but lately we've seen more and more. 'Paranormal Activity 2' left the door open for a sequel, but instead the filmmakers took us back in time for 3. Turned out to not be such a bad idea.Pros: Well acted across the board. Suspenseful. Does a good job of expanding the story. Several unsettling scenes. A few good scares. Ups the stakes a bit. Great period production design. Flows at a decent pace.Cons: Not much novelty. Some padding.Final thoughts: What began as something that grew through word of mouth, has become a sensation. Like it's predecessor, 3 tries to outdo what came before. It may not be the best of the series or a classic, but it certainly holds it's own. And thankfully there is still an air of mystery left behind when it's all over.My rating: 4/5</fullReview>

However, after viewing the third film I was left in complete awe of it.First and foremost, the first one stands as the ultimate of the films when it comes to scares, however this film stands as my absolute favorite of the movies. In my eyes it had the creepiest scene in all the films and without ruining it all I will say is it deals with a sheet. I was literally freaked out after having seen it and the movie.We are introduced to the same two characters, Katie and her sister but when they were kids. Not only that but we are introduced to a whole mess of activity that is both intense and freaky. Not only that but we are given more of the story line, a whole lot more that will leave you breathless.The only problem I had with this movie was that some of the activity seemed a little...too much if you will. But other than that this film is amazing and I hope when you watch it you will enjoy it as much as I did!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Paranormal excellence with a demon in the closet.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The third instalment of the Paranormal Activity franchise takes us back to 1988, giving us an historical insight to the peculiar antics of the invisible demon that has haunted our screens since it mammoth low-budget hit in 2009. Through our freaky voyeurism's we become educated a little further here as Toby (revealed as the demon's name) gives us an incite to his presence through Dennis' (Christopher Nicholas Smith) tireless study of Toby's movement, possible connections and extended family ties that hint Toby's relationship with the family for generations.One thing we have learnt is that Toby loathes the video-tape, but arguably the franchise would not offer the same effect if it implemented multiple camera angles and sharp Hollywood methods that we have become immune to. Therefore, our demon friend uses this to his advantage to leave the audience in suspense, flirting with their emotions as they await his next move. Although we anticipate his arrival, this third addition enhances the experience with panning cameras, additional point-of-view movement shots as the discovery moves us around much more frequently and vigorously. However much the horror genre follows its distinctive predictive nature, the paranormal experience cherishes our emotions by leading us to believe that this unearthing discovery hasn't quite reached its full blown conclusion.Paranormal devotees won't be disappointed as Toby's loyalty to his adopted family continues to mount. His relationship with Katie and Kristi Rey becomes clearer and the demons' viscous display continues to torment all of those who dare to make contact with him. On a rather disruptive note, the setup up and principle of the film is very familiar. Events become predictable and the matter of pick-pointing the victims is effortless to discover, but isn't that why horror fans continuously return to the genre?</fullReview>

It does have a few flaws but is there a film that doesn't?There are a few jumpy moments which a film like this needs but there are also some predictable parts. That said this doesn't distract from the fact it is a good scary,spooky film. Ignore the bad reviews,the people who write these are waiting for the perfect horror film which lets face it is never going to be made. In my opinion this is tons better than PA1 but not quite as good as PA2.The ending had me scratching my head too,could have gone on a while longer but ended up finishing far too soon.

		<shortDescription>Best of the three, leaves room for more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paranormal Activity 3 ties a few knots, but leaves a lot of loosened ends. In doing so, we're left with a film that satiates the hunger of the horror fan with scenes that trump the previous movies. It is a great culmination of the three and instead of answering all questions, it builds a bridge connecting the happenings to a new set of unknown conclusions.The movie starts out slow as we are presented with familiar first-person view narrations and spooks, coupled with the documentation of bedrooms at night. This time there are multiple room shots that toggle back and forth during the night scenes, and a panning camera view. Tension builds well with this dynamic, as we are shown only what the camera views, which are fresh scares not yet seen in the other two movies. There is also an intense during-the-day scene with one character shouldering a camera in front of a mirror: remember the "bloody mary" clip in the commercial? It doesn't go down quite like the commercial's take of it, not even close. As for the typical little girl theme, which is a re-occurring theme within horror movies, it earns it's creepy factor with the manner in which communication happens with the supernatural. Tastefully done. My only gripe with the film is the pace at which "things" start happening. However, it is a build-up that is well worth the wait. The ideas are new and innovative, and lets face it: we horror fanatics are dying to see shocking imagery. The last 30 minutes of the film are a terrifying and satisfying climax to the reason we decided to delve into the series. The sound effects are great and aren't overdone, just like the visual effects. I feel the previous two movies are mere teasers compared to what the last quarter of Paranormal Activity 3 offers. Our imaginations are stimulated not only by the harrowing events that we see take place, but also by the plot that thickens.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Paranormal Activity 3" is a step-up from the somewhat disappointing second film, and delivers a solid, scary ride!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently watched "Paranormal Activity 2" for the first time, and found myself torn. It was a fun ride and had a lot of great scares, but the film was also riddled with problems, and felt like too much of a souped-up, watered-down re-tread of the original. I liked it, but it wasn't great. I gave it a slightly above average 6 out of 10.However, I have to say, I just purchased the third film, and I am very happy with how it turned out. It is a great step forward, and is almost on par with the original film. It was scarier than the second film, and felt a lot more real and grounded. I loved it!The film begins with a ret-con of the second film. Katie (Katie Featherston) brings her sister Kristi (Sprague Grayden) a box of video tapes from their youth in the 80's. Soon after, their house is ransacked (as depicted in the second film), and they discover that the box has gone missing. We then are shown the tapes, which tell of Katie and Kristi's first encounters with the mysterious demon that haunts them. So yes, the film is a prequel. We follow the young Katie and Kristi (Chloe Csengery and Jessica Tyler Brown), their mother (Lauren Bittner) and her boyfriend (Chris Smith), as they encounter strange phenomena in the 1980's.I don't want to spoil the story or the twists, but I will speak of the films merits. For one, the acting was all really good. Particularly Chris Smith as the boyfriend Dennis, who gives a nice contrast from the men from the first two films, who were skeptical and at times even nasty. Dennis is a likable guy, who loves the girls even though they aren't his, and is loyal to his girlfriend and her family. And oddly, even though the women in the first two films were the believers and they had skeptical boyfriends/husbands, this time it's the opposite- Dennis believes what's happening, and has trouble telling his girlfriend. It was a nice change-up from the first two films. Lauren Bittner as the mother, Julie, was very good, but I felt her role was somewhat underdeveloped. It was Dennis' movie, she was just along for the ride, which was interesting considering she is mother of our two leads.Csengery and Brown are both excellent as the young girls. They have a cuteness and charm, and a great innocence to their portrayals, and I will say, they do resemble the adult actresses quite a bit. Both had the ability to melt your heart with how adorable they are, and they also were quite convincing with the fear. Great child actresses, they are.The fear is also quite ramped up this time, and the presence feels like more of a credible threat than in the first two films. Although this is a double-edged sword, as I will explain below.The storyline is quite nice, and I will say, though a bit silly, the ending does supply some answers to the mystery, and is the most terrifying finale to a horror film I've seen in some time.However, there are some detractors. As I mentioned above, the activity is again ramped up, which I can't help but complain about- it betrays the previous films logic and buildup. And it bothered me a little bit. Also, some of the effects were too "effects-y", and gave themselves away. And I will comment that the film does look too good to be "found footage" from the 1980's.All that being said, I really loved this film, and it was a bigger, scarier, and better film than the second. I give this a very strong 8 out of 10. See it alone, in the dark!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>PA3 sets out to do on thing; scare the hell out of you. From start to finish I was on the edge of my seat waiting for something to jump out at me. For being the movie it is, the dialog was decent and even quite funny at times. The characters were likable, and both little girls did an excellent job at playing their parts. Scary movies with creepy kids brings out some underlying fear in all of us that supercharges the scare effect. The "home video" filming style is going to turn many viewers off because it's not traditional. You should keep an open mind going in to this and realize this movie wasn't made to win awards for plot thickness. Overall, I enjoyed the movie and still had the chills after I had gotten home. I recommend PA3 to anyone who wants a really good scare and nothing more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Check out a podcast review of this film here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWoG3jJxEC4It's a good horror movie, but probably not what hardcore fans of this genre are hoping for. We wanted to see the things that they hinted at and mentioned in Paranormal Activity 1 and 2. In fact I think they could've made this an original movie but they felt like they had to connect it to the other films. But it is still scary to watch and I'm glad that they kept to form. Maybe some people are complaining that this offers nothing new. I disagree with that, there are some new scares in this one. But I'm also glad that they didn't go too far. They recognized that part of what made the original movies scary was that you never saw the demon. So in this one, you don't see it either. The weakest of the series, but still a good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was good. I would like to point out that it is better than 2, but still no where near number 1. There were a few scenes that could have been changed for scarier scenes and I think the ending should have been altered. A couple of scenes from the trailer I believed should have been included but weren't. Overall it's a good watch, and I recommend it, but the potential was there for so much more! The house house could have been more 80s like, similar to the grandma's. It looked modern to us. A couple big bangs like in the first one, maybe a voice talking, more doors locking, etc... Another thing I would like to mention is pay to close to the movie, as one creepy scene if misunderstood looks more random. Hope you enjoy it, I would give it 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More of the same...but the "same" isn't all that bad...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film for some good Halloween scares and fun. I have seen the first two Paranormal Activities, and although you watch the movie already knowing the concept, it does it's job in delivering the suspense and scares. I won't lie, my heart was beating fast during the silent parts as I was trying to prepare myself for a loud, intense struggle. I won't say Paranormal Activity 3 is much better than the other two. In fact, I won't compare them at all, because they each have their own style that makes them creepy. Sure, we all know it's the "found tape" concept, but in each movie the camera enthusiasts have their own way of filming. Paranormal Activity 3 does have some creative parts, such as a little invention involving the camera and a rotating fan. However, the movie does have it's faults. I remember being a little more than half way through the movie, and checking my phone for the time. I realized the movie did not have much time left, so I knew it would have to pick up pretty quickly. It picks up the pace near the end of the movie, and the ending itself is extremely intense. Having said that, I feel like I could have walked into the film thirty five minutes late, and not miss any of the good parts. This really was a downer for me. One thing about a good scary movie is that the scares are consistent, and I know the demon in the "Paranormal" movies is supposed to start out lightly, feed off of fear, and get much worse. But it feels as if it skipped a few of those steps in this movie. It felt as though the demon went from being a little creepy, straight to being the menacing monster we see at the end of the other two films.With all of this, "Paranormal Activity 3" is longer than it should be, is not consistent, and waits until the end to really begin to deliver. However, if you're looking for a good, fun Halloween movie, the suspense and scares are intense and worth the money when they are delivered, even if they are on the late side.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This one was my favorite out of all 3 Paranormal Activity films. Reason being is because this movie brought chills down your spine at least every 15 -20 minutes.I enjoy a movie that consistently makes myself within the crowd jump and feel scared for the next screen. The overall plot was astonishing and kept you thinking and always kept you at the bottom of your seat just waiting for a chilling scare or somebody jumping into the camera.I was disappointed that there was not a lot of scenes from the trailer included in the movie. But I understand showbiz and understand that they need to drive the audience with a thrilling trailer to attract movie goers. But i will expect to see these missing scenes in the DVD version.I felt the other 2 Paranormal films were very horror infused but was not as consistent as this one and the ending was breathtaking. I did not expect the ending to turn out so gruesome but it laid the movie out evenly with the rest of the plot!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, so I have watched the first one and I found it quite scary but it didn't really make me jump much, and it kinda lacked events, but I swear on my own life this third movie is well improved sending chills up my spine and last nights takeaway in my pants. I found it really frightening and both me and my boyfriend screamed like idiots a number of times. You get loads of crappy horror films about that go straight into some sweaty pervert chopping toes off but the thing that made me soil myself a number of times is the fact that it progresses further and further into the film and you just know when the timer slows down your gonna scream like a bitch. Ending was a bit rushed but what can I say, now every time I hear a noise in my house at night I am pretty convinced I'm going to get possessed/dragged out of bed by a demon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still One of the best horror ideas in years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Found footage films have become more and more popular in resent years but it has to be said that the Paranormal activity trilogy is head and shoulders above the rest. The premise of the tree working backwards from the very end of the story to the start so that the full picture is hidden from the audience is an amazing way to get bums on seats to see your film.Every thing that made the first paranormal activity great is still here in this film the slow progression and build up of tension by playing high pitched notes and a slow bass note that gradually gets louder until it is almost shaking the food that you ate for dinner out of your body well before a scare happens that finishes the job and leave you a quivering wreck in your cinema seat is all here and ready for you. the only problem is that i have seen the other two films i know the scares and i know the build up so it wasn't as spine tingling as the first or even the second but it was a great addition to the set.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was a big fan of the original PA. I loved it. On rewatches its effect has lessened, but I still remember the impact it had on me. The sequel I liked it a lot too, although it wasn't as creepy as the first I liked that it didn't over-do things like most horror sequels do. It worked in different ways than he original. Paranormal Activity 3 is more like the original than the sequel was.Like the sequel, I am impressed how much this series still has going for it. Like the sequel it also doesn't overdo things but it does manage to still build up nicely. I wouldn't say that this is a great film, but I do want to say that it continues the success of this series. I like how they continue to build on the main story. So I do recommend it for fans of the first two... maybe even if you liked the first but not the 2nd. I actually still kinda prefer the 2nd over this for now.</fullReview>

There are actually several tense, creepy moments in here for the thrill seeking film-goer..However, i have to say this one went a bit too POLTERGEIST for my tastes. There were a handful of sequences where it was just quite obvious that we were watching special fx flying at the camera. At that stage i felt no fear, no terror. Actually a bit of boredom.The climax has a great build. My heart was pounding in my chest, i shall not lie. However the pay-off was rather lame.

		<fullReview>These times 'found footage supernatural horror films' are the cream and reference to the horror films in the movie industry nowadays.I've already watched the other two films and my favorite has been always the first one, may be due to the fact that introduced us a different sub-type of psychological horror films.Being an avid fan from this genre (personally I dislike and feel unsettling the slasher-splatter flicks like Saw, Hostal, etc.), Paranormal Activity 3 features all the 'not-included' or 'improvements' on what the others two films failed or missed, like showing us the emotional instability from children (children are key-roles in horror films), not clichd scary scenes, camera-angles and more home-made photography-video adding more authenticity to the situations.I can say that what makes it really intense and frightening is after the initial 5 or 10 minutes (of 'relative peace') the jumps, scares, hushed gasps, nervous tittering has just begun, but it's the atmosphere and the hand-held camera walking through the halls of the house filling the audience with a sort of anticipatory anxiety which I felt it very enjoyable and frightening at the same time. Adding to this anthology of fears I loved the oscillating camera, a very big improvement to the franchise.The body horror and archetypal shadows (main elements from a 'psychological horror film') are there, and as usual also many Hitchcockian-elements as he once said and I quote that 'There is no terror in the bang, only in the anticipation of it', 'Always make the audience suffer as much as possible', key quotes and well applied in this occasion.Personally, I loved and found that silence and waiting can be more entertaining than frantic fast-cutting and berserk F/X. And I can guarantee you, YOU WON'T BE BORED.The only part I can complain is the performances coming from the adult cast (the girls were terrific), I felt that sometimes overplayed their characters by not feeling the uneasiness caused by the situation around or perhaps if they have fallen in a more emotional instability they may have brought an excessive tension to the atmosphere, which would have been counterproductive.Many people around the web have complained of not having included almost anything from the trailers shown. PERSONALLY, I WANT TO CONGRATULATE ALL THE PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THIS DECISION BECAUSE YOU MADE IT MORE UNPREDICTABLE. WARNING *SPOILERS*, for example in the trailers we can see young Katie throwing water to the entity while doing some painting, instead in the theatrical cut she only says that it is standing next to her.It's like showing us how intense is gonna be the roller-coaster but not the path is going to take.Also I want to congratulate both writers and directors for frighten us very nicely in this part of the franchise. The writer for the timing and managing the suspense and the directors (which I saw his documentary 'Catfish' quite nice indeed) for bringing in shape your creativity in Paranormal Activity 3.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Upon viewing the trailer for Paranormal Activity 3, I instantly felt that it hinted way too much of the actual movie. That trailer involved scenes of a psychic getting beat up by the invisible demon, the mother of the two girls getting launched into her bed, and a dozen more scenes of the demon terrorizing this poor 1980s family. I almost felt upset when the trailer ended. I felt like there wasn't going to be any surprises for me in the actual viewing of the movie... Boy, was I wrong! :D Paramount, you sneaky-snakes! Just about 95% of that trailer wasn't even in the actual movie! In fact, there wasn't even a psychic in the theatrical cut that I saw. I was pretty pleased with this entry in the franchise. I definitely believe that the 1st movie still holds up as the best in the series, but this prequel delivers some good scares for sure. I give this film 3 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

Well- I just got home a few hours ago from going to see 3- a movie I suspected might be a waste of $, only to find that after seeing 3,buying groceries,dinner, another movie on DVD &amp; bed, it is 5:13 right now and I can't sleep! The entire theatre(50-60 people) actually sat in stunned silence when our trip into terror was over &amp; the credits rolled. It took around an hour for my heart to stop pounding afterward, &amp; all viewers screamed simultaneously at certain scenes WITHOUT SHAME! Now I may be biased, as I adore scary movies &amp; I have the active imagination required of one in the arts, but still- I have a boyfriend, huge dog &amp; very huge &amp; angry cat. All is locked up. So why can I not sleep? Why am I keeping all night lights burning when they normally bother me? Cos I am SOOOOO scared, like "Heather's heartfelt videotaped Blair Witch monologue" scared. Not since my parents stayed at the drive-in in the 70s to watch the second feature(Invasion of the Bodysnatchers), wrongly assuming their toddler would sleep through it (I didn't!! Eeks!) have I felt this primal, incapacitating fear. Yes, there are some flaws, as with everything, but it sure creeps up on you later! Watch at own risk!</fullReview>

Many people in the audience found some parts of the movie Funny &amp; Thrilling honestly I found the same. Don't get your hopes up by watching the trailer at least all the scenes were not included in the Theatrical version of the film. One of the scariest scenes I saw in the movie (Not going to spoil it) Was a part when Toby (Invisible entity)attacks Katie.Overall the movie was a complete horror thriller with pop ups and climax scenes and as seen in the trailer a critic wrote "The last 15 minutes will ruin you" yes it did scar me, the ending was to intense and scary for meI recommend this movie to Horror lovers cause in most horror films i do not scream but in PA3 i literally screamed my eyes out. so there is my review thanks for reading :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Horror films/scary films - whatever you want to call them, are difficult to recommend because what might scare one person may not another. So this will either work for you or it won't, simple as that. Having seen many supposed scary films in my now 38 years, it can be difficult to genuinely scare an audience and yet the first in this series completely worked for me. I remember seeing The Entity when young and thinking at the time how relentless that was. Perhaps Paranormal Activity tapped into that and it did genuinely make me uncomfortable - in a good way. I found Part 2 to be quite tedious and that does exist here but I did genuinely find some moments unsettling enough to make it a worthwhile trip to the cinema. Maybe when there's children involved there is additional anxiety and the 2 young actresses here are believable. It seems that it takes every 10 years for some film to come out of nowhere to have an effect on an international audience so I can't wait for this pattern to come around again.</fullReview>

In this prequel we are shown life in the late '80s as the family deals with an unseen force disturbing the family's idyllic peace and wellbeing. We are presented with some insight into how and why these things haunt Katie in her later life, but it still feels like it's missing something. Overall, though, it's an entertaining 1.5 hours, but nothing incredibly new is here. See it, but don't set the bar too high. 6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was giddy when I saw the trailer a couple weeks back. It was an intense looking trailer and I was not expecting that. I arrived to the 1st showing of this movie in my local theater a good half hour early too get a good spot and had my drink and goodies ready. I had the woman along to squeeze my arm and get scarred while I would somewhat snicker at the lame "scares" and judge the movie at every turn. -Lights go down, the ROWDY crowd that was in the theater was mostly 18 - 30 year old, a very loud and chatty crowd - Oooooo my favorite....going to miss anything that's not loud. After what seems like 45 minutes of previews the movie starts up, no opening credits...I dig it. It starts of slow....real slow just like the other two. Nice...Than the first scare it gets just about everyone in the theater. The crowd is now over-giddy and ridiculous...got to love the drunk douche bags and smart ass's that talk over the movie to see if they can get people to laugh at there comments. Anyway The story line starts to move away from the trailer....must have had a lot of cuts and rewritten shots. I'm okay with that keep us on our toes, no trailer spoiling..I like it.....wait wait what are they doing?!? -displeased face- They are starting to get very cheesy with there scares....The one part I will point out is the bathroom scene which is INTENSE. After this scene they basically decided they wanted to ruin, yes ruin the series for me. The scripting just got blah with silly story structure and cheap parlor tricks and camera angles. Around this time the ending came...kinda. It was sort of an ending...it was like the end of an episode of lost you now have more questions than before and decided not to close any of the plot lines. So I was sorely letdown and upset. Ill give it a 5 Strong points - Scares were good, kept most things original and true to 1988 Weak points - Awful ending which ruined the whole SERIES for me, a few lame scares, and low sound. If your the average movie watcher you will like it, and you will tell people how scary it was. If you care about story structure you will HATE this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From thequickflickcritic.blogspot.com/ With "3", I have now seen all installments of the "Paranormal Activity" franchise save for the final act, "The Ghost Dimension", which I look forward to reviewing soon.In terms of this third iteration of ill-omened found footage from 2011, it's pretty much business as usual but for the fact that we learn the childhood origins of why the possessed Katie (Katie Featherston) behaves as balefully as she does in later years. So for that, and really only if you're a fellow fan whose followed along over these past eight years, it is worth the watch.Oh, just one more thing. In critiquing the other chapters of the "PA" franchise, I have neglected to give well earned kudos to the creative legions of the respective sound editing teams. This consistently clever crew commands that one's attention remain resolutely riveted to the screen with their freakily foreboding noises even if nothing of consequence is going down.Or IS it?

If I would have gone to the theater to see this, I probably would've walked out during the first half hour. Why? Because there was absolutely nothing, and I mean nothing going on. I think the bedroom door moved a little. Seriously though a half hour, I am not exaggerating. If you want to see a good horror movie with a lot of suspense, then I suggest you see Wes Craven's They. My favorite scene in this whole series is the kitchen scene in the second movie. Where all the pans fall and the cabinets fly open. It is the only scene that will startle you in the entire movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The third instalment in the Paranormal Activity series, the story of Paranormal Activity 3 is set in 1988, 18 years prior to the events that took place in the first two films and serves as a prequel to the series. The plot follows two sisters, Katie &amp; Kristi, who live with their mother &amp; her boyfriend and soon discover their house to be haunted by an invisible entity.In my opinion, Paranormal Activity 3 is the epitome of false advertisement. Because every single thing that was good in its theatrical trailer doesn't even exist in the final print, which is no doubt a very frustrating discovery, and what exists in the picture is the same old dull formula that lost its potency long ago, which in turn made this one a painfully boring affair.Even the scares are predictable, the added element that reveals the secret behind all this supernatural phenomena is lame, the cast &amp; crew is amateur at best and all of them fail to add or bring an interesting dimension into the story, the ever-hovering camera still doesn't justify its presence, and this weakest entry is a perfect indication that this lifeless franchise needs to be put out of its misery.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a little bit better than Paranormal Activity 2. In this prequel we will see Katie and Kristi as children, living with their mother, Julie(which was so hot...) and stepfather Dennis.I liked the movie because is simply... scary. It has a great 1988 atmosphere. Also, Katie and Kristi as children are very cute. I liked the scene when Toby interacts with the girls. The ending was awesome, very, very scary and suspenseful. Also, the grandma is the scariest character in the franchise.My rating for this movie is 8/10(same as Paranormal Activity 2), even if is better than part 2.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you've already seen and enjoyed the first two Paranormal Activity movies, I see no reason why you shouldn't like this one: it's the same thing all over again?Poltergeist a la found footage. Me? I was left rather unimpressed.Christopher Nicholas Smith plays wedding videographer Dennis, who lives with his girlfriend Julie (Lauren Bittner) and her two young daughters Katie (Chloe Csengery) and Kristi (Jessica Tyler Brown). After convincing Julie to participate in a spot of home-made porn (which is interrupted by an earthquake?talk about bad luck!), Dennis notices something peculiar on the tape which leads him to believe that their home is the focus of supernatural occurrences. Setting up cameras around the house, he attempts to capture more spooky goings-on?What follows is lots of tedious video footage in which the viewer waits patiently for something out of the ordinary to happen. Admittedly, there are two very effective jump scares along the way, but neither of them revolve around the supernatural, which makes them feel very cheap. The bona fide spooky shenanigans are predictable and not in the least bit scary. The best thing about the whole film is the mounting of a camera on an oscillating fan, which means that the viewer is forever expecting something nasty to come into view as the camera moves from side to side. Apart from one of the aforementioned cheap scares, it doesn't deliver, but it was a nice idea.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid, not great, installment to the Paranormal franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This third installment of the PA franchise pretty much follows the script of the first two, and while the first one is by far the best, this one is a solid addition to the series.First, let me start off with the one glaring problem with this movie. For the movie to work, you have to suspend belief that in no way most families would endure such trauma. In other words, most normal families, after reviewing footage of the night before and seeing footage of their daughter being lifted off the ground by her hair, or watching their daughter having a one-way conversation with some unseen entity, etc...would have run for the hills much earlier. Of course, that doesn't make a particularly good movie, so if you can suspend that belief and watch this movie for what it is, it's not bad and will provide some chilling moments.This movie is based on the perspective of the viewer watching old, home-made footage. One interesting aspect of this is how this comes about. In the beginning, someone breaks into Kristi's house and steals the box of old VHS tapes, and then suddenly we start watching them. It's not disclosed who this person is that steals them, but I wonder if that becomes an important piece of information for later in the series. Anyways, the old footage shows the sisters as young girls, living with their mom and her boyfriend. The young girls are cute and innocent, and that kind of makes it the more disturbing when you witness what happens to them, especially to the younger one as she generally thinks it's just fun and games, yet we know differently. And what really impressed me was just how good the acting was when it came to the girls, especially the younger one, Kristi. They were believable, engaging, and likable.One different and interesting thing about this installment is the usage of a panning camera which pans back and forth between the kitchen and living room. This adds a level of suspense as it's sweeping back and forth as things are happening. You get the feeling that there's always something dire going on in the other room that you cant see. The scares are pretty similar to the earlier movies in that you really don't see the entity, you just witness the activity going on around the family, though we do see Kristi conversing with it, whom she calls Toby.If you liked the earlier Paranormals, then you'll most likely enjoy this one. Personally, I think the fist one is by far the best so far, and Im getting the feeling that the rest of the franchise wont come close to that one, but this one isn't bad. It follows the similar formula, which isn't a bad idea, and yet it's just different enough that you feel like you're watching a part of a franchise and not the exact same movie. However, it's just not quite as scary or creepy as the first one, nor does it stay with you nearly as long.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome Sequel!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paranormal Activity could very well be the only horror franchise worth watching that's new to our screens in the past decade. It can't be denied that each film does borrow somewhat from the last and for some the repeated tirade of CCTV-like footage displaying apparitions, slamming doors and distant wailing could get insufferable really fast, I personally found Paranormal Activity 3 to be far stronger than 2 and on par with 1. The last twenty minutes of the film are really quite something and express promising talent and unforgettable jolts. In Paranormal Activity 3 it is what's suggested that is much scarier than what is seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best One So Far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>::::Possible Spoilers::::Here we have the latest installment of the Paranormal Activity series, and this time we have more of a background story on Katie and Kristi as we look at the events that happened to them when they were children. The first two films touch on this fact, but they never go into a huge amount of detail. Now, however, we see exactly what happened to them in this film.Now, to be honest, by now you know what to expect - strange things starting to happen and they escalate to a level that reaches boiling point. The "jump" moments and scares in the film are good and you do feel a sense of unease when watching in some parts. Some of the moments are quite subtle to start with as well (especially with the "ghost" scene) and rather than just a sudden "boo" moment, they build up a good tense, scene before letting you have it so to speak.Just as a quick mention as well - the performances are good, especially Chloe Csengery as Katie and Jessica Tyler Brown as Kristi. They both do a really good convincing job - without being annoying - of playing the parts of a couple of little girls being scared out their minds and terrorised by an unseen spirit.If you enjoyed the first two movies (as I did) then you will more than likely enjoy this installment (also, as I did). I recommend watching with the lights off and sound up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A decent prequel to the first 2 films with some genuine scares.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an improvement on Paranormal Activity 2 but still doesn't match the suspense of the original. In this instalment of the PA series we find out about Katie &amp; Kristi's childhood thanks to home video tapes which Katie has inherited from her grandmother. At the beginning of the film it rehashes a little of what happened in PA 2 and we discover that while Kristi is pregnant with son, Hunter, Katie stores the tapes in the basement of Kristi's house. During the so-called burglary of Kristi's house in PA 2 we discover in this film that the tapes go missing. There is no mention of these tapes in PA 2 which for fans of the story is an annoying inconsistency.But on a scare level this film scores higher than PA 2 as there are some genuinely creepy moments, but as with all the other PA films, most of the serious scares and action occur in the final 10 minutes or so.There is a good twist with the girls' grandmother and we discover that she is somehow involved with the demon.If you are eager to find out what happened to Hunter and Katie after PA 2 then you will be sorely disappointed as this entire film is devoted to telling the back story of Kristi &amp; Katie and what happened to them and their family in 1988 when they were children - and unfortunately it raises more questions than it answers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Picture the scene... An empty room. Still an empty room. Wait ten seconds. A little bit more the empty room. Something moves. Repeat.Just thread the above together for 80 minutes and you have a chapter in the Paranormal Activity franchise.Am I being harsh? I actually liked the first movie. The first half was a little slow, but there were some genuinely creepy moments in the second act.However, part 3 could basically be part 2. It follows the formula exactly. Yes, you get a few scares along the way. Yes, I even jumped and my heart raced when something jumped out at you, but if you've seen either of the previous instalments then you've seen this one.It's technically a prequel to the previous ones. I guess if you REALLY loved them, you'll like this.I noticed that it was produced for ?5 million and made ?105 million. With that kind of money-making power behind it, I'm guessing this will not be the last Paranormal film we'll be seeing. Although it WILL be the last one I'll be watching.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paranormal activity two and three both have the same potential. I only got a few of my questions asked from the second film in the paranormal activity series. The third one was just OK. In fact, it wasn't much different from the second one. I have never seen the first one in the series, so maybe that is why I can't get the interest going. I wish I could just find some interest in this series, but it seems awfully difficult. The movies are good because they are real life situations. The series doesn't seem to be much of a thriller, but it's just barely good enough to watch. I hope they make a fourth installment, because I want to see if there is any hope that I will ever actually enjoy this series as much as some of the other people out there. I guess I just haven't found the enthusiasm to watch the series and get something out of it. I got bored with this one just as much as the second, and I am hoping the fourth will not be so bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A few scary moments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Katie (Katie Featherston) gives a box of old VHS tapes to her pregnant sister Kristi Rey (Sprague Grayden). There are a lot of old footage from their childhood. The franchise is going further back in time. This one takes place mostly in their long forgotten distant childhood.The VHS tapes are a good way to bring this into Katie and Kristi's childhood. I understand the security camera is the style of the franchise. I would have been fine without that part of the franchise for this prequel. Also going back to their childhood means losing better actors like Grayden. I would hope the franchise had become big enough to get big time actors for the lead roles. The little girls are fine. The two adult roles are too regular folk-like. Lauren Bittner and Christopher Nicholas Smith are not big enough to lead. It's time this franchise stop thinking itself as a small time indie. The movie has a few scary moments especially with the kids. Otherwise the scares are not as compelling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have always hated Paranormal Activity 1 and 2. So I was not happy to see the 3rd installment of this awful series of films. But to my surprise, it was actually better than the first two films. But thats like saying being eaten by a shark is better than being eaten by piranhas.This film is yet another prequel in the series which tells the tale of horrible person Katie Featherston (Shes like 7) and Kristi as this movie explains who the demon is and how they try to get rid of it.The film has smart characters for once as people run away to get their paycheck because they know they are in a bad film.The Annoyence Level of this film is minor compared to the first two. There is still screaming at ghosts and stuff and being idiots to each other, but Directors Joust/Schuelman (Who directed the pretty good Mockumentary Catfish which I think you should watch) knew the mistakes that were made from the first two films and decided "Our audiences are not stupid! We need to make this film better!" and they did. The direction is one of the film's more stronger aspects.Scares? Just one. But its very effective.Paranormal Activity 3 is more of an improvement to the first two because they did all the right things that 1 and 2 didn't. But its still a bad movie due to plot holes and mainly the fact that it is not scary.41/100 D+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paranormal Activity 3 is a Prequel to Paranormal Activity 1 and 2. I was really surprised with this Movie. I thought this one was going to be lame. But it didn't,it has some very good scares in it.My favorite one that gave me chills down my spine was when the babysitter girl was reading her book and Toby was standing directly behind her and then disappeared. The coolest part of the Movie is that they used all the techniques that were used in the old times. We learn much about why Kristy and Katey are chosen by the demon and how it comes to the events of PA 1 and 2. I think this was one of the best horror Prequels that i have ever seen. But for me to have it a 10 out of 10 it would have to keep me scared and interested through the whole movie like The Conjuring or Insidious.</fullReview>

Their mother Julie(alluded to in the first film) has let recent boyfriend Dennis to move in, and he sets up cameras around the house to record the ghost, little dreaming the sinister forces close to home that are responsible...

		<shortDescription>Hot and cold running boredom; still, ten times better than PA4.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's 1988 in California. Dennis moves in with girlfriend Julie and her two daughters, Katie and Kristi. When things go bump in the night, he installs cameras to record in various rooms in the house.There are more bumps in the night. The family gets used to processing the surveillance tapes. Dennis investigates paranormal issues via the local library. He talks to Kristi about the invisible friend Toby.Dennis and Julie go out one evening, and leave Kristi and Katie with the babysitter, Lisa. The girls ask for a ghost story. All goes well; Lisa is a mature, confident sitter. Dennis and Julie do not return until later than promised, 23:05 instead of 21:45. Lisa gets a couple of bumps in the night.Kristi gets sick with a high fever; Dennis and Julie take her to the hospital. Randy comes to be with Katie, who insists on playing 'Bloody Mary.' Randy is a bit reluctant, but Katie convinces him. On the second, successful run, there are several bumps in the night (only it's daytime), Randy gets a foot long bloody laceration on his chest, and Katie gets quite scared. When they attempt leaving the girls' bathroom, poltergeist activity occurs. After Dennis and Julie return, and the daughters are OK, Randy lets loose on Dennis, then takes his camera equipment and goes.After some more serious bump in the night (and day), Julie, Dennis, Katie, and Kristie go to Lois' (Julie's mother) house. Dennis wakes up alone deep in the night. Julie is not in bed; Katie and Kristie are not in their beds. Looking further, he finds the triangle-circle symbol and inverted pentagram on the walls that were formerly covered by paintings. He encounters a group meeting.Will Dennis survive this one? How about Julie, Katie, and Kristie?------Score-----Cinematography: 6/10 Too much monochrome, too much camera shake. Still, so much better than PA4.Sound: 8/10 Not bad.Acting: 6/10 The screenplay did not call for much acting. Much of the film's running time was consumed by empty rooms.Screenplay: 6/10 Not much of a story, but reasonably done, once the decision was made to execute in 83 minutes instead of 15.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Familiar but effective</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, so we all know the score now after two PARANORMAL ACTIVITY films: there are CCTV cameras set up in haunted houses, and innocent families are at the mercy of vengeful ghosts. PARANORMAL ACTIVITY 3 takes the form of a prequel charting the childhood misadventures of the protagonists of the later movies.Of course, it doesn't really make sense in the scheme of things because none of this was mentioned in the later film, but it provides an adequate stand-alone scare-flick. The format and narrative of the movie are both very familiar, with a slow and subtle build-up leading to more and more unsettling moments and some genuine jump-in-your-seat shocks. It is predictable, too, with sudden movements and loud music guaranteed to make the audience jump, but just because it's predictable doesn't make it doesn't work.One aspect of the film I wasn't too sure about is that involving a plot point also covered in the likes of THE LAST EXORCISM and KILL LIST; it does feel incongruous and a bit desperate in its search for fresh material. Still, the direction - by CATFISH hands Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman - is effective and the scares do work; in the end, I was enjoying PARANORMAL ACTIVITY 3 in much the same way as an old-fashioned scare flick of the 1980s like POLTERGEIST or THE ENTITY.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just plain lazy and not scary at all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember the hype there was from the "Paranormal Activity" movies when the first one came out. People were calling it scary and were having nightmares because of it. The promotional trailers all showed frightened people gasping in fear at what was happening on the screen. I have never seen the first "Paranormal Activity", but if it is anything like this and I'm guessing it is, then the promotional trailer was all propaganda. "Paranormal Activity 3" relies on the same tricks as "Paranormal Activity 2" to scare the audience. Show the house at night for a while via the different cameras set up and then give the audience a shock scare by a chair sliding away from the table or something along those lines. This is the laziest form of horror in a film and it is not even done correctly as you know it is going to happen because the camera stays on that spot for a good minute or so. So, there is only shock scares and a lot of the time, they are done poorly. So... how is this film scary?The plot is the same as the second movie except with a younger version of the girls and with different characters in a different house. Yes, the same can be said about movies like the "Scream" series, but those films are done better than this and know how to do what they are doing correctly. The "Paranormal Activity" movies rely on jump scares and the same stuff over and over again.Nothing in the film is scary, not even the ghost or demon or whatever is in the house since, like in the other films, it just fools around with the furniture for two hours until it becomes hostile for some reason and does what it was always going to do. Plus, the stuff it is doing dose not even relate to what the demon's overall goal is, so why should I find a chair being moved across the room scary?"Paranormal Activity 3" fails as a horror movie, let alone a movie. Actually, scratch that. The "Paranormal Activity" series fails as horror movies, let alone movies. We have nothing to be afraid of because the "scary" moments mean nothing and everything else is laughably bad. Without even seeing the first or fourth films, I feel like I could make a review of them just by watching the second and third ones.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS***If I can say one word about Paranormal Activity 3 it would be intense. The film wastes no time getting the scares in even if some are false scares made by characters. This film has more humor than the first 2 which had a serious tone to them. This film is very suspenseful and the scares were a little different from the first 2 and much more amped up than before. Some scenes could be a flashback from the first film such as a little girl standing at the doorway of her parents and watching them sleep for hours standing up but the film isn't perfect either for me sometimes there were humor put in some wrong scenes due to the family friend who tries to make jokes during "scary scenes" which took some or the effectiveness away especially the intense Bloody Mary scene. The scares are more "in your face" more louder and bigger. Seeing the demon terrorize the children is intense and you feel bad for the little sister because she looks so innocent. I think the older sisters character could have been a little more nicer but realistically that's how all young sisters act. The film did have a few false scares that I thought were unnecessary especially one that was in the middle of the film and some scares could have Been more effective and scary in the beginning and middle but still suspenseful. The films ending is probably the most intense and suspenseful endings out of all of them and had me squirming in my seat and covering my eyes that I rarely ever do. The formula that you thought would be worn out was re-energized and Paranormal Activity 3 is a extremely solid sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A six may be too high, but I felt this was the best film of the series so the score should show it. These films are pure gold for the film industry, spend a minimal amount of money, and get a 200 million dollar return. I honestly don't get how they are going to continue this series, it got old and there are only so many times you can rehash the some scare tactics.The characters do their part, just don't expect anything too memorable. In fact the lead male is a complete moron. He seems to enjoy the whole haunting experience, until it bites him in the ass. I don't know about you but if a saw a levitating sheet(ghost) I would have a heart attack, besides he didn't even show his wife the tapes, she has to experience it first hand, in order for something to be done. And I guess innovation in the found footage genre means a rotating camera, so... good job.... I guess. The only reason I feel this one is superior is because it didn't put me to sleep and it actually had some suspenseful moments. The inclusion of demon worshippers was unnecessary, but I guess it was a key to the plot.It's an average film at best, if you want some cheap scares give it a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I sort of wonder how many of these films that they can release until people begin to say that it is rubbish and all that the movie ends up producing is an empty cinema. Well, this one has still managed to bring about a 6 on IMDb, but the forth one has managed to score a 4, which in my experience is actually a really low score (despite it still managing to make money). I also note that Oren Peli has taken a back seat in this one, despite the storyline begun in both of the other movies (though they do not necessarily need to be watched in order) is continued here.Basically, we go back to 1988 when the girls from the previous movies are little and a series of tapes were made of some strange activities that occurred then. However, at the beginning of the movie (which ties in with the second movie) the tapes are revealed, but when the poltergeist trashes the house, which resulted in them getting a security system, the only things that are missing are the tapes, and this movie is the contents of the tape.Surprise, surprise, the guy who sets up the camera system happens to be a wedding video maker and it appears that he becomes so obsessed with what he is going on he pretty much spends all of his time going through the tapes. As they say, there are 6 hours worth of footage on the tapes, and two tapes, so that is 12 hours he needs to spend going through the tapes, and that is if he is not fast-forwarding them (and even then some of the things are so subtle, you would miss them if they were fast forwarded).Basically this movie is pretty much the same as the last two movies (and probably the same as the next movie) where it starts off slow with subtle things, and then the happening get more and more impressive until everybody is killed at the end. However, the way the film is set up, only using footage that has been recorded, means that we can only see things that were actually video-taped, meaning that there is a lot of things going on in the background that we do not see. Also, we are told about the coven that the girl's grandmother was a member off, but true to the nature of the films, there is a lot that is not told.Look, it is an interesting concept, and I do like this style of film-making, which was made popular with Blair Witch Project, however the whole things that go bump in the night does end up dragging on, and they are done not so much to add anything to the film, but rather to make us jump when it happens (and I don't jump at such things). In the end I preferred the movies like Cloverfield and Chronicle, which take these movies to a new level (Chronicle being teenagers with superpowers and Cloverfield being the monster that attacks New York).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stretching the sub-genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While not a good movie, "The Blair Witch Project" was an original movie (other than the deservedly forgotten "Cannibal Holocaust") which accounts for its undeserved success. The sub-genre of found footage films blossomed in its wake although none of the films so far (e.g., "The Fourth Kind"). "Paranormal 3" suffers from the problems plaguing these types of movies. Most importantly, how to have found enough "found" footage to advance the narrative without making the existence of the footage seem ludicrous. Characters run from the ghostly coven that infest their middle market suburban contemporary while holding a camera relatively steady. They peer through closet doors where they are hiding and around corners when being stalked through the lens of what, given the movie is set in 1988, must have been bulky magnetic-tape carrying video-camera with bulky batteries. Generally speaking people don't run for the lives from supernatural creatures with 15 pounds of whirring glass, plastic and nylon covering one eye. OK, say you suspend your disbelief, do you get a compelling film? While it does carry some legitimate frights, too much time is spent watching stationary cameras scanning back and forth from room to room watching children sleep and babysitters getting breathed on by demons (if you were hit with a puff of air in the kids' room, wouldn't you assume it was faulty air- conditioning instead of undead witches or whatever?) In short, the found footage horror sub-genre has mostly played itself out although maybe someone will make a decent found footage comedy or drama in order to liven things up?</fullReview>

How many of these camcorder films have actually been successful? ...and don't you get just the slightest bit nauseated by the constant movement of the camera? I guess that's for you to decide, back to the film. In the third installment of Paranormal Activity, we learn what happened to Katie and her sister when they were little. To be honest with you, I was pretty into this film until the last twenty minutes or so. Without spoiling it for ya, lets just say the story takes a dramatic turn away from the storyline. The result of this is that the overall story isn't as creepy and really doesn't make as much sense as it should. Paranormal Activity was never that scary to begin with, the film plays on the audience by having things suddenly jump out at them, but the story itself has gotten far less creepier as the series has gone on. Part 3 and 4 do have different writer/directors and that may be part of the problem. The first one freaked me out, the second one was a little slow, but also did the trick, and this one really didn't scare me. They relied much more on making the audience jump than they did on scaring them with the actual story. Number three didn't stick with me for days afterward, the way one and two did. As for the cast, they were all newcomers and the little girls were absolutely terrific! This series has a way of finding newcomers who seem like they've been acting for decades. Paranormal Activity 3 is good for a few cheap jumps and laughs, but the ending was really disappointing, leading me to think less of this film than I do of the other two.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK people....I am going to say this and I guess im one of the only people in the world who thinks this way. This is without a doubt the worst franchise in movie history. Every year they seem to be coming out with these and every time its the same old thing....People walking around a house for an hour and 15 minutes then 15 minutes of some loud noises and screaming....I have never been more bored by movies in my life....I have seen all three all with friends( I would never choose to put this on) and they are all the same pile of boring crap.I really need an explanation about why people find these movies decent. You see Im a fan of horror movies like a huge fan and Im a huge fan of drama which means I don't need a lot of action to be entertained...but this movie has nothing...not a good story line...not a bunch of action...nothing at all...just boring...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A comedy for the whole family, including your cute kids and their invisible friends.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw "Paranormal Activity" I knew it'd be a long time before I slept peacefully. The invisible dread that lay with each setting sun, the eventual reveal in the daytime, the forceful nature of the demon, for no determined purpose other than malice, left me shaking. What if this kind of thing came into my home? How would I stop it? The subtle scares, the growling, the breathing. All of those things are what made the first movie so damn frightening.But that was lost to the filmmakers. The audience jumped at things crashing and banging, and so they put together a moderate script and out came "Paranormal Activity 2". Yes, the story was extended, and tied well together with the first. But something began happening. Gone was the dread and dreariness of the original. In its place were nonsensical dialog scenes sandwiched between crashing, banging, and doors opening and closing. The conclusion was slightly more satisfactory than the original, but we all knew, something was brewing, and it wasn't good. It was a franchise, and it came to fruition with this movie, "Paranormal Activity 3".We open with Katie bringing over old tapes, just so we have a reason to have footage to look at. After all, we can't possibly try shaking the gimmicky part of this series for a sensible storyline, can we? After the burglary from the second movie, we find the only things that were stolen were said tapes. So I guess the director and writer of this movie broke into the house and stole them, right? We see Katie and Kristi as kids. Kristi talks to an invisible friend she calls Toby. Dennis, their soon to be father, works on wedding videos and keeps hearing crashing in the house, then eventually while trying to make a sex tape with Kristi and Katie's mom, catches something moving during an earthquake and decides to put cameras all over the house. Kristi continues to talk to Toby, and Dennis wants to know why.Meanwhile, Katie and Kristi's grandmother wants their mother to reconsider marrying Dennis, mostly because it doesn't seem they're going to have a son. Hmm.The activity gets worse. Toby, the demon, pulls a pretty funny gag on the babysitter, pretending to be a sheet-ghost. Then it breaths on her to scare her away. It also attacks Katie and Dennis's partner in crime in a bathroom. Probably the only scary moment in the movie, but for the sheer fact that nothing else in this movie is scary.Toby wants Kristi to do something, but we don't know what it is. When she refuses, he drags Katie around until she accepts. So she tries to convince her mother to go to her grandmothers'. When she refuses, Toby drops everything in the kitchen from the ceiling. Typical demons, messing up the kitchen.So they go to the grandmothers, where we find Kristi getting dressed up for a wedding. With Toby. As it turns out, the Grandmother is part of a cult, and she's giving Kristi and Katie to Toby as payment of a first born son for bargaining with him.Or something like that.The end leaves the viewer extremely frustrated. The previews showed burning houses and demonologists having their head bashed on a table, which did not show up in the film. Instead, it's open-ended.And the fourth movie does not in any way tie those ends up.So, this movie is all crash and bang, and really, it's more funny than scary. Which leaves me with such low expectations as each sequel strays further from the original's terrifying premise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Paranormal Activity' to some people began brilliantly and is currently deteriorating into an irritating movie collection - I couldn't disagree more.'Paranormal Activity 3' is the strongest instalment in the 'Paranormal Activity' franchise because it is able to keep you intrigued, scare you consistently throughout as well as being thought provoking with sequels lined up. Also a nice touch is the added essence of humour which is refreshing when the film isn't trying to scare you as we aren't en- captured in the characters' dull domestics.The reason why 'Paranormal Activity 3' is the most interesting of the collection is because the plot revolves around the early supernatural events that happened to sisters Katy and Kristi as youngsters. We gain a greater knowledge of their experience with the demonic nuisance that struck in the first two films although frustratingly as the film concludes, I was left with more questions than answers.Another reason I hold the film in a higher regard than the others in the collection is that it goes to great lengths to ensure you have to wipe the nervous sweat from your brow and require usage of your deodorant. Directors Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman have a great remedy for producing scares from the two films prior however they have expanded on the original ideas with aplomb and induced a stronger and more consistent fear content to the film.Overall, what it may be lacking in originality, it more than makes up for with improvements on 'Paranormal Activity' and 'Paranormal Activity 2', which make it the most complete movie of the collection that I have witnessed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The further back the Paranormal Activity franchise reaches in its historical time line, the more "incidents" are put up on the screen. This has proved to be a successful tactic at the box office, where the turnstiles have clicked healthily as horror hungry hounds filter in ready for some more "home film" jumps and demon based peril. Yet Paranormal Activity 3 is proof positive the quite often more is not necessarily better.The whole thing just looks so tired, where once was an idea that had you darting your eyes around every corner of a darkened house, where anticipation of the slightest thing chilled your spine, now is the anticipation of what parlour trick the makers will use to ensure you really aren't scared at all. And a major problem is that we are learning more about the demon, thus it actually becomes less interesting.There is some good things in this edition, the roving camera on a fan idea works very well, sequences involving dust and a sheet hint at what a good film it could have been, while a painful incident in the finale has a good jolt factor. But basically it's the same set up only with different characters, where a comedic tone flits in and out and often it's not intentional. The punters piled in to ensure it made pot loads of cash, which inevitably meant at least one more sequel/prequel will follow. Can't say that is appetising in the slightest. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Paranormal Activity 3</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first film was a fantastic comeback for the found footage horror film concept made famous in The Blair Witch Project, the second film was terrible and mostly predictable, and I was expecting this third film to be the same. Basically it starts in 2005 where Katie (Katie Featherston) gives her pregnant sister Kristi (Sprague Grayden) and her husband Daniel Rey (Brian Boland), and we see them put on a video that they don't recognise. It is a video from 1988, where Young Katie (Chloe Csengery) and Young Kristi (Jessica Tyler Brown) live with their mother Julie (Lauren Bittner) and their wedding video making father Dennis (Christopher Nicholas Smith), and Kristi starts interacting with an invisible friend called Toby. Since this Toby's appearance Dennis notices strange things going on in the house, including a momentary earthquake, and captured on video there is a figure seen in dust falling from the ceiling. He watches the footage with his friend Randy Rosen (Dustin Ingram), and he decides to set up camera in three rooms of the house, the parents' bedroom, the children's' bedroom, and in the living room which will rotate on a fan mechanism. Soon scary imagery is caught on camera, as strange noises are made in the house, one of the girls is seen standing out of bed for a few hours doing nothing and a bed sheet standing in air and then dropping. However the interfering with the poltergeist is getting dangerous, to the point when there are loud bangs and crashes, furniture and ornaments are smashed and broken being thrown by an invisible demon, and then the family members are in danger from these incidents as well. The film ends seeing the family moving into another house to get away from the danger, and cameras are still set up, but of course the poltergeist follows them, Dennis is killed with his spine snapped, and the girls are taken away by a possessed Julie, we don't know what happened next. The found footage premise is not as original as the first film, there are certainly some good live effects, like the floating sheet and the kitchen furniture dropping from the ceiling, and one or two alright jumps, but overall it is still not exactly the scariest supernatural horror. Okay!</fullReview>

Something they were fond of making fun, when it came down to the Saw franchise seems to be OK at the Paranormal Activity world. Part 4 (I really do wonder where they are going to take this, this time around) is coming this year. So as with Saw, it's Groundhog Day (or year for that matter) again.But I have to say, that this one seems to get most of it right. While I'm anything but fond of found footage to begin with, they seem to have taken into account what some fans were saying. While still not flawless (work on your characters a little bit more please), it has quite a few effective scenes. One reminiscent of a movie called "Candyman" (you will probably have seen this in the trailer). Only thing that is really weird, is that they haven't done a "proper" Scary movie parody out of it yet!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst of the three</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm always on the lookout for a good horror film and they are incredibly hard to find! Paranormal Activity (the original) was a great film which, for most personality types, created great fear in the viewer during AND after the viewing. For those that weren't affected, it didn't make any impact.I also enjoyed the second one too.Having seen the third one I was very disappointed. It is the earliest film in the timeline, but uses the same old tricks. When it was finished, the first thing that came to mind was the classic film Predator - A brilliant film, excellently done where you didn't know what they were up against right until the end. When Predator 2 came out, it was nowhere near as good because you knew everything already.Having watched 2 films worth of the same techniques, this one really wasn't scary at all. There were one or two jumpy bits but I didn't feel there was any of the tension build up. So it then relies on the story... what story?That story was probably listed in a single paragraph and they said - lets make a film about this. This is one of those films that, if you had not watched the previous 2 films, you would wonder what the hell was that?If you enjoyed the first 2 films, then you should probably watch this - only to complete the story, even though the parts it fills are barely satisfactory. If you haven't watched them, then go watch them instead - they are far better films!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Love the first film, there was so much thought, and attention to detail that created an atmosphere that you don't get very often from films nowadays. THe second, was a step in the wrong direction, it was the same, but with slightly different angles, cashing in on a cheap first film with a more expensive, but still relatively cheap, second.the third? is just getting stupid. and there's probably more to come. These films don't cost much to make, and the franchise name sells it before you need to think of a storyline.THe storyline here is awful. it's not new, it's not clever, and it's definitely not shocking.Aside from the main storyline, in this film, no matter what happens in the opening hour of the film, (a ghost holding up one of the girls by the hair being one example) EVERYONE GOES TO SLEEP IN THEIR BED THAT NIGHT!! are you kidding me? I wouldn't be able to sleep, let alone a little girl that's just been pulled up by her hair, (right by her bed), at the end of every day, after all the stuff that goes on, where most people would leave the house after two days, everyone goes back to normal, for weeks.A few jumps, but ultimately a waste of a great opportunity to make a fantastic old school horror film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie that everyone was saying was the scariest movie ever, but was it really? Not at all. There are some creepy scenes, not scary, just creepy. The scenes are creepy instead of scary because they are just things that most likely wouldn't happen in real life and then do and you get the chills thinking what if that happened to you. For example how the little girl Katie talks to Toby, who is said to be her imaginary friend, and if you were the mom of this little girl I am positive you would be terrified if your child said she plays with her friend and he wants to marry her. Otherwise the movie was not realistic and is pretty much just a replay of all the other paranormal activities just with other characters. The audience that this movie would be best suited for is people who believe in ghosts and demons and it would be more realistic to them then the people who don't believe in ghosts and demons.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>America's scariest Home Videos is back - now with Fan-Cam!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Paranormal Activity franchise represents the first trilogy of films that have been released to theatres since this website started. More impressive though is that for three separate films all mining the same territory released so closely they are all actually pretty good, as long as you don't watch them back to back and realise how samey they are.The first Paranormal Activity dealt with young couple Katie and Micah and the strange goings on in their home.Paranormal Activity 2 was set slightly earlier than the original film, and introduced us to Katie's sister Kristi and her family ? including a young baby and the family dog ? it dovetailed in to the events of the first film quite neatly at the end in a twist that was either lazy or semi-inspired depending on your perspective. I quite liked it.This installment of America's Scariest Home Videos takes things back even further, in fact some two decades earlier circa 1988 where Katie and Kristi are mere young and innocent girls with an 'imaginary friend' named Toby? It also shows us that the obsessive video taping bug might in fact be (tangentially) genetic, as the found tapes were made by the girl's photographer stepdad (I know it is usually the girl's partners that made the tapes).Of course the thing pretty much writes itself from here, but I must admit that I liked the fact that they tried to tie the films together with an explanation ? even if it was similar to those from other films.The rest of the film can be outlined quicker by referring to the first two films because they have obviously decided that hey this ain't broke? The one new and ingenious inclusion is a fan mounted oscillating camera which spans the kitchen and living area. Each 'pan' takes perhaps 12 seconds, long enough that your imagination does most of the work for the filmmakers which leads to a few tense waits where you know something must be coming soon.Which leads me to the strength of these movies; while things need to happen to justify labeling the film a 'horror' movie, the scenes that are scariest are the ones in which nothing is happening. Once things happen they are usually accompanied by a loud noise and/or scream, you inhale quickly and move on, but those lengthy nothing's happening moments are often excruciating in a good way.There are a lot of those moments in these films, and despite myself I quite enjoyed being scared by the same things yet again. In fact Paranormal Activity 3 might well be the best in the series, but good things must end, and I feel that we're done here.(Box Office records say differently though, and the numbers reported for this film practically guarantee that we'll be lining up for PA4 next Halloween.) Final Rating ? 6 / 10. Sure it's predictable and a replica of the other two, but whatever you think the night after is irrelevant, while you're watching it this is tense and often scary stuff (without the gore seemingly demanded by lazy horror-makers). Isn't that what a horror film is supposed to be?</fullReview>

But I must say, I have never been a horrorfan. And so I actually was not sure if I should watch this movie. No regrets. The story is good, although the full explanation of what happened in the past is a bit long. But it is Hollywood, and they don't send you home after 74 or 90 minutes watching in full speed. They give you value for your money. Even the make up is well done, compare to other movies in it's genre, and the jump scare is at the right time, the right place and in the right mood. Hollywood has done well lining it's pockets with cobbled-together rehashes of the original, but I still prefer the romantic stuff...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't go to see this at the cinema. I waited for the DVD and in all honesty, buying that was more than enough I should've spent. A painfully boring story, uninteresting characters and a conclusion duller than a coma is a good way to cure insomnia and a good way to describe PA3.The cast aren't that bad but just not that good either. The girls portraying a young Kristi and Katie do a grand job and add some genuine tension and suspense to the story. The rest of the cast are amicable but I guess it could be because there are more than are needed. The plot had bite at first but lost it's flare 30 minutes in and there was honestly nothing interesting happening in the film until the final half which did get pretty hot. But then the credits rolled! The last 10 minutes although looked chilling, it was just outrageous and pathetic. I remember the first film went out with a few jumpy scenes. PA2 I believe improved on the first film but this has no direction. A lot of the scenes that were featured in the trailer was strangely left out of the final film which annoyed me a little given the fact that they obviously filmed the scenes so why leave them out? And they looked pretty good too. Fans of the PA series will be pleased to know that this cow is going to be milked for a while judging by the amount of revenue each movie pulls in against it's budget. But it would be nice for future films to feature new characters altogether so the concept doesn't get boring and dry which is what has undoubtedly happened to Paranormal Activity 3.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The producers shouldn't have bothered...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just like the other two movies, I was excited to see this because of how the trailer was put together. Let's face it, even if you are not into these movies, the trailers do leave you intrigued. The first one, I thought was good and the second wasn't a bad follow up. We all know film producers have to make a third addition and in this case they really shouldn't have. They ran out of ideas after Number 2 was produced and clearly didn't have anything incredibly exciting to put into the 3rd. When I read the storyline before going to see this movie, I thought it was a good idea to see how the story all began. (That's about the last part of the story you can squeeze out from Paranormal Activity) It was poorly done. To begin with, EVERY part I had seen in the trailer was not even in the movie. I went to check out this movie purely because of how good those particular clips looked. It was disappointing to not even see a glimpse of even one scene. The first part of the movie was a lot of; 'waiting for something to happen'. There was a lot of camera work where the audience would anticipate something would happen - but...it' didn't. Although I know it is based around a reality situation, the script was not terribly well written, it just seemed very repetitive and much like the other two movies. It was more of a case of watching it and thinking that this hand held 'live capture' camera work is getting old now...the idea of it has been played out too much. Don't get me wrong, this movie wasn't ALL bad. There was one or two scenes that were very interesting such as the kitchen scene which I thought was VERY well directed. But for me to say that this was the only thing I enjoyed, deemed this movie very weak for me. The ending was a little awkward to figure out and seemed to end very abruptly. For a 3rd addition storyline being strong, you could tell that not a lot of thought or time went into it at all. Some movies are played out too much and this was one of them...now I hear they are making a 4? Bad idea.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I heard some good reviews about this movie and some people were really hyping this movie up. But than again some of them enjoyed the first two Paranormal which I didn't enjoy watching. I found those 2 movies to be a bit annoying than actually entertaining. Despite the hype this movie isn't a big leap from the first 2 movies. The trailer is also misleading as well which takes some of the believability away not that this franchise had some believable aspects to it. Like Despite the supernatural elements that it can really happen or anything like that. There isn't anything really new with the premise as well, the ghosts or something screws around with the family and the people living in the house goes off and investigate while a member in the family puts it off as nothing. And the creepier the situation gets they investigate even more. But this movie brings about children in the movie, and there innocence and nativity is what builds the scares. There is just something with children in horror movies. I also thought the camera on the fan idea was sort of clever and used alright to build tension on whats going to happen next. The build up this time wasn't as dull and gets straight to it and tries to build tension bit by bit. Overall this is the best in this franchise so far but that ain't saying much. But this is a origin movie of how the first two movies began and how it explained it near the end was somewhat interesting. On the other hand the character decisions keeps getting more absurd, stupid and doesn't make any sense as this franchise progresses.5.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you agree that the first one was superior to the second one, than I think you will enjoy the third one a bit more than the second. It is obviously worth giving it a go, whether this means watching it at the cinema, or renting a DVD/Bluray. Yet, after watching the movie I though that it lacked imagination, originality and direction. They decided to play it safe a bit, but it went wrong in my book. They took the winning parts of the 1st and the 2nd and made a 3rd with a few additions of their own. That is a good strategy if carried out properly. Yet it turned out bad, it ended up repetitive and gave me that feel of 'I think I've watched this movie before'. The direction flaws were that I predicted scenes, the 'when' and 'where' of the happenings.I didn't mind the plot inaccuracies and vagueness. Going back to the first one, the atmosphere was so good that you didn't really care whats the story of the couple, the house or the entity. You just wanted to see what would happen. I wish they could have focused only on that department. Its also a little slow paced at times, and that feeling is possibly due to its similarity to the other ones. I cant help but think that I'm a bit harsh on this, cause its a horror movie that I'm now accustomed with its style. So any sequel is impossible to compete with the original, especially in this genre where its all about the scare factor. Consequently, it is my belief that the 3rd installment was the one they should have taken the risk and went to a different direction.As I said this one beats Paranormal activity 2, it will scare you at some points but not as much. Let me put it this way, you will sleep at night .Goodnight</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greater than 2 less than 1 ? and that ain't remotely bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first installment of Oren Peli's ultra-low budget dramatic horror blew me away. Number two was mid-range and mostly forgettable, but in the third installment, directors Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman delivered in grand comeback fashion.PA3 focuses on Katie and Kristi Rey's first brush with the entity that incessantly haunts Katie (Katie Featherston ? who will also appear in PA4 later this year). Once again, strange sounds and bizarre occurrences lead to a stream of jolts that keeps the tension at a high level ? with some excellent special visual effects that are cool, crafty and comprised of the "boo" factor. Usually, I can't stand horror movies with little kids because we know nothing really bad is ever going to happen to the little bastards. But Chloe Csengery (Young Katie) and Jessica Tyler Brown (Young Kristi Rey) did a fine job. The rest of the cast was solid and helped sell the creep factor all the way through.Sure, some people trashed this movie, and for good reason. The third installment of anything, unless it's THE LORD OF THE RINGS or, on a lesser scale, RETURN OF THE JEDI, there aren't many showstoppers when a studio is milking a franchise to death. But this captured the surprise of the first movie quite well. After all, unlike most horrors that are clearly in the realm of fantasy so we can distance ourselves, the PARANORMAL ACTIVITY juggernaut does its damnedest to present everything as genuine ? and hand-held cameras and their gritty feel certainly add to making that work. And this air of reality may leave many wondering, "What if this could happen to me?" Hence, the troubled nights sleep. For me, this franchise resonates because it's exploiting my own childhood fears. And since I'm bringing my past experiences to the screen, I feel every friggin jolt.As far as averages go, for my money, this is the best horror series ? ever. Yes, I know I'll get a lot of flack for that, but these movies rock my emotional world. Believe me, I'd love to say the HELLRAISER series, but like most franchises, subsequent features become either flat or just bad parodies of the original. For now, PARANORMAL ACTIVITY is keeping it real, fervent and surprising, and let's hope it continues when the latest foray comes to theatres on October 19.SPOILER ALERT: Granted, this third feature leaves us with questions, which will undoubtedly be answered in the fourth venture: Why didn't the house burn down as Katie said in the first movie? Yes, she could have been lying, but who knows what's to come and if the crazy coven wiped her mind free with a spell or something. And what happened to the girls' mother? We'll have to see where Peli, Joost and Schulman take us next.</fullReview>

The ending was definitely a surprise too! It's definitely not for children for even as an adult I was terrified. There is no nudity and little language, which I liked. However, there are a couple of devil signs, but it contributes to the overall plot. The language was also very brief, but it was one of the strongest words. Again, I can only remember one time it was used. Great, scary movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Same tricks, same movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember back when I saw the first Paranormal Activity movie, and I fell head over heels for it. I loved everything: The concept, the subtlety, the atmosphere, the gorilla style camera work, and the effects (what little there were) were great and believable. Upon hearing news of a sequel in the works, I waited with great anticipation, expecting new and exciting surprises. After all, a film like this holds infinite potential in how it's set up and delivered.But all I got was a movie that performed all the same stunts that the first one had. And not only was the activity the same, it was more animated and active. The subtlety was dearly missing from that movie, and I absolutely loathed the way it ended. A very disappointing sequel, to be sure.And here comes along the third movie, this time a prequel. "That should be interesting," I thought. And interesting it was...for all of twenty minutes.There is one glaring flaw present in this installation, and just like the film before it, it's that it does little other than recreate all of the same scares we've seen since the original. Every single one of them. Now, I will give it credit for having a slightly better atmosphere than 2, and there were a few fresh bits that I highly enjoyed, especially one particularly frightening game of Bloody Mary.But in the end, it fails to bring much new to the table. This series started off promising and then simply kept performing the same tricks over and over, and somehow making more money each time. And the "demon", whatever it may actually be, seems to become more and more comically present with each subsequent installment. We've gone from a silent being whose only sign that it's present is a chilling distortion in the audio...to growling like a lion in the wild. Somehow, I don't find that nearly quite as creepy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bigger Budget Doesn't Make for a Better Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first "Paranormal Activity" showed what can be done with a horror film on a micro budget, the second albeit with a slightly larger budget was still relatively effective but unfortunately "Paranormal Activity 3" is where the series starts to miss the mark. Now taking place in 1988, the main focus is on Katie (Chloe Csengery) and Kristi (Jessica Tyler Brown), when they were kids when all the paranormal events began. Their father Dennis (Christopher Nicolas Smith) becomes paranoid that there is something supernatural going on in their home and uses his cameras from his wedding video business to try and film it. If there is probably one word to explain the scariness of "Paranormal Activity 3" more than likely it would be lackluster. Due to a larger budget, directors Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman throw more "jump" scares into the film but most of which are mediocre at best and predictable at worst. That said, the last 15-20 minutes are relatively intense but like the rest of the series ends abruptly and leaves several questions unanswered. "Paranormal Activity 3" is nowhere near as good as the last two, but for those looking for a few cheap thrills it might just do the job.</fullReview>

I honestly cannot believe anyone gave this movie more than five stars at the very, very most. Seriously. This movie does not contain ANY of the trailer scenes which weaken it in my opinion. It has some of its trademark "gotcha" moments and some creepy moments but boring compared to the first two. It does give a little insight in to the history of the series but again, could have been WAY better. Let me guess...Katie(sic?) and the boy go back to the Coven. Oh, so scary.

		<shortDescription>Paranormal Activity Snore!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Paranormal Activity hit the big screens in 2007, it was like a breath of fresh air. Finally filmmakers were able to merge horror and the documentary style filming and make it a success. Then came the second instalment in 2010. Whilst it had lost the feel of originality, it still felt fresh and was an upstanding prequel to the first. Then we come to the the third. The adverts make it look so innovating and somehow more eerie than the first two, but in reality what we got was nothing more than 83 minutes of dull documentary style horror, with the occasional(and i stress occasional)scare.So the scene is set for Paranormal Activity 3 in 1988. Katie and Kristi befriend an entity Tobi that is living in their house. This film is set before the first two and the girls live with their mom and her boyfriend Dennis. When strange things begin to occur Dennis becomes obsessed about finding out what is causing the disturbances.I was left deflated after watching the movie, as I had such high hopes for this franchise of horror films. Tension was built throughout, but i felt it never really came to a climax. The pacing was not consistent, there was suspense without really seeing it through, and the conclusion both dissatisfying and confusing.As i mentioned, the trailer for this movie looked really good, and led me to believe that this was going to be better than the first two. However, in the trailer you see a sance gone wrong, girls jumping from the upper story, closet ghost knocking games, a medium coming to get rid of the ghost and water being thrown on a ghost to reveal its shape. This combination would have made a brilliant third instalment of this franchise, but in actual fact the things that you see in the trailer which make you want to watch it, aren't actually included in the final edit. The one scene that they cut which made me most angry, was the 'bloody mary' scene with both the girls and when they turn off the lights you see the apparition behind them. The combination of everything mentioned in this paragraph would of made for an exciting and chilling edition.The producers decided to go further with the story and try to offer the audience an explanation for the hauntings, by making it a story about satanic women rituals, which is only too similar to that which is seen in The Wicker Man and The Last Exorcism. In actual fact what made Paranormal Activity successful before was that it was edgy and eerie without explaining the goings on and the hauntings.I cannot express how utterly frustrated I am when thinking about this movie. It definitely had potential, and could of been as good as the other two. I can only come to the conclusion that the filmmakers became bored and did not give their whole hearted, undivided attention into it. They should of definitely quit while they were ahead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fear that bump in the night.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Going against theory that part 3 of any movie is lacking that of the original. The original PARANORMAL ACTIVITY satisfied the curious and pleased those that like to scare themselves; but frightening enough. PARANORMAL ACTIVITY 2 was a flat out disappointment compared to its predecessor; but again creepy enough to sustain the viewer's will to be frightened. Now comes PARANORMAL ACTIVITY 3 and I'm pleased with the "prequel threequel" of found missing tapes. Finding a box of missing tapes carries that eager reveal. In spite of what could have went wrong with this episode, it didn't. Even better than the first two, I guess because it goes back to the late 1980s when the poltergeist activity started frightening the family of little sisters Katie and Kristi. We take backward steps of 15 to 20 years to get a glimpse at the demonic nocturnal antics that fostered unforgettable nightmares. Some of the teasing creepy shots in the trailers somehow didn't make it to the movie; that is a damn shame. But still, keep your eyes on what appears in mirrors in the background of certain scenes. There will be times you'll flinch and some times you'll actually grab your seat and collect yourself. Sure the real scary stuff is brief... leaving you wondering what the s#i* was that? Starring are: Chloe Csengery, Jessica Tyler Brown, Christopher Smith, Laura Bittner, Katie Featherston and Sprague Grayden. Well deserved kudos to directors Ariel Schulman and Henry Joost.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Paranormal Activity series is (still) fun, but it's apparent by now that it doesn't have much more new to offer. If you've seen the first two movies, you already will be familiar with most of the tricks this prequel is going to throw at you.&nbsp;Set around twenty years before the first two movies, PA3 focuses on the first appearances of supernatural activity in the lives of young Katie and Kristi. Once again positioned as a "found footage" film, the events are mostly captured by cameras positioned around their home by their mother's boyfriend.&nbsp;A lot of back-story and the origin of the ghostly presence are revealed as the movie goes along. It's good to get some of the mythology of the Paranormal Activity world, but as the mystery disappears, so does the creepy, "this could happen to anyone" feel that was one of the strong points of the movies. You're still likely to jump and be spooked from time to time, but familiarity has definitely set in by this entry. Fans know what to expect, now.&nbsp;If you liked Paranormal Activity 1 &amp; 2, 3 is likely to be worth your time, as well. I actually prefer it to the second movie, and would put it slightly behind the first. It's more of the same, but it hasn't reached the point where the movies are wearing out their welcome quite yet. One the same note, if you weren't a fan before, PA3 isn't likely to convert you.&nbsp;</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I honestly can't blame them for squeezing as much life out of this franchise as possible. Considering the money it brings in. It's certainly going to be the next Saw. Paranormal Activity 3 is a prequel to the previous films. It shows us the young girls and their first encounters with the demon. The film brings in some nice little touches. Bored of the static shots throughout the last two movies. This time there is a camera set up that gently moves from side to side. But since this is in 80s, they have to spend a scene explaining how this is possible. The 80's also mean there are some questions such as, why does the demon only attack during the 6 hours that the tapes run for. He's also clearly a drama queen, as he refuses to smash the cameras before doing some weird stuff. Surely demons are more subtle about causing mayhem. The build ups to the chills are rather creepy, but since we've sat through this twice already, we know we can relax until at least the halfway point. Doors knock, footsteps are heard, and people act like absolute tools. Can't just one of these films have completely likable characters? The mum was such a massive See You Next Tuesday, that I wanted to punch her. Midway it has some awesome ideas for scares which I wont ruin here. And the lack of CGI had me wondering how they did it. I miss those moments in movies. I'd say the movie successfully scared me, which is always good for a horror film. But, being the third part of a franchise I expected some questions to be answered, not have more raised. Doing so has left me less interested in watching the 4th entry, because by now I need some closure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paranormal Activity 3The upside to having a ghost as your best friend is that it guarantees you acceptance amongst the Goths at your school.Unfortunately, the pals of the poltergeist in this horror movie are years away from cliques.Found video footage from 1988 documents the eerie events that Katie (Chloe Csengery), her sister (Jessica Tyler), their mother (Lauren Bittner) and her boyfriend Dennis (Christopher Nicholas Smith) experienced after moving into their new home.Among the activities captured is that of an invisible creature that lives in the crawlspace of the girls' bedroom.A videographer by trade, Dennis rigs the home with cameras and, overtime, obtains some truly terrorizing images.The second sequel to the franchise, Paranormal Activity 3 increases the scares and expands the story, but at the cost of becoming contrived.Incidentally, not all bumps in the night are ghosts. Sometimes they're just the strung-out junkies living in your attic. (Yellow Light)http://vidiotreviews.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Paranormal Activity 3... BOO!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moviegoers hit 12 theaters on September 25th, 2009 to see what some would call the scariest movie they have ever seen. Making a mere $77,873 on its opening weekend, Paranormal Activity spearheaded a movement that would become a horror movie lover's dream. Paranormal Activity 2 opened just a little over a year later on a whopping 3,216 screens and grossed $40,678,424. This is a brilliant feat considering the logistics of these movies. They are low-budget and probably not incredibly difficult to make. They don't need the Brangelina's of the world and they are shot nearly all in hand-held camera mode. Motion sickness galore, people. To top it all off, the most recent installation in the Paranormal Activity trilogy, Paranormal Activity 3, beat both of the first two combined for opening weekend gross with a staggering $52,568,183. This franchise is on a rocket to the moon it seems. Oh, and let's not forget that Paranormal Activity 3 broke the record for highest grossing horror movie opening weekend of all time. OF ALL TIME.It's not like these movies are super advanced with CGI graphics. They are lacking in the blood and guts and thrive mostly on sudden loud noises and things that go bump in the night. Somehow these filmmakers have perfected a formula that keeps butts in the seats and cowards like me covering their eyes whenever there is a quiet moment or a speed-up in the clock on the camera. Paranormal Activity 3 takes the audience back. We travel back to the salad days of our friends Katie and Kristi. Their mom Julie (Lauren Bittner) is decorating a birthday cake for Katie when we first meet her and step-dad Dennis (Christopher Nicholas Smith) is behind the camera catching all of the magic as it happens. The movie doesn't waste any time getting to the good stuff. It is just like the other movies in the way that one person senses something in the house and the other person is in total and idiotic disbelief. There is such a thing as blissful ignorance and I can't say that I blame Julie for taking that route. Moving sucks and if someone were to tell me that there was a violent and evil demon lurking somewhere in the house I moved into recently, I would probably chalk it up to "just the wind" every time too. Much like Daniel ? Kristi's beau in PA2 ? did, Julie is an ignorant pest that wants everything to just be okay so she ignores the proof that Dennis catches on video. Meanwhile, Kristi has started to get up in the middle of the night to talk to someone. This carries over to the daytime completely ruining every notion I ever had about bad things not happening in daylight during scary movies. Her friend's name is Toby and he truly is a jerk. Katie tries to tell her sister that she's just being a baby for having an imaginary friend and Toby gives her what for.The picture in the attic from the first movie is captured in this one and we are also able to see much of why the ghosts are torturing this family. For the sake of doing something different (NOT), our cameras in this film are carefully placed throughout the house. However, this is before digital video and Dennis is limited to what he can do with a 6-hour time limit on each tape. In his infinite genius, he takes apart a oscillating fan to create a way for a camera to scan a room back and forth excruciatingly slowly. This makes it really easy for the movie to scare suckers like me who buy into contrived stuff like this that only happens in horror movies.The last twenty minutes of the movie deliver an unexpected treat for those who have seen the other two films. It is different in that it is longest sustained sequence in any of the movies, and it gives the viewer a real understanding of why all of this dumb stuff is happening. Please keep in mind that this is coming from possibly the only person in the theater who actually screamed during this part.As far as seeing this one, if you've seen the other two, why not, right? If you're going to get wet, you might as well go swimming. Aside from bitterly wishing that I had come up with the idea for the phenomenon that is Paranormal Activity, I enjoy a good scare. These movies work because they are not only frightening when you are at the theater watching them, but they take on a completely new level of terror when you are laying in bed in the safety of your bedroom and you can't be sure whether or not your closet door just moved. Oh, did you hear that? I do believe in spooks, I do believe in spooks?</fullReview>

What would you do if the contents in the DVD was different than what you paid for? This is exactly what's going on with Paranormal Activity 3. None of the footage that were advertised in the trailers were in the actual movie. Now we all know what deceitful advertising is, but this is borderline criminal. I can understand one scene but, when you see that none of the trailers exist in the real movie, you really feel like you've been cheated.Anyway, paranormal activity 3 adds nothing to the series. You still don't know why things happen because they don't bother to explain anything. Just bits of clues about a stupid coven but they never give you the full story. The movie never reveals why the demon or the ghost was bothering with the family, the reason for the killings or the connection between the three events.The acting was suffice enough to keep watching the movie till the end. Characters were likable but they were too shallow for us to care about their fate because there was no character development. It was basically the same thing as watching random people on youtube. You may like what they do on camera but you do not build rapport with them.There are some scary moments still and rather than pulling a boo right in to your face, most of them are subtle. The movie does a good job building the tension and gets to the point fast.If you have nothing else to do, go grab a copy and watch it. It's not a life changing movie but it's not boring either. Just do not expect too much from the movie otherwise you will be disappointed.I give 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Paranormal Activity 3: The Very Last Resort</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paranormal Activity 3 is the second sequel to Paranormal Activity, but its story is chronologically first. It is set in 1988 and it follows the main characters of the two previous movies as it describes how the haunting all started. Precisely, it just describes events, and only at the end offers an explanation of the possible onset and causes for the events we witness in the two previous movies.I think this is a typical case of aiming to repeat an unexpected success and trying so hard, it turns the whole thing into a pastiche. The original Paranormal Activity was a low-budget movie, and it was following a formula that hadn't been successfully used since Blair Witch Project. It also managed to give the formula a new use in applying it to a domestic environment and a new theme. Suspension of disbelief was required, but the movie was coherent within itself and it certainly delivered.Now, this second sequel is the perfect example of the opposite: it basically repeats the same trick, but it tries really hard to be as good as, if not to surpass the original, and it is doomed to fail. In trying that hard, the movie-makers turn to ridiculous plot twists, tired scares (which are so predictable, you can almost tell exactly when and what is going to happen) and just basically the same thing we have watched twice before, but done much worse.I would recommend this movie to fans of the Paranormal Activity franchise and to horror fans desperate for something to watch.My score is 3/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Its been about 3 weeks since I saw this movie but I am compelled to write.I would put PA1 as the best, PA2 as slightly less, and PA3 as slightly less than that in terms of quality. However, I think all 3 movies are far superior to other horror crap out there.So even thought I loved the movies, I have to rant about PA3, but don't think I did not like it. I did.In PA1 we had an evil entity that was completely unfathomable as to how it thought. It was a GREAT alien, evil character, living on a plane of reality we could not imagine.By PA3 we learn that "Toby" is just a lackey for a witch coven. He is merely a step and fetch it demon for the grandmother. This takes away any kind of evil intelligence "Toby" might have had, and makes the entity a less impressive character. I am not as frightened of Toby, because now I know he is just "doing as he is told". What a horrible story idea. Also, now we have to ask - why summon the demon at all? Why have it torture your daughter or granddaughter if the idea is just to produce a male child? It makes no sense at all. At least with a smart and powerful demon, it becomes more chilling if it does things that seem irrational TO US, but not to it. Anyone agree with me?</fullReview>

As for what we got in the theater was OK , it's a very slow build up with a few scares that similar from the first two movies but as usual from a paranormal activity movie things don't get good until right at the end when the real scares come through . In summary I still feel ripped off this movie doesn't deserve the box office take it has however it would have if the trailer content was there so now we know how they are going to sell the DVD " extended version with 10 minutes extra content not seen in theaters " !!! .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A shame they didn't do more with that plot line.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found it kind of tedious; the old routine of setting up cameras and watching bits and pieces of uneventful footage, just waiting for something spooky to occur, has become tired by this point in the series, leading to it being the most unconvincing of the three films to boot. The scares came at a predictable pace, telegraphed by each new round of footage, and none of them were particularly creepy or memorable. Scenes such as the outline of the ghost in dust or the sheet dropping behind the babysitter fell flat for me, feeling forced rather than haunting. That could just be because this is the third time around for these now familiar "activities" but truth be told, I've never found them to be all that effective or convincing. They play like those reenactments on supernatural TV shows rather than legitimate footage; they are, at best, only superficially eerie. A hint of plot finally rears its head during the last sequence (a coven of witches), which made me sit up for the first time during the movie, but it fizzles out with a shock scene for the audience to gasp at rather than something more interesting or satisfying. A shame they didn't do more with that plot line. Anyway, on the plus side, the success of this film should lead to more supernatural and/or hand-held horror, and hopefully better than the likes of what this series has had to offer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Paranormal activity was good but had many flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all you must see it in theaters or you will lose interest and it will seem like a bad movie, which it is not. If you see it in theaters then you will jump more. Also since its a dark theater you don't really have any choice but to watch. Yes, the movie didn't show any of the scenes in the trailer which was only the beginning of disappointments. But there are a few good scenes in which the demon comes.And there are also a few good scares but most of the jumpy scenes are predictable. For example when the babysitter pops out onto the stage or when the doors close. Also, the end was very disappointing. It was OK but it was just confusing and made no sense. The old people, the Bonn fire, and the way end when the Grandmother was taking the kids away. I don't know, maybe it was hinted in the other movies? But I didn't see the 2nd one in theaters so it was boring to me and it lost my attention. So the end of the movie was OK, just left a lot of questions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now, The Cat Is Out of the Bag!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The third entry in the "Paranormal Activity" franchise finally lets the cat out of the bag. If you've enjoyed this low-budget, reality-oriented trilogy about things-going-bump-in-the-night, the big question on your mind should be who or what is responsible for those bumps? Are we talking about a ghost or a demon? "Paranormal Activity 3" dares to venture beyond the first two entries. Indeed, had "Catfish" co-directors Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman with "Disturbia" scenarist Christopher B. Landon done anything less in the third installment, you'd have to suspect their sanity and their sagacity. "Paranormal Activity 3" easily surpasses "Paranormal Activity," but it cannot compete with "Paranormal Activity 2" on a scare-for-scare basis. "Paranormal Activity 2" possessed more startling scenes. You may not scream as often as you did in "Paranormal Activity 2," but "Paranormal Activity 3" will still make you scream. The closet scene gets everybody. Nevertheless, "Paranormal Activity 3" contains something different: a sense of closure. Okay, maybe not closure in the traditional sense of the meaning. The closure here is that you will learn more about the enigmatic forces behind the paranormal activity. You could say that "Paranormal Activity 3" is the beginning of the end. This bloodless, gore-free franchise is about as far as you can get from the bloody, gory "Saw" series. Nonetheless, fans of the "Saw" movies knew the handwriting was on the wall when Jigsaw died. Jigsaw was the genius in the "Saw" movies, and he charted every twist and turn. It was only a matter of time until the "Saw" franchise expired after Jigsaw's demise. Similarly, the clock is ticking on the "Paranormal Activity" franchise. Mind you, Paramount Pictures could still get a few more sequels out of this franchise. Writing a movie review about this kind of movie is like walking on a tight rope without a safety net. Happily, you won't learn about the big revelation in this article, but you will know that it occurs."Paranormal Activity 3" qualifies as a prequel. Keep in mind, "Paranormal Activity 2" was sort of a prequel. Its events played out almost simultaneously with those in "Paranormal Activity." Moreover, the story concluded with older sister Katie (Katie Featherston) driving up to her residence as her boyfriend Micah (newcomer Micah Sloat) appears with a sophisticated video camera. Micah thinks that technology will enable him to triumph over the unseen forces which have been plaguing Katie. The ambitious "Paranormal Activity 2" raised the stakes. Whereas "Paranormal Activity" relied on one camera, "Paranormal Activity 2" boasted twice as many cameras. The first sequel introduced us to Katie's younger sister Kristi Rey (Sprague Grayden of "Wake"), her husband Daniel Rey (Brian Boland of "The Unborn"), Kristi's step-daughter Ali Rey (Molly Ephraim of "College Road Trip"), and Hunter (William Juan Prieto alternating with Jackson Xenia Prieto) their toddler son. Kristi's husband Daniel is a down-to-earth soul who doesn't believe in the supernatural. Indeed, he fired their Hispanic housekeeper Martine (Vivis Colombetti of "Patch Adams") after he caught her wafting incense to ward off evil spirits. Once Daniel had banished Martine from the premises, far creepier things began to occur. Daniel had paid to have surveillance cameras installed, but he rarely believed any of the odd things that the cameras caught. Eventually, some utterly strange phenomenon happened, and an invisible force left a bite mark on Kristi's thigh. Ultimately, Kristi went berserk."Paranormal Activity 3" recaps the first sequel before it turns into a genuine prequel. This time around we meet Katie and Kristi as little girls living with their parents in modern suburbia. Like the houses in the earlier epics, this house looks like the last place where an entity would hide. The only place that gives off bad vibes is a tiny upstairs storage space which is considerably smaller than a closet. Co-helmers Joost and Schulman have changed virtually nothing aside from the time period and the technology. "Paranormal Activity 3" takes place in the 1980s. Wedding videographer Dennis (Christopher Nicholas Smith of "Little Children") and wife Julie (Lauren Bittner of "Bride Wars") notice that some inexplicable things are occurring. Principally, these extraordinary things are associated with Kristi's imaginary playmate Toby. Dennis decides to set up two VHS cameras and maintain surveillance. Like the basement in "Paranormal Activity 2," the upstairs cubby hole becomes a source of contention. The babysitter cannot get out of the house soon enough after Dennis and Julie come home from an evening out on the town. Moreover, Dennis' partner Randy (Dustin Ingram of "Sky High") experiences some of those bad vibes and quits working for Dennis. Predictably, as in all haunted house epics, Dennis and Julie can only take so much before they bail.The biggest problem the uninitiated may encounter with "Paranormal Activity 3" is their lack of familiarity. If you missed "Paranormal Activity" and "Paranormal Activity 2," you aren't going to be sufficiently acquainted with its crucial back story to enjoy the third installment. Basically, the sisters constitute the most important characters. Initially, Katie seemed like the more demonic. She changed in "Paranormal Activity" from little miss sweetheart to guilty-as-sin, particularly during the last few minutes. In "Paranormal Activity 2," Kristi attained that distinction. Meanwhile, the husbands are expendable, and everybody else just wants out. The "Paranormal Activity" movies don't wallow in gratuitous blood and gore. They are reminiscent of the popular soft drink 7-Up. Remember 7-Up's 1975 advertising campaign. The company called its beverage the un-Cola since they shunned the use of caramel coloring. Similarly, like its subtle predecessors, "Paranormal Activity 3" amounts to a un-horror movie. The scares in the "Paranormal Activity" movies are sudden and swift, but immaculate. These movies unfold unobtrusively, gradually intensify, and then deliver a shock when you least expect it. If you've seen the "Paranormal Activity 3" trailers, you have seen the best example: the bathroom scene. Oddly enough, this scene is missing from "Paranormal Activity 3."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Engaging and Exciting than the second but doesn't top the first at all.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Starring: Katie Featherston, Chloe Csengery, Sprague Grayden, Jessica Tyler Brown, Brian Boland, Lauren Bittner and Christopher Nicholas Smith.Directed By: Ariel Schulman and Henry Joost.Review: Here comes the third entry in the widely popular supernatural trilogy. it started with a merely unknown movie that soared to new heights slowly making the first movie one of the most profitable movies ever thanks to the low budget. this movie itself set new records upon its release making it the midnight opening for a horror film ($8 million), the best opening day for a horror film in the United States ($26.2 million), the highest opening for any film in October, highest opening for a film in the fall (September-October), and setting a record opening for the franchise ($52.6 million). this movie serves as a prequel for the franchise, it takes place in 1988, 18 years before the events of first movie showing the childhood of both sisters Katie and Kristi. it may give you a little more information but to be honest, this whole franchise left me quite confused and uneasy following the plot. i have to see the second movie again to connect with this all.Though i wasn't excited at all for this movie at first but i could not stay away from this movie. and also the fact that it got slightly better reviews than the second movie so i made up my mind to watch this movie. i was surprised that this movie was more engaging and exciting than the second which felt flat in many ways. now i still admit that the whole appeal of this series have been wore off. i thought the first one was something of a change in that severely overdone and clichd Horror movies genre with a fresh subject and approach. i mean i personally felt extremely scared and found myself literally traumatized by the whole horror effect of the first movie. i was thinking about it for days and couldn't stay alone or in dark in my house. i guees this a great idea to scare people with a monster or whatever thing that you don't see but makes weird things happen in the house and with the people. this is exactly what scares me to my guts rather than those layers of Makeup monsters or computer generated scary creatures or maybe the masked serial killers. i still enjoyed it because it was slightly well made and had good time while it did scared me but felt that it lacked the whole feel of freshness which in this movie didn't quite matter but was really missing in the second movie.Now i think it was a good idea to give this movie to the Director duo who previously brought a Mockumentary if you want to call it that, Catfish. i really liked it and thought they did a good job with this one too. their direction felt really good and different in a manner it makes you more scared. well at the end it feels exactly like the second movie but the first one was very different from anything i ever saw. another thing i noticed was that what you saw in the trailers was something you will never find in the movie. it really worked the idea of that and i found myself surprised by it. Pacing was not a problem in this movie, it was well organized everything. i was surprised when i saw the trailer which showed very latest type of cameras being used which made me thinking that how on earth do they have such technology in 1988? but then it was shown that this is what he did, he was professional, Dennis, which explained everything.Performances from the two young actresses that played Katie and Kristi were really good and i liked both of them. everyone else were nice. the actor who played Dennis, i thought at first was the same actor who played Micah in the other movies. i was not quite sure about Dennis' character he felt a bif flat to me. Screenplay was nice but not good. now i really understand what happened and how these three movies are connected.There were some reallt scary and weird scenes like that "Bloody Mary" scene was something that freaked me out so much, the oscillating camera thing was genius. the earthquake scene, the Kitchen scenes or the one with the young girls. i was terrified by them so much. the end of this movie is gonna mess you up so much. when i understood everything i was in a shock. a movie that terrifies you so much and is enjoyable in its own unique way, something that many viewers doesn't find interesting but i do very much. but you see still it ends up doing enormous amount of business at the Box Office meaning many people loves this idea. Go for it. get freaked out.Rating: 3/5 C+Visit My Blog: Hollywoodandme.Blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Want some Punabnormal activity! Read my movie reviews such as this one!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's around 3:27 a.m. and I have decided to write my movie review of "Paranormal Activity 3", and I even have a camera filming me as I write the review. What is the camera going to capture? Just a bunch of punabnormal activity in this movie review, as in all of my other reviews. "Paranormal Activity 3" is a prequel to the past "Paranormal Activity" movies. It's set in 1988 when sisters Katie &amp; Kristi Rey were little girls. We all know what happened in the mid 2000's to Katie and Kristi; if you don't, this is a good time to stream or netflix "Paranormal Activity 1 &amp; 2" or stop reading this review before I become a spoiler spirit. Similar paranormal happenings occur in "Paranormal Activity 3" as it did in the first two installments, and the same suspense elements work to the creepy "t" in 3 as it did in 1 and 2. In this one, there is an invisible entry named Toby who may or may not be in the spirit, but that is "toby or not toby" for all to see. Directors Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman keep the paranormal suspense alive and well in "Paranormal Activity 3" with plenty of gravitating trepidation while the camera stands still. The power of the Paranormal films is that it solidly shows the calm before the ghostly storm as a crucial foreshadow to what lies ahead. Oren Peli (who directed the first installment) once again stayed on board with the Paranormal project by serving as Producer to "Paranormal Activity 3". Why not? The Paranormal has made Mr. Peli a millionaire; Oren you smart? The paranormal ending does not disappoint in "Paranormal Activity 3" and the finales are the paramount parts of all three Paranormal movies. So have a Bloody Mary or two or even three and check out the "Paranormal Activity 3". **** Good</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OMG you would think the PA people, after pulling off the first movie, which was brilliant; and the second movie, which was actually a very good remake; could have made the third movie amazing. After all they had all the right material, all they had to do was to explain the holes from the first two movies and this movie could have been the best of the three. Instead they decided to do the same old thing (I think another reviewer said they remade the Wicker man - yet again), which I think is a very accurate description of this third installment.The scares were the same and the story was ridiculous with an ending that was a total let down. In fact I went to the movie because they advertised that the final fifteen minutes would blow you away. Well, during the final fifteen minutes I found myself falling asleep and then when I saw the ending credit start to roll I said to myself "where are the final fifteen minutes? When was this movie going to get scary?This movie was a total ripoff so don't waste your time or money by going to see it. In fact you'd be better off recording the trailers on TV and pasting them all together, which would make a better movie than this one and a totally different movie since not one of the trailers was in the movie. What amazes me is that the picture studios keep ripping people off with trash like this movie and then they complain about pirating. Well, I'm sorry I paid to see this movie; if you don't want to record and paste together the trailers then pirate the damn thing because it isn't even worth a buck twenty on Redbox.P.S. Please kill off this franchise because the third movie was the nail in it's coffin.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hmm, how to describe Paranormal Activity 3? I guess I should start out by saying that it was at least more enjoyable then the second film of the series, though still certainly not as good as it could be. At this point the series has been overdone, the first movie was interesting, I'm a fan of the "at home camera" style and even the story line from the first movie wasn't that bad. The plot was somewhat original but the fact of the matter is they're not scary films. The third one just became ridiculous however, what with the grandmother making a pact with a demon to marry her granddaughter and have her first born son, really?! I had high hopes for the first movie one it came out and though it matched some of them, its sequels thus far have been ridiculous and I have a feeling that it will become another Saw series, with an outrageous number of sequels and ridiculous story lines. If you haven't seen this movie yet and plan to, I suggest waiting until it's on TV for free and you don't have to pay for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fails to live up to the hype or its predecessors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What does it take to scare people in today's cinemas? Suspenseful timing, believable emotion, relatable characters? Well, Paranormal Activity 3 tries to scare its audience by using as little of these things as possible. Set in 1988, when the two leads of the first two movies in the franchise are young sisters, PA3 uses the same (nearly identical) opening premise as its predecessors: a young family that begins to hear weird noises which leads the 'man of the house' to set up cameras around his home like a pseudo-Big Brother. Following the two previous scripts to the letter, the noises and strange occurrences become more and more erratic or 'scary', and by the 70 minute mark, life in the house becomes unbearable as the demon/entity/bad guy starts slamming doors and moving kitchen utensils. The real question on everyone's lips though is the obvious. Is it scary? Short answer, not really. As someone who thoroughly enjoyed of the first two instalments (the first one in particular), PA3 is a real disappointment and is for a number of reasons. Firstly, as it is a prequel, you have a pretty general idea of who is going to live and die (if any), which leaves little room for any great amount of suspense. That said, there is a slight 'twist' in the final five minutes, but anyone that paid attention to the first two films will guess the 'twist' in the first five minutes. Another let down of this film, the third in a highly successful franchise, are the characters. In Paranormal Activity 1, Katie guided you through the story and while Katie Fetherston may not win any Oscars anytime soon, you felt for her and you were completely taken in by what she was going through and rode every bump, scream and cooking pan with her. This time round you don't really care for any of the characters or their safety (I found myself at one point cheering for the demon), which is never a good sign. The timing and pace of this one is also completely off as the producers have obviously reached a point at which they are out of ideas to build suspense, having to come up with strange ways to make looking at an empty room suspenseful (you will be cursing the 'fan- cam' by the end of it), and when they did manage to build the suspense, the majority of the time it amounted to nothing, a trick that gets old quickly. The exception to this is the Bloody Mary scene, which no, is not a tribute to Gaga, but is perhaps the only point the suspense is built and executed well. But hey, 1 scene out of 90 minutes isn't bad, right? All that being said, my two friends loved this and said they were deeply shaken by the end, something I could not understand, so perhaps it is just me. I just would find it hard to imagine that anyone who liked the first one for what it was, would find this one anywhere near as suspenseful or well executed as the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I want my Money back, I have never witnessed blatant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow what a total reverse engineering of a below par film...Lets trick the movie going public into seeing a real lemon. The trailer is what got me in to this movie- with my 20 year old daughter, and my ex-girlfriend (yeah, that would have made for a better movie actually)....Anyway, I am a current full time student in Animation and special effects in film. And i am always amazed at the dribble and garbage that the studios and distributors actually let make it to the theaters. They really do not care to entertain us as of late, just find a marketing illusion to get us all into their final edit of warmed over trash. I mean come on, totally missing are at least 80% of the scenes from the trailer, that made me want to see it in the first place....What is with that? I'll tell you what, they knew this was a turd way before release, yet still its making money by falsely getting you and i into the theater through showing possibly interesting acts and scenes in the film...but none of the scenes were in the actual film, ( and I agree with many of the other reviewers that these cool scenes (questionable now) will get into the bonus features of future DVD and Bluray...It's a travesty, to say the least. I feel like I bought into a possibly good time at the movies, then I think they punched me in my gut and stole my popcorn. I mean this couldn't be more of a marketing ploy, to rip people off. Hey, I have never wrote a review here but I have followed reviews here for over five years. I found myself possessed enough to write this as a warning to possibly save someone else time and their hard earned cash. I wish I could get my time and money back. Not only did they show an entirely different set of circumstances from what was in the trailer, but it looks like they had one story, and then at the 3/4 run time mark they totally change the entire premise. Along with that very hard to swallow fact...the acting is so for lack of a better word "bad" "unwatchable" , hilariously not scary,...and on top the technical errors....analog is not the new digital...but it seems to be in the 1988 scenes of this movies story....Wow, this is my first review, and i apologize if it is not very professional in format, but I felt compelled to let others know that this movie is all about taking advantage of the movie going public's intelligence, bait and switch them all, and take our money and deliver nothing at all in return. Except maybe a reason to actually write a first time review of a piece of crap. OMG, please do not add to the undeserved attention or popularity of this dreadful piece. I want my money back...really! To go from possible haunting by an unseen entity to totally changing the premise to a subject that has absolutely nothing to do with any of the previous films(spoiler, I wont say, because i know you still may want to see this, but do yourself a favor and resist the temptation, I wish i did).I am so amazed at the lack of integrity, in most films today- but this really is the cherry on top for what i feel is still yet to come....'cause people if we buy into crap like this, what else are we in store for in future releases. I want to be entertained, not pitched to and then forked over. I hope i was at least semi clear, and i save at least one person the cost of admission....go see whatever else is out there ( or stay at home and watch a movie from the past that actually was scary), and if you want to see a real scary scenario just watch whats happening with our economy...just a joke that's unfortunately true!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Trailers were better than the movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The trailer scenes that quite a few folks have mentioned were better than the movie itself. Only two scenes creeped me out, and that was the 'ghost' scene with the babysitter with the sheet and the dad getting killed the way he did. If they would've added the trailers in the movie and made the trailers very vague, then I'd probably would've given it a 8.Also didn't care for the witches coven aspect. It helps explain the demon coming about, but took away some of the eeriness of it it seemed. It just seemed to deflate me a bit at that point of the movie. The mom hanging got it intense again, and the next scene was probably my favorite of all them when he gets contorted backwards. Ouch!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clich With a Few Jump Scenes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film is a prequel to the first Paranormal Activity, but naming is Paranormal Activity 3 is misleading. The title makes you think it will be a sequel, but someone who hasn't seen the trailers and knows little about the series will have no idea what's going on and who the characters are. The film is about Katie and Kristi and their parents in the 1980s. Katie thinks that she is seeing a man named Tobe, no wait, not a man but rather a demon. The mother denies the fact that Katie thinks she is seeing Tobe so the father sets cameras around the house. This sounds very familiar to the previous films doesn't it? Well, as the film progresses on and on more paranormal activity comes into play.The film is shot using two cameras. Many scenes are played at night and very little stuff goes on for the first half of the film or so. It feels like you are watching the same scene over and over again, it gets really boring. This movie took scenes and ideas from previous popular films before this that if you have some experience watching the movies before hand you know what is coming up. I think it is safe to say that Paranormal Activity 3 is a clich horror film.The film follows the same formula as its previous films. Something strange happens, family sets up cameras, stuff happens then the film ends. I will admit that the movie made me jump a couple times but it won't give you nightmares or you won't be scared after leaving the theater. It was very predictable at points and there are no actual camera angles it is always shot from a single hand-held camera. Paranormal Activity is shot in the form of a documentary pretty much.The title is misleading, also. Paranormal Activity 3 sounds like another sequel, and judging by the ending of the second one you think there can't be anymore. But no, just another reason to try to make money. Paranormal Activity 3 is a prequel, and so a common name for prequels contain the words "The Beginning". This is just going to be another series that is strictly just going to be made for the money. The series is always shot on low budget with actors with rarely any experience at all and single setting scenes.No I don't hate the movie if that is the idea you are getting, but just the way it was filmed and the fact it seems like you are watching the same thing over and over again bugged me a lot. It ties in nicely with the other films and it completes the series. There is a cliffhanger that is a sure setup for another sequel, which I hope draws the conclusion to the series for once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What I thought of the movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently watched paranormal activity 3 and would have to say that I am not impressed. Having watched the first two movies I already an idea of what i thought would be the plot of the third. The movie was in fact scary because of the camera work and all the little special features done by the editor. however, the plot of the movie was not as appealing. I feel that the movie should have explain a little bit more about how the "Demon" came to be and why is it that this particular family is continuing to be haunted and tormented by it. I feel the movie has great effects and was scary in the sense of things popping out on you but didn't really impress me as far as a good story line goes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS FOR PA 1 &amp; 2 The first two Paranormal Activity films are terrifying. Your presented with a rather mundane and placid place where a supernatural presence slowly but surely grows and becomes more vicious. The normality of the speech and environments builds up this ordinary nature, but it's the small details that clinch it. The 'magical' figures of the first and second films include a psychic, a mysticism familiar house maid, and a mentioned demonology expert. These all exist.The demon is difficult to understand and unknowable in it's motivations, which makes it more unpredictable and frightening.SPOILER FOR PA 3 What don't exist are the mythical satanic witch covens summoning up demons and marrying people off to be brides of Satan. It killed my ability to buy into the real of the film, because it felt so fake. Their grandma's appearance screams witch from the very beginning, and if the audience can make that connection while watching a snippet of the fictional family's life, than so could the guy taping everything.In addition, the application of the name Tobi, the cult around him, and his rather yawn inducing need to marry the young girls leaves me cold. So, the unknowable demon just wants to get hitched? To a little girl? Give me a break, he went from terrifying otherworldly to pathetic demon living in it's mom's basement.The majority of PA 2 is pretty good, with a few more cheap scares reducing some of the quality, but are excusable. Over all, the ending was bad enough to bring down the overall quality of the movie. I was scared for about 75% of the movie, but as soon as they took a trip to Grandma's house, it lost me. She was an obvious witch, her house was like a museum of "I revel in Satan" but Dennis just can't put two and two together and get them the hell out of there.It's scary for a watch, but I don't recommend wasting a theater outing on the worst installation of the series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Found Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As "found footage" goes, Paranormal Activity 3 rates with The Blair Witch Project (1999) by keeping a certain tension even though the audience eventually knows it's hokum, or rather that it's just a good spook tale best told around a campfire at Halloween. In this prequel to the other installments the two little girls begin a relationship with an unseen boy, Toby, who manifests only by occasional strange activity caught by dad's omnipresent camera.Returning writer Christopher B. Landon and directors Henry Joost and Ariel Schuman have dad Dennis (Christopher Nicholas Smith) plant home video cameras in two strategic spots, the little girls' bedroom and the kitchen and living room areas. In the latter spot an oscillating fan has the camera strapped to it so the camera can see into both rooms, sweeping like radar to pick up any stray movement. The surveillance in both areas creates a tension that is almost purely anticipatory for most of the film with a few occult occurrences. Falling ceilings and powerful blasts remove household objects from their moorings and toss bodies around.Needless to say the usual tropes are here: wife Julie (Lauren Bittner) doesn't believe kids or dad that the occult is happening; false starts abound including an effectively ghoulish mask striking fear as it jumps out; the kindest characters may turn out to be the unkindest.Perhaps the slasher chainsaw shows and knife-slashing nightmare films have made this bloodless "reality" more enjoyable for its restraint, or maybe we do fear the things that bump and grind in the wee hours. Whatever, Paranormal Activity 3 delivers chills by replicating every child's fears after the lights go out.Despite our immersion in these antics over the years, when they are done well, as here, the effect is still frightening. Take that you TV reality shows.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Missed Opportunity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The major disappointment of PA3 is the fact that the trailers misrepresented the movie. The first two PA movies were scary and fun because they only touched on aspects of why these events were happening to seemingly innocent people. People that could be you or I at any given time. The viewer then had to gleam what little information we could get from subtle conversations and nuances to understand why these events were taking place.Then the franchise comes out with a third film that could help shed light on these occurrences. In the trailer a viewer gets excited because you might get to understand why the house burnt down. Why they refer to the mother as seemingly crazy and horrible. Why in the second movie they refer to always being part of sances. But NO they take you on a whole different path. I watched the movie wondering when these moments would occur and when theses questions would be answered.It felt like the movie shifts half way and switches from Paranormal Activity to a modern day Rosemary's Baby. I left the theater counting all the scenes I was expecting to see from the trailer to be totally stunned that it was almost all of them. I felt cheated. I felt like I went to one movie and was given a totally different one. It would be like them cutting Voldamort from Harry Potter! I have read other people say that movies cut clips from trailers all the time and I get that for instance in Bridesmaids they cut a hole bunch of scenes from the trailer and I still felt cheated but at least they got the gist of the movie. In PA3 I felt like I was lured into one movie and shown another.I understand that the makers of PA3 didn't want to show all the good scenes from the movie but I think with a more subtle trailer they could have a achieved the same effect. I think the movie in general could have been scarier by not clubbing you over the head with why the demon was attacking these girls. Instead it left you puzzled in the wrong sort of way like going into a movie thinking it is a comedy and it being dark and serious.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Paranormal Activity 3 Review: By Dale Lawson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having already seen the previous 2 Paranormal Activities I had a vague idea of what the third film would entail. There would be no soundtrack, lots of hand-held cameras and of course scenes that build the suspense up and up until you jump out of your seats. I however do not classify Paranormal Activity 3 as a horror for the simple reason that when you leave the cinema you are no longer frightened but find yourself questioning the plot of the film as you try and piece together what actually happened. Using hand-held cameras for horror films is a clever way to make the audience believe that what they are watching is actually real. This is the one aspect of Paranormal Activity 3 that I will praise, as by using hand-held cameras it not only creates the illusion of reality but also helps build the suspense when on a tripod. Although it is more complex than the previous two films it still leaves the audience very confused when they leave. The first Paranormal Activity was actually a well made film by a few students in America, making the plot somewhat original and enjoyable for people to watch. Especially when so many people believed the film to be real footage (even though cinemas clearly wouldn't show a scene of death). So when watching the 3rd film in the series I cannot help but think that Paranormal Activity might end up a lot like the Saw franchise, where the first few films were new and interesting but as the series dragged on, so did the plot. Unusually in this film it wasn't the child actors letting it down but in-fact the male actors. I said earlier that the film tries to create a sense of reality. But unfortunately any belief of reality disappears when the husband or his friend act afraid (or not afraid as is often the problem) So if you're a fan of the first two Paranormal Activity films, bad acting and confusing plots then you will like the third movie in the series. But without completely putting anyone off this film I would like to say that I did stay engaged throughout the whole movie, and did leave hoping for there to be a sequel, just to find out what happens next in the franchise. http://dalelawsonreviews.tumblr.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where is the activity gone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I knew watching sequences is always risky because I think almost every time first one is the best one. However I hoped to be wrong and saw this and it turned out that I wasted my time and money. Trying to scare people using silence and darkness has never been that cheap. They lost the soul of Paranormal Activity because there was no activity. So what can I say, obviously mass production has killed one more movie. The same directors had reminded me of Blair Witch when they use shaky Handycam in their other movie or documentary Catfish and now with the bath seen they do it again. It was like a seen from Candyman, I hope it is only me who feels that way. It is shame that they spent 5,000,000 Usd but make a movie as bad as Paranormal Activity 2 but at least budget of it was only 2,750,000 Usd. So although they spent twice more than previous one result is almost the same even can be counted as worse as it is kind of repetition. I recommend you to stay away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but it doesn't even come close to the first or 2nd.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am such a fan of this series, I find that it's far more original than a lot of the other horror franchises coming out of the states recently, it's even more amazing that these films deliver genuine thrills and are made for a minuscule amount, however this installment just does not cut it in my opinion. It's good in parts and does a great job of delivering a few scares, some of them not even paranormal ones, it also does a terrific job of recreating the 80's, all the way down to the stonewash jeans.Katie Featherston is so cool, even though she isn't really an actress I would easily put her on my list of favorite actresses, unfortunately she isn't in this installment very much and the parts that she is in are not scary. This installment focuses on how these two sisters got a very angry demon following them through their lives, so it goes back to when they were only children and that's when we find out the history of the situation, so Katie isn't in this movie very much and it was very disappointing for me personally.The scares in this movie are OK, one in particular in a kitchen involving all the furniture is probably the best scare in the entire franchise, with the exception of that though the scares are not that great. Another thing that I didn't like was the ending, to me it really bad and got too far away from the actual storyline. I hope there is a fourth movie, and I hope it tracks the story of Katie when she stole the baby from the 2nd film. I can hope and pray fir more Katie, she's one scary lady. Still go see it though because it is a good movie, just not as good as the others. Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm gonna go out on a limb and say there's another PA in the works...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That's all I could think after seeing this movie.I'm not gonna lie, I had zero expectations with this film considering everything spooky that could've happened already did in the first one.I got how the first two connected: the baby. Obviously, the demon wanted Hunter and used Katie to get him. That's great. We got an explanation as to why Katie wasn't killed in the first one and it tied nicely at the end to give us that, "Oh! So that's what happened after she killed Micah!" conclusion.But why did the demon want Hunter to begin with? That was question. What did these two girls do in their childhood to make a demon want the first born boy? Both lead female characters (especially Katie) eluded to certain events from their childhood that might hold the answer, but nothing more came from those conversations.So here we are 4 years later and we still only have half the puzzle. Everything we need to know to fully understand what happened is edited out! Please tell me why a director or writer would do a scene that explains something but then edit it out? It makes no sense and leaves the audience scratching their heads (people who have seen the movie know what I'm talking about).The scares are not scary. In fact, the true scares would be in the trailers. I will say this though: there are 2 incidents (both in the kitchen. Again.) that had me go, "Oh that's kind of cool. I wonder how they did that?" But is that what you want an audience to ask themselves in the middle of a horror movie? Of course not! You want the audience to jump and say, "WTF just happened!" Granted, different things scare different people. What some find silly, others find terrifying. But there's really nothing here to scare. The formula in this film follows the other two, just less so. The only thing they improved was mounting a camera on top of a fan, which could've been a great advantage for this movie, but it was grossly underused. They might as well have had a stationary camera instead.And we are still scratching our heads to try and figure out what happened to the mom? What happened to the supposed fire that both previous films refer to? Why is the mom so obtuse about everything? So many questions that have come from ambiguous answers. I left the theater thinking that this is just another way for them to make another PA movie to fill in the holes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the third installment of the Paranormal Activity franchise. It's a prequel of sorts as it fills in more of the backstory of the original film. This movie was originally a one trick pony. The first one had unique premise and it was fine as one movie. This is another example of how an idea can get run into the ground. The few good startling bits were separated by long parts where nothing happened but sleeping and panning. This movie did make me afraid: afraid someone would see me coming out of this movie. For all of its attempts to give us character development, it was not enough to make me interested. This movie scares up a red light.To read more go here http://fatsamuraireviews.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paranormal Activity 3... wasn't good, as usual the ending left you disappointed, I wasn't expecting much. The problem with Paranormal Activity movies is that they COMPLETELY rely on jump scares. OH MY GOD A PAN FELL! OH MY GOD A LIGHT TURNED ON! OH MY GOD A DOOR SHUT! I would respect these movies more if they at LEAST lead up to things with more suspense but they don't, they're predictable! For example, (Spoiler alert area) remember around the end where the dad walks slowly up to his daughter to try and get her attention when she's crying? You just KNOW that she's gonna scream, growl, whatever to make you jump. Jump scares are a cheap thing to rely on a whole series with. Or when the wife jumped out of the closet wearing the mask, before that you just know something will happen. My friend next to me was predicting what would happen next throughout the whole movie and every time he made a prediction he was correct. But I will give the movie this, in this one, "paranormal activity" occurred in a more spread out form which surprised me, unlike in the previous ones where EVERYTHING happens at the very end. To that thumbs up. However my last complaint is that in these movies including this one, NOTHING WAS BELIEVABLE! (Spoiler Alert Again) That mother was completely stubborn as to not listening to her husband or her very own kid when they tell her something's going on, if I had a kid in the future and they came running up to me crying I'd think "Hm... maybe I should check out what my husband's been filming for the past 3 WEEKS! But not this mom no, she's a dimwit and finally realizes when only something happens to her that "Durrr maybe we should leave now". I disliked this movie greatly, and I wish they'd stop capitalizing off these movies. That is all.-Pictoron at http://www.youtube.com/user/Pictoron</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film had a pretty interesting idea with the imaginary friend Toby, but not only were none of the cool scenes shown in the trailer in the actual movie, but every "scary" part of the movie was a jumper-style moment that you could predict a solid 5 seconds before the moment.There were also huge holes in the plot. Why wouldn't any of the sisters remember half of the third movie it was was supposed to be a prequel? Why was Katie so oblivious in the first movie, if she lived through the third movie? It can be hard to tie up holes if you don't expect to make sequels, but they could have done a much better job.Don't waste your money unless you really liked the first two. It's more of the same.

		<shortDescription>Worst of 2011? Nope. But the most boring? You bet!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>** out of (****)The biggest slam against "Paranormal Activity 3" isn't that it's not scary, which is still a disappointment in itself considering that even 2010's offering conjured up some nice scares. But that it's so tedious, it's like a chore sitting through it. The first thirty minutes are just unwatchable. Do you seriously have to spend half an hour doing absolutely nothing. No likability in characters, no scares, just. plain. boredom. I wish the demon killed me for a second. The next forty or so minutes? The tension starts to build, but just barely. Repetition is key in this movie. If I saw that goddamn camera swivel one more time, I would've put a gun to my head. (You'll see what I mean when you see the movie). The scares just copy each other and it's the same crap. Someone scares someone (yeah, it wasn't even funny the first time, imagine seeing it 3+ times in a row), cue generic jump scare, and add a noise or a squeak (which are so subtle/little, if you blink or don't hear for a second, I guarantee you'll miss it). And, what everyone is talking about! The last fifteen minutes? Absolutely NOTHING. I felt like, maybe it was some kind of joke everyone was playing on me. No, nothing, zilp, zitch, nada. No payoff WHAT. SO. EVER. And then the credits rolled. First off, the acting. Now the acting is actually pretty decent. No one really got on my nerves, which was pretty good. But the characters were just SO clich. For a movie series that's suppose to break the mold of clich, it's funny seeing all of them. Insert the interested dad ghost-hunter, cue the "it's-not-real-this-stops-now" mother, and the kids who've seen it all and you have this movie. The script? Confusing as hell and not worth deciphering. I don't care what explanation you give me, the ending simply did not make sense at all and was just flat out stupid. Even if Einstein can give a reason, I'll still call some smelly, ugly BS. Now for the fun part, the scares. How dare you make a "Paranormal Activity" movie and then take away all the scares? Without the scares, you have no movie. Everything, just everything is gone. Not to mention the scares are EXACTLY the same as the first two. No wait, even the first had more scares which were more original than this one. And please guys, since your movie isn't scary, the least you could've done is not made it so boring. I'm surprised this movie has a 6.5 rating. But where I felt the most cheated, the last 15 minutes. I didn't care about the movie, I didn't care about seeing the iconic trailer scenes (which weren't EVEN IN THE MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!), I cared about the climax. The reason why we came. Let me tell you something. I felt so cheated like Hollywood just bitch slapped me in the face, sucked out all the money in my wallet, and then said with a smile on their face "Come back next year! :D" NOTHING. HAPPENS. No big, climactic setpiece. No epic human vs. demon. NOTHING. HAPPENS. Let me stick that into your brain so that it becomes clear. Worst of 2011? Nope. But the most boring? You bet! Aside from some interesting camera techniques/angles and a decent buildup, this movie just never takes off. In "Paranormal Activity", the last 15 minutes were absolutely terrifying. My heart was pounding so much, I thought it was going to pop out of my chest. I sat there, just frozen, shoken by terror. In "Paranormal Activity 2" those last 15 minutes were something. Intense, adrenaline-pumping, I was at the edge of my seat. "Paranormal Activity 3"? Absolutely nothing. If you rate this movie any higher than a "5", I'm really scared to think what you consider a good horror film. Now that's scary!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Biggest disappointment / let down in movie history!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think the trailer that sold everybody on this movie was better than the actual movie itself! When I first saw the trailer for this film I was super excited and couldn't believe some of the new scary stuff that was gonna be in it... That is what I "thought" was gonna be in it. Everything that was in the trailer WAS NOT in the final cut of the film. Which in my opinion is false advertising?!? The ONLY reason this movie got a 4/10 was because the directors tried to make the film live up to the trailer. For example, they kept making you think katie was about to jump of the balcony, there was a Bon fire instead of a house on fire, katies mom (instead of flying backwards) gets thrown forwards, instead of two girls playing bloody mary a grown man and little girl play it, and instead of a girl throwing water on "toby" to reveal it figure, dust falls on him. Beside the fact that i Went to see a completely dif. Movie than I thought, I was utterly disappointed with what I did see. It was not even comparably as good as the first 2. The story line wasn't as good and the scares seemed more predictable than I remember.( it was still pretty scary though!!) not to mention the ending was way worse than the first one. All in all this movie was exceptionally disappointing, and the true question is, did "paranormal activity 3" leave you wanting more, or expecting more... And in this case, it left me expecting more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Paranormal Activity 3</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based in 1988 and shown through a series of VHS tapes, Paranormal activity 3 is a prequel to its predecessors. The movie revolves around a young family and the strange happenings within the family home. The connection between the events in the house and the seemly innocent arrival of the youngest daughters invisible friend, Toby, soon unfold.Written by Oren Peli, who brought us Paranormal activity and this years earlier box office hit, Insidious. Oren doesn't bring much new to the table with Paranormal activity 3, essentially it's the same scares and slick camera tricks, what I would say is that they have taken this successful formula, refined and polished it. The film effectively builds suspense throughout which winds up the viewers nerves before splintering them with a succession of jumps and frights. With the most likable cast so far, significantly better acting and a much needed dose of humour, this makes an excellent addition to the series. The attention to detail and 80s memorabilia is noteworthy, the much loved Teddy Ruxpin bear is a gentle wink to 80's children watching the movie as adults.At 84 minutes, the movie is short by any standards, with the last fifteen minutes or so, attempting to address some unanswered questions and add some weight to the plot, unfortunately, its obvious, unremarkable and a little messy. The ending feels like its focusing far too much setting up the inevitable fourth sequel rather than wrapping up the third. The strong body of the movie is lessened by a weaker ending. However, overall Paranormal Activity 3 is a decent film, it does exactly what it says on the tin and is notably better than Paranormal Activity 2.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spoilers: The Story has been completely trashed and heres why</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am incredibly disappointed in the fact that that the Paranormal Activity franchise seems to have gone the same way as the Friday the13th, Hallloween and other franchises in terms of story continuity.Swiss cheese has less holes than this plot did. 1) Forget the Trailers: they didn't make the theatrical cut so they bloody Mary scene won't be what you saw among others 2) Story Continuity Issues: In PA 1 Katie told Dr Fredrichs the demon was always at the foot of her bed but never at her sisters, however, in this movie the demon is now Toby the imaginary friend of Kristi now happily chatting and running about the house with in the middle of the night. Katie mocks her sister as a baby for having her imaginary friend and is oblivious to what's going on until she is attacked later 3) How can their mother now have been murdered by Toby when Micha clearly mentions to Katie in PA 1 while they are upstairs with Dr Fredrichs "that they shouldn't have her mother come visit anymore because she's mean" after the Dr warns them about having negative energies in the house? 4) Where was the fire? You guessed it, that didn't make the theatrical cut either (which seems really stupid considering that Kristis house in almost suffers the same fate due to a spontaneously combustive stove top in the extended of PA2 also totally ignoring the fact that in PA 1 Katie also told the psychic about her family losing everything in the fire but thank goodness no one was hurt.5) Other Mistakes: If you remember the disastrous basement from both versions of PA2 then you will really be surprised at the sudden addition of this new footage depicting a pregnant Kristi and Daniel painting the nursery when Katie comes by to tour the organized basement asking if she can store a few boxes in which she has no room to keep at Micah's . When asked what they are Katie says its just stuff I wound up with after Grandma died which turns out to be a huge box of videotapes shot by their mothers boyfriend. Heres the Mistake: they lead you to believe here that this was probably the reason the house was trashed in PA2 but apparently they forgot that in both cuts of PA2 Kristi clearly tells her husband that the only thing that was missing was the necklace her sister had made her and no videotapes are ever mentioned.6) Where does this whole tired Satanic Cult Angle enter into this storyline now? Mystery grandma harping on Mom to have a son (in PA 2 Ali ponders the possibility that it may have been a great grandmother who pacted for wealth), witchcraft symbols scrawled in a closet and hidden behind paintings at Grandmas house while the mysterious old women from a demonology textbook are having a ritual out in the garage only to be discovered by a curious boyfriend with a video camera. 7) Both girls tell us in PA and PA2 that all they remember from their childhood was being scared all the time and nightmares yet in the closing sequence with the dead bodies of their mother and boyfriend on the floor in their view both girls docilely go up the stairs with Grandma while Krisi cheerily calls out to the demon "Come on Toby, let's go!" and the Grandma saying come girls we have to get ready. No one looking scared at all. Complete and utter disappointment , the filmmakers should take a few lessons from the Saw movie creators about how to create, maintain and finish a plot line .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My nieces nagged me into taking them to see I and II. So III had to be done to get the trilogy. After the movie, this is what I heard from the audience: "is that it"? "I spent twenty dollars for this"? "that didn't explain anything". On the escalator down I heard two children asking their mom "so did the grandma kill the mother and the father"? Yes, I felt all of those questions myself. How much was spent on seeing these movies, when after each one I felt, "is that it"? Has Hollywood run out of what it takes to write good scripts and direct good actors? Have the good writers "aged out" of Hollywood so we're stuck with writers-in-training? And yet, you want to have hope that there are actually really, really good scripts out there that are really, really, scary and that there are wonderful actors out there who can make us jump out of our seats and be scared all night. There's an old series out there called "A Haunting". Those episodes provide more "real life" fear than this. More video cameras in this one. More watching the clock at the bottom of the screen. More watching for shadows. And then there's the necklace with a symbol and then there's the books from the library that get the husband and his buddy wondering. And then there's grandma. In the end, you just don't care anymore. You just wonder: where did my money go?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i have never seen a paranormal activity film before this one and to be honest its not my usual type of film but i went with some mates and at first i was interested the film wasn't too confusing and it was scary my mate jumped out of his seat at one point, but towards the end the film just went weird i thought it was all over when they went to the Nan's house but i was wrong and from there on it got confusing and it left so many questions who were those people behind that door and why did it have to turn out to be some cult thing i was hoping it was just some kind of spirit connected to the house but anyway the film does what it says it scares people. One more final thing the trailer is showing scenes which i never even see in the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Was awesome until.... (Contains Spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie had the best special effects and plot. As I watched it though, I noticed nothing in the commercials were in the actual movie. That disappointed me a lot because the scene with the ghost in the bathroom and Julie getting knocked backwards and the girl jumping over the railing were sweet shots. I looked past that and enjoyed all the thrills and destruction until the horrible ending...(SPOILERS) Someone in the family is part of a satanic cult. That's why all this happened in the first place... WHAT?!!!! ARE YOU SERIOUS? Can you say The Last Exorcism? Also a crappy movie by the way. At the end, the cult is shown. A bunch of evil old ladies hobbling towards the camera. Look, satanic people are not scary. Stop acting like they are. The commercial said "The last fifteen minutes will change your life". Lol. Oh and they make the mistake of graphically altering the little girl's face to make her look more "Evil" in a scene. Just like the cheesy theatrical ending in the first one where Katie screams at the camera. PA 3 would have been my favorite if it hadn't been for the ending. I hope they release an alternate ending on the DVD. I hope it has deleted scenes that were shown in the commercials. If you're going to watch it, i'd walk out right after the guy finds the symbol on the wall. You wouldn't get to see him die, but it would spare you from the horrible conclusion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fell apart in the third act</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I gave it this rating for the ending alone. For 2/3rds of this movie I was fairly scared, and had a pretty good bit of suspense built up. Then it got weird and the story fell apart. The characters' reactions to everything that was going on was way off and not something normal people would do. The ghost or entity was very overt way too quickly. The ending was tragically lame and left everyone in my theater with an expression of utter confusion and of let-down --Minimal Spoilers-- Once the entity showed himself in the blanket there was no way of turning back. The characters' reactions after that did not follow any logical formula. And it's not as though they missed it, it's on film and they saw it. At which point almost everybody would actively do something to change their situation. These characters saw that they were being haunted and did nothing. This was relatively early on.From there on, it was too fantastical. Everything was taken to the extreme in the worst possible story directions, and not much reality or story freshness ever returned.The ending made this film reek of crap. They took all the plot from the first two films, threw it out, and made up some bullshit. This was meant to be a surprise, but the only surprise the audience was left with was feeling cheated. Remember how it was supposed to be an entity that was attracted to Katie? Well, they rewrote it to be a group of witches or something. They weren't scary in the least. It doesn't make sense, and whoever made this movie doesn't care. For what this story was supposed to be out would make the previous two impossible, or at least an endless amount of explanations were needed. Katie, to start, would have to have been a sociopath or not remember anything from her childhood somehow, such as her mom's boyfriend dieing in front of her.--------- Don't see this film, even if you're a fan of the first two. Remember, your money is your vote, vote for quality. Cheap Hollywood films, that's sole reason for being created is for a quick buck, needs to end. There will no doubt be another film to come, and it's going to be worse.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This could of been so good, but instead it was chopped up, not really any scary scenes, none of the scenes from the trailers were in the film which could of made the movie really really good, instead it was like watching a made for TV movie...I so enjoyed the first two thinking that this one would explain it all, but instead it created more questions.. was it the Earthquake? Bloody Mary, Family History? etc that the demon attached itself to these girls? Again, because it was so choppy it didn't not have a flow to the story line.Just because a movie makes $52 million on the release does not make it a good movie it just means that you did a well enough job attracting movie goes to the theater.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What movie was I watching?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked the movie overall. In the first PA, my biggest problem with it was that the payoff for the build ups never came through. In PA2, they stepped it up a bit and we got a little more payoff to the build up. In PA3 I liked that "most" of the build up did end with a payoff of some crazy happening in the house... lots of cool tricks by Toby were scary and some were pretty funny. (pulling the older sisters hair was really cool) Overall, I liked the movie. Definitely the best of the 3...BUT... as some posters have said. Where was everything in the trailer??? The two girls saying "bloody mary" in the mirror looked really cool, but, why do a totally different bloody mary scene? NONE of the "scary" trailer parts were in the movie... WHY? Instead, they got cute with mixing it up, fooling us with unexpected scenes. When I watch a trailer and it makes me go to a movie... I KINDA want to see what crazy things happened leading up to, and coming out of the scenes in the TRAILER. (where she throws the water on Toby seemed like such a cool scene to go with... but, not in the movie?) And ya... having 20 old ladys show up left me thinking... "this just took a bad turn" It left a very bad taste in my mouth... taking away from the experience. "where were all the cool parts I wanted to see?" And the end... how many of you, when the final scene happened turned to your bf/gf and said, "this better not be the end" only to fade to black and credits roll. VERY disappointed in the ending.Overall... I'd see it again, these movies are great on the build up and creepyness of a classic scary movie, and part 3 even had some really nice payoffs... but, the trying to be "edgy" "unexpected" "cute" really took away from the experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining, more of the same but not as clever as part 2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two girls befriend an invisible entity who resides in their home and their mothers partner sets out to film the strange goings on.The two leads from one and two Sprague Grayden and Katie Featherston reprise their roles briefly. Part 3 opens with a brief insight of the events of Paranormal Activity 1 &amp; 2. It quickly moves to 1988 (you view the contents of some missing tapes) to a time when the sisters Katie (Chloe Csengery) and (Jessica Tyler Brown) Kristi Rey are young. This prequel directed by Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman Paranormal 3 is technically well filmed, exceeding the likes of Blare Witch in both look and sound. Because of the 88 setting, there's lots of nice touches, the sets, the VHS imperfections, date/time stamps and noise of the camera zooming.Like its predecessor, there are good naturalistic performances. Sceptic Mom Julie played by Lauren Bittner and boyfriend Dennis - Christopher Nicholas Smith are more than adequate. Dennis' character is as likable as Micah from the first. Video obsessed he makes a swivelling camera from a fan to the annoyance of his wife.Old ground is trod, characters filming themselves, waking up late at night, creepy images, bangs, shaking rooms, noises and so. There is nothing more creepy than children talking to unseen entities or babysitters getting scared. You follow the characters on their journey as they investigate and interrogate the video footage and strange goings on in their new house. There's a few stand out moments, the hair pulling and balloon bedroom part complete with blanket flying at the camera. The scene where Dennis' friend Randy experiences the ghostly goings on is a highlight.Paranormal Activity 3 is not a horror in the traditional sense- if you enjoy these camera point of view chillers and was scared by first two this will possibly exceed expectations. That said, it's not as clever as part 2 in its narrative intertwining.Ultimately once again it builds up to a big snapping scare, its more of the same. Nevertheless, it still manages to suck you in an be intriguing - why I'll never know.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Meh!!!! I enjoyed the suspense and scares but thats about it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly I haven't seen the first and second film of the trilogy but that didn't matter due to this being a prequel. I was told by my friend who watched it with me that there are a lot of references to the other two films but it doesn't prevent you from enjoying or understanding what's going on so if your in the same boat as I was don't let that put you off. I didn't not enjoy PA3 but at the same time I didn't love it either. Hence the title Meh. Below I will highlight what are in my honest opinion the good and bad points.The good points:- Great use of suspense, camera work, acting was surprisingly good and towards the end of the film a lot of jumps and scares. Also without giving any spoilers away the Bloody Mary scene was intense and entertaining and my highlight of the film.The bad points:- Very slow, it does get better and of course it couldn't be too fast paced because that would soften the build up of tension but it did start to drag a little bit. The use of amateur camera work is great because it adds to the real feel of the film, however if I heard a noise or went to investigate something I would rather pick up a baseball bat rather than a camera all the time. I just started to feel that the over use of carried camera shots started to take away the believability of the scenes/film.That's it really, I enjoyed PA3 for what it was but at the same time I can't really rave about it because it was above average but not great. As for all the reviews I have read saying how annoyed they are that all the scenes from the trailer aren't in the film, I say I'm glad they aren't. There's nothing worse than seeing half a film condensed in to trailers so when you watch it your expecting or you know what's going to happen.Hope this helps anyone thinking about watching the film, just remember it's not bad but it's also not great and try to enjoy it for what it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The weakest link in an otherwise strong chain</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're looking for a short sharp punch to the fear gland then Paranormal Activity 3 could well be what you're looking for. I really enjoyed the first two films and think that the found footage sub-genre of horror can be very entertaining and immersive. PA3 is no different but the franchise is quickly becoming something of a one-trick-pony, if you like that trick you'll love PA3, if not, you won't. You've already had two films to tell you whether or not you're going to like this one.The film does however engage in a little bait and switch. It is worth pointing out that there is a huge amount of footage shown in the film's trailers that just isn't in the film. Deleted scenes are one thing but the story depicted in the trailer just isn't the story of the film (beyond the basic premise of a family under supernatural attack). There's also something of a change of genre towards the film's climax that was ? to be fair ? surprising but also a little out of place. Ultimately the film just asked far too many questions and answered none.On the plus side though, the acting is believable, the found footage thing works well (especially with the nineteen eighties setting ? people were obsessed with that newly available technology back then) and the fact that there are children in the story makes for a continued creepy tone.There's a rule for sequels (especially horror sequels) that states one must outdo the last. If Saw 6 made you want to throw up your lunch, Saw 7 must make you want to throw up your internal organs. Paranormal Activity 3 is no different however the fact that 3 is a prequel to 2 and 2 is a prequel to 1 means that ? chronologically speaking ? the hauntings are actually getting less and less severe as the story progresses.As a stand-alone film Paranormal Activity 3 is a pretty decent chiller with a clear and creepy tone and some well executed scares. However, in comparison to the first two instalments, it's a bit of a let-down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>**SPOILERS** Here we go again...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a user of IMDb for the past 7 years, I'm going to assume from this point forward that nearly every film is going to be rated at least 1 whole star too high. Because, in my opinion, there is no way in hell that PA3 is a 6.5 star movie. As people are likely to see the rating before anything else, I want put this up front: at best, PA3 is a 5.8, and that's being generous. I think 5.6 is probably more accurate. I hope that the slew of IMDb members who slap 6 and 7 stars on virtually everything they see will one day learn to dole out the stars a little more sparingly and with more thought. I believe that once a film has broken into the 6+ star rating it should (for the most part) lack glaring errors. PA3 contains too many obvious flubs to enter 6-star territory.The most unforgivable error is the wife's refusal to watch the video footage. It wouldn't have changed much. I mean, even if she had watched it they probably would have ended up at her mother's house any way. At least there would have been some satisfaction there for the viewer.The other problem is that the formula used in the movie becomes tedious at times. Only so much can be done while you're waiting for a camera on an oscillating fan stand to show you the next half of the room. It's boring and makes the action feel compartmentalized, as if it's happening because of the cameras and not in spite of them.Now, I don't mean to say that the whole movie is boring - just some of the elements. There are some pretty strong parts. The comedy works well. Some said it detracted from the film, but I disagree. I think that being able to juxtapose the characters while smiling with images of them experiencing terror both endears the character to the viewer and enhances the horror. However, there are times when the characters don't seem to be acting like they're really going through what they are. This makes the story lose some its credibility.The friend of the husband is a very effective character, and the scene with him and the older daughter playing Bloody Mary is the most effective scene in the movie - the acting during that part is just intense and enjoyable. What blows it for him though, is his inexplicably hasty departure from the house following that episode. It just seems like, knowing that character a little bit, he might have handled it in a slightly different way. More could have been done with that part of it.One of the main problems, which leads to why so much of the story seems half-baked and unfinished, is that the scares take precedent over coherent story presentation. So much time is burned during all of the set-ups for the scares that it feels like content has been omitted. And the lengthy set-ups are part of what starts to make the movie feel like it has been hollowed out in some respects.I would watch this movie again. So that's how we get into the 5-star zone. I know that I will be frustrated again though, and that's going to keep me from ever branding a 6+ on this one. Some decent acting and some creepy scenes that will stick with you make this one worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Halloween is my favorite holiday. So when I heard that Paranormal Activity 3 was due out around Halloween, I felt like a kid going to an amusement park! I am a fan of the the Paranormal #1 &amp; #2 Movies--- #1 was very creepy and #2 was a bit more frightening. But Paranormal Activity 3 was was like looking in a bag of Halloween candy---some spooky nostalgic candy that you love and some candy that you might try to palm off the dog or your kid sister.First, there are some irritating things about the film. I know most of you have heard that there is NOTHING in the trailers that is in the movie---Well, at least not EXACTLY. I guess this is just a subtle way to market the film. Why? they should depend on their fans more often. Secondly, at the end of the film, you will Definitely have some unanswered questions and leave a little confused. Don't worry, I smell another sequel coming, I just hope it kind of wraps up some loose ends.But of course, there are some really good things. They follow the same format as #1 and #2---video taping EVERYTHING in their lives. Including the demon "Toby" (cute name) who is the invisible playmate of little sister Christy (whom I assumed was the older sister?) Toby is a real trickster who likes to freak people out with moving lights. creepy noises, and a bed sheet on the head (he's got a little sense of humor). But Toby has a mean dark side and displays it but terrorizing the older sister, Katie and throwing furniture around. One day, the family decides that they had enough. They pack up, travel over the river and through the woods to Grandma's house. Find a safe haven, right?....Riiiigggghhhhtttt!There are new characters here too. Julie, Katie and Cristy's young Mom. Dennis, her fun loving boyfriend and Julie's Mother who presents herself as a dark pessimistic type character always nagging at Julie for choosing Dennis as her soul mate (unanawered question---what happened to Katie and Cristy's Dad?. Does Grandma act a little witchy? You be the judge! Katie and Cristy (as adults) mention some type of weird happenings in their childhood when they are trying to find a solution to the hauntings. But in my opinion, these incidents are traumatic! and I would think a child would remember this more into adulthood.Again, the ending seems to be a set up for another chapter. Would I see it? You bet! I hope it is in 3D!---How's that for a big scare! (The prices scare my more) But still, it would add to more Halloween fun!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Things Just Got Scary Again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first movie scared the living hell out of me. The second movie, not so much. We've now reached the third movie, and while I maintain that horror movies should be judged by their ability to frighten and not by their status as franchise pushers, I have to admit that some of my faith has been restored. Although "Paranormal Activity 3" is in many ways as clichd as its predecessor, and although a few of the much publicized explanations are a bit obscure, it's smoother, tenser, and pretty damn scary. On more than one occasion, you will jump out of your seat. The rest of the time, you will be clinging to your armrest (or perhaps the arm of your date) in sheer suspense. The previous film, which suffered from a repetitious formula and typecast characters, lacked that kind of power.Yes, this movie is an improvement. It is not, however, up to par with the original "Paranormal Activity," the most inventive and frightening horror film since "The Blair Witch Project." This is to be expected, considering how high the bar was set. A year ago, this led to me to question why filmmakers push for sequels and/or prequels when one film is all it takes. I'm still asking myself this today. This movie works as a standalone horror film, but as a part of a franchise, it's unnecessary. In one crucial way, it's also unwanted. The tagline is, "Discover how the activity began"; my problem is that I never wanted to make this discovery. I found the first film so terrifying in large part because no explanation was given. We had a man, a woman, a surveillance camera, a haunted house, and nothing more. It didn't matter why ? it only mattered that it was happening.Like the previous films, the subjects are sisters Katie and Kristi, and their story unfolds in the form of recovered home video footage. This time, however, we see them as young children in September of 1988, living at home with their mother, Julie (Lauren Bittner), and her boyfriend, Dennis (Christopher Nicholas), who so happens to have his own business as a wedding videographer. This means, of course, that he conveniently has access to video editing equipment, which will come in handy as the activity becomes worse. But I'm getting ahead of myself. Dennis' attempt at making a sex tape with Julie is interrupted by an earthquake; as they rush to check on the girls, the still-rolling camera captures dust falling onto an invisible presence. This footage prompts Dennis to set up cameras in strategic areas of the house. Sure enough, strange events are starting to happen, and it's all being captured on film.Perhaps coincidentally, these events began at the same time Kristi (Jessica Tyler Brown) started interacting with an imaginary friend named Toby. Her mother is convinced it's just a phase. Dennis, who isn't sharing the footage with his wife, seems to believe otherwise. Needless to say, this is but one of many instances of disturbed nights, highlighted by unnerving subtleties such as phantom noises and objects that move on their own. As the film progresses, the activity becomes less subtle, and of that, I will say no more. One of the film's most effective techniques is the placing of a camera on the motor of an oscillating fan; numerous scenes show one continuous shot panning back and forth, revealing first the living room then the kitchen. This makes for some surprisingly effective scares. One in particular, which I will not spoil for you, had everyone in the theater screaming.The final scene, though technically masterful and undeniably frightening, raises some serious questions about Katie and Kristi as adults. Let's just say that, on the basis of what the last shot reveals, I'm not convinced either girl would grow up to be as well adjusted as they initially turned out. It's almost as if they forgot an entire chapter of their lives ? or, at least, a significant chunk of it. Such scenes make me wish that "Paranormal Activity" hadn't spawned two prequels, that it had been allowed to stand on its own. "Paranormal Activity 3" works reasonably well, but it would be nice if the filmmakers heeded this piece of advice: When bad things happen, the greatest terror lies in not knowing why.Now here's an interesting side note. The film was directed by Ariel Schulman and Henry Joost, the same men that helmed the 2010 documentary "Catfish." I enjoyed that film, but like a lot of viewers, I found myself questioning its authenticity. Was it truly a documentary about a suspicious internet romance, or was it a hoax? The fact that their follow-up project was a fictional film made to resemble a documentary only adds fuel to the fire. Amazing, how moviegoers ? and filmmakers ? have blurred the line between reality and fantasy. When my review for "Paranormal Activity" was posted in 2009, I received a number of comments from readers. Many were facetious, but a select few seemed convinced that the footage in the movie was real. One person even asked me where more information on the case of Katie Featherston and Micah Sloat could be found. Too bad we now know they're just movies.-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very unremarkable, but not 100% unimpressive.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After having seen Paranormal Activity 1, its 1st sequel, and the slew of similarly filmed thrill movies that followed, I find this movie quite unremarkable. Hand-held camera enthusiast? Check. Setting up surveillance of "strange happenings"? Check. Things moving &amp; appearing on their own accord? Check.I'd say this film pails in comparison to its predecessors. The first film is great, the second is pretty good at times, the 3rd is just okay at best. Where could this franchise possibly go from here, I couldn't imagine. They have already reached too far. But if they do make another sequel (or prequel) I hope they can step their game up better!You will not find the chilling thrills you've come to expect, prepare to be disappointed. No need to even study the picture closely to catch the subtleties in the darkness like you had to do with the others. If they want you to be "scared", they'll just throw a figure under a sheet and put it in the middle of the well lit screen for you. Big yawn. Some of the "acting" was pretty good given the material they had to work with anyways. It has some creepy moments but if you're expecting Paranormal Activity 1, you're in for a huge let down. ----Possible Spoilers----The film begins a few years ago. Katie goes to visit (or perhaps stay with) her pregnant younger sister Kristy and her husband. Katie brings a lot of things to store at Kristy's house including a box of old VHS recordings she said she got from their Grandmother. Kristy's husband goes through the box and begins watching some old recordings. He begins with one of Katie's birthday party in 1988. Katie and Kristy's father is an avid camera user. "Strange" things begin to happen after Katie's parents try to make a homemade sexytime video and an earthquake interrupts. Young Kristy befriends an entity she calls Toby and does all the clich things you'd expect a child to do when they have an imaginary friend. No one believes that Toby exists. Stranger things start happening in the home such as creaking, things moving, drawing on walls and shadows moving. The father sets up more surveillance and is increasingly concerned with not only these occurrences and what he's manage to capture on film so far, but by Kristy's imaginary new friend. The mother is vehemently in denial that anything is awry, and the father just seems like a tool. The only characters that seem to matter at all are the 2 little girls. It's not until the ceiling nearly collapses on moms head that she's ready to admit her husbands investigations were well founded. To little, too late though. The truth behind everything that's happening is more unbelievable and closer to home than any of them could imagine.----End of Spoilers----In the past movies, no matter how many days or untold events goes by in the film, there is still a strong sense of continuity from scene to scene. I found that characteristic to be lacking here. You will feel that you've missed too much and that vital info has been withheld from you from one scene to the next. The ending should have been better. It was a nice twist but could've been played out much more intriguingly. The slow watch and wait pace of the first 2 films is carried out here as well, but doesn't give viewers the same reward for their vigilance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Once again a lot of nothing until the very end when fans finally get what they came and paid to see (for about ten minutes).</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'PARANORMAL ACTIVITY 3': Three Stars (Out of Five)The second sequel to the surprise ultra-low budget horror hit from 2009. This one is a prequel set eighteen years before the original two films and explains how the sister heroines of the first two movies, Katie and Kristi, first encountered a demon presence as children. This one is directed by Ariel Schulman and Henry Joost (the team that brought us the popular 2010 documentary 'CATFISH') and is written by Christopher B. Landon (a co-writer of the second film). It was made on a budget of $5 million, which is not nearly as low budget as the $15 thousand budget of the first film (or $2.75 million of the second), but still pretty low budget by Hollywood standards. It's already made over $81 million in it's first weekend of release (setting all kinds of records) so the extra couple million dollars spent on the film's budget probably wasn't a bad investment. These films are obviously hugely popular with scary movie fans but I've never been a big fan of them (and I'm a huge scary movie fan). I wasn't that impressed with the original, thought even less of the second and actually liked this one a little more than the last installment but the series as a whole has not impressed me. If you like these movies though you're probably sure to be more than pleased.The story begins in 2005 with Katie (once again played by Katie Featherston) giving an old box of VHS tapes (of family recordings from 1988 ) to her sister Kristi (played once again by Sprague Grayden). The film flashes forward a year to Kristi's home being burglarized and the tapes going missing. We then go to video footage from the stolen tapes in 1988, when Katie (played as a child by Chloe Csengery) and Kristi (played by Jessica Tyler Brown as a youth) were living with their mother Julie (Lauren Bittner) and her boyfriend Dennis (Christopher Nicholas) and Kristi began seeing visions of a seemingly imaginary friend named Toby. Julie and Dennis also have an odd seemingly supernatural experience and Dennis of course decides to plant video cameras around the house in order to record the mysterious goings-on at night. The movie once again plays out entirely in a 'found footage' mock documentary way.The film is once again a lot of nothing until the very end when fans finally get what they came and paid to see (for about ten minutes). The rest of the film is all build up with cheap shocks and startled scares here and there but nothing really happening (just like the other two films). This chapter (surprisingly) also doesn't have a lot of the coolest scenes from the trailers, for some reason (they'll probably show up on the DVD though). The inclusion of these scenes could have helped give the film at least a little more thrills and chills. The movie does have it's moments (I have to admit) and the payoff at the end is almost worth the wait but for the most part it's (once again) just a lot of over used B movie tricks and gimmicks. This one does have the added chills of little girls (which can be really creepy), the classic 'bloody Mary' game used to good effect and a witch coven subplot. Other fake mockumentary horror films recently (like last year's 'THE LAST EXORCISM') have used similar effects and storytelling to much creepier and scary results though. The movie isn't a complete waste of time (if you're a fan of cheap thrills and creepy images) but for the most part it's just over hyped and over used ghost movie clichs.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A55VyvDcEBI</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Its been a long time since I watched a horror movie in the cinemas, so I wanted to check this one. I'm surprised by the good reviews I have gotten about this one. This is a movie where you could fall asleep in anywhere in the first hour. You could walk in after an hour and you wouldn't have missed anything. But still the last half an hour pays off. It gets creepy but not scary. I hate to mention it but none of the scenes from the trailer appear in the movie. After watching the trailer, I was hooked but again movies are never as good as the trailers. This proved to be true. You finally get to know how this is all attached to Katie. And thats the only thing you get out of it. You can take your girl friend out and have fun. But still it is a RENTAL. I suppose this is the new SAW now. The car park was full on a Monday evening. It delivers in the box office as long as people buy this crazy concept.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A taught, suspenseful horror that is gripping</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mild spoilers contained!!!!!! Combining the storytelling elements of the first two films, Paranormal Activity 3 mixes the shock-horror style with a gripping story to create a tense, if slightly unsteady, experience.Following on from the hugely successful 'Paranormal Activity' 1 and 2, the third film is a prequel. It tells the story of the oft-referenced events of Katie and Kristi's childhood. The old techniques return - the camcorders, the night films and the jump-out-of-your-seat scares. This film is obviously the one that used the highest budget - most noticeable in its set and style. The film is set in 1988 (7 months after I was born, cool) and the period setting helps the mood. We see old style cars in the garage that serves as Dennis's (the male lead) office for film editing. The eighties costumes, though inconsistent (Julie's style is distinctly more modern than, for example, the babysitter's) are always worth a look and the trickery used (attaching a camcorder to an electric fan to create a panascopic view) is effective.Still, this film does not look like a cgi-fest. The effects are flawless. Some familiar scenes return (the presence in Katie's bed) and are combined with new tricks (babysitter in the kitchen). With the falling furniture, the audience is completely convinced that the events on screen are really happening.That, of course, is where this film series excels. The cheap tricks are kept to a minimum. (People jumping out at the camera could quickly become old and thankfully it is infrequent.) The most effective, for me, trick of the first film was the simple idea of a person standing still for hours on end. It wouldn't be a 'PA' film without this and, surely enough, it returns. But that it is a child who stands watch for over an hour is even more disturbing because by that stage, 'How did they do that?' has begun to fade into 'What the hell is going to happen?'.On the acting front, the leads are top-notch. Christopher Nicholas Smith and Lauren Bittner, as Dennis and Julie respectively, are fine and compelling to watch. Smith's portrayal of a man who at first finds the events amusing before slowly realising the extent, and Bittner's portrayal of a mother who is firmly rooted in the normal, but is forced to accept the paranormal, are both top class. Bittner is perhaps the more sympathetic of the two as she displays a terrified woman who seeks safety with the first choice, and presumable best choice, of her Mother. Dennis, though arguably too close in character to PA-1's Micah, plays a difficult character of the fill-in father who is trying his best, while attempting to understand the events around him.The child actors, Chloe Csengery and Jessica Tyler Brown as Katie and Kristi Rey respectively, are something of a revelation. Csengery displays the bullying yet caring older sister and Tyler Brown portrays the little girl who can see something the others can't, in a very unnerving manner. Yes, there are pitfalls - Tyler Brown sometimes seems to fluff lines - but watching Csengery in the bathroom after the ill-fated game of Bloody Mary is enough to convince anyone to stay the hell away from mirrors.The little homage to Poltergeist is a nice touch as well - that the mother is kept from her screaming daughters by the static filled television is a creepy yet nicely indulgent tip of the hat that adds self-awareness to the film. Overall, PA-3 is a triumph. A slightly forced ending is the only disappointment. The prequel introduces new ideas to the franchise and invigorates it, yet some of the ideas are a little hammed up. Though the twist is a nice mix, there is perhaps too much in the final fifteen minutes to justify. PA-3 contains similar levels of violence to PA-2, and while neither sequel adequately recaptures the terror of the first film, they are both worthy additions to the series.I would rate 'Paranormal Activity 3' at 8/10 - a highly suspenseful, genuinely unnerving film that is slightly let down by the denouement, yet manages to become a successful prequel in terms of story and shock factor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Follows the Formula: Action Only After the First Hour</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was not really planning to watch "Paranormal Activity 3." I had seen the first two installments of this series, and well, I think I have already seen the best of it, and it is not really much. Before it opened though, critics were giving it an A rating. Then it actually opened to record October box office numbers. So I thought, maybe there is something in this movie after all, so hence I watched it.The story brings us back to 1988 when Katie and Kristie (the sisters from the first two movies) were still little kids. Their dad Dennis decides to film their bedrooms and dining room 24/7 after hearing strange noises during the night. Those scenes where the ghost was terrorizing little Kristie in the kids' bedroom were quite a good scare. Their mom Julie is the skeptical one, until much later she too would be convinced via a grander show of the ghost's power in the kitchen. These "ghostly" scenes were variations of similar scare tactics we have seen before though. We also meet the girls' mother Lois as she gets into the action.And as it was in the first two films, the suspense was suspended for almost an entire hour before anything remotely exciting even happens. I have to admit though there were some pretty unexpectedly spooky scenes in the last twenty minutes or so. While I found this installment definitely better than the Part 2, it is not exactly something I would rate an A. It is okay though, and good for a short squeamish time towards the homestretch. That is, if you can sit through the tedium of the first hour (much like what you sat through in the first two PA films).</fullReview>

I was all set for an entertaining flick which might give me a few scares ~~ this is an embarrassing amateur "snoozer". In my time I have seen as few hundred films of this and similar genres. This sits right at the bottom. To think that thare are two previous in the "series" is astounding. Apparently there is a market for this kind of dross.

		<shortDescription>Horror at its best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By MrPolisCMay Contain spoilersPeople,do not spent any money for this at the cinema not if you have a great LED 40 inch TV with the latest technologies and a full surround system to with it. It was like 2 in the morning and i had just woke up after a great sleep with a strange mood to watch a horror film and test my nerves together with my new TV set.I have seen the prev and so i was prepared for what to expect.or thats what i thought.. Never i had in mind that what i was about to witness was one of the best horror movies of the last couple of years and a great cinematic experience who had me jumping on the sealing ,bitting my nails and my heart banging like crazy. I liked the previous movies of the series but having viewed them on my pc i wasn't that thrilled about them although i liked the hole camera idea and the concept which might not be something new but surely gives a knew freshness in the category of live footage horror .The 3rd movie adds knew elements in the series and surely gives what people was asking for..more action..more terror more scary scenes.Just to be fair,i was much affected by the fact i was watching this on my new TV set which made pictures come alive (imagine this in a horror movie)and the sound had me looking behind my shoulder every time.So OK i was very exited from the hole experience so half the credits goes there and people who already experienced such a cinematic pleasure wont be that exited but still. So again,sitting alone at this hour of the day,alone with no sound or anyone to distract my attention..and the film forcing my thirst to discover the unknown waiting for something to happen at any moment.No matter how much i was prepared for it it still manage to scare me ever y single time and just to note down that i do not get scare easily which was something i kept complaining about all horror movies of the last ..maybe 10 years. I hadn't seen the trailer or read the review so i didn't knew this was a prequel and that is also why i wasn't disappointed like many other viewers bout not seeing some scenes from the trailer in the actual film (like the scenes were not enough).You wanted more action scenes ..you got them.The acting was pretty amazing taken the fact all the actors are pretty much unknown.i like to analyze human behavour and studying it and believe me ..the actors did a pretty good job convincing us this actually happened..The movie unlike other scary movies don't count on ugly demons ,scary music and ongoing action to fright you.Instead it use a technique were it lets you get to know the house and the protagonists so that together with the viewing methods and the continuous hunting for clues will put you right there in the scene so it will terrifying you .It gives you something to be afraid of but doesn't answer all the questions..doesn't show you much so that it will keep a mystery and the thirst to find answers alive.If something like this could had happened for reall this is how it would have been. Now let me answer to some of the other viewers who failed to appreciate the greatness of this film.Why does a live footage has to give you answers about everything like the burning house or who this entity is,or how did the mother died?Why did the hole cult part surprised some of you?It was an interesting addition .Why it hunts the children?You serious?Children are more open to this kind of activities and more innocent and easier to control.Thats what the demon wants .To control the children so that the marriage will take place and the life and death will become one into the flesh of the newborn son.Having said all this and as you already know by know if you have read the hole review this is one of the best horror movies ever made with some of the most terrifying scenes i had ever experienced and i have seen a lot.Even people who do not like this kind of horror movies and are kind of old fashioned , will find something to like to this 3rd movie.I definitely recommend this to anyone who can handle it and once again i recommend you watch it alone at late hours .</fullReview>

Where were all the scenes from the previews? I was so disappointed with the first one that I don't even know why I bothered to watch the others. The previews made it look so scary, and I thought maybe the creators were finally going to redeem themselves. Instead it was a tired old reworking of the previous movies with a half-cocked explanation for the whole thing. No one can do what The Blair Witch Project did. I wish people would just stop trying. What could have been a spooky new type of horror flick has been turned into garbage.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was horrible. For at least 1 hour, nothing was happening. You guys keep going back to the beginning and that is what is confusing. And don't even get me started on scenes that were previewed in the trailer and were not even in the movie! What happened to the scene in the commercials where the twins chanted 'Bloody Mary' three times and the girl with long hair appeared in the mirror? That wasn't even in the movie. In fact, the girl with the long hair was NO WHERE in the movie. It was just this 'Toby' character. I have given Paranormal Activity 3 chances. The 2nd Paranormal Activity movie was actually better than the rest. All in all, I did not enjoy the movie. It was not scary and certainly didn't live up to the, "The last 15 minutes of the movie will have you scared for the rest of your life", as mentioned in the commercials. I selected 1 as my rating, but it should really be -30.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In yet another instalment to this money making franchise, PARANORMAL ACTIVITY 3 takes the audience back even further (1988) in yet another prequel, this time focusing the story on JULIE &amp; her boyfriend DENNIS &amp; Julie's two girls KRISTI &amp; KATIE (the heroines of the first two films, shown here as little girls) as they are bothered by an unknown &amp; unseen supernatural entity that has made contact with one of the girls, waking her up in the night &amp; playing games with the child. Setting up some camera's, Dennis &amp; a pal of his, attempt to document the happenings in the house &amp; learn that "Tobey" the entity that is making contact with one of the girls, may not be a ghost, but rather a violent, unseen demon that soon terrorizes the family. When the family re-locates to the grandmothers home, they think the problem is over, little realizing the terror is just beginning. Having replaced the SAW franchise as the one horror series that fans want to see at Halloween, PARAMOUNT PICTURES by now has obviously one thing in mind for this franchise &amp; that's have it become the annual, yearly event for horror fans at Halloween &amp; produce more sequels year after year than what SAW did, while pulling in an incredible amount of cash much like the Friday The 13th franchise done for the studio back in the eighties. While most found footage films would no doubt wear it's premise thin by a third entry, surprisingly PARANORMAL ACTIVITY 3 remains a very healthy scare fest, that manages to creep you out in so many different ways. The film delves even deeper into the plot than any of the previous two films, although by this point, the franchise is starting to repeat itself maybe too much. The end climax is clever &amp; eerie, but goes into details about an all female cult &amp; other supernatural going on's that none of the heroines in the first two films never mentioned, also worth noting is how many of the films most powerful scenes were in the trailer only &amp; do not appear in the film itself. The film is well acted &amp; the writing is as good as always. Highly recommended to fans of the first two films, but if you didn't like the first two, then don't bother with this one. Followed by a sequel PARANORMAL ACTIVITY 4*** stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paranormal Activity was a decent thriller which was far more better than the first two series with more sensible story writing and more scary scenes This part takes you to the year 1988 when Katie and Christie were kids. This one tells you how Christie was haunted by a ghost in the house and what led to subsequent killings in the later series. Dennis is a wedding photographer who falls for Julie and slowly moves into their family. However Julie's mother does not approve of this and wants her to borne a son after having 2 daughters already. On the other side, Christie is haunted an imaginary figure, Toby. Eventually, weird things begins to occur in the house which slowly leads to killing of Daniel and Deborah. I have never been interested in the Paranormal Activity series but this one was quite interesting ones as it explained how the activity begun. Unlike the first parts , this one does not play at a slow pace but actually comes to the point and builds up suspense as to what will happen next. The direction is sensible along with nice camera work. Acting is decent by the star cast where as the editing is superb. On the flip side , screenplay could have been more accurate explaining why the imaginary figure befriends Christie. Some of scenes were really scary especially the one where Deborah goes back to the kitchen and finds all the utensils and table in the air. Overall , a decent thriller with fine ending. Of course, there was lot of scope of improvement in between. Good :3/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still like the second better, but a great movie nonetheless.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw the first Paranormal Activity, I really liked it. Then I saw the second Paranormal Activity and loved that movie even more. It upped the scares, added quite a bit to the story, and had better characters. Last night I finally watched the third movie and I have to say I really liked it.First the good stuff. Like the first two, this movie is scary, really scary. In fact in terms of scares this one definitely has the most. Some may complain that they are all jump scares, but to be fair most of the jump scares in this movie aren't the cheap, it's just a friend sneaking up on you and saying boo. Most of the jump scares are from the ghost doing crazy stuff. The film builds up suspense, there was a point where my heart was beating faster than usual, that shows the film is doing something right. I also really like the "fan cam" which is a camera that was put on a rotating fan. This lead to a really good part involving a sheet.I also once again liked the characters. I thought they were interesting, and I like that they allowed adult Katie, Kristi and Daniel to be in the movie, even if it was only a cameo. The acting is good, especially from the two little girls.And two things that really made me appreciate this film were that it was funny, and actually kind of sad. Randy is hysterical at times, and some good jokes are told. And Katie actually had me at the verge of tears at two points. One was when her and Randy were in the bathroom, she was scared, she wasn't pretending, she was paralyzed with fear. And the other part was at the end when she saw her mother, laying dead (or maybe she was just unconscious) on the floor. Either way, there are many sadder things than seeing a little girl crying over her dead (or at least appears dead) mother.And once again it ties into the first film well. They didn't add as much, really only the cult part, but it works. And it doesn't have many inconsistency's they even had the demon interact with Kristi, because it wouldn't effect Katie until after the events that happened in the second movie.Some complain that almost none of the scenes from the trailer were in the movie, but I didn't watch the trailers until after the movie, so it didn't affect me (maybe they are deleted scenes). Also, I was able to suspend my disbelief enough to belief that these cameras were from the 80's because Dennis films weddings for a living, but some people might not be able to suspend it enough for that.Now there were a couple of things that bothered me. Some scenes just seemed really stupid. Like when the demon pulled Katie up by her hair. At first it made me jump, but looking back it seems pretty stupid. But my big problem was the ending, and I don't mean the ending was bad. I mean that when it ended, I still had a lot of questions. When did the house burn down? When did their memory's get erased (granted they do say the cult wipes their memory.) And didn't Katie say that the demon bothered her when she was little and not Kristie. Although that's more of a problem with the second movie. It seems that they were leaving so much for the next movie, but the first two had good endings and allowed for sequels, what if this movie wasn't a success? So overall I still think 2 is my favorite, while I jumped more in this, it wasn't hard since it had a lot of scary parts. The second I was freaked out and jumped despite not having as much. Plus it had a much better ending and added more to the story. So I'm looking forward to the fourth movie, actually, I looking forward to it even more now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paranormal Activity 3 is a prequel to the first 2 movies. I've always liked the movies because of the way they are filmed. The home video makes the movies seem as if they are real and gives you the feeling that the demon/witch stuff is real. The film explains a lot that the first two did not, and it keeps the audience wanting more with the ending that leaves them with unknown answers. The story is about sisters from the first two films, and explains why the paranormal demon is haunting their families. It could have been a little shorter, because the beginning seems to dragged out. But once everything starts happening, they film gives off a very creepy vibe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not sure what I am going to add to these reviews I have already read, except to say I hate then movies develop a "formula" and it becomes the M.O. for the rest of the series.I am not sure if these are spoilers, but I will say up front that they may be.Why is everyone involved with these bizarre events a videographer with multiple camera setups running 24 hours a day? No one does that.Secondly, if my wife/husband was vehement about something bothering him/her to the point of hysterics, why the HECK would you ignore him/her? What kind of relationships do people have? Once again, no one would do that.SO the theme in these movies is utter and total denial of any signs of a demon. But if we assume demons DO possess people, then we have to agree then that GOD exists too and why would you not seek out spiritual guidance in an event like that? So you believe in demons, but not in GOD? sheesh...I know movies like this are using tricks to create anxiety and tension in the audience, but it seems like modern writers have no idea how actual people act in situations. Yet, those are the people watching the movie.Plot holes so bad this movie is like swiss cheese.Don't waste your time, but thank you for your time if you read my review.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a true horror fan and I'm not easily scared. In fact, most of the horror movies I see make me laugh. I remember when the first PA came out, most people thought it was a real documentary, and I remember I had to pause the movie in the middle of it just to get my breath back. It was THAT scary. While watching PA2, I KNEW it was just a movie, and that the whole capturing everything on the camera was just a technique to scare the viewers (which was very effective in PA). That's exactly why PA2 didn't scare me at all, because it had the same format as the first installment, and I knew it wasn't real. That being said, I thought PA3 was going to be a drag, but I was dead wrong! I sat through the whole thing and I nearly jumped out of my skin every time! PA3 is WAY SCARIER than the first two installments. That I knew it wasn't real and I was still SCARED TO DEATH testifies just how scary PA3 is! It was so intense and violent that it made PA and PA2 look like children's bedtime stories! I just finished watching it and, wow I'm still shaking! When a horror fan gets scared, it means the movie IS SCARY! So go watch it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alright, I first of all, let me just say that I found the first "Paranormal Activity" movie to be semi-adequate, because it wasn't particularly scary. I watched part 2 despite of this, and must say that part 2 was really, really boring. So it was with a great deal of skepticism and reluctance that I sat down and watched part 3.Are you kidding me? This movie was a joke.There is nothing scary about this movie at all, and suddenly there is a coven involved in it? That just didn't make any sense at all.Sure, there were times when the movie was starting to build up suspense, but it never really climaxed into a full-out effect. It wasn't scary at all. The best part about this movie was when whatever entity it was started moving stuff about in the girl's room and making one girl slide across the floor.The people in the movie did good enough jobs with their staged characters. Mind you, this is entertainment, not a real documentary. But it wasn't really characters that you bought into, and they were lacking personalities and depths.I enjoy horror movies, but "Paranormal Activity 3" was pretty far from being scary. But I am sure if you found the first two movies scary, then you will probably find this one scary too. But for people, like myself, who are used to watching proper horror movies, this is like a stroll in the park at high noon.And as for these movies being authentic; yeah right! It is entertainment, not real life. With this bottom-feeder third installment of the series, it is time to let the franchise die off quietly and go to sleep.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now I'm a horror fanatic but generally shy away from ghost stories, they rarely interest me. I was convinced to watch the first and second by my partner and I found them slow, boring and quite frankly like watching the Ghost Hunters without random people asking the rest if they heard something (Which they blatantly didn't).When I heard about how much money this had made and how it was hyped to be different than the others, more action packed (Namely something actually happened) I was interested in seeing it.Half way through the movie I found myself feeling conned, same formula....nothing new. And if you were expecting me to say that the second half turned it around, your kidding yourself. The movie plodded along with random bumps in the night but nothing actually taking place until the final 10 minutes. Alas that final 10 minutes is rushed, nonsensical and simply put a very poor finale that leads me to believe that this whole movie was used to hype the next snails pace sequel.I understand the studios logic making these things, they cost nothing to make and bring in millions, but after 3 of these movies and nothing happening nor changing I have to question the mentality of people who pay to see this garbage. If you continue to do so then the studios will continue to make it and instead of high quality movies we'll keep getting these bargain basement camcorder pieces of crap.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not really into horror, there's enough real life bad stuff going in the world without watching it on the screen however I went to paranormal-3 with a friend as a birthday gift to them. The film was so dull and boring it should be given to insomniacs as cure for their insomnia, it will certainly put them to sleep.We sat for an hour bored witless watching the equivalent of endless home movies. There was little kiddie chatting to imaginary friend, a door mysteriously shut, a light broke and a door was locked when it shouldn't have been but wow it took an hour to get to that point! Both of us were actually yawning and desperately trying to stay awake. I took a break and played some video games in the foyer for a while, apparently didn't miss anything at all. My friend went out for several very long cigarette breaks and missed nothing, ultimately we walked out because the mental torture of being bored witless was just too much.On the way out we we bought a drink and mentioned how bad the film was, only to be told that by the young lady that a lot of people were telling her that, she went on to say that staff get to see the films before the public and she wasn't frightened by it even though she cant handle scary films.If IMDb had negative ratings I would have given this film a -10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The worst of the series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a very boring movie. It is definitely not worth the money. I can only give kudos to the kid actors. They did a terrific job in pretending to be frightened. Plot didn't make much sense, could not wait for it to be over.You are constantly anticipating that it would get extremely scary, but it just flatlined. Nothing that really made the hair stand up on the back of your neck. Boring parlor tricks. Unbelievable what "scary" movies have turned into.The first hour was filled with pretty much nothing. The rest of the movie doesn't really do much to frighten you, or explain anything. I agree with the rest of the reviewers, trailers did not sync with actual film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm a Paranorman Activity convert!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has converted me. If there are other "Paranormal Activity" movies made in the future, I will eagerly wait and watch. I began this movie with very low expectations. Having seen the first of the series and loathing it, I vowed to never watch another when I found out more were being made. However, I did watch part 3 and am so happy now that I did. This is an amazing movie. After watching this I re-watched the first and watched the second for the very first time. I now no longer hate the first movie since seeing this one. It gives it some merit and makes it seem less random and pointless which is how it seemed to me before.I would suggest to people that have not seen any of this series or who have only seen the first movie to watch this first, followed by part 1 and then part 2. That will be more of a chronological order and will make it a much more cohesive viewing experience. Others who have seen the movies and loved them may not agree with me, but if you don't like to be confused while watching movies, that is definitely the best way to go. I highly recommend this movie to others who think they hate the PA movies. This may very well convert them too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the best one so far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was lucky to have seen it on a big screen with some teenagers attending it too. The first part of the flick they did laugh a lot with things going on, the second part some jumped in their seat and in the last part they were crying and one even screamed for her mum. Go face that one. Is it all that scary that the teenagers were screaming? No it isn't but it do delivers some jump scene's and has some creepy parts in it. The reason is simple. When you add kids into a flick and let them being possessed that do adds to the horror scale, isn't it? It did remind naturally of Poltergeist. A girl talking to an imagined person, but once she get annoyed by that person (ghost) that person (ghost) takes his revenge.I liked it and thought it was the best of the 3 so far. I said, so far, because it do has an open ending. The best thing is that it doesn't take until half the flick before things go awry. It starts really quick and doesn't stop until the end. It starts all with small things and a few jokes but slowly it builds in scary moments and further on it even becomes deadly. But if you don't like mockumentaries then you surely will be bored again. But I must say after the Saw franchise that this will become the new franchise. Let us only hope that it will gives us paranormal activity.Gore 1/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 3/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 1/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved Paranormal Activity (part 1 &amp; 2) and was so eager to go see part 3. I didn't even watch the trailers like many reviewers here did which was another spoiler since many parts from the trailer weren't there so I won't be commenting on that.The movies starts out well, interesting, then it starts getting kind of old with the same camera scenes, didn't get scared even once.Now the worst is.....the movie JUST ENDS! I was just watching in anticipation of something exciting to happen.....and then I see the credits on the screen! What the heck? Did the director just get tired or bored and decided "ok, show over, let's go home guys?" Oh my god! This has got to be the worst movie in 2011! I will never go to a Paranormal Activity Sequel in the future! Save your money &amp; Time! don't see it! Not even on DVD! It's not worth it at all!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After reading a lot of the reviews... my expectations were not very high... but not very low either. From the reviews, many people complained about how many segments from the trailers were not in the movie. And this was part of the reason why they didn't think it was so great. Well. One of the reasons why I liked the movie so much was because they didn't have everything from the commercials in the movie. I'm tired of trailers showing you everything that happens in the movie and when you watch it it is not as fun or exciting. Plus, one of the missing trailer scenes actually makes sense why it wasn't in the movie... it would have messed up part of the story.Okay, so. I thought the movie was good. It was better than the second one and not as good as the first. But, if this movie was the first of the three released, then it would have been the best probably (maybe). It was scary. But, I didn't come home with the same fear of sleeping in my bed scared... (probably because I didn't watch it by myself in the same room that I would be sleeping in). There were a few creative and inventive ideas in this movie that added a little something extra... to make it unique from the other two. If you know that you don't find these type of scary movies scary... but rather humorous... then why watch it and then complain about it not being scary and such... why go into a movie knowing exactly what you would critique and hate about it and then go and complain about it. That's lame.I rate the movie a 7... because it scared me... I sat through it and enjoyed it. I had fun watching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I think that Paranormal Activity 3 continues the tradition of being a great experience to a fairly unexceptional movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Paranormal Activity franchise is now entering its second sequel(prequel) and I've been left wondering if the franchise can really sustain itself relying on the same tricks its been using since the original. The series was certainly really cool and inventive when it was released by demand in 2009, but now the really cool following has erupted into a similar crowd that followed the Saw series. This sequel actually goes back to 1988 when the protagonists from the first two movies are children so that the audience can see where the whole story started(kind've). I think the big question on my mind as well as the minds of many others is how long can these movies keep audiences scared before the movies cheap tricks and formula grow stale? Paranormal Activity 3 certainly promises some new scares and a bit of an origin story, but can it really deliver on scares when it sticks pretty close the formula of the first two films?Check out the rest at http://wp.me/p1tyJd-61</fullReview>

To be honest the trailer was more interesting then the movie. This time it was very predictable and left people with more questions then answers. Examples:What does the symbols on the walls mean? Whats the history with this woman cult? What actually happen to the baby in PA2?In PA2 we found out what happened to Kate because it carried over, where in this movie nothing really seemed to fit.Hope the DVD is better then what I saw at the movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everyone has their own opinions about handy cam films and I think they simply boil down to you either liking them or disliking them. Personally I have been a bit of a fan of the Paranormal Activity films which is probably safe to say the opposite of the majority's opinion however I think taken at face value they deliver probably the best they can in terms of scares and atmosphere.Paranormal Activity 3 is basically a prequel to the other two films, it goes back to 1988 to try and shine some light on the events that took place in the first two films. There was already a mention in one of the previous films that there was an entity with them in their childhood and these are the video tapes that show exactly what took place in that time....Overall this is probably my favourite of the three films (closely followed by the first) I felt that it was more polished than the other two, delivered more effective punchier scares, built on tension a lot better and generally for me did the job and that was make a solid handy cam supernatural film! Whether it will hold the same weight on a DVD and out of the cinema I don't know but either way i thoroughly enjoyed it! Read the full review at: beyondthegore</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not sure why anyone would give this a rating of more than 3 out of 10. This movie was a failure, not only did it fail to scare me, but it also failed at keeping my attention. I don't believe, they even tried. The movie was so predictable (and not in a good way). This is my first time watching any of these sequels or whatever you wanna call 'em. I wasn't impressed, at least some of the other scary movies will make you laugh, not this one. My advise, is don't waste your time or money, wait till it comes out on DVD at red box for $1.20 (still not worth it, but it's better that $30 at the movies). Also, the movie started off in 2006 with Daniel (Kristi's husband) they didn't explain how the movie ended up in 1988 with Dennis (same voice by the way) Dennis is supposed to be Katie and Kristi's moms boyfriend (confusing).</fullReview>

So I knew there were gonna be some of the scenes from the trailer left out, and there was gonna be a bone crunching ending. A lot of the BOOS were people jumping out at your, which did scare you, but was lame. It left a lot of unanswered questions. When you though "Okay, here we go!" It ends. The ending to me was a little confusing. It wasn't about the demon or haunting at all, but a satanic colt that seemed to willingly let the demon posses them. I don't know, it was just weird. Also, there were like only two scenes of what was in the trailer, and that was the girl coming up the stairs and the guy and the girl getting scared in the bathroom. That and the Bloody Mary was there, but it wasn't of the two girls doing it and you didn't see it the black figure. The Trailer made you believe it was gonna be 10 stars, when it wasn't. See it at your own risk. It was fun either way to scream with the audience.</fullReview>

Its not even worth watching for free. I watched it in the theatres and seriously it was horrible. 1 and 2 were good. I personally loved 2. I guess people who get scared easily would find it frightening other than that it was B-A-D. Even after reading this if you still plan to watch it, its all up to you this is from only my perspective.

		<fullReview>Let me make this clear: I went to this movie with the sole intention of seeing how rubbish it was. After watching the first two films to feel what it is like to die, repeatedly, while looking at a movie, I knew that this was going to be something reeally special. There were six other patrons in the theater. It was being put on in the tiniest screen in the 9 screen cinema. I could literally guess every cheap scare that was going to happen, and wasn't surprised that the filmmakers were too lazy to put in some more subtle disturbances, like the rocking horse swinging very gently, or a candle flickering. All of us laughed during the supposedly ''intense'' scenes. When the film ended so abruptly, there was a mutual understanding between us all. We looked at each other and shook our heads in shame, then burst out laughing. Everyone in the theater. The lads who picked up all the rubbish after the showing came in a few minutes early, saw the ending, and laughed with us. People, save your 10 bucks and... I don't know, buy a milliliter of petrol or something. The one thing that I hate about IMDb is that it won't let you rate in negative numbers. Because since this is even worse than the first two films, I really can't give it a score. Well, one out of ten for the pure joy of it being so short. But, a warning: People! Destroy every copy of this pile of steaming horse turd as the spawn of Satan doesn't deserve to exist! Do not let it reach Youtube in 10 minute clips as the internet will be burnt to a crisp and chicken nuggets will ally with doughnuts to go on a suicidal rampage to obliterate everything in the universe, including Louie Walsh! 1 out of 10!

I GOTCHA!" generic stuff from the first 2, while some of it left me going "What... the... heck...". Of course, there were only 2 parts that really left me going "Whoa... that was pretty good!". There are holes in the story everywhere. If the movie were a bridge, you wouldn't be able to walk for 10 seconds without falling through. I had high hopes, despite the first two being just as generic, but I came out disappointed. More than half of the trailer clips weren't even used and those were the ones that made it look cool! All in all, the story was put together horribly, it wasn't genuinely SCARY at all and I just didn't like it. My opinions are entirely subjective, as there are people who think this is the epitome of horror films. Don't take my word for fact, but in my opinion, I wasted my money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was not expecting much from Paranormal Activity 3. I was a moderate fan of the first Paranormal Activity, and thought the sequel was a decent but underwhelming rehash. To my surprise, this third entry ended up being possibly my favorite of the series - it doesn't have the freshness of the original, and suffers a bit from a creepy but nonsensical ending, but is easily the scariest and most fun of the three. This is a roller-coaster ride of a horror movie, one that will leave you in agonizing suspense, inspire uncontrollable fits of nervous laughter and make your heart leap into your throat over and over again. Its unpretentious goal is to be an entertaining, scary spook show, and it succeeds with flying colors. It's not a well-rounded or intelligent movie, but I had a blast watching it with a crowd of equally entertained moviegoers, and for this type of movie that's what really matters.</fullReview>

Paranormal Activity is just a recycled plot with different characters and same scare tactics that just don't get to you. Personally, yes the 1st film did make me jump a little but didn't give me a real good scare. The sequel was just old tricks in new film which bored me. Sitting there for a little more than an hour and a half just had me waste my life watching this. This film has horribly let down the horror franchise.

My complaints. 1) Hardly any scenes from trailer are in movie. 2) Now real explanation as to Why this all happens.

The buildup is well thought through and does create huge interest in the story-line. The home-made video style movie does it best for me and those small nuggets of scary moments are really well done. Of course, those of you watching this on a laptop/ desktop/ small TV will miss out on the fun because one thing i have realized with horror movies - effects are most of it (sound n large image/video) being them.One of the best scenes in the movie is the one where the dad is chasing noises and then he gets it right in his face. Boom! There are others as well but then.. the end of the movie gets a little too predictable and to make it worse it even pans out the way you think it will. For me the first part was the one n only version which really make up a lot of suspense and thrill. Now, it seems they just want to drag it on..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was by far the best film in the series, and maybe even one of the best horror movies ever made. It had my theater laughing, crying, and running out through out the whole film. Although it was much darker than the other two PA's, it provided a lot more comic relief than the other's did, proving to be a much more enjoyable movie experience. I also don't understand why so many are complaining about the ending; it answered many of my questions without answering every single one, making room for a part 4, which i have no problem with. it seems to me that these films get scarier and scarier as each sequel (or prequel, in this series case) continues, which is why i think people are always returning to see them. whether you enjoyed the last two or not i really think you should go see this one, as it impressed me in more ways then one. *spoiler* my only complaint is that the movie contained almost NONE of the scenes from the trailer(s), which kind of disappointed me because i was REALLY looking forward to the water scene.

They could scare people because it all happened in the home, the one place you are supposed to be safe; and turns it upside down. Paranormal Activity 3 does this, and more. It messes with you mind, gets under your skin, and makes you scream! All your questions from PA 1 &amp; 2 are answered and the ending will shock you! But this movie gets a 9/10 thanks to the genius(es) who were in charge of the trailers; none of the footage in the trailers was in the film! And I mean, NONE of the trailer footage. The trailers were misleading and actually could have made the movie more scary! They might be saving that footage for, possibly, an extended and unrated version when PA 3 is released on DVD/Blu-Ray.

		<fullReview>I love the first 2 Paranormal Activity movies.I am so disappointed in this movie.1st off, the trailer is very misleading. The movie leaves out half of the scary moments in the trailer (not the bloody Mary one, the full- length second trailer!)I cannot believe people actually like this movie! It Sucks!2nd off, throughout the whole movie I sat there while people jump out of closets with masks, people turn around to see creepy little girls, and babysitters jump in front of the camera and shout "Hi Dennis!" How Lame?If you do go see the movie though, go for one, two, or all three of these reasons.1: The theater experience. It is much more fun to be scared with other people than to be scared alone. (although 9/10 of the moments in the movie aren't scary)2: To understand the next movie that will come out next year. There are some points in the movie that are revealed that you won't want to miss out on if the next one is any good.3. The ending. The last 15-20 minutes goes back to pure Paranormal Activity brilliance! It was almost enough to redeem itself, but then I thought to myself: "If the rest of the movie had been like this, it wouldn't have sucked!" So yeah... It's not scary until those last 15-20 minutes, if you get scared by the pop ups (we all do!!!! &gt;:[ ) then you might just love this movie. If you like the other 2 Paranormal Activity movies, it's a 50/50 chance (you'll either love it or hate it). And if you absolutely love the first two like me and lots of others, than skip this one and wait for the "Unrated" DVD. I'm sure all the stuff they left out of the trailers will be in there... Please don't pay the full price admission ticket to see this! It's trash! If you're into the PA mood, go slip the first 2 into the DVD/Bluray player!5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paranormal activity 3 was creepy, very. It was scary also but the one thing that made me mad and a lot of people i know is how they left out so many scenes from the trailer. The reason people go to the movies is because of the trailer... and them taking those scenes out ruined a lot of the expectations.The one thing that was most terrifying was the camera atop the fan. Because you never knew what was going to be in the kitchen or in the living room. Another thing that was really creepy was the freaking old lady cult. That s*** was scary. That image was THE scariest thing throughout the whole movie, well for me. And the plot got very predictable by the time they got to the grandmother's house. I already knew the grandmother had something to do with this. There were also lots of plot holes by the end of the movie... so many questions...but at the end of the day, if you like being scared and want to, go see it. If you're one of those people, like me, who want the whole package: good scares, great plot, GREAT ending. then don't waste your money. They also said the last 15 minutes will mess up your life? I slept so well last night.Paranormal Activity 1 was the best, and looks like it will always be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We all know what these series of films are all about now. We all know that if we go to see them, we are going to get a good scare. We all know that a lot of the footage of the trailer isn't in the final film.What I didn't know was how a camera on a fan body could be the most terrifying thing I have seen in a long time.I can do with the bangs, the blankets moving, and even the whole kitchen falling to the floor. But at night, seeing the cameras move from left to right, and the viewer knowing full well something will happen, is the most shocking part of the film.It usurps the second movie a lot, by not focusing on one thing for the majority of the film (Swimming pool), but it focuses more on the two girls and the detective work Dennis does throughout the film, rather than give us cheap thrills.Minor characters are discarded as they are not really adding much to the film, and the house is a lot bigger in this one, just the second house was a lot bigger, leaving more space to focus on during the night.The night scenes are longer and more eerier, but there are a couple of copouts due to editing. The two young girls are amazing in this, and they add a sort of Shining feel to the whole proceedings.But the disturbances go into the day, so where as before, the viewer was relatively safe watching the day footage, you are not here.Plus we finally get to see the 'demon in various forms. The most eerie being when it's under the sheet. For one moment you think it's one of the girls, but then something happens....The mother can get quite annoying at times, and there was one scene where i wanted Dennis to drag her down to his study and force her to watch the tapes.Sadly, the last fifteen minutes are a letdown. still creepy, but it just feels like the makers have ripped of 'The Last Exorcism'.So all in all, it's a great addition to the series, with a genius turn in the moving camera and a few other shocks.if there is a fourth (which I'm guessing there will be because the weekend B.O looks amazing), they must do something to the ending.But a good scary movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where is everything from the trailer?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this film last night, at a Vue cinema and all in all, I thought the film was fairly good. It's the best out of the three. It took a while to get into it, but when it did, it really did. The thrills were so much better and a hell of a lot more tense than the previous two films.When the film came to it's climax though, I realised I didn't see anything from the trailers!? Where was all this footage?! I never saw the man who gets his head bashed against the table a fair few times. I never saw Katie and Kristi play 'Bloody Mary' in their bathroom. The biggest thing that was missing for me though, was the house that was on fire that you see in the trailer. Where was that?! I don't remember seeing any house on fire!? I was baffled because in the previous two films, they've mentioned a house fire and who it's effected both Katie and Kristi badly. So, where was the house on fire?! It made no sense whatsoever.I hope when the DVD is released, there is an extended cut! I would like my questions answered for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paranormal Activity is definitely a polarizing film. It seems you either love it or you hate it. If you didn't like the first one, you definitely won't like this one, and that's fine. If you liked the first film, and even if you didn't like the second film, you will enjoy this one. You can even see this film without watching the previous two and not miss much.Paranormal Activity 3 is in the same style of the first two movies, but I think it's much more effectively done here. The filmmakers addressed a lot of issues people had with the first, and more so, second movies. The characters are likable and, for the most part, not incredible idiots. There's not a huge amount of build-up till the main narrator accepts that there is a ghost, and significant scares happen early and often. While there are some repeats from earlier films, they are limited and fairly short. For instance, there is only one shot of someone standing and staring at the bed. Unlike the second film, there are no long, repeating shots with nothing going on. At most you get about 10 seconds of establishing the norm before something incredibly freaky happens. It's a good mix of subtlety and overtness and double crossing audience expectations.Many reviewers cite the last fifteen minutes as being especially frightening, but to me the most effective moments happened in the previous 30 minutes as the demon becomes meaner and meaner to Katie.There are some issues: series continuity is not followed. Pretty much everything from the trailer is missing. People complain about the HD video from VHS tapes. My reply? They could have left out the first five minutes and released this as an incredibly effective original movie 'inspired' by the first, and I have no interest in paying ten bucks watching a 90 minute film in SD.I will say: this is definitely a film to see in the theater. PA1 was much more effective at home because the house looked like generic new construction. So much of this film is in enjoying the brief suspense and cathartic release over and over again that having an audience of willing participants can greatly increase the appeal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>By Far the best movie for the Halloween season!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I gave this movie a seven simply because I have honestly seen better, BUT make no mistake this had me screaming so loud that my throat began to hurt. It was creative,inventive, distinct, horrifying and all in its own way. The characters were great and the family was so convincing that for a while I forgot this movie isn't based on actual events. The Paranormal Activity trilogy is by far one of the best I have ever seen since the Michael Myers reign. I loved every aspect of it, parts one and two had me scared but this had and still has me terrified by far. While I caught the midnight release of this film and I did not see many of the parts shown in the trailer on the big screen, it just makes me more excited to purchase the DVD once it comes out. Better yet I think I'll do a pre-order. Once again folks if your looking to be scared this Halloween season then this is the movie for you! I just hope and pray that this is it, the last film of the story line because what better way to finish, than to finish with a BANG!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pre-K Paranormal Activity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, you've seen PA1 and PA2 and you think to yourself, "Hmm, where can they possibly go from here?" I thought, incorrectly of course, that they were going to follow Katie and Hunter and their endeavors. Unfortunately, my dreams were squashed months ago by the first trailer. Some were correct in assuming that they HAD to go for a prequel. The issue was, how do you make sure that the cameras are retro enough for these high class film critics?! Well, you simply put a camera on an oscillating fan's base and there you go. The new camera panning added so much to the movie. It added a suspense that had not been seen in the other movies. As it pans to one side you think, "When it goes back there, something's gotta be going down!" But no, it doesn't so then you think, "Now it's gotta!" But no. And so forth for 2-3 cycles until "WTF! They cleaned their kitchen?!" The young Katie and Kristi were great actresses and definitely added a new level of scare tactics. So many times I was just hoping Kristi would stay in bed so that I can breathe for a second. Young Katie also gives us arguably the two jumpiest scenes in the movie.In other news, Old Katie and Old Kristi weren't in the movie long enough for us to enjoy their presence but luckily they did cast a hot babysitter. Micah is non-existent at this point, thank God but we get to meet what seems like his douchey, much older brother. Thank you for allowing us to hate him once again. On the flip-side we do get to meet a funny new character who was totally into filming the activities until "Nothing happened."Overall, this is by far the best of the series and thus doesn't allow me much room for sarcastic remarks. I ponder to myself how Katie and Kristi functioned in grade school with Toby around all the time... sigh...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Paranormal Activity 3 - Full Cinema, No Complaints</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must say First off that i love the Paranormal Activity series, and despite being slightly let-down by the second in the series, i must say that it definitely bounced back for the viewers and gave us a whole new level of terror.I saw the film tonight, on the first release date in New Zealand, and entered the cinema with high hopes for the film, but did not feel any worry about this. I knew 100% that i would not be let down again by the series and left the cinema knowing that i was accurate in my belief This film is by far the scariest of the series and brings with it a new level of connecting up than i have ever seen in any horror series in the past. It managed to keep the aspect of terror alive as well as keep everyone on the edge of their seats throughout and also keep the story and not lose its touch SPOILER ALERT: I have to admit that the ending for the story left me with my mouth open and slightly shocked. i loved in that moment he opened the door and there were all of the old women in the room, trying to get Kristi and Katie, and that it opened a window into the past. i can only feel sympathy for the two little girls and what they had to endure after what happened in their evil grandmothers house overall this film definitely had its funny moments and its very, very scary ones, and i am hoping that they don't stretch the series for another 3 Movies, but find someway to end it with a bang</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a HUGE PA. Back in Nov. of 2009 i decided to see the first one but i was not crazy about seeing it. I thought it was good but after watching it at home a few times i thought it was excellent. So it was a no-brainer i would see 2 and now in 2011, part 3. PA3 is actually... possibly scarer then 1 &amp; 2. It brings, tension, scares, jump scares, the perfect amount of humor. Not forced. Its just a great movie... but literally the last 5 minutes when you realize "how it begin"... I thought it may have been rushed or not such a great idea, an "oh, this again!" moment. Now the ending is a masterpiece compared to that rushed crap ending to The Last Exorcism but i have mixed feelings on PA3's ending. It was good and scary as hell but... i think the writers pushed it a little too far story wise and retreated to the formula. Not that it wasn't well done, it was... but i am not 100% it will fit with the first two movies story-lines...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad, but a mediocre horror film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paranormal Activity took the place of Saw as the annual franchise of the horror genre which, with every new movie, recycles a same formula changing some elements, or deepening more into the original story. And even though technically more sequels could be made (or prequels), I think that Paranormal Activity 3 should be the last film from this franchise.I appreciated the fact that Paranormal Activity 3 bothered itself to follow and solve the mystery of the ghost presence established in the two previous films. However, the explanation did not leave me very satisfied, nor I found it particularly ingenious (in fact, I think it is pretty much of a clich). I think that one of the best elements from Paranormal Activity and Paranormal Activity 2 was the balance they kept between realism and fantasy; the environment was very real, the characters were credible, and the supernatural manifestations suggested a sinister purpose, exacerbated by the fact that they were quite vague. Most of Paranormal Activity 3 kept that attitude...but when the moment of the big revelation comes, I felt that it crossed the line to a fantastic field which is not very compatible with the tone from this saga. In other words, I did not find it a well-founded explanation, but an improvised excuse.For the rest, Paranormal Activity 3 brings us more from the same: long takes of the family sleeping, minimum special effects and some shock scenes in order to break the suspense (I have to admit that some of those shocks produced involuntary laughs on me). And besides, the "home video" scenes have a lower quality, something which extracted definition and clarity to those moments in which we do not know what is going to happen. As for the actors, Lauren Bittner and Christopher Nicholas Smith bring adequate performances, even though their characters are a bit hollowly written. And the girls Chloe Csengary and specially Jessica Tyler Brown are quite credible in their roles.In conclusion, Paranormal Activity 3 is a film which offers more from the same, but which is inferior to the two previous installments from the saga, and which offers a quite disappointing ending, specially because it alters my perception of the two previous films. However, I can slightly recommend it because it kept me moderately entertained despite its mediocrity. Nevertheless, I think that the door from this saga should be closed down, unless someone finds the appropriate angle to bring new life to it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The last 15 minutes will mess you up for life" No Kidding!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow! I just came back from seeing this uh, thing. I have to say, it's kinda hard to describe the feeling that I got from this. I could either say that it was genuinely terrified and it raised the bar for future horror movies, which is a good thing, or I could say that they went way over the top in terms of scare tactic and bone-chilling suspense, that it made the movie uncomfortable and took away from the enjoyment factor. Well, I have decided to go with the longer lasting impressions of this movie and say: it's MAD scary! What makes this movie different from the others is that, for the first time, we see something truly supernatural, including the bed sheet ghost, the lady shadow, the hair pulling and, of course, the FREAKING kitchen scene. Those things scare me more than the other stuff in the first movie that, while creepy, could be explained naturally.Another thing is something that I noticed right away, the style in which the story was being told was, more typical and more commonplace. What I mean is that, this movie follows other typical horror movies more closely than the previous 2. For example, throughout the first hour or so of the movie, the demon starts creeping about the house and the first people to be terrorized by it are the babysitter and Randy, Dennis' friend, who then decide to flee the house and are never seen again. That to me is kind of like a serial killer killing off the unimportant characters first in a typical slasher flick. I don't think it's a bad thing though. I think the new directors were trying to appeal to both the fans of PA and the regular viewers who would also identify with this style, so in that regard, it was a way to benefit everyone.The last thing I would mention is that, as the movie progressed, it made me feel uneasy and dreadful about the ending, or more importantly, the so called "last 15 minutes that would mess me up for life". Well, they were right. It was a rough transition because like I said, I was feeling uncomfortable about going through more of the creepy stuff just to get to the ending. When I finally did though, I was on the edge, my heart was beating fast, I was covering my ears, and occasionally, I was even closing my eyes or looking away to remind myself of where I really was. Having done that stuff probably took the suspense away, but I didn't wanna risk my health.Overall, this movie has a little bit of everything: tension, jump scares, arguably unnecessary humor, and a solidification of this demon thing we've grown to love. Some might not like the new, more typical direction this movie took, but that's understandable. And if anything that won't be the reason why this movie will be "hard to watch".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Paranormal Activity 3" Keeps Franchise Alive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll start off saying "Paranormal Activity 3" follows the same formula as its predecessors. So if you were a fan of the first two, then there is no reason not to be a fan of this installment. The film is set in 1988 where the boyfriend of the mother of Katie and Kristi (lead women from previous two films who are kids in this film) sets up cameras around the house after detecting spooky footage on his camera following an "earthquake." From there the film begins to follow the pattern of the previous films of escalating horrific occurrences and more characters getting exposed to the unknown visitor.This film was pretty well made I must say. Keeping the film in a 1988 setting was fairly well executed. The vintage San Diego Padres logo on the fridge, light bright game on the kids' dresser, and the cloths of the babysitter and Randy. Other parts seemed a little, well, out of the time period. But that's just me being a little nit picky. The jumpy parts were very well done and really make you jump. I also have to give them credit for doing new ways to creepily almost see the spirit (best of course being the sheet standing behind the babysitter).The acting was good for the most part. Christopher Nicholas Smith as Dennis and Justin Ingram Randy were definitely the highlights. They were easy to relate to and characters you could pull for. Lauren Bittner as Julie wasn't really anything special except for being attractive.The only place this movie was lacking was plot development. (**SPOILER**) Yes I get that this movie was about the experiences the girls had as children with this unknown entity but it doesn't add to the story except that the Grandmother was involved. The idea of a cult to create a male heir in the family tied in but the ending was kind of unsatisfying. I get that Kristi was lined up to marry "Tobey" but what does that have to do with anything? Is the fourth installment going to cover what happened after? The movie didn't show the house burning as was indicated in the previous films. (**SPOILER**) I don't know, it just left too much open to be answered for me to really put this up there with the first one.Overall, the scares were legit, acting was so-so, and visual effects were cool, but the story needed a little more. I recommend this to fans of the previous two, those who didn't enjoy them don't bother and why are you reading this? 8 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before you start reading this review I want you to know that this is coming from a person who is not dissecting every detail of the movie (script,directing,acting,special effects etc.). I'm writing this review as a normal person who likes scary movies. In my opinion this was the scariest of all three Paranormal Activity movies. I jumped a lot and I doubt I was the only one that did. I think the story line was also pretty good. I just had a hard time believing it took place in the 80's. The movie was a bit short for me (not even an hour and a half), and I was a bit disappointed that a lot of what was shown in the trailer was not in the movie. Although there was a "Bloody Mary" scene it was with one sister and the boyfriends friend and not with both sisters. The scene in the trailer makes it look like the girls summoned the ghost and that's what was causing the paranormal activity, but you find out in the end that it was the grandmother who is part of some kind of demon worshiping group. In all I think this movie was pretty good. It was scary and there were actually some funny parts too. If you have seen the other two movies and liked them you should see this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first two Paranormal Activity films were quite random. They were essentially a contemporary haunted house tale that took things to a comical level. I know I'm not alone in thinking those movies were hilarious. In the third installment, however, the frights start to creep in. We do get a lot of the usual antics that have become trademarks of the franchise, but as the story progresses, we begin to understand the cause of it. Fans of the series will love it... and those who are not, may be tempted to give the franchise a second chance. This is a very effective prequel and allows you to look at the other two films in a whole new light. Plus, now that we know the whole story, the fourth installment sounds very promising.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paranormal Activity 3 is the best one yet you would think by now the franchise would have run its course but no it has not there are more scares and more doors are opened for future installments. This is understandable when the makers behind Catfish are involved and they bring new scares and show this franchise is not dead. This is my favourite so far it is one of the best horror films out there at the moment so many questions are answered but soo many have been created and some are still unanswered. If the story is good i hope there is another installment as these questions need answering. Watch the first two before seeing this as i didn't and now i am going to watch them as people say they are clues and hints plus you have to watch the first two pr you would be lost with this one. When the adverts say the last 15 minuets you will never forget they mean it you will be shocked. Paranormal Activity 3 is fantastic a must see for any horror fan and a must see for fans of paranormal activity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not gonna bother writing down the storyline for this sequel. They had no business making a sequel after the horrible second movie. It uses the same, boring approach, which is beyond stale. This time, they go all the way back to 1988!! Talk about scraping the bottom of the barrel just to make some cash at the box office. They talked about befriending an entity in the first movie, but that doesn't mean they needed to make a freaking prequel/sequel out of it! I don't give a flying f****** about Katie and her sister's childhood. If you thought the snail's pace was bad in Paranormal Activity II, wait until you watch this movie. It makes Paranormal Activity II look like a speeding bullet in comparison. There are way too many shots of the house, characters doing pointless things. At one point, the husband actually wants to see how big of a drag his wife can take on a marijuana cigarette (!) Stuff like that just screams filler. They also try to legitimize the 80's setting by using VHS. It's about the only thing in this movie that they put effort on. It's completely void of entertainment, suspense, scares, and tension. The idiotic characters make things even worse. The male lead is just another Micah, in my opinion. Speaking of Micah, he shows up briefly to cash in a check. Katie Featherstone has gotten rather hot, but that's about it. She doesn't do much. The ending is very anti-climatic, making me wonder why I spent my precious minutes on this movie. Anything to make money, even if the story is told in the first two. Thank god this movie was short! It still felt like well over two hours. Thankfully, Paranormal Activity 4 was actually quite tolerable. It wasn't great, but it showed semblance of what made the first movie good. If you're looking to cure insomnia, this might just do it!DUD</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weakest in the franchise by far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moving into his girlfriends' house, a man comes to learn that her daughters' seemingly imaginary friend is a malicious spirit that has been targeting them and tries to find a way of stopping it from corrupting his family.Overall, this is certainly the weakest effort in the series and is not that impressive. Among the many flaws here is the fact that this one really tends to wander around for so long building up the human drama back-story that it's really not all that interesting for the first hour or so. Not only is this barely filled with any attacks or ghostly occurrences, there's barely any reason for them to set up the cameras in the first place as the whole thing is centered around her imaginary friend which is hardly the sort of behavior from a little girl that causes parents to place cameras in the house to check on paranormal activity when they're not around. That thread alone makes this one hard to swallow, but as well the fact that this one goes on for so long really tends to make this drag on and on throughout here so it's quite dull and boring for the most part as the only real scare throughout here is the false scare with the wife that's played as a practical joke on the husband so it's inclusion is a totally unjustifiable one that eats up time that could've been used to better explain how their family history is involved in the demonic the way it's portrayed here since it starts to get interesting with the presence of the demon conjuring and protective symbols that have been handed down throughout the family, but it doesn't have the time to do that since the film has spent so much time tying in the fact of her imaginary friend rather than doing anything else in here. There's actually a few good things about this, mostly the final twenty minutes or so with the family now in their relatives' house and being subjected to numerous assaults by demons and ghosts that are quite frightening and really creepy. Utilizing the possession tricks throughout here and the demonic attributes makes for a rather enjoyable time with some action finally thrown in for good measure, but overall it's not nearly enough to compensate for the boredom elsewhere as well as the series continued annoyance of featuring the shaking camera perspective that really hampers the visuals throughout here that are the more memorable parts of this one.Rated R: Graphic Language, Violence and children-in-jeopardy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Utterly ridiculous!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*sigh* not sure where to start with this one! We went from the subtle atmospheric genius of the first and second one, to the downright ostentatiousness of this one! Its like the scriptwriters didn't even watch the first two films! OK, so in the first one you'll remember that Katy explains to Micah that growing up she and her sister were regularly visited by an entity which stood at the foot of Katy's bed and used to terrify her and her sister? Thats pretty much all she tells Michah,which tbh is unsettling enough a thing to happen to anybody, so far so good. And the first half hour or so it does stick to what Katy has told Micah, but then trouble really starts a brewing. Basically the entity then goes on to threaten Katie unless the younger sister , Kristi, does what he says. There is also levitating bodies and right at the end a whole room full of demonic looking women, not to mention people being thrown down the stairs etc! Yet Katy doesn't think to mention ANY of this to Micah!!! To be honest this film has just got 'cash cow' written all over it! There is barely any relevance between this film and its two predecessors. Are you honestly telling me that Katy would tell Micah about a ghost standing at the foot of her bed but negate to to tell him any of the other ridiculous over the top goings on that happened!? I mean how are Katy and her sister not scarred for life if all of that really had happened? Paranormal activity 1,2 and 4 were excellent films providing the right amount of atmosphere and jumpy bits that you come to expect from the PA writers, PA 3 just lets them down, they should have binned this one and gone on straight to number 4</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since my second job of buying lottery tickets isn't paying off, I've decided to make my first million by means of a webcam. It seems easy enough: Film a boring house with a boring family for about 90 minutes, label different scenes as Day 1-30 and make sure my buddy opens/slams doors and drops items (by means of cheap fishing wire) in the background while I scream on mic: "What was thaaaaaat? Oh myyyyy goooood!"Thanks Hollywood; you've made my rich dreams come true. You've proved you don't need millions to make millions. I can make a movie like Paranormal Activity 3 (1/5 Stars) just for the price of the webcam. Maybe even less. I guess I could return the webcam since the entire movie can be made in less than two hours and my buddy could be an intern. Hmmm?Okay, I'll be serious. These movies, these chores to get through, should come with the disclaimer: "ONLY If You Believe in Real-Life Paranormal Activities, You Will Be Frightened. As For Sane People, We Apologize for the Inconvenience of the Next 90 Minutes."But even that statement won't hold up much. For, these movies aren't even trying to make you believe they actually happened. So, you'll get a fictional movie (pick one: Paranormal Activity 1, 2 OR 3, they're all EXACTLY SAME MOVIE) and for about 90 minutes, you'll have roughly 1-2 minutes of something happening or changing in the background. Wow, you devoted fans have a shitload more patience than me!Look, yeah, I don't fall under the "Believe in Ghosts" mentality, but truthfully, in a rage when I got home, I said: "Bloody Mary" 3x in the mirror ? as instructed in the movie ? just to end it. Miserably, I guess I didn't believe enough because nothing happened to finish off my pain.Worst of all, since I was so incredibly bored, I didn't laugh (AT the movie, mind you) as much during this third installment as I did the first two. Okay, okay, I admit, the ghost acting like a ghost, i.e. wearing the traditional white sheet ? that was flipping hilarious! ? and the ending, which seemed like 4 hours to get to, made me laugh hard. Especially when the emotionless, dull and trite Step-Dad gets bent backwards to death. Yeah, there, I spoiled it. Maybe I did you a favor.Don't worry; the movie is as scary as a kid by a campfire holding a flashlight under his chin. At least when he tells this dud of a tale, he probably can sum up the entire movie in less than 5 minutes. Really, there's not much more story here to restate.Wake up, America! We're losing the war on terrible movies every time you put even a buck into these terrorist's, er, director's pockets.(Wait?why were there two directors for this again? Oh! So each can point the blame finger at each other when people finally realize the idiocracy portrayed here.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Same old formula, weaker new ideas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I gave this movie 2 stars just because i laughed in some scenes, thus it was at least enjoyable enough to deserve more than 1 star (which is the worst note available). In fact, the whole crowd was laughing a lot in many scenes, and i do not blame them, because this movie fails to accomplish anything that it should be, which is to be a horror movie, and it fails so bad that the horror scenes became ridiculous instead of scary.The found footage style on horror movies, a genre that became popular after the "Blair Witch", is so over-used lately that it ceased to be a tool to build a "realistic", near-documentary atmosphere and turned into just an annoying, shaking and pointless way to record a movie, far from the original, raw feeling that the pioneers achieved.The problem with Paranormal Activity (the whole franchise), in my opinion, is that it is almost entirely based on the found footage idea, and if you are not in the mood to "believe" that everything on screen really happened and those were real people to enjoy it. Why is that? Because it have really, really bad acting, bad direction, and long scenes where absolutely nothing happens. But then again, if everything on screen is "real", the people aren't acting, there's no direction and people's lives are boring, so nothing really happens most of the time.Paranormal Activity 3 is essentially the same movie as 1 and 2, but this time with kids. And most people still buy it. Go figure...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remembering poltergeist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found PA to be boring. The second one even though i know i saw it i cant really remember it so there must not have been anything memorable about it. I recently heard there is a fourth now playing and i wasn't even aware a third had been made. I ran across it on netflix and decided to watch it. I had read a couple reviews stating it was the best. I have also read a few reviews stating the previews were quite different. I looked at the preview and there in fact a few scenes and even characters not in the movie i saw on netflix so i am assuming that is what thats about. Anyway my opinion on this movie is that it is OK. I don't try to judge it based on the others but inits own movie. It had a rather slow start but i guess that is to be expected to build up tension. I do believe the writers took a lot of inspiration from tobe hoopers classic poltergeist. Little girl talking to ghost...got it, someone being dragged into closet....got it, stuff in the kitchen being moved around in just a few seconds....got it, parents blazing one up....got it heck there's even the TV comng on with static and instead of the little girl saying "they're here" she says "tobys here" i was just waiting for a four foot tall old lady to come and cleanse the house but then it went from mischievous spirits to something to do with cult related women and even that has its similarity to poltergeist where the females had the "gift" these females were all witches i guess. Anyway the movie had a few tense moments and was OK.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They're here... again.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Paranormal Activity movies are all pretty boring. Everything that happens is too subtle to have an impact. The spooky stuff is mostly just strange noises and maybe an occasional light fixture swinging for no apparent reason. A lot of each movie is just you sitting and waiting for something interesting to happen. And why these people feel the need to constantly tape their every move even when nothing is happening is a mystery into and of itself.The third instalment is also the most derivative. It is eerily similar to Poltergeist. The wife smokes pot. The girls' bedroom furniture gets sucked towards the crawlspace. Kristi behaves very similarly to Carol Ann, talking to the spirits that only she can see. The house itself looks similar to the one in Poltergeist: 80s suburbia.On the other hand, this movie is probably the most enjoyable one of the three. The production values are higher and there is a lot more weird stuff happening thanks to better special effects. The Bloody Mary bit was a nice touch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The redundancies of this franchise are starting to show</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Paranormal Activity franchise just seems to keep on trucking along, never losing any steam it seems. Paranormal Activity 3 is, obviously, the third film in the franchise. This time around we jump back 18 years to when Katie and Kristi, the unfortunate pair of demonically terrorized sisters, are children. The film chronicles their first encounter with the demon that returns to terrorize them in the first two films. Obviously, the film is shot in the same first person style as the first two films, always adding to the creepiness factor that possesses the entire film franchise.Three movies in and I still haven't managed to sit through a single one of these films in the franchise without being incredibly scared for my life. Paranormal Activity 3 doesn't let up on the thrills, and employs all of the same chilling techniques that scared the crap out of us in the first two films. It goes in a similar route as the second film in setting up surveillance cameras around the house to monitor the strange happenings that the characters encounter at the beginning of the film. We are obviously somewhat used to this by the third time around, but Paranormal Activity 3 does have one stroke of genius that ramps up the scariness ten fold. And that is the cruelly suspenseful oscillating camera that pans back and forth to monitor the living room and kitchen of the house. This was a fiendishly clever move by the filmmakers and helped to keep the style of the franchise at least somewhat fresh.However, Paranormal Activity 3 really starts to show the redundancies of this franchise. I like the prequel element as it is interesting to see the story that began with the first Paranormal Activity grow deeper and deeper, but this film does sort of feel like more of the same. It is still scary, but the disturbingly tense atmosphere that the first two films had down so well wasn't as prevalent here. Paranormal Activity 3 is still entertaining, and still frightening, but its also a little crazy and, especially by the end, seemed to go a little overboard.I enjoyed this film, but it was easily my least favorite of the three. If you have seen the first two films then don't miss out on this one, even though it isn't as great as the first two in style or substance. It definitely delivers on the thrills, but it has its fair share of issues. But, as I've said before, go in without skepticism and just enjoy the film because it is plenty entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The problem with this movie is that it was just like the first two. About the same type of things happen, so by the third time, it's just boring. This is a prequel just like the second film. This time the two sisters are little and we see how the haunting began. This time, it is the mom's boyfriend that carries a video camera throughout the film. Weird things happen and these people just act so what. I think I would be trying to perform an exorcism. Then the surprise twist happens when they go to the grandmother's.FINAL VERDICT: Just like the first two. At least it is a short movie, so if you just like the concept of these movies, check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow paced "horror" movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This time I'll try something bit different. I'll try to review the film as I watch it, and not when I've finished watching. I start to write about 50 minutes into the film. So far, if you ask me, _nothing_ has happened. Very early in the film, the dad of the family gets feelings something is not right with the house. That is over and done in like, ten minutes. A haste work, just to get down to business. Problem is, when the film is suppose to start up, nothing really happens! He sets up cameras in the house, just like in the two previous films. We've seen that before. A few scenes with wobbling lamps and doors closing. The youngest daughter is sleep walking and talks to someone invisible for the audience. But that's about it so far. Early in the movie, there's a scene where they view some of the footage, and witness dust falling from the ceiling. It looks like it falls on an invisible person, which makes them a bit confused. This is not followed up very well, at least not so far. I wish they could at least have watched some of the material. What's important with some of the films in the series, is the reaction and horror of the protagonists, the psychological events, the confusion ... There's nothing like that here. Just minute after minute with slow paced filming in room after room ... a lamp falling to the floor. I am so ready to give up on this ... So far just two scenes that stood out in this slow paced story ... or rather the lack of story. Okey, that was unexpected ... I think. More rooms ... Okey, so now things starts to happen. Took almost an hour. No, sorry ... it didn't. Now it's back to normal again. The girl running around the house, talking to "someone". One reaction from the father when watching the tapes, but not from his daughter running around the house by night ... Okey, so I don't fancy horror movies with guts and blood flying all over the place, and people getting chopped up in every scene. But I would almost prefer that before this. This is TOO slow. Okey, got to admit, there's a couple of scenes that made me jump. But with this weak story it's a bit unmotivated. And there's too few of them so far. F-FRIDGE! Think I just crapped my pants! I didn't see that coming. Okey, on the whole, two or three scenes that made me react during the entire movie. Weak story. Sleep-slow pace. Predictable ending. Too many loose ends. Slightly different story from the first two, and if it would have come as the first one, I might have liked it better. But it feels like make the third film right after two so-so films. I sat through it, and even though it at least was better than the second, it still feels like we've seen it before. If you want a good horror movie which is suppose to be a "mockumentary", watch "The last exorcism" instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This gets a 4, only because it's better than PA2. Not much of a feat, granted, but 4 isn't much of a score, either. Honestly, I'd rate higher, despite repetitive scare moments (as someone here said, could they not have just redone the kitchen scene effects?), because the arc moves nicely. THEN. They choose to simply explode credibility, along with the first 2 films. So, Katie's grandma is a practicing witch, and her daughter has NO CLUE, which would seem to be the case since Julie gets bumped off by her mom, and thinks her own girls will be safe there? Growing up, she never noticed mom's odd collection of pals, or woke up ONCE to see why mom was up all night? Most irritating of all, though, is that the grown-up sisters refer to minor freak-outs when they were kids, and fail to mention mom's boyfriend's back being snapped, mom hanging dead in the air, and grandma's satanic rituals. Yeah, there's a fast line earlier about girls used in this fashion being 'brainwashed to forget', but this is so, so clearly a cheap maneuver to excuse the ludicrous ending. And, if you accept that, then why do the adult girls remember disturbing things at all, and in some detail, as they do in the other films? Really, now. If only they had had the guts to transpose the action to grandma's and keep some linear storyline going. Maybe. Just maybe, this would've been OK.</fullReview>

I've seen all three now in the cinema, and while the first is fairly good, the second one is stupid and this one is just plain boring. People in the cinema were talking with each other and not paying attention. There are some good scares and creepy moments, but it's a bit much to wait 90 minutes for a powerful conclusion. That's just not what I think a good horror movie should be like. OK, it's quite funny and everything and they can deliver the goods. It's just why does it have to be so boring and stupid? It's like the setting is great but this movie concept just has too many flaws.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Paranormal Activity 3&#x2033; is the funniest movie you will see in theaters all year. From start to finish it is loaded with gut busting laughs that you will be eager to tell you friends about. The problem? It's not a comedy at all. In fact it is deadly seriously from beginning to end which only added to the fun. Once in a full moon horror audiences get to experience this sort of bad filmmaking. A film that plummets below mediocre into so-bad-it's-good territory. This is just that film."Paranormal Activity 3&#x2033; begins in 2005, Katie delivers a box of old videotapes to her pregnant sister, Kristi, and Kristi's husband, Daniel. A year later, Kristi and Daniel's house is seemingly burgled and the tapes are missing. Flashback to 1988, a young Katie and Kristi live with their mother, Julie, and her boyfriend, Dennis; Kristi begins interacting with an invisible friend named Toby. Dennis notices that since Kristi's friend appeared, strange things have been happening in the house. Dennis and Julie try to make a sex tape, but are interrupted by an earthquake. While they look for the girls, the camera shows dust fall from the ceiling and land onto an invisible figure in the room. The figure then moves and the dust falls to the floor. While reviewing the footage later, Dennis notices the strange incident. He invites his friend Randy over to view the footage, who suggests that Dennis place cameras throughout the house to capture any other incidents.That night in the girls' bedroom, Kristi wakes up and begins talking to someone off-camera before going back to bed. When Dennis questions her about this the following day, Kristi tells him that it is Toby. After more disturbed nights and strange occurrences, Dennis discovers a strange symbol in the girls' closet. He finds the same symbol on a picture of women in a book about demonology. Dennis explains to Julie that the symbol belonged to a witches' coven that brainwashed girls of child-bearing age into having sons and then forgetting about it, but Julie dismisses his claim. Because, of course, he HAS to be making this all up. Right?Hmmm where to start with the problems of this film:* Sometimes there is a time stamp on the camera, sometimes there isn't. * Who is editing the jump cuts when there is no "flash forward" in time? * Who was changing the tapes in the middle of the night? * Why is the camera looking over at the parents bed when it is staring straight at the mirror? * Why didn't the babysitter say what had happened to her to the parents? * Why didn't the Randy show them his cut after he was attacked by "Toby"? * Why was Toby never mentioned in the first two installments? * Why didn't Dennis show Julie the tapes before going into the stupid speech about the witches? * Was the final scene (witches in black robes?) really meant to be taken seriously? * Didn't the video quality appear to be awfully good (and in HD even!!) for something that had been 25 years old and sitting in storage? * Also did the witches edit the tapes together themselves?The list goes on and on and on. This is quite the movie experience that really must be seen to be believed. Go in with a few beers and zero thoughts in your head and maybe you'll have a good time. Who knows? Just don't spend money on it.</fullReview>

It's good for those who prefer suspense of what might be there and seeing something momentarily or objects moving.There was plenty of suspense. A slight change from the other ones with how they used one camera (rotating left and right like a fan does...well the camera was actually mounted on their home made contraption using the base of a fan!) which just added to the suspense of what would you see the next time the camera pans to the other side and then wondering what was going on when it rotated back!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this film, it is genuinely scary, which is entirely due to the clever way that tension is created. As with the others, the director did an amazing job building suspense and atmosphere, to the extent when seeing a chair flip over or a door close seem like the scariest thing ever. The ending scene is so tense that I (aswell as most of the audience it seems) could barely watch it.I don't see why people are whining about it being different from the trailer, I think that it is a good thing as the trailer doesn't do the film justice; it is much better when you don't actually see the ghost (as you do in the 'Bloody Mary' scene from the trailer) One bad thing however, was that a couple of the tricks from the previous films were used (for example, the whole 'standing completely still for hours on end') and weren't scary as we had seen them before.All in all, I give this film a solid 8, I haven't had this much fun in the cinema in a long time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First I'd like to advertise some innocent people that truly believe in reviews of films that are in the cinema. Many part of the reviewers are from the film's production and the several others are from other currently on screen film's production, so you should not believe in everything they say. Well, I saw all the films of this franchise on cinema, and the others were medium scary. This one, believe me, is extremely creepy and scary. A thousand times more than the previous two. In the first half hour of this movie there were plenty of false scares, which made me feel cheated and mad. I thought it was gonna continue like that all film long, like the filmmakers are saying "I just wanna scare you and take your money". But after three or four false scares, the scares became real and horrifyingly frightening. By the 50 minutes of the film I couldn't even look at the screen anymore; I was so agonized and scared that I was hoping for they all just die and the film end for good. The family's arrive in the grandmas' house was the fuse for me and for the rest of the audience; there are several horrifying scenes that I will probably remember before sleeping. Thumbs up for the kid actresses, they are really cute and believable, and I felt very sorry for them. Sadly, it sometimes looks too similar to "Blair Witch Project" and the sounds are too loud, but the film is very worth it. It probably won't be that good in home DVD...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never had any interest in Paranormal Activity until recent hype. I went back and viewed the first and second installment to the series so I would feel fully prepared going to the theater to view the third.Like the first two, number three does little to pave way for a fourth. With the exception of the great profits made from this film, the actual content is quite poor.Paranormal Activity uses the "you fear what you can't see" and "the longer the silence, the better chance we'll catch you off guard". Approximately 85% of this film you'll find yourself waiting, waiting, and waiting for something to occur. On various occasions you'll stare at the same shot for over a minute. The problem here is that the cuts are often so drawn out that you might possibly end up thinking of something other than the movie in front of you.Although I did find myself feeling a bit uncomfortable walking into my empty house in the dark afterward, the movie itself did little to scare me at the time. This maybe an excellent movie to watch before going to a haunted house or something of that magnitude, aside from that I certainly would not view it again. Please don't feed this series any more money if they do pump out a fourth, it's a disgrace to the genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's not difficult to spring back from the abortion that is Paranormal Activity 2. And for all the reasons PA2 did not work, PA3 did. There is really no need for a Paranormal Activity 4 but I can only hope that the POV approach is traded in for a true "present day" motion picture with future installment. I give PA3 7 stars because it cleverly expands on the original story. And like the original, it leaves more questions than answers. I can only deduce that with their childhood home having burned in a fire, their witching grandmother set her daughter and would-be son-in-law aflame. Not sure if I need to go any further back into the family's dark history nor do I need to see what happens to the girls after their grandmother takes them in. I'd like to know what is happening with them now - please... and I'll accept flashbacks - thank you.</fullReview>

If not, prepare to snooze. I kept waiting for something to happen. The technique of a story supposedly being video taped has been done to death. And many parts are just simply a regular film of people videotaping (unless all of the characters have video cameras implanted in their foreheads). I've see episodes of "Twilight Zone" and "Night Gallery" that were infinitely more scary. The scariest thing about this film is that it's apparently a hit. There's no exploration of paranormal activity. It's misleading and, worse, is just plain boring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, this movie has problems. It falls headlong into the trap that hobbles all horror series by demystifying the once-vague presence at its centre and adding layers of pointless explanation in order to milk the franchise until its udders are sore. It's also hard to believe that the tapes we see here survived, and a rushed explanation about wiped memories can't suppress the feeling that the young girls should have remembered a lot more than the events we heard about in the previous two films.But... despite that, the movie works. It really does. It's a fully functioning horror movie that throws a lot more at us than before but somehow makes that not a bad thing; there's some dead air in the first half, but nothing like the amount in 'Paranormal Activity 2', and as the knocks and creaks build into an all-out assault, it gets creepier and creepier, until by the finale I was literally biting my nails.It's surprisingly effective. Not as effective as the original film was the first time around, but it's a pretty decent effort.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a big horror fan. I'm also a big fan of the 'found-footage' style, and I have to admit that the first in the Paranormal Activity series was, well, brilliant for what it was. I liked the originality of it all. I liked the mystery surrounding this movie. I thought the found footage style was well executed. And amazingly enough, at some points this movie had some sort of minor scare value.So two sequels later how do I feel about the series? Bored. Full stop. The original one worked, but that fact that we are two sequels later, with a third coming out later this year, is just a bit annoying. The originality of the first PA has long since worn off. For those of you wondering about the plot for this film, its follows the story of Katie's childhood, and how the activity began. Sounds interesting but it really isn't. The fact that Oren Peli keeps on pulling out the same tricks (Doors closing by themselves and the like) makes this film predictable and tiresome. Even the found footage element is a failure. The budget for this film fells way to high and the quality of the video is just too dam high for it to be believable.Will I come back to see PA 4? Probably not.If you really have to see this flick, by all means go and see it. If you're a big time horror fan, don't bother. You'll be bored within the first 5 minutes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well... this is my very first review and I had to write something about this one here! After reading some others' reviews I must admit I'm very surprise people liked this TRASH...I went to the movies last Saturday just to see PA3 and I was very excited before the movie started cause I loved the first ones.This one sucks and makes no sense... I can say I survived 1h30min cause the movie is really, really bad in all senses.Witchcraft??? The demon comes from witchcraft??????? How could the writers come up with such a ridiculous idea?I'm totally disappointed and hope the Paranormal Activity era ends after this one.It's so ridiculous that the mother of the girls was so young and 1988... One of the girls in the 3rd was like 5 years old in 1988 as they showed. How could she be so grown up in 2005???Just boring, unoriginal and makes no sense at all! I used to be a fan!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why did they even bother making a prequel which is actually not a prequel , rather than explaining the happenings of the previous two movies this one just makes its own happening which was completely unnecessary , nothing new here , nothing new for those who have seen some scary movies in their lifetime , for someone extremely fresh to scary movies (not possible) then there might be something for them but even that will leave them thinking why are all the characters in the movie stupid , why isn't the Man of the house really being the Man of the house and doing something to stop what is happening , the story was forced to move on and scenes were intentionally created just to create a scare which doesn't really creates a scare as such , the beauty of the first movie was that it took you by surprise , second one was waste of time and this third one is not just a waste of time but a total waste itself , looking at how much revenue this movie is generating just tells me how retarted people are to make such a movie successful even by word of mouth , save yourself from being stupid enough to watch this in the theatres</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They sacrifice storytelling for mediocre scares...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since 2009, the 'Paranormal Activity' series has eclipsed the 'Saw' franchise in topping both the domestic and worldwide box office gross during the weeks leading up to and proceeding the Halloween weekend. A combined worldwide gross of just over $370 million dollars from the two previous outings made a third film inevitable, and despite the on-screen decade changing to encompass a prequel, the basic voyeuristic concept stays exactly the same. In their first fictional feature-length debut, 'Catfish' directors Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman take over the reins of the popular franchise and while they infuse their own directorial sensibilities upon the project, it ultimately fails to both engage and frighten the audience to any satisfying, bowel-movement inducing degree.The year is 1988 and Katie (Chloe Csengery) and Kristi (Jessica Tyler Brown) are two seemingly normal sisters who are looked after by their mother Julie (Lauren Bittner) and their step-father Dennis (Christopher Nicholas Smith). After numerous things go bump in the night, Dennis decides to set video cameras up at various locations throughout their home including their own marital bedroom, the young girl's room and the downstairs living area. As the day and nights go by, videographer Dennis along with help from his technologically savvy friend Randy (Dustin Ingram), begin to notice that all is not what it seems within the household and that a malevolent being may be specifically targeting members of his family. What takes place next comprises of loud noises, unexplained moving objects and another edition to the paranormal franchise in which the audience slowly experiences a family's descent into madness as they try to both understand and overcome their experiences at hand.The third film in the 'Paranormal Activity' series isn't a terrible film by any standards, but it does fail exponentially in two key areas. First of all, the third film of the scare-inducing trilogy offers up absolutely nothing that is new or innovative in any way, shape or form. The closest Joost and Schulman come in attempting to conjure up a bit of ingenuity is in the use of a mounted camcorder on top of a rotating axis, yet this device is severely underused and instead they opt more for the use of on and off-screen diegetic sound effects. While the narrative itself starts to become interesting as it slowly opens a revealing door of uncertainty to the viewer, potentially exposing what may be behind over two decades of terror in the lives of these two young women. But it instead opts to cut ties during the final act leaving many questions unanswered leading to underwhelming end to the potentially exciting exploration of the mythology behind over two decades of paranormal activity.Secondly, if audience members have seen the first two films then they will well versed in how the series approach scaring the paying members of a theatre senseless. The scene shifts from hand-held filming to a stationary shot during the night as the members of the family sleep, before an extended period, usually between thirty seconds and a minute, of absolutely nothing happening is utilized to emphasize the vulnerability of the characters, and then the 'scare' happens. Whether it is a banging door or screeching off-screen diegetic sounds, or some form of unexplained paranormal phenomenon such as levitation, after the first two films this predictability becomes ingrained within the viewer and it is easy to simply evade the scare because you can adequately predict when it is going to come. Aside from two sequences in which Joost and Schulman change the record so-to-speak and provide two very well crafted scenes, the majority of 'Paranormal Activity 3' reuses the exact same format as the previous two films and therefore becomes stale, and most often than not, predictable.Joost and Schulman have essentially created a re-hash of the first two films, except with young children replacing the older, more mature leading characters of the previous instalments. Both young girls give exceptional performances considering the majority of the film hinges upon their interaction with the world around them, and the film itself is competently composed, even if the two decade old tapes do look like they have been meticulously preserved in a state of perpetual perfection. But, it is first and foremost a film within the prosperous horror genre, and 'Paranormal Activity 3' fails on a fundamental level to provide any substance, any originality, or any scares that manage to eclipse the terror of previous two films and add a new level of horror to the already spine-chilling series.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is no second thought in telling that Paranormal Activity 3 is the best Horror Movie in 2011.Frame by Frame,the Directors have concentrated in delivering a best scary experience to the audience.Paramount Pictures should really be appreciated for delivering such a horror movie in 85 Minutes.If PA 1 was first of its kind with single camera in the Bedroom,PA 2 was well crafted with different CCTV Cameras all over the house, capturing the activities.PA 3 has gone a step ahead,as they have applied excellent ideas in introducing new thrills for a regular story. On the downside few scenes are heavily inspired from the movie Insidious,which is visible abruptly.However the screenplay is awesome, which makes you forget everything.People who have already seen the trailer,and waiting to watch the movie,there is something shocking-surprising for you.You will realize that once you finish watching the movie. Down Line: Don't Miss this movie if you are Horror Movie Fan. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Are You Scared? Well You Should Be, Because This Sure as Hell Isn't Scare Tactics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Are you interested in getting a good scare this Halloween season but don't want to pay the money or wait in line for the giant haunted houses in your city? Well then look no further than your local movie theater and go see Paranormal Activity 3. Paranormal Activity 3 is by far the scariest movie I have ever witnessed and probably the most terrifying experience of my life. The film prides itself on the scares it gives its audience and will make you regret not bringing deodorant with you to the theater, because due to the films extreme intensity, you will be really sweating out of nervousness. The poltergeist itself is pretty much a combination of Frankenstein's gentle relationship with that little girl right before he kills her(referring to the story of Frankenstein, not PA3) and the evilness of Michael Myers. This ghost is the definition of evil and has a very bone chilling relationship with one of the girls. The movie has some of the best cinematography I have ever seen in a mockumentary. The camera positions unfortunately have the best shot to capture the hair raising paranormal activity you will see on screen and yet still leaves the viewer's imagination to run away with itself when hearing the creepy off-screen sounds and actions of the ghost and terrified family. For those of you who loved the first two movies are in for a treat with this one as it outdoes the others in every way. And for those of you who find the Paranormal Activity series to be overrated or nothing special, then I encourage you to take a chance on this one, you won't be disappointed. So if you want to be scared out of your wits or want the best horror movie that will make your date jump out of her seat and start holding on to you for dear life then go see Paranormal Activity 3 because I can positively say that without a doubt that THIS is the new generation's Exorcist. WARNING, if your house is haunted or you at least think it is haunted I strongly suggest you don't see this movie because you won't be sleeping well for quite a while.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best One so Far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before start typing my opinion, i have to say that i don't really understand why there are so many "haters" of this 3rd movie. It really surprises me. Anyway... this 3rd movie , in my opinion of course, was the scariest and creepiest of all. The director found new ways to scare you, scenes you haven't seen in the other 2. And of course this is what exactly you are waiting to see...something new. So the good news are that the new ideas ( the ideas to scare the viewers ) were great. Many questions , many doubts , many gaps you had in paranormal activity 1 and 2 are now solved and answered. But this doesn't mean that you will understand completely the whole thing. New questions came up with this last movie. To sum up , this is for me , the scariest of all 3 ( but after watching paranormal 1 and 2 you know what you are going to see , so maybe you wont get scared at the maximum level. This is a truth that you must have in the back of your head ). I was more scared with paranormal activity 1 , because that movie was something new. Something that i hadnt seen in my previous horror movie-life. Something i wasn't expecting. I low budget film with so much horror inside. Then paranormal activity 2 came up and i was expecting to see something familiar with the first one. I was scared again but not as much as the first one. And finally paranormal 3 came with the scariest scenes of all 3 but i was prepared.Don't watch it in theaters because people are talking like always.. See it on Blu Ray or DVD , with the lights off and the sound in the maximum volume. And then ... enjoy a nice evening.I rate it 8/10 for a horror movie and 10/10 for a paranormal activity movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Paranormal Activity Thus Far (Contains Minor Spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't a big fan of the first two Paranormal Activity films. I liked them, but I really disliked how it felt like they poked butt throughout the movies and a lot of the scares were cheap. Thanks to my sister, I got a free screening on Tuesday. I went in with an open mind; it was like going to a birthday party for a kid you didn't like too much -- as long as there was cake, you would be fine. And, boy was there cake!!First off, half of the scenes in the trailers weren't in the film at all (although I hear that there are multiple endings for this one as well). That being said, the trailer is very misleading, but in the best way possible. It tells the story of why the two sisters are being "haunted" in the first two films. The movie is like walking through a haunted house set up for Halloween -- one of the professional ones that takes months in planning.Scares in this movie were throughout the entire film -- although a lot of them were jump scares (a character jumps out just to scare another character). When the scares dealt with the demon, who in this film is named "Toby", they were pretty creepy and effective. I'm not one who gets scared easily, but this movie made me jump. And the last fifteen minutes of the film were the best fifteen minutes in the entire movie.To sum it all up, Paranormal Activity 3 is the best out of the series thus far. The scares were well planned and it got to you on many levels. Some of the scares seemed very cheap and you may feel lost at times. It is advised to watch the other two movies prior to this, or else you may not understand anything at all. This is also a movie you should see with a crowd; you'll thank me later.</fullReview>

DO NOT LET ANYONE UNDER 12 SEE THIS MOVIE.The story was okay, but as it has been noted numerous times, most the parts in the trailer aren't even in the movie. Instead of taking its time to attack them in this movie, the demon gets straight into it and starts wrecking havoc, then after a few clues, you find out that the demon is half-controlled by the grandmother and an entity called Toby that gives a literally bone-crunching surprise to Dennis(the stepdad)in the last 10 minutes, that will leave your mind running even after the film is finished.</fullReview>

What really sucked was that the parts shown in the trailer were not shown in the film I wish it had the part were the mom threw the glass of water to the ghost.

		<fullReview>This film was fantastic. People can moan and complain that it didn't explain enough to them, or it wasn't scary enough for them... but really? Not scary enough for you? Not enough tied up ends to the, so far, 'trilogy'? I guess, in a view of a jaded movie goer, I can sort of see where you're coming from, but it is hard to believe that you watched the same film I did last night. This movie was so good, I don't believe that I blinked once. I love being tense, I love watching and waiting for something I can't even see. For everyone who has said that this movie wasn't good... just put yourself in this alternate perspective for a moment, if you will. Take away the fact that the movie wasn't filmed on a real 80's style camcorder. Take away the fact that none of the material from the trailer was in the film cut. Which by the way,is AWESOME. I hate trailers nowadays for the most part. Why do we go to these movies in the first place? Oh yeah, to escape reality and have fun. Right? Well, by some of the reviews I have read thus far, I would have to say that most of you have lost your ability to just watch a film in that way. You didn't allow yourself to enjoy what you watched, and you forgot that you were there to watch a movie and let the directors take you on a journey, that probably, you couldn't dream up or organize to make better... and if you COULD... then DO IT AND SHUT UP ALREADY! I swear, all the negativity and harsh criticisms are completely unjustified and absurd. The fact that this franchise has gotten to three films and kept the stories connected and involved, is amazing. When, to begin with, it was just one film, and wasn't planned for a sequel. They defied all odds, and killed most everything out at the time in the Box Office. SO! I commend the crew for yet another amazing installment in this series, and I cannot wait for anything else released with them. REMEMBER PEOPLE... quit complaining and just have fun. It's a movie. It's meant to be entertainment, not a judging for what's believable and what's not. If you say it could be better, then I await your movie that tops this. Really. Bring it. I'm sure the Paranormal Activity crew would love to see it too! Stay scared. ~JON</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Paranormal Activity 3: The Most Terrifying Film In The Series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Love 'em or hate 'em, the "Paranormal Activity" films are genuine horror movies, with real scares, sympathetic characters, and tremendous dread. With an ingenious marketing campaign and a low budget, Part 1 creeped us out. Then Part 2 offered the same scares, but elevated them, making it as good as the original, if not better. So, how does "Paranormal Activity 3" do? The third film has taken us back in time from 2009 all the way back to 1988. Here, we get a chance to see the childhood of the ill-fated Katie and Kristy. Before things go wrong, we are introduced to the kids' parents: sweet and funny mother Julie and her new husband, Dennis, a man with a penchant for filming weddings. When an earthquake occurs and something is caught on tape, thanks to Dennis's camera, it is a must that Dennis installs cameras throughout the house to see what they can find. The recordings you see will shock you! After "Paranormal Activity 2," I was only slightly worried about what would happen if Paramount released a third movie. Would the found footage concept get old? Would it be just a simple money-making scheme? Well, fortunately, the answer is no. The "PA" series works so well, unlike the "Saw" movies, for several reasons. They are smart, they are brilliantly scary, they build fantastic tension, and they don't over-explain things. Explanations in these movies are only very brief and not talked about too much. So things make sense, but a lot is left to the imagination. "Paranormal Activity 3" keeps the story going, and doesn't throw pointless characters onto the chopping block. The filmmakers are only interested in scaring the hell out of the audience, and they've done it again."PA3" is the first horror film I've seen in a theater where I screamed like a little girl, and I don't scare easily nowadays. The first film had an impact on me, and I definitely jumped several times with part 2, but "PA3" had double the scares, double the tension, and insane "BOO!" moments(thank God there were no pets in this movie. Every "boo scare" always involves the cat.). This film is sincerely the scariest of the series.The plot line of the film is fresh and interesting. The fact from the first two movies that these supernatural occurrences have been following Katie and Kristy since they were little, and that this was not uncommon to them really makes you feel their horror, psychologically and emotionally.Suspense in the "Paranormal Activity" movies has never been this high until now. Dennis's cameras around the house, especially the oscillating fan camera that roams back and forth between the kitchen and the front doors of the house, toy with your mind and challenge you to a creepy game of "Where's Waldo?." We are constantly looking around the house, waiting to catch something out of the corner of our eye in the bedroom or near the front door. When the series adds more cameras to the experience, the tension never drops.The cast of "PA3" have been chosen well. Christopher Nicholas Smith and Lauren Bittner have a great, natural chemistry as Dennis and Julie. They also add some good humor to their characters. They are enjoyable to watch, and we care about them. The performances of young Katie and Kristy(Chloe Csengery and Jessica Tyler Brown) are quite good, especially Ms. Brown as Kristy. Whenever a child in a horror film is in danger, you are immediately frightened for them, and Csengery and Brown do a competent job of portraying their fear.After three movies, I think it's obvious that "Paranormal Activity" isn't just an average trilogy. Unlike the "Friday the 13th" sequels or the "Nightmare on Elm Street" franchise, which always bring back Jason or Freddy in ridiculous ways to kill a bunch of nubile teens, this series keeps a story going while adding something new each time. I'm not sure if a fourth film will happen or even help the franchise. The movies are already so damn good, and another follow-up with more found footage could make the concept old very quickly. But I will end on a positive note. You're not likely to find any other major Halloween thrills this season outside of this film. "Paranormal Activity 3" is the best film in the series yet, with heart-stopping scares, a wonderful cast, the right directors(Ariel Schulman and Henry Joost directed the critically acclaimed mockumentary thriller "Catfish"), and an ending that will raise several questions, but leave you in state of pure horror. That's right, guys. More sleepless nights await you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a world where I feel bombarded by remakes of old movies, unoriginal ideas and shotty writing, I am genuinely impressed by Paranormal Activity 3. I'm one of those people who will laugh at attempts of jump-scares or fright and the reactions by actors/actresses, before I'm genuinely scared. And usually child actors (in my opinion) are just annoying, pigeon-holed as bumbling idiots without a conscious or brain, or over worked -which turns them into over-actors. I am relieved to say Paranormal Activity 3 doesn't fit the bill! Movies exist to entertain. That's the bottom line for me. In the theater, I started a skeptic as I recalled my lackluster experience with P.A.(1) and to my delight, I left curious. My brain was buzzing with questions about the STORY rather than questions about what the hype was about. There were parts that made me laugh like a baby, and parts that forced my hand over my eyes in utter suspense. All the while I was waiting for a part where the kids would slip up in their acting -which didn't happen.Point being, I shouldn't expect to be disappointed by a movie. But unfortunately as of late, that's what Hollywood has done to me. However I feel like P.A.3 is one of those movies that revived some faith in me that writing isn't dead. And although I pride myself on being able to figure out and predict the endings to movies, this one -even when I thought I had it figured out, did not disappoint in surprising me. I highly encourage the movie goers who believe that the audience is part of the viewing experience to give this one a shot. Even if you have not seen the other P.A. movies, this one will make sense even out of context (a good characteristic of any series movie), and possibly urge you to check them out. A great Halloween release movie. Good fun, good job!</fullReview>

What I respect so much about these movies, is the fact that they do not rely on the "gore factor" or use of special effects. This is a good ol' fashion scare movie....and it is probably the scariest thing anyone could imagine. If you want to enjoy this movie this is what you need to do. 1) Go see the movie really late. 2)Take it seriously and shush the obnoxious people making fun of it. 3) Use your imagination...pretend it's real.If you follow those rules you will have the time of your life.

And, unless I am misunderstanding the credits, they have the girls casted as young and older girls. Well, I don't recall any scenes with the older girls. Unless that's one of the times I was dozing.

		<fullReview>First of all, let me tell you not to be fooled by those on here who say this movie isn't "believable." It is so ironic that they instead prefer movies such as the classic "Halloween," where the killer literally can never be killed, even after being shot four times and falling off of a balcony. Keep in mind that these movies are not actual documentaries, and are meant to SCARE us.Now, for those of you who say they don't believe in devils, ghosts, aliens, etc., that's fine. But you can't tell me that you have never once been frightened by a sound in the middle of the night, or a ghost story told around the camp fire. Whether you want to admit it or not, the very fact of not knowing whether these things exist is enough to give anyone nightmares.Now to the movie....Not only did they do a great job of creating the 1988 look with the house, cameras, clothes, etc., but they continued to surprise me for the third time. I felt like PA1 was filled with tension and few jumpy parts, but worked really well because of all the build up. I went into the theater for PA2 expecting the same build up with a great climax as PA1, but was surprised and pleased to find far more unsuspecting and "jumpy" parts. I was so caught off guard, especially with the kitchen scene, and found my self digging my claws into my husband's arm. Now, PA3 was more like the 1st one in that there were less jumpy parts, but far more disturbing behavior, especially from the little girl Kristy. Her imaginary friend Toby is never seen, yet you always feel his presence. The ending was so shocking and unexpected, yet tied in perfectly with the first two movies.I highly recommend all three of these films, because just watching one doesn't do it justice. Each film goes further into depth and uncovering the mystery, and if you give them a fair chance rather than dissecting every little thing, you will find one heck of a horror movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A worthy addition, with some of the best scenes yet!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After last week's massive let down with the Thing prequel being released, I was hoping dearly that another favorite of mine - The PA franchise - was not going to be destroyed just as quickly.Thankfully, it wasn't.I don't want to give too much away, as part of the experience was not knowing. The previews to the film don't really give anything away either, as most of the scenes in the previews are actually NOT in the film itself - Although are just as relevant to the overall story.PA3 draws a fair bit more from films that have done it in the past, in particular, Poltergeist and The Blair Witch project.As much as I loved the film, I wasn't too enthralled with the direction the film went in the third act went, and ultimately the climax of the film, as I think this kind of concept has been done to death - particularly IN the 80s, when this film was supposed to have been set.Some reviewers have immediately dismissed PA3 as lacking authenticity, in that the film is shot widescreen and in HD - two formats which weren't being used in the 80's. My take on this is I would find far more to complain about if the film was shot in 4:3 and featured stereo sound with optional Dolby NR. No thanks. Authenticity is one thing, but not at the expense of atmosphere.As far as the scares go - The PA crew have once again got it right, aiming directly for the psychological shock that makes our skin crawl - and not just throwing a bunch of horrific images on the screen, which is where so many other films get it wrong. There are also some very creative 'wow' moments in the film, one involving something as generic as a white sheet.Now for the things I was a little disappointed in...*** MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD ***1) Firstly, I would have loved to have found out more about the background of the demon. Its suggested in the second film that a deal could have been made for money or power. If so, its likely that the Grandmother was responsible - and this was obviously for money (both Katie and Kristy had very nice homes even though they had menial jobs and their boyfriends either stayed at home as day-traders or worked at Burger King)2) Why did it have a connection with Kristy and not so much Katie?3) How did the fire in the house start?4) The drawing inside the upstairs storage space - A letter 'M', plus in PA2 we see what appears to read "MEUS" (latin for 'mine') scratched into the basement door. If we are to believe the demon is after the first born male of the family, which didn't exist in 1988, what could the demon/Kristy have been trying to write on the cupboard wall?5) Who/what IS the demon?Overall, I believe fans will like this film and its a very worthy installment to the franchise. The question is, are they going to expand the series yet again, or deal with the obvious omissions as extended features when the movie hits disc?</fullReview>

You are so bored and just want it to end.I really can not see how anyone would think this was entertaining in anyway.There are so many horror movies that have lower ratings than this turd.That I would recommend over this film any day of the week.If you thought part 2 was boring?This one is even worse.So boring .No explanation of why anything is happening.And the ending was enough to make even a soft spoken person scream at the top of their lungs.Watch if you want?But do not expect much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just got back from an advance screening of Paranormal Activity 3. I am still 'recovering' from seeing it. All of the hype about the 'last 15 minutes' is completely true. If you can remember the last 5 minutes of the first film - imagine that tension spread out over 15-20 minutes and you'll be close to imagining how scary it is.One reviewer gauged this film by saying that the first two films slowly built up tension with the majority over the first two films staying around the 3/10 mark for tension for 80% of the film before ramping it up to 8 or 9/10 for the rest of the film. This however stays at a 3/10 for the first 30 minutes with the rest of the movie firmly at a 9 and even 10/10 for tension.There are some excellent, clever techniques used to build the scares - most notably the use of the rotating fan stand with the camera planted on the top. There are some genuinely frightening moments as you wait for the camera to slowly move back to its original frame.Again, back to the famous 'last 15 minutes'. I won't spoil things but I will say that the story/mythology takes a very different step during this part of the film. Everyone in my theatre was screaming very loudly throughout this part and it will stay with you for a LONG time after the film ends. There is no break in the tension during this scene.Fans of the first two films will love this.Only down points I would say are there are a couple of plot holes in terms of continuity and there are LOTS of things that are shown in the trailer that are not shown in the film. Hopefully a director's cut will include these.8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just got back from a screening of Paranormal Activity 3 and I am stunned. I expected this film to be good as I am a HUGE fan of the first two and I have been following all the viral marketing for this film but I never thought it would be as good as it was, if anyone has gave this film a bad review they need to check that they saw the right film, I can't see why ANYONE would not like this film (unless they don't like horror films, that would probably be understandable). First of all don't expect to see most of the scenes that are in the trailer, but even though those scenes are not in the film, it doesn't make it any less scarier.The film starts in 2005 when Katie asks Daniel and a pregnant Kristi if she can store some boxes in their basement. They go through the tapes, which, although there are loads of them, the ones that stood out the most were the ones that said September 1988 (which is the rest of the footage of the film), Katie 1992 and Katie 1993. One year later Kristi's house is trashed and Daniel and Ali realize the tapes are missing. We are then taken back to 1988 when Katie is celebrating her birthday party and we are introduced to the main characters, Katie and Kristi, the girls from the first two movies, Julie, their mother, Dennis, their stepfather and Lois, their grandmother. Shortly after this scene the activity begins.The actors in this film are outstanding, Julie strangely looks like a long haired version of Kristi and she even acted like the older version of the girls in PA 1 &amp; 2, although the only difference is she is a skeptic and doesn't believe anything is going on in the house until she has a shock (bit of an understatement) in the kitchen, the stepfather who looks strangely like Micah is a great new character and actually likable too! Randy is a great new character who, like Dennis, believes there is something going on in Dennis and Julie's house, the grandmother is EXTREMELY creepy, even in the scenes where she isn't meant to be! She has a really eerie look about her and finally the younger versions of Katie and Kristi are amazing, they would actually make you believe that it was them when they were younger, the casting directer of this film has done a great job.The scares in this film are seriously out of this world, even the fake scares (such as the Mother jumping out of the closet with a mask on and the babysitter jumping in front of the camera). This film is way scarier than the first two movies and to be honest it's one of the scariest films I have seen in years. The thing that makes it so scary is that no matter where the characters are in the house, whether it's night or day and even if they're out of the house, Tobi, the ghost, will find them and if you say anything nasty to Tobi or if you offend Tobi in anyway, then you're in big trouble. Two of the most effective scares (not counting the ending, I'll get to that in a minute) is a scene where the babysitter is stalked by a sheet wearing Tobi and the (should I say alternative) Bloody Mary scene.Now, the ending, I saw a TV spot saying "The Last 15 Minutes Will Mess You Up For Life", the guy who said that couldn't have been any more right. For the last 15 minutes of the film I found myself sweating like it was a hot summer's day, shouting at the screen, jumping out of my seat, screaming, fiddling around with my fingers and looking away from the screen...no film has EVER made me do that, this is one of the most messed up and suspenseful endings in found footage horror history. The twist is unreal and I don't even wanna spoil it because you HAVE to see it to believe it.Overall, it's an amazing film that answers a lot of questions and opens a lot of questions10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I did see the original Paranormal Activity and it I did enjoy the movie for the most part. I skipped the second movie in the series and now I am on to Paranormal Activity 3. Just like the original movie, I was prepared for the movie to drag on as the story builds. It is an expected style for this type of movie so to be fair I am not holding that against it in my review. I did however, dislike some of the building scenes that really didn't fit the storyline of the movie. I felt almost lost at times since there was really no clear roadmap to the plot until the end of the movie. As for the acting, it was on par with a bigger budget movie. The child acting was believable and did not take away for the flow of the movie. One other thing that was a bit annoying was the preview for the movie showed a scene that was not even in the theatrical version. The preview was very creepy and scary on it's own and it does not even occur in the movie. I was very frustrated with that and feel like it was a true bait and switch.If you are a fan of the series, you may like the movie overall. I however was very disappointed with the movie and would not recommend this movie to any of my friends.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll just say it now: SPOILER ALERT! SPOILER ALERT! SPOILER ALERT!Obviously those writing reviews on here are completely ignorant to some key aspects of demon and occult lore. There wasn't an issue with the occult aspect of the witches being brought into it, that's how possessions and things like this are supposed to happen. This isn't a human haunting, it's demonic work. So when people make comments like "The Paranormal movies were made on the premise of being about a haunting of demons; adding in the 'cult' aspect just changes things. We were drawn in on the fear of the supernatural, not satanic women.", it just shows that either a) they weren't paying attention in the other movies or b) they have no basic understanding of how demons are supposed to work. To answer some frequently asked questions of haters:1. Where does it show you anything to do with the house burning down? It doesn't. At least not yet. Speculation is that the footage was placed in the preview, but was eventually cut from the final edit. There is a PA4 coming out, keep in mind.2. Why weren't any of the clips in the trailers in the actual feature? See Question 1.3. It never explains what the entity actually is? Are you all such morons that it has to be specifically spelled out? Does Kristi need to stand in front of the camera and be all "Toby is a demon and he's oppressing us because of something really idiotic that our great grandma did back in the 30's."4. How did the mother actually die in the film? And where does it show that she is actually dead at the top of the staircase?5. Why does the ghost haunt the children although it is meant to haunt the first born son? It's not meant to haunt the 1st born son. It haunts the rest of the family because it WANTS the 1st born son. The great grandma (Lois's mother) made a deal with the devil and in payment the devil wanted a son, but she never had one, so it passed to the next woman and so on... Until Kristi has her baby boy in PA2. 6. Where did a cult ever play a part in any of the other films? There's a difference between a cult and the Occult. The term "cult" can be applied to any fanatic group. The Occult specifically is used in reference to "knowledge of the paranormal" and includes the realms of witchcraft and demonology. So really, it isn't a cult. And it is referenced in the second film. Kristi's step daughter thoroughly investigates the possibilities of the haunting and concludes that Kristi and Katie's great grandmother was part of the group of witches that Dennis reads about in the 3rd movie.If you didn't like the first one, then you probably didn't like the 2nd, and most likely wont like the 3rd. But if you like this kind of scary movie, then you will love it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As others have noted, the most compelling scenes somehow made it into the trailer but were cut from the theatrical release. The fact that they had this footage but chose not to use it really makes me question the intelligence and judgment of whoever edited this movie. And, as others have noted (spoiler...), what was a demon in the first two movies, attracted inexplicably to our female protagonist, becomes a pawn of some female wiccan cult - or something. It's hard to say. But the fact that a witches are somehow controlling the demon really takes the scare factor out of the whole concept. So, in summary, if you like the trailer, don't expect to see any of that in the movie. And if you think that witches are scary (which I don't...), you'll love this installment in what was, up until now, a terrific series.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>PARANORMAL ACTIVITY 3 - 5 out of 10 Enough is enough. Hollywood just does not know when to stop do they? The first paranormal activity was a brilliant horror film made on a shoestring budget . The second was good too but not a patch on it's predecessor . Before you know it a third is out but with no thought given to a proper script or a credible storyline. now the series is tainted because of no 3 and guess what ? Paranormal Activity 4 is on production. Enough already !!This is the convoluted prequel that involves two sisters , one of who attracts a supernatural being called Toby. We see the same format as the original . The man of the house decides to tape everything that is happening with a Video recorder ( it's set in the late 80's) and we see in real time what is going on with Toby and the younger daughter. Noises , doors moving and people being chucked all over the place. It takes 40 minutes for anything to happen and when it does it's just dull.The final 15 minutes turn into a farce with a plot twist that is so annoying you want to put your foot through the screen but sadly this film isn't worth the energy. They have done to the Paranormal Activity franchise what they did to the Saw series.... Murdered it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was nothing short of impressive. Paranormal Activity 3 explains the origin of the entity that haunts a pair of sisters from their early childhood. It was alluded in the first two films, but part three was the payoff. Naturally it sticks to the formula from the first two features being of the found footage genre, but it still works. The horror is created more by what isn't and barely seen. Jessica Tyler Brown sold communicating with the ghost perfectly. The scene with Chloe Csengery and Dustin Ingram in the bathroom was well done. The ending was unexpected and frightening. I understand that there were plot holes concerning the burning house and the coven, but this trilogy starts in 1988 and concludes in 2006. Are we supposed to see every detail in an 18 year span? The point of these films is just to scare you, which it does effectively. I don't think that there are many movies where every single detail falls into a neat logical package, hence the term fiction. This movie gives the audience a little of everything: some nostalgia, some urban legend, and a lot of chills. The third time was the charm in this series.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This a prequel to the first two films. It takes place in 1988 and shows two young girls and their family who are being attacked by a ghost.Like the first two this is all footage taken from cameras set up around the house. It also has unknowns playing all the roles. The first one was OK but didn't exactly thrill me. The second one scared me silly. This falls somewhere in between. Is it scary? Yes--but it's not hard to scare someone with sudden noises and things jumping out at you (which happens in this film). Still this film does have some very scary bits. The "Bloody Mary" sequence is unnerving and a bit where a babysitter is approached from behind by the ghost sent a chill up my spine. So it does work but hopefully this is the end of the series. Really--how much farther can they take this?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went and saw this movie yesterday and while I really did like the movie itself I left the theater with more questions than answers. First let me say that I'm one of the people that really liked the second Paranormal Activity pretty much more than I liked the first one. When I found out they were making a third one I knew I had to go and see it.Now let's get to the movie. Like the heading says I liked this movie but didn't love it and that all has to do with how the movie ended. I don't want to ruin the movie for anyone and if you haven't seen it yet and are planning to stop reading now. In the second PA it is brought up that the hauntings are probably due to a family member making a deal with the devil for fame or money but as you find out towards the end of this movie it has all been brought on because the grandmother of Katie and Kristie is in some sort of devilish cult or some kind of witches covenant. Also at the end of the movie, after the mother and boyfriend are dead, the grandmother walks upstairs with the girls and says "It's time to get ready" and that is where the film abruptly ends. Like I said I left the theater scratching my head and asking questions that were left unanswered. It seems like they are setting up for a fourth movie, which the first two didn't really due, and if in fact they do go ahead with a fourth installment where does the footage come from? The mom and boyfriend are dead, it is 1988 and no one is left to record what goes on next. I felt like I walked out of the movie and somewhere the producers were just laughing going we got you to come see the third movie but if you want to know what really happens you'll have to come back and see the next one we make. Also throughout the film it was Kristie seeing the spirit with Katie pretty much being the skeptic, until the Bloody Marry scene, and then at the end of the movie Katie was the one that looked like she had been possessed. I have many questions. Where does the house burning down come in to play? I guess with my own imagination I can come up with that answer. Another big question is how do the young Katie and Kristie get back to normal, because they seem fairly normal in the first two movies, after everything that has gone down.The last thing I was hoping to see in this movie, or whatever movie they are going to finally close this series out on, was what happens to Katie and the young baby Hunter she took at the end of the second PA. Does she sacrifice the baby, like is how this thing gets broken anyway as stated in the second movie, and if and when she does that does everything go back to normal, except for the fact that she killed her boyfriend, her sister, and her sisters husband. I guess I was just hoping to go see this and get the answers to all of my questions but at the end I just left with more questions than answers. If that had happened I would've given this movie a 10 but the ending just felt like a tease. If they make a fourth Paranormal Activity I will most likely go see it, I mean you're talking to a guy that saw every single Saw movie, so I will follow this through until the end I just hope the end comes soon and answers all the questions I have instead of sticking me with even more questions to ask.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paranormal Activity 3 is one of those movies you either like or hate. I liked it and thought it was better than part 2. Part 3 is another prequel taking place in 1988 with kid sisters Katie and Kristi. Their father, a wedding video photographer, sets up cameras around the house to try and capture the mysterious presence on film that is haunting them. Soon he gets proof of something sinister on film that doesn't plan on leaving the family anytime soon. I liked the camera set up with an old fan that turns back and forth to show what is going on in both the kitchen and living room. You sit and watch on the edge of your seat to see what the camera is going to capture. One scene in particular in the kitchen (like in part 2) is guaranteed to make you jump from your seat. And that is just one of the few good jump scenes you will experience this time around. The acting is good as usual. The girls play their parts very well. And I thought the mother was pretty hot! The ending gave me goosebumps. It explains where the demon came from and why it is haunting the family. Right now it is the number 1 movie so I'm sure there will be a part 4. But it really isn't necessary. It would be good to just leave it alone after this one. But I'm sure Hollywood will think differently.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was highly disappointed with Paranormal Activity 3 for a number of reasons. The film has it's usual suspense buildup that a lot of people will love. It ultimately falls flat with the ending though, just like the previous two movies. The fact that they did not show the demon at the end of this one is just plain stupid. It's a shame because if they did show some sort of frightening creature at the end I think this movie would have a lasting impression on people. I felt cheated after the movie ended because it was not even 90 minutes long. Immature people were constantly talking during the movie which at times killed the horror aspect of it. During the scene where the ghost was under the sheet a couple of people actually said "ooooooo" and the whole theater started to laugh and make stupid remarks. I actually turned around in my seat and told all of them to shut up. I'd advise people that if you want to go see this movie wait till it comes out on DVD because you are unquestionably going to have a couple of dumb people who ruin the horror/suspense aspect of the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before I get started, let me just say that I am a huge horror/thriller fan, and I have liked the previous Paranormal Activities. However, PA3 is completely absurd.. such a waste of my time, and I don't know why it has been given so many good reviews. In my opinion the rating should be a lot lower than it is.Watching the trailer, I was very excited - it looked fantastic. However, it was very false advertisement.. hardly any of the creepy/scary scenes were included in the film. I don't even know what the point of the trailer exactly is, when it isn't even clips from the film?! The movie included much of the same stuff.. creepy noises, banging, throwing people about etc. Pretty much the only thing that's different is the fact 'Toby' talks to the youngest girl and 'Toby' is her 'invisible friend'.I think the only times I jumped were when the real people in the film tried to spook Dennis, the main camera guy (who looks an awful lot like Micah?!) in the film. Even with the 'creepy' scenes, the audience were laughing uncontrollably and found it funny.The most disappointing aspect to the film was the ending. I thought Paranormal Activity was spooky because of the mystery 'demon' spirits which stalked a family and eventually broke it up. Turns out, these demons were brought in by the grandmother, who belonged to a 'cult' and drove demons into her family. The mystery of how the mother died remains unknown. What happened to the children after? Surely if they lived with their grandmother, they would have been growing up in a 'cult'? - therefore what was the point in the last 2 films when the two girls claimed they did not know why demons were following them? The ages of the girls in PA3 are old enough to remember some aspect of their experiences, particularly the elder girl.The whole storyline has basically changed and I don't like it - at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So me and my wife go check out PA3 Sunday (she loves horror movies, I go and then get freaked out getting ready for work by myself in the morning after she leaves!) with mid-level expectations. She didn't think the first two were all that scary, but I found them to really screw with your mind by what you can't see, which is what really scares me. We were both let down. I read online that some of the scenes from the trailer were not in the Theatrical release, but I think almost NONE of the scenes from the trailer made it in the finished product. I understand the producers' intention, to give us something we aren't expecting, but since this series already has a built-in audience how about giving us less in the trailer and more in the film? Not using scenes that were truly riveting in the trailer means we are invariably going to be let down by what they did use, and that was the case here. Kudos for letting us actually see some sort of demon this time, and the scene with the babysitter was exhilarating, but the end, though pulse pounding at times, is truly lame and leaves all sorts of questions as to how this could truly have happened to these girls when they were young and allow them to live "normal" lives as adults. And Satan worshiping women? The whole end is a farce. My suggestion for the fourth film, and you know there will be a 4th. Drop the found footage angle (it was all too convenient for this one that the mom was dating a guy who loves to film "everything") and bring in a real horror master to end this one with a bang. People are going to get sick of the found footage clich anyway and we've just about milked all the story out of this family we can muster, so how about just giving us a good demonic possession movie that wraps this whole thing up? Please, so we don't have to keep wasting our time with this crap!!!!</fullReview>

It's safe to say that I've been more frightened during a Disney film.A cinematic Tour de Force this is not. The last 20 minutes were OK, but after enduring the worst opening hour of a film since Hawk the Slayer (at least i fell asleep during this so I made the experience productive), even when it suddenly jumps up a notch towards the end, you just can't switch into the right frame of mind to enjoy it. There's no tension being built throughout and the characters make the most stupid decisions. It feels as though you are cutting from one home camera shot to another without any real purpose to them, and when something does happen, then the next scene will release any small amount of tension created by dropping in some attempted humour.There is no explanation to anything that goes on, which coupled with the lack of tension just leaves you feeling disinterested and doesn't make you feel involved in any sort of way. All i could think about for the majority of the film was I hope this finishes soon so I can go grab a beer or 10 and quickly erase this painful experience from my life. Even the beer didn't taste good after this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of the three films, Part three is the most disappointing. Although I felt that some of the effects were cool, the story lacked major aspects in syncing with parts 1 and 2. Most notably there was no mention of the fire that supposedly destroyed their home when they were children. Plus, just about EVERYTHING in the previews and trailers promoting the movie was NOT in the movie. This practice has been rampant in movies lately; however, it was the worst that I've ever seen it in "Paranormal Activity 3". The following is the "Official Movie Trailer": http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90r3CnPI0AM (Note ? 80% to possibly 100% is NOT in the actual movie). Plus, it is supposed to come off as an actual video account of a paranormal activity and the way the movie was put together it just does not compute to me. However, I suspect that most who go to see this movie do not do so for story content as much as they just want to be scared. The "scary" scenes that were orchestrated to make the audience jump are not that surprising and borderline corny. The best "scare" turned out to be the prank that the girlfriend plays on her boyfriend. Forgive me if I sound too vague, I really do not want to spoil it for anybody who decides to go see the movie. I realize that my feelings about the movie can and will differ from person to person. All in all I was very disappointed with "Paranormal Activity 3".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't Believe the Hype this Film Does Not Live Up to the First One</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The biggest thing that stands out for me upon viewing this film, was the loud sigh of disappointment from the theater audience when the ending credits began to role. I had read all the hyped up reviews before seeing this, everything from "the last 30 minutes was the most intense of any movie I've ever seen," to "this film is up there with The Exorcist," to "Easily the best one of the three." Needless to say, the first Paranormal Activity really creeped me out, but the 2nd one was much tamer and predictable which left me feeling skeptical about seeing this 3rd one until all these positive reviews persuaded me otherwise. I'm glad I saw it because Paranormal 3 did have some very good moments in it, however as a whole it was an extremely disappointing movie and much more on par with the second film than the first.This film takes place in a suburban California home in 1988 and focuses on the two sisters from the first two Paranormal films when they were kids. A strange image is caught on the father's camera during an earthquake and he decides to set up more cameras around the house to catch more...well, paranormal activity. Hence, the story is one you've seen before. Of course being the 3rd film in the franchise they do try to bring new elements into the story to freshen the scares. The new elements in this film are the two little girls, one (Kristi) who has an "imaginary" friend named Tobi, a camera that is mounted on a swivel fan (a unique feature that heightens the suspense as the camera pans back and forth across the living room/kitchen), a creepy storage door in the kids' room, a cute babysitter, and a geeky camera-loving friend of the father who plays "bloody Mary" with one of the kids...and of course another plot twist that personally ruined the movie for me...which I'll get to later.Although I found this to be the tamest of the three, it is also the best filmed of the three. While the storyline contains plot holes (What happened to the house fire?) is very weak and loses direction, there are some very fun and creative moments in this film. One that stands out is when the mother reaches her arm into the disposal unit late one night while the camera is panning, and suddenly a light fixture pops and an enormous bulb falls. Another is the ironic ghost in a bed sheet that creeps up on the babysitter only to shrivel up into a heap on the floor. I also really enjoyed the 80's references in the toys as I was born in '86 and grew up with many of these. The teddy ruxpin scene was a personal favorite of mine, as well as seeing the light bright, cabbage patch dolls, and plastic barbies scattered about.Now I'll get critical. The ending really ruined this movie for me, not to say that it wasn't suspenseful, but it certainly was not "the most intense ending I've experienced in a movie." First of all it got away from the heart of what made the first movie so terrifying. The family actually gets out of the house in this one (Not that I blame them.), but it rids the audience of that sense of feeling trapped in a nightmare. We finally got out of it this time...well sort of. I admit I like how it started with the father suddenly finding himself alone with his family missing, but the whole grandma is a cult leader scenario left me confused and almost cheated. The end of this film played out more like Blair Witch Project with a touch of REC than a Paranormal Activity movie. It also made the demon itself less scary, as it became clear that the grandma was controlling it. The unexplained terror of the night has become nothing more than Grandma's invisible pet. I don't understand either why the grandma would off her own daughter like that, really it just kind of happened to draw the movie to a close. To be fair, the endings are the weakest part in every one of these films, but this cult reference just felt so out of place to me.This movie also leaves less room open to the imagination which is what makes the first two films so terrorizing. In this third installment more surreal computer effects take place such as the daughter's ponytail being tugged, pulling her off the ground, or seeing a dusty outline of something just makes the realism disappear. What's the point of doing a mocumentary style film with totally unrealistic events taking place? The first movie was the best example of keeping the boundaries between what "could happen" and the ludicrous in balance, this one tended to exploit what they could get away with. A lot of the scare tactics are more of the same (I couldn't tell you how many times I've seen the bed sheets move by themselves in horror movies). Also there wasn't a whole lot of originality in this movie: ghost in a sheet (Halloween), imaginary friend (Amityville Horror), locked in scary little storage rooms (Sixth Sense), satanic cults (Blair Witch), demon children and night cams (REC).For my conclusion; Paranormal Activity 3 is a fun movie to watch and I recommend it to fans of the first two films. Just don't believe the hype and expect this movie to live up to the expectations of the first one. I admit I enjoyed it slightly more than the second one, although they are easily both on the same level when it comes to suspense and storyline. It is the tamest of the three films (the part that made me jump the highest was in fact not caused by the paranormal but by the babysitter yelling Boo! into the camera lens.), however the acting is the best as well as the filming techniques.</fullReview>

I must admit, I am no longer 14 but even when I was I never got sucked into these camcorder "oh my gosh is it real?" tard-fests.So you watch this pile of crap for an hour and 18 minutes and finally the protagonist's back and neck get broken cirque de soleil style by a psychic witch.So do not get angry and claim I ruined this movie for you. The idiot that wrote and directed this fly breeding pile ruined it for you. The first installment of this series is good. The second is absolute terrible and the third...well it's not as bad as the second but it certainly doesn't make amends for it either.Run run run fast as you can and if you're stupid enough to pay to view this movie, you're clearly too stupid to know you are entitled by U.S. Federal commercial legislation code to a REFUND when you are unhappy because it failed to meet up to expectations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has potential to be a comedy...........</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the hype being so high, I decide to give Paranormal Activity 3 a chance by watching it on opening night. With the first two being successful in theaters, I had high hopes for this film. However, halfway through the film, I realized I had made a big mistake.First off, the beginning was incredibly slow. Don't expect any real action until forty minutes into the film. The first half was more of an information giver than anything else, with maybe a small scare every eight to ten minutes. We learned more about the characters, had a small scare, explored the house for a little while because something seems awkward, had another small scare, and then the "scares" start ten minutes later after halfway through the movie.Second, the movie had potential. It would have been scarier if they didn't add so many funny scenes in between. After a small scare, the director will humor you by adding a funny scene to make you laugh. To be honest, the film had more funny themes to it than thrills. The audience ended up laughing throughout, which in the end, took out the scare factor completely. I tried to take the movie serious even through the scary parts but I was too distracted by the audience members who yelled out random things like, "No, don't go in there!", or "Oh s!@%, did you see that! Did you see that!" If I could change the genre of this film, I would say it is a comedy. I found myself laughing more than hiding under my arms. I would say the only part worth watching is the last ten minutes of the film, and even that wasn't as great as people put it out to be. If you haven't seen the film, don't. Don't spend the ten dollars and just wait until your friend owns it on DVD. You will be disappointed if you go.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A high expectation movie gets a low review.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really did not like this installment of the hit mega-horror franchise of Paranormal Activity. The first was great, as was the second but the 3rd was a disappointment. I do not recommend seeing this at all. Considering how good the original was with a budget of just 15,000 I excepted a movie with a budget 30,000 times large (5 million) to blow me away and yet I finished the movie with a face of disappointment. Taking place in 1988 a professional video photographer records the weird happenings around his house. Pretty much the standard Paranormal Activity plot. I am afraid that this series will be an endless series of repeats much like saw and final destination. Don't get me wrong they were good movies but after the 5th or so installment it gets repetitive and boring. The same can be said for this movie which offered me little thrills or chills. Even so Paranormal Activity broke the box office horror movie record with 52 million beating out Jackass 3D (I cannot believe they call that a horror movie) which gained 50.5 million opening weekend. Stop giving this franchise money to go on and rent it on Netflix like the rest of the world if you really want to see it. This movie is definitely worth waiting for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I've got a bad feeling about this family...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paranormal Activity 3 is a messy and unnecessary prequel for a franchise that didn't even need one sequel. I stated in my review of the second one that since it followed the original formula, it was better than The Blair Witch Project sequel, Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2. At least Blair Witch knew it was not necessary to make a third film. Paranormal Activity still believes in itself, and will inevitably make more installments.This is a prequel to the first films, like I mentioned. Something we all saw coming. The film takes place in the present for just a few minutes, then we see Kristi's (Grayden) house get vandalized from the second film and we see a bunch of old tapes her sister Katie (Featherson) dropped off had gone missing. The rest of the film is compiled of those VHS tapes from when Katie and Kristi were young.It is 1988, a fairly modern version of it, and we see both Katie and Kristi growing up rather upper middle class with their mother Julie (Bittner) and her boyfriend Daniel (Boland). We learn Daniel is obsessed with taping everything, and one day catches what appears to be some "paranormal activity" on tape. He then sets up a camera in their bedroom, a camera in the girls' bedroom, and an oscillating camera on a fan in the living room/kitchen.The rest of the film consists of ineffective jump scares, mild activity that sometimes goes unnoticed, and a lot of screaming. Not from the audience, but from the parents and the children. Not a lot of questions are answered, but the film feels like it should bring more into the picture. We never really find out the story of the baby Hunter from the second film, and many other points like the mysterious photograph are not revisited.The trailer is misleading beyond belief. Very few, if any scenes from the trailer exist in the film which is either because (a) the film was victim to several rewrites and reshoots, or (b) they shot much of the footage for the trailer before the actual film and now went back to film around those shots and got sidetracked. Certain scenes like the "Bloody Mary" scene from the trailer exist, but in a very different and inferior manner.Paranormal Activity 3 is supposed to be set in 1988, but looks absolutely nothing like it. The house is too modern, the clothes are from the present, very little references to famous things in the eighties, and not to mention the film being shot with a glorious, high definition camera - the most fatal flaw of all.Lots of the activity is very subtle as well. We are provided with maybe one effective jump scare, two or three amusing scenes, and an interesting camera angle. The ending, in-which the last fifteen minutes are supposed to "scar you for life," are rather underwhelming and very unappealing. I dare not spoil them because, while I was disappointed, I was nonetheless surprised.The franchise itself has ran its course dry, but more sequels are inevitably on the way. We have many more questions, and fewer and fewer answers per film. No doubt this will gross many, many millions at the box office, and be seen by many fans of the first two. If you are interested in creepy stories from an interesting perspective, directors Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman, directors of this, did an extremely immersing documentary called Catfish. That had more jumps and way more intensity that lacks in Paranormal Activity 3.Starring: Katie Featherston, Sprague Grayden, Chloe Csengery, Jessica Tyler Brown, Brian Boland, Lauren Bittner, Christopher Nicholas Smith, and Mark Fredrichs. Directed by: Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loved the first two....this one not so much.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Going into this I had heard that this would be the film to answer all the questions created by the occurrences of the first two films. This was absolutely not the case. I walked away with more questions than I had before. Not to mention there are several inconsistencies. I realize that at the time the original was created, the writers probably didn't plan on having the good fortune to have to continue the franchise through two more installments, so a lot of the story line had to be added as an afterthought. Therefore I'm more lenient on the plot holes than I would be otherwise. Still the execution of this film is not on par with the previous two.One - It's a lot less scary. The "jumpy" moments are not as organic as in the first two. They somehow seem cheap and contrived.Two - The "found footage" gimmick was excellent in the first PA, good in the second, but now it's no longer credible. There are quick editing cuts that don't jive with the homemade footage idea; particularly with footage that is supposed to have been created over 20 years ago. It's explained that the boyfriend in this film is a wedding videographer but it still seems strange that he would film his entire household everyday all day for no reason at all; even prior to the hauntings.Three - The screenplay is choppy and just plain bad. There is a lot less dialogue in this film, and when the characters do speak, it's not natural conversation like in the first two. Their actors lines are elementary and basic; and they're not helped by the bad acting. The two little girls outshone the adults by far in acting skills.Four - It left me a little confused in regards to issues that I wasn't confused about before I saw the film. Not a good sign.All in all, it was nowhere near as effective as the first two. Too contrived to be in the PA franchise, whose strong point was always the natural unfolding of what was happening to the characters; the way in which it made it seem that these events could and did happen to real people. PA 3 missed the mark entirely. Too contrived, too staged, too showy. And it was for nothing because it wasn't even scary.A big disappointment! 4.5/10EDIT - Just finished watching the first trailer that's listed on the IMDb page, and over half the scenes were omitted from the film! Seems like this film may be suffering from bad editing if nothing else. It lacks a flow and cohesion that some of these missing scenes might have brought to the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Disclaimer: I am extremely jumpy...saw this at a pre-screening. I thought the first one was almost funny-that is until I saw the ending. For some reason I am OBSESSED with the 2nd one-so my expectations of this were pretty high. Other people have written stuff about the time period and how it doesn't coincide with the technology. I didn't pay attention to that...what got me was how often (and loud) both myself and the audience as a whole reacted to certain scenes. What I loved the most is how the movie used sound and anticipation (and sometimes humor) to draw out certain scenes. Forget gore-what makes this franchise so successful is that it really gets under your skin and uses psychology to make you want more without really wanting more (for the characters' sake). SPOILER ALERT: as soon as a certain incident happened with a girl's hair (I have never shrieked so loudly, lol) I knew I was going to have white knuckles for the rest of the ride. This movie is good...and for the sake of it I hope it stops here because I would really hate for it to go from "psychologically chilling" to "cheesy."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting formula gone to waste</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another Prequel which tells the story of how young Katie (Chloe Csengery) and her older sister Kristy (Jessica Tyler Brown) coped with strange happenings in the new home they moved into in 1988 with their mum (Lauren Bittner) and her new hubby Dennis (Christopher Nicholas Smith). You know trouble is brewing once Katie talks about her mysterious invisible friend Toby and the secrets she shares with him. What follows is a wild array of effects which at times are scary, but not because of any build-up of tension but because they're loud, and, quite simply, you can't time them precisely. There are long silences, but they only seem to be there for the sake of filling up some of the plot holes rather than actually creating the same tension of the previous film and especially the first installment in this series. Sometimes predictably, sometimes lifted from its predecessors, but often just very silly, this doesn't work as a horror film. The performances of the two young leads Csengery and Brown are, however, quite remarkably restrained and very effective. If the story is mostly rather off-putting, these girls certainly aren't and they manage to at least keep you slightly interested until the ludicrous finale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Paranormal Activity 3</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With so many found footage supernatural horror films out in the open already, you would wonder just how many would be enough before the genre becomes stale. Easily one of the most successful in terms of box office numbers and sheer ingenuity, Paranormal Activity seemed to have so far built on the strengths of its predecessor film, and with each installment throws the gauntlet down to the next creative team to see how much more they can add to its universe. This time round directors Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman, responsible for the documentary Catfish, brings out the usual arsenal of scares to great effect, bringing us back some 18 years prior to the events seen in Parts 1 and 2, to shed some light on its origins, yet keeping the door wide open for any creative team to either fill in the blanks between this film and Part 1, or to venture forward from Part 2.And credit goes to writer Christopher B. Landon, who brings to the franchise plenty of room to do just that, and in some ways being very generous in crafting a tale that has the legs to provide for any follow up film, if this installment does well, to continue where it left off and bridge the story toward Part 1, or to go even further back, but not too far since this one is set in the 80s, just about the time where VHS beat Betamax in being the video recording format of choice, and any further would mean stretching the limits of having artifacts for audiences like us to rummage through with glee.Landon had introduced the sisters Katie (Katie Featherston) and Kristi (Sprague Grayden) whom we have come acquainted with, and opens the film just before the original film, where a box of VHS tapes got found, and so we begin a trip back to the past, introducing us to the time when the sisters were kids (Chloe Cserngey as the younger Katie and Jessica Brown as younger Kristi), their mom Julie (Lauren Bittner) and her live in boyfriend Dennis (Christopher Nicholas Smith) who conveniently for the sake of the story, is much of a documentarian himself and by nature of his job, has a video editing suite in one of the rooms in the house. Everything's fine and dandy at home, until two and then three video cameras get put around the house, and we start to witness Kristi's communication with a certain Toby, who remains unseen. Yes, the haunting have begun.You may wonder just how much more quality material could be included, and Joost and Schulman showed us just how. While Part 1 had utilized what was primarily a one video camera recording in the bedroom, and Part 2 being more sophisticated with multiple CCTV cameras deployed around the house, Part 3 strikes a balance between the two, with up to three cameras deployed in the bedrooms of the adult couple and the kids, followed by a pan- camera between the hall and the kitchen/dining space. And besides having the haunting experienced only by the direct family members, Landon's story has it expanded to include the babysitter and Dennis' buddy (Dustin Ingram) in very dramatic, intense episodes that bring the creeps head on.While a bigger budget provided for a lot more that can be done in terms of special effects sprucing up the creepy moments on screen, from levitation, flying furniture and the likes, undoubtedly this film aces it when required to build anticipation, with silent moments growing almost deafening, and sound design at its best when tasked to maximize scare impact, although steering from becoming too cheap with many falling reliant on loud noises to compensate for its desperate lack of finesse in conjuring up scary images. You know something's coming by way of the running clock on the video sped up and then slowing down, and the directors are experts at teasing with shadowy figures lurking sporadically in the background if you care to look a little bit closer. It's goosebumps galore, with technical diligence and brilliance combined to keep scenes flowing in continuous long takes, hardly taking a breather especially when the supernatural elements begin.Whatever happened to Hunter will remain unsolved for now. But if this will prove to be as successful as its predecessors this upcoming Halloween period, I suppose the answer won't be too far behind us. This is highly recommended, and while the first two films would have made you quite chummy with the key characters, Part 3 can be viewed as a standalone episode, or viewed first to keep the time chronology in order. If you're up for a proper spook fest, Paranormal Activity 3 will show why it still remains at the top of its game and its peers, and for budding filmmakers who want a crack at the horror genre, this will be something as a reference point and lessons to be learnt in keeping up the suspense and delivering when it matters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like watching horror movies late at night, before I go to bed. The movie I watched 3 days ago was "Insidious", 2 days ago I watched "Grave Encounters" and yesterday I watched "Paranormal Activity 3" (all of them for the first time). I must tell you that the first two movies were MUCH more scary, they kept me on the edge throughout the movie, and "Paranormal Activity 3" was dull and boring. The movie is identical to the first two in the series. Same formula, same scares, same situations, like a deja vu. Only the house is different. Our demon is not really creative, he just goes around making noises, slamming doors, moving furniture and scratching people just like he did in the first two movies. The movie is very predictable and you know whats going to happen a moment before it happens. The story is getting ridiculous, not to mention that it is inconsistent to what was said in the previous movies. Also, after three movies the "setting-up-cameras-to-catch-ghosts" formula is getting old (that is probably what "runs in the family" according to the cover). I don't get it, if things like that were happening in my house, setting up cameras would be the last thing I would do, I mean, knowing this sh*t happens at night would scare me more, I wouldn't want to know that! A total waste of my time.</fullReview>

But like the SAW movies it fell in a hole of predictability and boredom.It is basically an extension to the PA story without delivering horror, because the slow and intimidating one of the first movies are replaced by jump-scares.

		<shortDescription>Just keep filming!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no question that there is still something refreshing about a contemporary horror film franchise that performs well at the box office, despite operating on the most elementary of structures. The first film in the "Paranormal Activity" series required patience and discipline from its audience, an approach that tended to alienate the "slice and dice" contingent somewhat - whose ADHD leanings ensured the film's home movie "aesthetic" was met with yawns and snorts of derision. Yet for those blessed with slightly longer attention spans they would be rewarded with a film that contained some genuinely creepy shocks, heightened by those same choppy, ponderous video cam threads.So it is then that we arrive at the third episode in the series and while the regressive narrative (the focus here is on the young Katie, whom we were introduced to as an adult in the first film) digs deeper into the mythology and origins of the story, the central structure of the film is in no way changed from parts one or two.The emphasis on video taping and surveillance is just as pivotal here as it was in the first film - pored over all the more given the year in which the film is set, 1988, an era when technology in the home was reaching it's zenith.In slightly more guerrilla style then, Katie's father, Dennis, rigs up cameras in the house, in response to various unexplained "events" stemming from daughter Katie and her vividly sketched "imaginary friend" - the results of which playing out at night.While this gradual reveal worked so brilliantly in the first film, it's become almost redundant the third time around. What felt like creeping tension in the first, plays more like utter tedium two films later. It also feels like an increasingly cynical ploy, asking of its audience to sit tight for over an hour of viewing time before being drip fed their first real scare.To it's credit there are some effective moments in the film's final section, as evil spirit "Tobi" starts flexing his muscles in ways that the micro budget first could never muster. Such moments are typically handled with restrain,(excluding a ludicrous sequence to rival the kitchen shock of the second film) and add a little excitement to the proceedings.Sadly, the film fails to cash in on this late glimmer of promise, taking a fatal stumble in its last act, with an ending almost as far fetched as that featured in 2010's "The Last Exorcism". The final shock utterly predictable and xeroxed in a slew of penny dreadful scare flicks gone before. The message couldn't be writ any larger, this series has been mined to extinction and has now become yet another dull franchise of the genre.</fullReview>

Wouldn't it serve their evil purposes more than to spend so much time tormenting so few people? People who buy into these types of movies really must love shallow sadness and hopeless depression. These types of movies are just ways to explain away human psychoses (plural). If anyone has some serious hard evidence of a ghost and not just some doctored Hollywood TV special or the like, then please just show us and try not to make money off of it. These types of movies are so easily forgotten. Does anyone even remember the Friday the 13th movies?

		<shortDescription>Good sequel, but not a lot of good scares.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, so I just got back from the first showing of Paranormal Activity 3...and uh...hmmm...Okay, so the movie was good, fans of the first two will like this one. I thought it was enjoyable. The last fifteen minutes was mind-blowing. But this movie didn't really scare me. It didn't have that real scare effect like it did with the first two. It used some of the same factors that made the first movie scary, i.e. One of the girls standing, staring at the parents while we watch the clock pass through the hours. This movie had some good, "Oh, my god! I can't believe that's happening!" moments, but it lacked the really good "BOO!!!!" moments. And even the ones that are there are very predictable.The movie starts right off with Katie and Kristie, (Kirstie?) and they find a bunch of old tapes, and they watch them, which is the premise of the third movie. It starts off with the birthday party, and then after that all hell slowly breaks loose.Like I said, good movie if you liked the first two, which I most certainly did. I thought this was a great one. I would go see a fourth, but I don't think a fourth would be necessary. All of your questions are wrapped up in this installment, so they shouldn't have to continue with the franchise. It could've been so much scarier though.6 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>PA4 will have to be on super 8mm</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Did you watch 1 and 2? If so you might have noticed a theme. No not everyone dies, thats right it is always on a camcorder, every minute. So if the first two movies didn't annoy you then this one should be no different. The story goes back to the sisters' childhood years with their mother and her boyfriend. There are some good shock points in the movies when you totally expect them (which is all the time). But this one almost has a real story in it with the girls' grandmother. However, we can't be worried about the real story when there is time for another shock moment when the camera pans back and forth on a makeshift turning device made from a stripped down oscillating fan. The girls in the movie I enjoyed, the parents weren't totally annoying and the friend is a good blend of weird and innocent. That makes this movie better than the first two already. Unfortunately that doesn't make the film good or bad.Paranormal Activity 3 will make its money fast and drop off real quick. It has an interesting idea but never really fulfills you one way or another. I think the real story is the one that would precede this one, too bad it would have to be on 8mm. Wait maybe thats a good thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay...but like the other two, not great.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just watched Paranormal Activity 3, and I am disappointed. I am actually more confused then before. It doesn't let us know why the "deal" was made in the first place, and what was asked for in the "deal." Another waiting game to actually see things happen. I was getting worried about the time, and the movie ending with nothing really happening. The trailers that you see, are not even in the movie. I guess its okay, considering they would once again show all the "good" stuff like last time in the trailers. Would be nice to see those parts of the movie in the DVD.The plot is good, but still leaves it open for another one. And the ending is strange. Leaves you with questions, and still confused on why it is happening in the first place? And why? Would advise ones to go during the day when it is only $5.00. Like we did! If you like the other two then you will be fine with this one too. But will leave you wanting another one to know why this is going on in the first place!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just Awful! :(</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just Awful! The first part of the movie is good. The first half of the movie follows the same themes Weird events, children seeing weird happenings, and people getting scared via a live video camera. The first half of the movie is more of the same old same old of the first two movies. The movie makers create a game changer with the last third of the movie. The evil entity forces the family to move out of their house and over to grandma's place. One could see the plot twist coming a mile away. Grandma is evil and started the whole family curse thingie! The bottom third of the movie bothers me. The movie disintegrates into a version of the Blair Witch project with people running around and screaming. The conclusion looks like I am watching local access television. If I was the guy character in the film, I would have started throwing punches at the old witches and jump over the fence. The conclusion was not scary. Thumbs down on the ending. I give Paranormal Activity a 4 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Threequel" is the least of the Paranormal Activity films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What makes us afraid? It's a key question and one that makers of torture-porn and gross-out horror movies have completely failed to understand.But it's actually very simple: The unknown, and the unseen. Playing on these aspects are what made Paranormal Activity into a franchise, starting with PA 1 which remains, in my view, the most terrifying movie experience of my life.Paranormal Activity was very effective because it depended on subtlety, building tension until it was near the breaking point. I can remember scanning the screen during that movie and looking for what was out of place ? and getting chills when I found it.Paranormal Activity 2 succeeded as well, even though there were far too many loud 'bangs' and false scares which were clearly designed to imitate the age old 'it's just a cat/dog' element.But above all, both Paranormal Activity 1 and 2 did one thing that was preferable above all others: It didn't show us the entity.Paranormal Activity 3, on the other hand, barely gets going before it shows us the entity, as it were.And so begins the issues with this film.To be fair, Paranormal Activity 3 has parts that are, indeed, unsettling. For instance, how many of us have been at home and we hear something we can't explain. Like footsteps on the stairs, a knock at the door, something falling on the floor, etc. But then we go and see, and there's no one there. That's the sort of material that sends shivers down your spine. And it's the very same formula which made Paranormal Activity one such a success.In PA3, we have some of the same disquiet ? a cupboard door which swings shut on its own, a truly frightening game of Bloody Mary and a unique camera mounted on an oscillating fan which takes the 'found footage' gimmick to the next level.But the film falls apart when it strays from the tried-and-true formula of the first two films. It delves too far into the back story and raises more questions than it answers. And, unfortunately, those raised questions present unanswerable problems for this film? problems that ultimately take away from the entire experience.SPOILER ALERT! For instance 1) If Katie and Kristi saw their parents die, why do they remember nothing of this during the previous two films? 2) WHY, if they viewed these films, as is indicated at the beginning of PA3 did either of them stick around in their respective houses? They see the entity kill someone! 3) What happened to the bodies of the parents? 4) What about the fire that destroyed their house, referenced in the first PA movie? 5) Why did they never think to bring in a psychic, like they did in the first film? 6) "Toby" wanted Kristi to get everyone to the grandmother's house. The conclusion we draw is so the parents could be killed. But considering "Toby" was already malevolent beforehand, and was clearly strong enough to deal with them on his own, why did they need to go there? 7) What about the 'dark figure' that stood at the end of Katie's bed, which she references in the first movie? 8) If the demon was so close to Kristi, why did she remember none of this when she was an adult? And why did it have to terrorize her and her sister if the hope was to have a male child? 9) If it's true that the coven controlled the entity, why did it possess Katie before she could have children with Micah? 10) How did the tape itself survive? Grandma knew about the tape, since she would have found the camera and deposited it in a box (and kept it at her place). Why didn't she have it destroyed? I'm left somewhat dissatisfied with this film for that reason. Do I regret seeing it? No, and I would recommend any fan of the previous two films to at least give it a chance.But keep your expectations low. And treasure those moments of terror and intrigue you experienced during the first two films. They aren't replicated here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Read this I won't ruin the illusion, but see it quick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I begin this third installment made me squirm and jump just as much as the second film but no where near as the first. It helps if you know the first two movies because all the weird stuff happening is linked. I liked this third one, it takes things back to when the sisters from the first two films were little. The origin story of why the entity followed them from kids to adults is explained to a point but there are still questions that need to be asked. The concept remains the same with video footage interjected together and this one being set in the 80's, VHS rules. See it before someone else tells you the ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad, but doesn't look anything like 1988.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw "Paranormal Activity 3" at a special Hollywood premiere at the ArcLight. I also had the honor of seeing Katie Featherston signing autographs for us fans waiting patiently to see it. Unfortunately, I left my Droid smart phone in the car because it was my understanding we would be wanded for recording devices. That didn't happen and many people had their camera phones with them. I would have loved to get my pic taken with Katie. Oh well.Anyway, back to the movie. "Paranormal Activity 3" is a prequel to the first two movies. The movie starts in 2005 with Katie getting together with her younger sister Kristi at her house and both come across some old VHS tapes of them taken in 1988 when they were children left behind by their deceased grandmother. They watch a tape and that is the premise of the film.The overriding glaring error in this film is that the entire 1988 portion of the film was shot in HD in 1:85:1 or 16 x 8 ratio which caused me to ask the question "oh really?" If my memory is correct, HD video in that ratio did not exist. The film would have been more realistic had the picture quality looked more like VHS with the ratio in 1:33:1 or 4x3. The father, Dennis, works as a wedding videographer and he has a linear editing system consisting of two 4x3 monitors and VHS tape similar to the editing system I used when I took video production classes in college in the early 1990s so the film gets kudos for that.The film starts with young Katie celebrating her birthday with her little sister Kristi looking on. As the story progresses, we discover that Kristi has an imaginary friend named Toby. When it's time for the girls to go to bed, Kristi gets up, walks toward the camera (yes, just like the first two movies, this family has camcorders set up around the house recording their life) and starts talking to her imaginary friend. Meanwhile, Dennis and his wife Julie decide to make love while the camera is rolling. Just as things start to get hot, an earthquake strikes. As Dennis and Julie run out of their room to check on the kids, crushed pieces of plaster fall from the ceiling. When the plaster lands, it appears to hit something invisible, the first sign that there is a spirit in their midst. Throughout the film, things escalate as Kristi's imaginary friend starts taking things to higher levels causing her older sister Katie great worry and concerning Dennis as the paranormal happenings are all caught on tape.The first "Paranormal Activity" film had a great premise in which a couple liked to record their life on tape. Problem with making sequels with a story like this is you get every family recording their lives on tape and so you start to wonder why is it that every generation of this family likes documenting every move they make? Another thing I found tedious is that like the first two movies (and practically most clichd horror films), this film contained quite a bit of "scare scenes" that makes you jump. This film had a few legitimate scares but had one that was so predictable, I didn't even budge in my seat when it happened.With every subsequent sequel having more or less the same premise, you start to wonder when this story is getting old.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not all that great ***May contain Spoilers***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>They used the same synopsis as before, camera angles of house, creepy things going on, etc etc. They just add a bit of humor and awkwardness into it. Mind it is funny at some points.I didn't plan to write something long, this is short and simple.After the movie the theater people were trying to push enthusiasm of the movie. It's lower rated than the first 2 movies in my mind.Don't see it in the movie theaters, don't even buy it, it'll be on TV before you know it, then you'll see why I say, its not all that great.5/10Hope this helps~Shinji</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good But Not Completely Successful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paranormal Activity 3 (2011) *** (out of 4) Prequel to the first two films takes place in 1988 as a young Katie and Kristi begin to experience weird things in their house. All of the activity is being filmed by their stepfather who sets cameras up in the house and obviously they're not alone. I thought the first film in the series was a masterpiece of terror but I found the second one to be completely lacking in just about every department. This third film is a good one but I don't think it works that well as a ghost film. Say what? In other words, I'm giving this film three-stars but I think out of the three movies this one here probably contains the lowest amount of scares. Even though I didn't like PA2, the film still had a couple very good jump sequences and on some levels this film here seems to not even be trying for scares. The reason I say that is because there are a lot of scenes that really build up the drama but never really pay off in the end. We'll be watching a sequence, see something small happen and then we're waiting for the big pay-off scare but it never happens. Throughout the film there were several sequences where not too much would happen and what we did see was rather small. The first movie in the series just was relentless in the type of scares that it was going after because it really was an assault on the viewer in terms of building up the suspense. That doesn't really happen here but there are still some very effective sequences. One happens during a game of Bloody Mary. Another one happens when the mother finally realizes something is going on. I won't ruin what exactly happens but it's an effective sequence. Again, I won't spoil the ending but it's mildly effective up to a point but then again you've really come to expect more. The suspense level might go up to a six out of ten but the first movie was just so good that you expect all tens. So, why the three star rating? Again, the suspense is never as high as one hopes but what's here is still a lot better than most films these days. What really helped me enjoy the film even more was Lauren Bittner and Chris Smith who play the mother and boyfriend. I thought both of them were extremely good in their parts and they really made you care and feel for them and the rest of the family. Both actors were very believable in their parts and it was fun going through the movie with them. Also, the 81-minute running time was good as you at least never get bored and things are handled quite well by the directors. With all of that said, even though I enjoyed the movie I do wonder how many people are going to walk out disappointed. Yes, I enjoyed the characters and the small frights were good enough for me to enjoy myself but I'd say the majority of people just want large scares and I don't think they're going to get them here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just saw Paranormal Activity 3 - WASTE OF MONEY.... movie too slow.... only 1 or 2 slightly scary bits.... trailers even have bits that ARE NOT in the movie... wasted opportunity for the studio - whoever did the test screening analysis needs to be sacked.If your a fan of the franchise.... don't pay top dollar to see it... Don't waste your money - wait for it to be on DVD but don't pay any more than $2 as thats all it's worth.I'm surprised that it wasn't released straight to DVD.... oh well, studio has to try to recoup on its investment.Don't Waste Your Money!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>no. no thank you</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not new to IMDb, actually I've watched more films that you will watch in 10 lifetimes. yet this is my first review. so, thank you for reading. I saw the film 3 hours ago in a special premiere...for free. Nice...however, as much as i like not paying for watching a movie, it wasn't a great experience. Its not that its a bad one, its just that it has a lot of flaws;first of all, the story takes place in the year 1988. In 88, there was not HD cameras available for the general public(yet it existed), only VHS cameras that recorded on VHS tapes. and this movie, is clearly shot in HD. so, for the realism of the protocol, when there was no HD, and only VHS, they should have filmed this one in VHS or DV. I don't care that it looks nice. this is an outrage, and not acceptable. the whole movie is supposed to be the "cinematographer point of view", and the semi documentary realism. I don't give a rat's ass about today's technological abilities, if you have a concept, go all way, or don't make/do it at all!the story line is tremendously weak. I personally think that the second "paranormal" is better then the first, because the screenplay is greatly interwoven with the story of the first one. i really a film snob and truly think that the paranormal 2 is underrated. mainly, because of the writing, and the fact that it successfully kept the essence of the first part. this one, was not successful at all. it just played on the concept and the story when it liked, and ignored it in the rest of the time. rational actions by the characters couldn't be seen on the screen. and the ending, the ending was poorly executed. its just...finished. my girlfriend &amp; I kept setting in our chairs waiting for the continuation of the film. yet, the directors thought that it should end right there. so, it was quite a disappointment. really, there was not a sufficient climax or enough story building for it to end there, what a shame... now...the good things are that it has good affects. not as scary as i would have done, yet a nice part near the end when one of the girls is left alone. good one. the acting is fine. however, I think that what hurts the acting is the script, that lets the story to continue in some parts when you can see clearly, that they have needed time to stretch, so the directors allowed stupid things to happen when they should have ended swiftly in the start. the kids played quite nicely. the parents that were a little weak. again, because they could not react properly(time stretch) good editing(accept from the end, which i believe is the director's or the producers fault). good sound editing and mixing. those who don't understand sound editing may experience some fear and horror. cinematography (spoiler) I'm trying to be in the point of view of the father. if you see your little daughter, talking with ghosts in the middle of the night, and then the babysitter spooked by one, you should turn and pan the camera to where all the action is happening!!! WTFFFFF!?!??! this is of course the directors fault. another loose end and a major hole in the plot. (spoiler end) to sum up..I'm happy i didn't pay for it. really. not like transformers 3, that i paid 30$ for 2 tickets and tried to murder myself during the film. Michael bay, die.in the end, another one for the series. it falls in the holes in the plot, and bad writing, and bad directing. not horrible, just, not good. nothing new. really. another money taker. could have been good. yet, it didn't went all the way, like the first and the second. the first was not a masterpiece at all, however, it stayed true to itself. which i really can't say about this one. wait it for the DVD rip, maybe the grain will look more convincing for a tape that was made in 88.you can watch my best films list, http://www.imdb.com/list/-8Ig4rHh_Fc/enjoyHangoler</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Plumpers ahoy!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's really bad; slightly better if charged by plumper's lover's standard. The major problem with this movie is that it's a Blair Witch Cam wannabe. It came out within one decade of that instant classic and looked like it was rushed to capitalize on the fad. I didn't even know this movie existed until one day I chanced upon a Hollywood blockbuster cinema site and found a 2 star (out of 4) review of this film. The reviewer praises everything about the movie, equating it on par with Cloverfield and other shaky-cam classics, especially the absence of any musical score, except the leads. I think he might have seen an import version of the movie because of all the bad things about this movie, the CG?FX was the worst! It was in fact as crappy as seen Jackson's THE FRIGHTENERS, very 80's, very cheesy, especially in a movie about modern-day USA. Horrid. The male lead is cringe inducing. The big bad was played by an actor of high repute in his younger days and now reduced to putting on a kabuki mask making scary faces, so sad. It reminds me of Bette Davis with thick pancake makeup in What Ever Happened to Baby Jane but at least that was a classic and tour de force acting. Here is anything but that. The comic reliefs are annoying and just take up time. Don't bother with this and just stick w/ the BLAIR WITCH trilogy.</fullReview>
