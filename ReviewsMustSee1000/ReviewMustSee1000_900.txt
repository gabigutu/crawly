		<shortDescription>Lies My Butler Told Me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lies, sometimes, are an act of kindness. Many times I hasten to add. The imagination of a lonely child is ignited by a meek man in love. The man, as played by the extraordinary Ralph Richardson, is a mass of contradictions and yet we understand him. Married to a shrew and in love with Michele Morgan no less. Carol Reed is not a director that comes immediately to mind when one lists the greatest directors of all time, but in my book, is right up there with the very best. No other director has been able to bring Graham Green to the screen with its spirit so gloriously intact. Guilt and fear as riveting entertainment. Suspenseful, funny and beautiful to look at. Go try to top that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Fallen Idol: Minor Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just saw "The Fallen Idol" at the Nu-Art in West Los Angeles on the last day of its one week run, with a new crystal clear 35 mm print. The meaning of the title only becomes clear at the film's conclusion, so I won't say much more on that score. From a Graham Greene novella which I have never read, the author drafted the screenplay, so presumably the film remains faithful to Greene's perennial themes: loyalty and betrayal; faith and faithlessness; marriage and divorce. What makes these issues intriguing is that the film largely revolves around the point of view of an innocent, charming young boy called Phillipe, played to perfection by Bobby Henrey. He lives in the London embassy of a French speaking country, which is a sort of purgatory (always the Catholic themes with Greene) which is both in England and not subject to its laws. He is taken care of by a kind valet/ chef de maison called Baines (understatedly played by Ralph Richardson) and his Cruella De Ville of a wife (played as the personification of small-minded evil by Sonia Dresdel). Phillipe has no mother (she has been unwell and away for a long time), and no memory of her. Insteads, he has the run of his own Garden of Eden-the huge Embassy with its lovely views over London, great rooms and sweeping staircases. He even has his own snake- a pet that he hides behind a brick on the balcony and carries around in his pocket. He hero-worships Baines, who indulges him and talk to him and hates Mrs Baines who orders him around, hectors him and threatens him at every turn. The story of the film occurs over a week-end, where Phillippe and the Baines' are left alone in the Embassy as the ambassador has gone to bring back his wife from her convalescence, and revolves how Phillipe understands the love triangle between Mr Baines and Mrs Baines and the lovely Julie (played with cheek-bones high) by Michele Morgan, speaking both French and English.Look out for some terrific performances by the main cast (especially Bobby Henrey as Phillipe), but also by a series of supporting characters : two washerwomen, a sharp tongued lady of the night, a kindly bobby, several detectives and a perceptive doctor. The photography bears mentioning. There are shades of the "Third Man", as well as a great hide and seek game in darkness under the furniture in the empty Embassy, and a truly memorable run through the empty streets of London in the dark. From a personal point of view I enjoyed several scenes shot on location at the London Zoo, which was all very familiar even from a fifty year vantage point.The film won a British Academy award so it's not exactly undiscovered, but it's not been easy to find at revival theaters or on DVD, but it deserves to be. As I said at the top, a minor masterpiece which operates on many levels. (Los Angeles-April 2006).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Produced only a year or two before THE THIRD MAN, THE FALLEN IDOL is as good a film, and directed by the same man: Sir Carol Reed. Here we are in a claustrophobic world of an Embassy in London. The Ambassador and his wife are too busy to watch their son Phillipe (Bobby Henrey), so the boy is dropped off into the hands of the Embassy's butler Baines (Ralph Richardson). Baines' wife (Sonia Rendell) is a jealous shrew. She has reason to be jealous - Baines is having an affair with a younger woman named Julie (Michelle Morgan). Phillipe likes Baines, whom he idolizes as a strong father figure in the absence of his real father. He also likes Julie, and he dislikes Mrs. Baines. There is reason for that - in her moments of anger and jealousy she does act harshly and nastily towards Phillipe. In pursuit of proof of her husband's infidelities, Mrs. Baines goes to incredible lengths. She even stands on a dangerous ledge to watch them. But a gust of wind causes the lower part of the window to knock her legs out from underneath her, causing her to fall two stories to her death. Enter the police (Jack Hawkins, Geoffrey Keen, Bernard Lee), who are wondering how Mrs. Baines died so violently. Baines and Julie panic, and begin trying to put together a coherent story of an accident (although they know nothing about what actually happened). They have no choice but to involve Phillipe, but this is unfortunate because the little fellow knows little about creative, consistent lying. So details of Baines' relationship with Julie come out, and the police begin to wonder that this is not an accident but murder. The film is a gem because much of it is shot from the perspective of the boy. He has admired Baines as a honorable father figure, but he is increasingly worried for Baines and Julie and he is increasingly confused when, far from being advocates of honesty, they suggest he lie to assist them. The film does end with a degree of disillusionment for the little fellow, rather unusual for such films in general. But the disillusionment is a key to Greene's view of the world (Holly Martin's of his pal Harry Lime in THE THIRD MAN for instance, or Van Johnson's views of God and Deborah Kerr in the original THE END OF THE AFFAIR). It is a remarkably good film, and well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fallen Idol one of my favorites</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fallen Idol is a great film, with all actors in fine form, especially Ralph Richardson, and including the boy. Richardon is the embassy butler married to a shrewish, domineering wife. He has an illicit, albeit discreet love affair with a beautiful young embassy secretary - you can't help but feel for them both. When the shrew is found done in by a fall down the ornate embassy staircase, the wonderful gentlemen detective types enter, ever so politely, of course. Fallen Idol is an example of the best of British movie-making: low key, sympathetic, civilized. The boy's pet snake is a nice touch. A gem; a good example of the type of fine film that I wish could be made more available here. A Graham Greene story, directed by Carol Reed - what more could we want. Another great Carol Reed 'lost' film is 'Outcast of the Islands', also with Ralph Richardson.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Adult Mysteries Through A Child's Confused Eyes--and a Beautiful Camera</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Fallen Idol" builds on a classic situation of English children's literature--the lonely rich kid from overseas in the big house left with hired caregivers-- to create a masterful suspense tale that deftly examines truths and half-truths, lies and white lies from the boy's confused perspective.Based on Graham Greene's short story "The Basement Room", the film builds on the look of Hitchcock's "Rebecca", with a house as visually significant as Manderlay, plus fraught with Lillian Hellman's sophisticated view of childhood as in "These Three". Key is not just Georges Périnal's enthralling story, but the stunning direction by Carol Reed in how he uses gorgeous black and white cinematography from both a memorable interior and a London that ranges from scary night to a misleadingly bright daylight that is equally full of secrets, as seen in a new 35 MM print at NYC's Film Forum. The beautiful production design is dominated by a gorgeous staircase in the ambassador's residence that has to rank with one of the all time movie centerpieces as in "Gone With The Wind", and is as central for the first and last third of the film as the Rear Window in another Hitchcock film. Reed has the camera go up and down those heavily symbolic stairs as a shared link from the main floors that are the busy public areas, down to the basement servant quarters then up and up to the private residential areas, with overlooking balconies and windows that are key for spying on each level. The staircase sets up several dramatic events (adding layers to the film's title), climaxing in a notable scene of the incredibly tense voyage of a child's innocent-seeming paper airplane that carries a significant clue slowly, slowly traversing that vertical no-man's/everyman's land from the top to the bottom, as we hold our breath where it will land.Throughout the film, the complex world of adult relationships and interactions is seen through the eyes of a child (the wonderfully natural, lively, lisping Bobby Henrey - who now lives in Connecticut and did a Q &amp; A at the Film Forum I didn't attend) so that childish activities take on ironic or double meanings of freedom or dread, between appearances and reality, from a good night story, to a game of hide and seek, to a picnic, to running away, to an idyll at the zoo that one would assume inspired Rowling for a key scene in "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone". Throughout the film, the boy constantly misunderstands what he is seeing - sometimes he sees the truth, sometimes he doesn't, sometimes he only sees part of the truth, as the adults alternate in advising him to lie or don't lie.The young Ralph Richardson is absolutely marvelous as he switches from father substitute to hen-pecked husband (Sonia Dresdel as his wife recalls Agnes Moorhead), to relaxed lover, to efficient butler. While this new print revival is being distributed as a forgotten masterpiece, my parents vividly remembered seeing it first run in their neighborhood Brooklyn movie theater and that it was quite popular. I presume that the same team's next work on the masterpiece "The Third Man" overshadowed this gem in film history, but also perhaps because this film doesn't end on quite the cynicism that a contemporary audience expects from their work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an excellent adaptation of the Graham Greene novella. Richardson's performance is incredible, and the relationship between Philippe and the butler is the centerpiece of the film.I sometimes wonder if this film would have been more successful with a different title. IMHO "The Fallen Idol" suggests a Saturday matinee shlockfest or a pretentious drawing room comedy.This is a good companion piece to another Graham Greene novella -- also directed by Reed -- the Third Man, which is just possibly the greatest film of all time...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh what a tangled web we weave...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm amazed at the time of writing this, there are only 33 comments and 1700 votes. How is it that more people haven't seen this movie.Another classic pairing of Directot Carol Reed with Writer Graham Greene - who would later go on to even more success with their collaboration in "The Third Man". While I wouldn't rate this movie quite as high as TTM, it is very good film in its own right.This is a tale as seen from a child's eyes in a very grown-up world with very adult issues. This is captured superbly in the cinematography that uses low angles at child height and looking up. This is also a story of secrets and lies - and so the camera is very effective in changing shots and angles to always give them impression that others are spying or eavesdropping. This is also conveyed very effectively with the set - which is filmed substantially withing the Embassy residence which is a huge, lavish mansion. It has many levels and staircases - none so impressive as the ornate, curving main staircase. The camera also makes good use of close-ups and wide angle shots. Often times, movies with stick with one or the other. I think it helped keep it interesting.The characters were all well cast. I especially liked Ralph Richardson as the butler whom the boy, Phillipe (Bobby Henry), idolizes. Richardson has just the right balance of decorum and warmth to make you understand why the boy, who is starved for attention, follows after him. He has a very smooth speaking voice that is pleasant to listen to. He reminds me a lot of Kevin Spacey in his appearance and demeanor (especially in "Pay it Forward"). I think the director did a great job of eliciting a good performance out of the then 8 year old Henry. I heard that the director's secret was not to have the child respond to an actors lines - but to que the child himself in a different take. I think the precociousness and spontaneity of the child were captured quite well with this.There are quite a few memorable scenes - hide and seek in the dark, cavernous mansion; the boy running through the dark London streets with all the alleys, archways, wet streets and glowing lanterns; the paper airplane flying from the upper balcony and circling all the way down, slowly, to land at a detectives feet; the detective questioning Baines at the top of the stairs, all the while the tilted window is visible in the background. The music changes pace with the story, and at times it was frantic and frenetic to match the suspense and fear of the story. I felt it was used quite effectively.The story addresses themes of loneliness, betrayal, secrecy, lies, and loss of innocence in a plot that kept my interest from beginning to end. My only complaint is that at times the dialogue was difficult to understand with the clip, British accents. I wish this had been offered in closed captions so I could catch some missed conversations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A magnificent film, directed by Carol Reed and written by Graham Greene</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Phillipe, the 8-year-old son of the ambassador, bored and lonely, has been left in the charge of Baines, the embassy butler, and his wife. The ambassador has gone to bring back his wife, who has been ill for several months. Phillipe (Bobby Henrey) idolizes Baines (Ralph Richardson), who talks to him, tells him stories, takes him for walks and pays attention to him. Baines' wife (Sonia Dresdel), however, is a shrew. She has little patience for Phillipe, she runs the housekeeping side of the embassy with an iron hand, and she is unshakeable in her commitment to the cold, loveless marriage she has with her husband. She doesn't know, quite yet, that Baines and Julie (Michele Morgan), a secretary in the embassy, have been meeting secretly each week for months, just for tea or a private walk. They love each other but seem to find no way to break free of his marriage. And then Mrs. Baines, after an hysterical argument when she discovers Julie, is found dead at the foot of the grand stairway in the embassy. Phillipe thinks Baines killed her and is determined to protect him. His lies make things much, much worse. This is a marvelous film, full of irony and subtlety. Phillipe is too young to grasp the meaning of much of what he sees and hears. He unexpectedly interrupts a meeting between Baines and Julie in a tea shop. She is telling Baines she will be leaving; that their relationship is hopeless. Baines is trying to find someway for her to stay, if even for just a day or two more. Suddenly there is Phillipe, happy to find Baines, climbing onto a seat next to them, having a pastry, observing what Baines and Julie are saying to each other so quietly and intensely, and believing when Baines says they are talking about a friend and that Julie is his niece. Something is happening, he knows, but he simply doesn't register how desperately they want to talk to each other without pretense. Phillipe tells fibs, especially to protect McGregor, his small pet snake, from Mrs. Baines' anger. When she accuses him of telling lies, Baines tries to protect Phillipe by saying that there are lies and there are lies...that some lies can simply be a kindness to protect others. Mrs. Baines finds ways to trap Phillipe into admitting he met Baines' "niece." When she dies, Baines tries to find ways to use lies...or at least not the full truth...to protect Julie. Phillipe lies to the police in an effort to protect Baines. The conclusion of the film is a masterpiece of amusing irony when we realize the truth might be more dangerous to Baines that Phillipe's lies. Carol Reed directed The Fallen Idol in 1948. The year before he gave us Odd Man Out. In 1949 came The Third Man. Then Outcast of the Islands in 1952. That's four incredible films, one right after the other. And don't forget Our Man in Havana in 1959. The Fallen Idol, The Third Man and Our Man in Havana were collaborations with Graham Greene. These movies are not just literate and often amusing, they're thoughtful and often uneasy. And all are stunning to look at. The Fallen Idol gives us two great performances, or rather one great performance and one performance great despite itself. Ralph Richardson as Baines is as understated as the character. We're witnessing a character full of emotion and longing, yet so carefully proper and repressed it hurts. Baines relationship with Phillipe is genuine, yet in many ways it's based on lies and made-up stories. This is one of Richardson's best performances. As Phillipe, Bobby Henrey does a masterful job, but that's because of the patience and skill of Carol Reed and the cleverness of the film editor. Henrey was a nonprofessional who got the part because Reed thought he looked exactly like the kind of young boy Phillipe would look like. As a person who worked on the film with Reed said later, Henrey couldn't act and "had an attention span of a demented flea." Reed took infinite pains to gain Henrey's friendship and confidence. He would walk the boy through the part, usually standing in for Richardson when Richardson would have been off camera feeding Henrey lines. He shot miles of film with Henrey, and then spliced the bits and pieces together into coherent reaction shots. You'll note that Henrey has almost no scenes that go for more than a word or sentence before there are cutaways. Even so, the result is a great film portrayal of a little boy, Phillipe, who can be irritating, impatient and willful, and yet touching in his determination protect his friend, Baines.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has almost been forgotten and isn't available on DVD. It was produced the year before the same principals (Graham Greene and Carol Reed) made The Third Man and delves into some classic Greene themes.The POV is told almost completely through the eyes of a boy who wants to protect his beloved friend and butler Baines. In the process, he almost ensures that Baines will be charged with murder.It's wonderfully staged so that the boy gets to witness all kinds of adult stuff, but doesn't completely understand what he's seen.Ralph Richardson is great as Baines and there is genuine suspense in whether the boy will tell the truth or lie and whether either will help his friend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Fallen Idol (AKA: The Lost Illusion) is directed by Carol Reed and adapted to a screenplay by Graham Green from his own short story called The Basement Room. Additional dialogue was scripted by Lesley Storm and William Templeton, the music is by William Alwyn and Georges Périnal is the cinematographer. It stars Ralph Richardson, Bobby Henrey, Mich?le Morgan, Sonia Dresdel and Denis O'Dea.Film is told thru the eyes of Phillipe (Henrey), the young son of a diplomat living at the French Embassy in London. With his parents often away from home, Phillipe has latched onto the family butler, Baines (Richardson), for friendship and guidance. Baines regales the boy with fanciful tales of adventure, but in truth Baines himself is unhappy, stuck in a loveless marriage to the shrewish Mrs. Baines (Dresdel). When Bobby happens upon Baines in the company of a young woman named Julie (Morgan), it thrusts the youngster into a world he doesn't understand, and when a tragedy occurs, Bobby is in danger of shattering the friendship between Baines and himself.The first of Graham Greene's literary works to be directed by the great Carol Reed, The Fallen Idol took some time to come out of The Third Man's shadow and be heralded in its own right. What transpires over 95 minutes is a tight psychological thriller that leaves a lasting image of childhood confusion, disillusionments and the innocence that's lost. Throw into the mix adult secrets, human conundrums and a gripping mystery investigation at its peak, and it's not hard to see why it's such a well revered picture. It's also a film that thrives on dialogue, again not surprising given that Green himself always said it was the best film adaptation of his work, while some of the deep-focus photography from Périnal adds real atmosphere to the proceedings. Richardson is superb, and he leads a hugely effective cast, where Dresdel is scarily witch like and Henrey, plucked from nowhere to star as the naive boy, paints an indelible portrait of a child struggling to comprehend the mysterious world of the adults around him. In support there is quality thespians such as Bernard Lee and Jack Hawkins. The ending is notably different to that in the original story, and no doubt about it, the original ending would have garnered a different reaction from many. But Greene was happy to change his own source for the screen, so if it's good enough for him then it surely is good enough for us? Certainly time has been kind to The Fallen Idol, it's Hitchcockian feel blended with literary smarts has made it a lasting favourite of critics and fans alike. 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little boy thinks the butler did it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A little boy (Bobby Henry) thinks he saw a murder in "The Fallen Idol," a 1948 film directed by Carol Reed from a Graham Greene screenplay. You really can't get much better than that.Phillipe is the son of the French ambassador to England and his good buddy in the large place where they live is the butler Baines (Ralph Richardson). Baines and his shrew of a wife (Sonia Dresdel) run the place, and the action takes place while both the ambassador and his wife are away. Being an only child, Phillipe has a vivid imagination and is also very attached to Baines, whom he follows one day to a coffee shop. There, Baines is in deep conversation with a woman he introduces as his niece Julie (Michelle Morgan). In actuality, she's his girlfriend, and she and Baines are discussing whether or not he can get a divorce from his wife. When Mrs. Baines leaves to visit her aunt, Julie comes over to the house to spend time with Baines and Phillipe. Just one small problem - Mrs. B knows something is up and is still in the house. When she winds up dead at the bottom of the stairs, Baines falls under suspicion, and Phillipe is afraid Baines killed her.This is a beautifully crafted film about the mind of a child and about secrets and lies. Baines tells Phillipe secrets and lies, Julie tells Phillipe secrets, Mrs. Baines tells Phillipe secrets, Phillipe can't keep a secret, so lies ensue. When the inspector (Jack Hawkins) shows up, it becomes exhausting all around.One of the biggest stars of the film is the camera, which takes us down a London street as a little boy runs in the dark and rain; up a long staircase; through a game of hide and seek with covered furniture; the boy's view of the busy household; and most especially the precious final shot.The magnificent Ralph Richardson portrays the complex Baines perfectly - unhappily married, in love with the beautiful Julie, afraid of his nasty wife, efficient at his job and fond of Phillipe, who is at this point clearly in the way. Michelle Morgan is believable as Julie, a kind young woman - these aren't two nasty, conniving people, just two people in love who don't know whether to go forward or separate. Bobby Henry is an excellent Phillipe. He's not sweet and adorable, but we don't want Mrs. Baines to be mean to him; he blows every secret all to hell and doesn't lie very well; he shows up at inappropriate moments; he makes the wrong assumptions - but we feel for his terror and confusion. If he'd been cute, it would have made Baines and Julie seem more exploitive than they were. It also would have made Mrs. Baines seem even meaner - but she's mean enough.One of the best films to come out of British cinema, and more proof of the greatness of Carol Reed. A must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Shortly after watching director Carol Reed's very good,but sadly overlooked 1939 Pre-Code film A Girl Must Live,a fellow IMDb'er asked me if I had seen Reed's 1948 Film Noir The Fallen Idol.Despite the title being one of my dad's all time favourite films,and Reed's classic Spiv Film Noir The Third Man,and his high-kicking musical Oliver being two titles that I had greatly enjoyed,I had somehow never gotten around to taking a look at The Fallen Idol,which led to me putting the title at the top of my "must buy" list.A week later:Opening an unexpected parcel that had arrived earlier in the day,I was shocked to discover,that a very kind IMDb'er had sent me a surprise parcel containing not one,but two Carol Reed titles!,which led to me excitingly getting ready to at last witness the fall of an idol.The plot:Finding Phillipe being left on his own in the French embassy,as his parents go on a short holiday,loyal butler Baines decides to cheer Phillipe up,by telling him wild,made up stories,about his adventures in Africa.Looking less than amused at her husbands wild tales,and also not being particularly happy about Phillipe keeping a pet snake hidden,Mrs.Baines tells her husband that he should not be encouraging Phillipe with his crazy stories.Going past one of the main windows in the embassy a few days later,Phillipe notices Baines sitting in a near by café with a woman who is not his wife.Sneking out of the embassy,Phillipe rushes to the café,where he discovers Baines talking to a woman called Julie.With having a deep desire to see Julie, (who he has been having a long- term secret affair with) one last time before she has to go back to France,Baines invites Phillipe to come along with him and his "close friend" Julie to a trip to the zoo.Returning to the embassy later that night, (with Julie quietly creeping in,so as to not raise the attention of Mrs.Baines)Phillipe soon discovers that Baines new "friendship" will soon lead to him witnessing the horrifying sight,of his idol falling from grace.View on the film:Limiting any sense of genuine cheer to the oddly up-beat scored ending in his adaptation of his own short story The Basement Room,co-writer (along with Lesley Storm and William Templeton) Graham Greene gradually builds an unsettling Film Noir world,whose inhabitants turn out to be much different than they originally appeared.Keeping the plot based from a child's point of view,the writer's show Phillipe's "innocent" outlook on the adults to be one that is rotted away by the adults,with Philipe discovering,that instead of joy and optimism,the fractured face of the adults hide the dark shadows of deceit,dissolution,mistrust,and possibly,even murder.Fully displaying the low-lit world that Phillipe's embassy is enclosed in,director Carol Reed and cinematography Georges Perinal expertly use high-angle to show the darkness that surrounds the people in Philipe's life,from a height that Phillipe will never be able to reach.Along with the stylish high-angles,Reed also works closely with editor Oswald Hafenrichter to give the "fall" of Phillipe and "the idol" a tremendously gripping tension,with Reed using Hafenricter's snappy editing to show that a "murder" may not be what it originally appears to be.Despite being a bit of a pain to work with on set, (although this would not stop Reed from working with child actors in the future)Bobby Henrey gives an excellent performance as Phillipe,with Phillipe never being allowed to become a sickly-sweet character,thanks to Henrey showing Philipe's smile to slowly fade away as the "true" faces of the adults are revealed,which leads to Philipe's smile being replaced by a strong sense,of anger,confusion and disbelief.Joining Henrey,and backed by a wonderful supporting cast which includes a charmingly gruff Bernard Lee,Ralph Richardson gives an amazing performance as Baines,with Richardson complementing Henrey's performance by showing Baines to be someone who is deeply humble,but is also unable to stop the deadly mist which is stopping any light from entering his life,which Baines soon discovers stops him saving the fall of an "idol",that leads to Phillipe's childhood innocence being permanently decayed from the fallen idol.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Low-Key Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Was there ever a more civilized treatment of infidelity than this British suspenser. Ralph Richardson's butler Baines is the very last word in polished civility and stiff upper lip no matter how extreme the provocation. Yet he's so unfailingly kind and considerate to the boy Phillipe that he's among the most admirable of transgressors. The bond between the lonely son of the French ambassador and the hen-pecked English butler is memorably touching and the emotional heart of the film.Director Carol Reed has basically a single set to work with. But it's a great one with the sweeping staircase, high domed ceiling, and checkerboard tiles, all keeping the eye entertained at the same time the sinister events unfold. Those events are driven by poor Sonia Dresdel who has the thankless role of the cruel wife and housekeeper Mrs. Baines that she plays to the hilt. You just know from the start that Phillipe's pet garter snake, MacGregor, is doomed in her bleak household. In fact, the screenplay has loaded the deck by making her such an unsympathetic figure. Who can blame Baines for his covert rendezvous with the lovely Julie (Michelle Morgan) when his shrewish wife remains in the empty embassy waiting to pounce.What really distinguishes the movie is its skill at viewing adult actions through the eyes of the child. Thus, instead of a conventional two-shot close-up of Baines and Julie in intimate conversation, Reed gives us a three-shot from the perspective of Phillipe as he watches them. We may know what's up with them, but we also share the boy's puzzlement over a world he has yet to grow into. We share that perspective throughout, which is not only an unusual one, but visually reinforces the touching bond between the child of the elite and the highly polished commoner. It also turns the emotional climax (not the dramatic) into a memorably revealing one-- a rite of passage, as it were.Anyway, in my little book, the movie qualifies as a genuine classic, placing Carol Reed in the same Pantheon as contemporary British masters Hitchcock and Michael Powell. Once you see it, you don't forget it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sir Carol Reed, neglected genius</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the great directors of film are named these days, the incomparable Carol Reed is rarely mentioned. He has been completely surpassed in the public esteem by his British contemporary David Lean. After the success of Reed's English films, a period which began in 1940 with the coal-mining film "The Stars Look Down" and ended with "The Outcast of the Islands" in 1954, the director was discovered by the big Hollywood studios; he went on to direct a number of big-budgeted Technicolor international productions ?-"Olivier," "The Agony and the Ecstasy," and "Trapeze"?all of which he handled with consummate professionalism, but somehow their box-office success unfairly diminished his reputation with the critics. He is perhaps best remembered today for "The Third Man," which many people erroneously think Orson Welles directed. Although Reed's early films were shot in London films studios and on location all around the word, they remain quintessentially British in understated mood and attack --B&amp;W films made in collaboration with the best expatriate talent that had gathered in London during the war years. ("The Fallen Idol" is photographed by the French cinematographer Perinal, the Jugoslavian editor Hafenrichter, and the Hungarian set designer Vincent Korda.) Reed at his best has the unique ability to portray the most complex of human relationships with voices lowered; witness how masterfully he directs the detectives and suspects in the final reels of this superb film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Baines and his wife work for the French Ambassador in London, and they don't get along. Baines is thinking of ending the relationship, and he's already started an affair with the beautiful Julie (who kept reminding me of Faye Dunaway...must be the cheekbones). Into this triangle intrudes the young Philippe, son of the ambassador, who can't stop asking questions, and also can't keep a secret. When Mrs. Baines dies, Philippe inadvertently helps the finger of accusation point solidly at his pal Baines.This film is beautifully shot, with fine exteriors and ornate interiors. My two favorite sequences were the "games in the dark," featuring odd camera placements, angles, and lighting effects, and the tense "paper airplane" flight, in which a key piece of evidence whirls round and round the policemen investigating the crime. All the main characters turn in bravura performances, and the script by Graham Greene has no dull moments. (In today's world, however, police would never get away with interrogating a small child without much more control and intervention.)The very ending is a bit anti-climactic, but all loose ends are tied up satisfactorily. The final joke comes when Philippe's mother arrives in in the last few seconds, calls out "viens vite!" (come quickly) to Philippe...and he starts down the marble staircase VERY SLOWLY. (You'll understand after you've watched the film.) A solid combination of script, acting, and directing makes FALLEN IDOL a captivating way to spend an evening.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let us not compare "The Fallen Idon" to its successor, "The Third Man," that bar is just too high. However, in it one can see delicious photography, especially at night, that foretells what we see later in the TTM. Idol starts slow and builds to an emotional crescendo as the film comes to an end, whereas TTM keeps the tension high throughout and deflates at the end.The biggest weakness is casting which seems a bit spotty. While it is hard to keep ones eyes off Bobby Henrey as Phillipe, Jack Hawkins is a credible police detective, and Ralph Richardson brings exactly the right balance to the film, there are some other questionable assignments. Sure, Michele Morgan in gorgeous but is she credible as a secretary from the Embassy steno pool and presumptive lover of the Embassy butler? One thinks not. Someone as glamorous (and bi-lingual) as that in post-war London would have been sipping champagne in the Savoy Grill rather than hanging out in some down-at-the-heels neighborhood tea shoppe with the butler. Give me a break. While such a liaison would have been believable, it would have to have a different, and far less "out there" actress playing the part to get my buy-in.Also, it would have been nice if Mr. Reed had called upon one of his favorite actors, James Mason, to play the role of the police Inspector. But presumably, Mr. Mason was chasing the big bucks filming "Caught" in the States at the time and was therefore not available. Pity, because instead we get Denis O'Dea playing James Mason playing the Inspector which somehow does not work quite as well as it might have.The plot hinges on the unfortunate credibility adults invest in the child observer. Children are notoriously unreliable witnesses especially when subjected to the stresses like those of police interviews. On the other hand, the mob in "The Third Man" all too readily accepts the porter's child fingering of Holly Martins as the perpetrator. One would hope this only happens in the movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lesser known but still poignant Reed/Greene work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like The Third Man, this film is directed by Carol Reed and written by Graham Greene. Unlike Third Man, it doesn't have Orson Welles... just kiddin', that doesn't matter so much. It's a unique story where the Butler DIDN'T Do It, but everyone thinks he did, helped along by a cute little boy named Phil who cries wolf. Once everything begins to get straightened out and Phil learns not to lie, it's too late and nobody believes him, which is ironic anyway because at that point had he told the truth things would have gotten complicated again.Carol Reed is up to his cinematic tricks as he shows the majority of the action through little Phil's eyes, sometimes precipitated along an architectural edge and sometimes surprisingly balanced while discord and imbalance occurs among the characters. The cinematography does wonders to the area of the embassy, turning it into everything from a domestic area to a playground to a horrific fun-house to, eventually, a crime scene.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Child's View of the World</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the first moments you are a part of Phillipe's world as he peers through the staircase at his idol, Baines, and the hustle and bustle of people on the move. His parents have gone away for a couple of days and he is left in the charge of housekeeper, she-devil Mrs. Baines, who is as malevolent as her husband is kindly. I do love this film but hadn't been prompted to write a review until I read several comments about how "irritating" the little boy, Bobby Henrey appeared. I was so surprised. I didn't think he was annoying at all. Carol Reed may have despaired at having to direct him, apparently he had a very short attention span and in order to maintain his look of wonder Reed would position grips and electricians (people who had befriended the child) just out of camera range to keep him focused. I thought Henrey embodied the age of wonder, where everything was truth and beautiful. In fact his whole personality is what gives the movie the intensity and tension.He is a lonely little boy whose only friends are a little snake, McGregor, which he keeps in a loose brick in the wall and Baines who treats him to winks and funny dances when no one is looking. But Baines (the outstanding Ralph Richardson) has his own dramas, he is in love with Julie (Michelle Morgan), a secretary at the Embassy, and desperately wants to divorce his wife whose jealousy and vindictiveness comes out in her handling of Phillipe. Yes, Phillipe can be tiresome - in the scene where he finds Baines and Julie at a cafe (Baines had been barred, by his wife, from taking Phillipe for a walk) and won't leave them alone, but isn't that what most little kids would be like. I felt a lot of sympathy for the little boy - at a zoo outing he is mostly ignored and ends up dejectedly feeding the birds. He is drawn into the lies that Baines has woven for him, whether it is the "secret" of Baines meeting his "niece", to tall tales of derring do Baines weaves around his pistol.When Mrs. Baines accidentally falls to her death, Phillipe, who saw the struggle at the top of the stairs, then her lying motionless at the bottom (he missed in between that showed it was an accident and Baines wasn't even there) like a true friend, is determined to prove Baines is innocent. It is Phillipe's irritating behaviour that has the film on a knife edge of intensity. Drowning in all the secrets and lies Phillipe decides to lie to the police and as Baines tells the truth (that he and his wife had words because she attacked the boy) Phillip's subterfuge places more and more suspicion on Baines. The Chief of Police uses wheedling methods to trip the little boy up, only Jack Hawkins as the solidly straight forward detective is the movie's breath of fresh air. There seems to be a huge sigh of relief when Phillipe is roughly pushed onto a chair and told to be quiet.Again it is when Phillip is out of the room (being given a lecture by Julie that he has to start telling the truth) that the police see the open window and realise the woman had been trying to get to Julie and slipped over the stairs. For the last five minutes the stress and suspense is now created by the little boy who now wants to tell the truth. "I've got something to tell you", "Please listen", "why won't you hear me" - all said in this thin, piping voice makes for very suspenseful viewing and the very end scene, when his mother (actually Henrey's real mother) calls "Phillipe" you know his life and personality have changed forever.Highly Recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bobby Henrey's performance is outstanding!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't wish to duplicate other members synopses of the storyline of this wonderful, classic film, but I would like to say something about the performance of the then eight years old Bobby Henrey as Phillipe and how crucial he was to Carol Reed's realisation of The Fallen Idol. Bobby's parents were writers and he had initially been chosen to star in the film both for his looks when Reed had seen a photograph of him peering out of the window of his London apartment on the dust jacket of one of his parents books and because he was bi-lingual, having spent his early childhood in both France and England and spoke English with a French accent, which was called for in the script. Bobby had never acted before, but Reed, a man of infinite patience where children and child actors were concerned, persevered with him over an incredible shooting schedule of five months (a long time for those days) shooting numerous takes of every scene involving the boy and his dialogue, which paid off handsomely, as he managed to coax out of him the most incredible and natural performance by a child actor ever seen on the screen and certainly not bettered since.No better example of all this can be found than in the scene where Philippe is convinced that Baines, his only friend whom he idolises, is going to be sent to the gallows for a murder he did not commit. At this point, he realises just how much he adores and loves Baines and that he cannot live without him. With all the passion in his heart and soul, Phillipe pleads with the police to listen to him as he finally decides to tell the truth about what happened in the hope that this will save his friend: "Oh, please, you must listen to me! I have something to tell you! Oh, please listen to me! Oh, please! Please listen to me! You have to listen to me! You must listen to me! It will only take a moment and it will put everything right." But the police completely ignore him. This scene is so gut-wrenchingly heart-breaking, that it's almost too upsetting to watch and you become totally involved in it and feel very deeply for this increasingly desperate little boy. It is an incredible performance that is so perfect, it has to be seen to be believed. I cannot recommend this film highly enough. It is one of the finest films ever made in the history of the cinema.</fullReview>

Its a movie that could not have been made here since the censors and right wing hacks would have cut it up left and right. Aside from the great acting, direction, and cinematography is dialog that is so perceptive, witty, and tinged with sarcasm, yet still fresh and amazing after more than six decades. Some examples: --after being told he cannot go for a walk, the boy whispers to Ms. Baines: "I hate you." Then won't apologize, and when sent to his room states: "I don't care". --when he laments the death of his snake and proposes a tombstone heading: "Maacgregor, killed by Mrs. Baines. (pause) And the date." --the prostitute on finding out that the boy is the son of the ambassador: "Oh, I know your daddy."And the vivid scenes of London then, with little traffic, horse drawn wagons, noir streets; the embassy as a great haunted Gothic symbolic universe.

		<shortDescription>An intelligent film better for being told from a child's view</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An intelligent film from Carol Reed and Graham Greene, starring Ralph Richardson as the butler in the French embassy in London. The screenplay by Greene is based on his short story "The Basement Room," and the script is excellent, requiring some attention to catch all the details that are later lied about.The gist of the story is that young Phillipe (Bobby Henrey) is the only, lonely child of the ambassador, and he's taken under the wing of Baines, the embassy's butler. Baines fills the impressionable youngster with tall tales of derring do and shootings in the wilds of Africa. Phillipe adores Baines. Mrs. Baines (Sonia Dresdel), however, is a harridan and our villainess, requiring strict behavior from her ward.The problem is that Baines's tall tales take on a sinister aspect as we find out more about him and his relationship with his "niece." Baines is discovered by Phillipe who has no clue; at Baines's request, Phillipe agrees to keep the knowledge of the niece's existence secret. Based on the short story, I believe the boy is seven, but the actor was nine when the movie was made. In either event, Phillipe is no match for Mrs. Baines nor any other adult, so his attempt to keep his secrets are soon found out, and his attempts to protect Baines are branded as lies.Mrs. Baines, of course, meets her end in an accidental fall from a window ledge. However, it appears that Baines pushed her down the stairs, and the police are called to investigate. Phillipe lies to protect Baines, and the police soon find out about the niece and other goings on, which exposes Phillipe as a liar. It turns out that had everyone told the truth from the beginning, the suspicions would not have been aroused.Graham Greene is an excellent author, and I recommend his works. Since this is a Greene script, there are many turns of expectations and many amusing moments that are snuck in to take us unawares. (My favorite line: "Oh! I know your father, dear!") What makes this movie really work is the ending. Phillipe finally decides to tell the truth, but by doing so, he'll destroy Baines, although he doesn't know it. His attempts to get the police to listen to him are both tense and funny. It's a great ending to the movie. Greene also gets lots of characters in the movie in small parts; watch (and listen) for the charwomen and the clock winder. It's all very British.The movie was made in 1948 by the director of "The Third Man," which premiered the following year. Unlike Harry Lime's Vienna, Phillipe's London is untouched by war and corruption. (Both movies were scripted by Graham Greene and had two of the Korda brothers on the crew.) The camera work is great, and we get a wonderful view of (I think) Belgravia from the upper floors of the embassy. The movie is subtle, and attention is rewarded. The themes are adult, and the use of the child for perspective makes the movie work much better than a straight telling of an affair of the heart.The short story is considerably different from the film, and I recommend reading it after you've seen the movie. It's freely available online if you search for "The Basement Room." Phillipe has a much darker side in the story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>more trademark Graham Greene ambiguity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before they made 'The Third Man', director Carol Reed and screenwriter Graham Greene collaborated on this mild-mannered suspense story, in which a precocious young boy's devotion to one of his father's servants is tested after he witnesses what appears to be his long-suffering idol pushing his wicked wife to her death down a flight of stairs. An investigation follows, but the film isn't really a mystery since the audience already knows more about what happened than any of the characters on screen. Truth will prevail, although the outcome is ambiguous: the police set matters straight, but they do so from a clue that has no connection to the suspected crime. If the film appears dated today it's only because they don't often make them of this high caliber anymore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Carol Reed and Graham Green combine talents</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a screenplay by Graham Green and direction by Carol Reed, this movie from 1948 is a throwback to the best of British cinema. The main cast of Ralph Richardson, Michele Morgan, Sonia Dresdel and Bobby Henrey is exceptional as are Jack Hawkins and Barry Fitzgerald in supporting roles.The movie involves the young son of the French ambassador as well as the butler, his lover and his wife. The child has a vivid imagination and soaks in everything that is going on around him. Seemingly advanced for his age, he is still a child. He dotes on the butler (named Baines) and one day runs into him in the company of his "lady-friend", the beautiful Michele Morgan (a French actress) who, from what I can tell, is still living. The butler tells the boy that the woman is his niece. This information is filed away with other things that occupy the mind of a small child, including his secret friendship with a pet snake.When Mrs. Baines accidentally falls to her death in the presence of her husband, the boy's story comes back to haunt Baines, who is later confronted by the police. The boy is full of information but cannot put it into the correct context. At the end, he realizes the impact his words can have but the police who are at first interested in his version of events, are no longer listening.This movie is punctuated by the perspective of a boy playing around the embassy, the secret meetings between Baines and his friend, and the conflict between Mrs.Baines and the child over the pet snake. Some of the film is on location in London at a time (1948) when cars seemed infrequent and horse-drawn carriages still part of daily life. This background gives the movie some of its atmosphere as does the darkened embassy when Mrs. Baines returns to find her husband with the "other woman". The movie is well worth watching 60 years on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an intelligent drama-thriller with some wonderful Hitchcockian moments (the paper dart, a clock that has to be wound-up at the most inappropriate time) and themes (the difference between appearances and actual facts, a man's struggle to prove his innocence although all the indications of guilt point at him), and also a good study of how different a kid's perception of the adult world can be. The pacing is a little sluggish, however, and the child actor they chose for the part is not really the best they could've come up with. Ralph Richardson, on the other hand, is excellent. And you may be surprised to know that Guy Hamilton, the future director of many Bond films, was the assistant director here. (***)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For awhile, 'The Fallen Idol" was part of the Criterion Collection but according to what I've read, the rights have now been acquired by Lionsgate. Be that as it may, any film that ends up as part of the Criterion Collection (even for a short while) is supposed to be considered a highly rated 'art' film, if not a 'masterpiece.' Certainly the film has things going for it including some wonderful noirish cinematography, Director Carol Reed's remarkable coaching job of a child actor, solid acting performances on the part of the adult actors and haunting on-location shots in 1948 London.Despite the classy 'look' of the film, the screenplay itself is weak and as a result, I relegate the whole affair to the pantheon of 'B' melodrama. The weakest aspect of the film is obvious: the character of Mrs. Baines, who is just such a vapid, unlikeable martinet who would have been probably diagnosed as bipolar if she were alive today. And is Mr. Baines much better a character than the evil Mrs.? What exactly do we find out about the wily butler besides the back story that he killed a black man while he was living in Africa before working at the Embassy? As it turns out, that's just a tall tale Baines has made up to impress Phillipe. Otherwise, Baines spends most of his time trying to convince Phillipe to keep his mouth shut so that no one finds out about his affair with Julie, an Embassy employee who works in the steno pool.I suppose it was very progressive of director Reed to hold up Baines and Julie as 'the good guys' despite the fact that they were having an affair (Reed himself was the product of an illegitimate union). But why should we hold them in such high esteem? Just because they're the victims of the unreasonable Mrs. Baines? I appreciate the fact that Baines wins points because he's kind to Phillipe but really that's all we know about him. And as far as Julie is concerned?to my mind, she's seems to be a complete empty vessel.In watching the documentary about director Reed as part of the DVD 'supplement', we learn that he was master in extracting wonderful performances from the child actors he worked with during his long career. The case of Bobby Henrey who played Phillipe was no exception. Henrey reportedly could never sit still and eventually Reed had to hire a magician to perform tricks for the boy in order to keep his attention. Reed expertly brings out the child's confusion as he misunderstands the reason for Mrs. Baines' death which leads to Baines being placed in jeopardy (the child believes that Baines 'murdered' his wife after confusing that event with Baines' tall tale which initially the butler appeared to communicate as a 'murder' but later clarifying it as 'self defense').The rest of "Fallen Idol" involves the rather stodgy police investigation into Mrs. Baines' death. Will the boy gum things up despite attempting to cover for the butler at every turn? Since he's just a kid, he's unable to cover up the discrepancies in Baines and Julies' story and after they're found out, Baines is on the verge of suicide. Fortunately an eagle eyed cop comes upon Mrs. Baines' footprint next to the window where she fell; this of course ends up exonerating the happy (or shall we say semi-happy) couple. I believe that the original ending from the book the film was based on, was Baines doing himself in, and some internet posters would prefer the more unpleasant denouement. I was actually pleased that the films' scenarists changed the ending to a happy one as the thought of having that child experience such an awful event as suicide would have ruined the picture for me.If there is a moral in this story, it's probably 'always be honest' because Baines and Julies' decision not to tell the truth almost led to their arrest and complete downfall. Despite the fact they prevail in the end, I would have much preferred that Phillipe had a direct hand in saving them. As it turned out, it was pure coincidence that saved Baines from the hangman's noose and not little Phillipe who will only be remembered for not being able to keep his big mouth shut.Like Hitchcock, The Fallen Idol is concerned with an innocent man being unjustly accused. Unlike Hitchcock, the characters of The Fallen Idol have little or no ambiguity. And when the protagonist is finally saved, it's not from his own exciting efforts or efforts on the part of a valuable ally (in this case, a nine year old boy) but from a slow-paced, pedestrian police investigation. Where was Hitchcock when you needed him?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Some lies are just kindness"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Fallen Idol (1948)' was adapted, with a few changes, by Graham Greene from his novella "The Basement Room." Greene himself supported most of these alterations, including a plot reworking that saw young Phillipe condemning the innocent Baines through well-meaning if misguided lies, as opposed to the novella, in which a guilty Baines is betrayed by Phillipe's inability to keep secrets. One change of which the author did not approve was that of the title. I must differ with Greene on that point; I find "The Fallen Idol" to rather beautifully suggest the erosion of Phillipe's childish trust in the father-like Baines. The general theme of a man condemned by another's love was explored in a subsequent Carol Reed drama, 'The Man Between (1953),' in which James Mason is trailed to the West German border by an adoring child.'The Fallen Idol' was the first of three collaborations between Greene and Reed (the other two being 'Our Man in Havana (1958)' and the legendary 'The Third Man (1949)'). Here, many of the pair's trademarks are apparent. Certainly, Reed's favoured camera tilt makes several appearances, though rarely as eccentric as those in 'The Third Man.' For a moment, the film's ending looked to be treading in similar waters to the American noir 'They Won't Believe Me (1947),' and I had chills at the prospect of Baines committing suicide moments before his exoneration. That the ending doesn't follow through on this threat didn't feel at all like a forced happy ending; I genuinely felt relieved at Baines' survival.The performances in the film are mostly impressive, particularly Ralph Richardson, who gradually reveals the flaws in his character, and Sonia Dresdel, as the nasty Mrs Baines who arguably gets what she deserves. French actress Mich?le Morgan reminded me of Ingrid Bergman, and perhaps it's no surprise that she had previously starred opposite Bogart, Rains, Greenstreet and Lorre in 'Passage to Marseilles (1944).' Bobby Henrey, by all accounts a very difficult child actor to work with, does a good job of appearing a well- meaning nuisance, but the final scene, with his consistent and perplexing "please sir, please sir, please sir" whining was like fingernails down a blackboard.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Outstanding film of love, suspense, jealousy, rage, guilt, justice, and the uncomprehending nature of pre-pubescent boys.And what a cast. Ralph Richardson is the butler in the French embassy in London. The Ambassador's family takes off for a brief vacation, leaving the mansion to Richardson and his wife, and leaving them in custody of their young boy, Bobby Henrey. This must give Richardson a great deal of pleasure.Also giving Richardson a great deal of pleasure is his ongoing affair with the foxy featured blond Michelle Morgan, the embassy's typist. After all, Richardson isn't getting along with his wife for reasons that the script perhaps makes a little too obvious. She's practically bipolar.Richardson and Henrey get along very well though. The butler spins out long yarns involving lions in Africa and killing a Mau Mau leader in self defense. But then Richardson lies to him all the time, partly to entertain the child and partly to conceal from him the affair with Morgan, who, he tells the kid, is his "niece." Henrey, however, lacking the skill at deception that an adult would have, spills the beans to Richardson's wife, who goes berserk, whacks the kid around, has a violent confrontation with her husband, and, while trying to peek into the bedroom, slips from an overhead ledge in the manse and breaks her well-deserved neck.The authorities are called in. At first, they assume the body at the foot of the stairs is the result of an accident. But Richardson comes out with a couple of lies, trying to keep his girl friend out of it. And Henrey lies too, thinking he's helping his idol, except that every time he lies, he gets Richardson into more trouble, until the police are ready to take Richardson down to the precinct and charge him with murder.I first saw this many years ago and wasn't very impressed. The springboard for the story is pretty banal -- married man has an affair and tries to hide it from his wife. But I'm far more impressed now that I know more about what's up. I suppose that's a way of saying the movie is designed for an adult audience.Carol Reed directed with panache. There is hardly a static scene. When the cops are interrogating someone, the Chief Inspector -- Dennis O'Dea with the face of an IRS auditor -- and Richardson stand facing one another, but O'Dea's minions are wandering around in the background, listening carefully, glancing at Richardson, fiddling with some props. The photography by Georges Merinal is memorable, especially when Henrey is running around the dark and cobblestoned streets in his pajamas.There are moments of humor too. The French ambassador's secretary, Karel Stepanek, shows up and one of the detectives, proud of his command of a foreign language, keeps inserting French phrases into the conversation, in a terrible accent. Finally, he says to Stepanek in French that he's sorry for causing him all this trouble, and Stepanek glances at him with annoyance and says in English, "You would trouble me much less if you spoke English." And when Richardson, Morgan, and Henrey visit the zoo, the two lovers are deep in a quiet conversation, which the kid interrupts with, "Oh, look at the monkeys! Look at the monkeys! What are they doing?" Richardson looks at the monkeys -- which the viewer doesn't have a chance to do -- and uncomfortably hustles them away.It's enjoyable and suspenseful and is a kind of primer on how we can sometimes be led astray by our best intentions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good Hitchcockian-style film that needed faster pacing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing this film for the second time, I am upgrading my review of it. The one fault this film has is a problem in many older British films -- segments of it have a slow pace. There are definitely parallels here to Hitchcock's style of directing and type of story. However, Hitchcock would have kept the pace up throughout. The film is based on a short story by Graham Greene, and was nominated for Academy Awards for Best Direction and Screenplay.The film highlights a positive relationship between a butler and the young son of a diplomat. The boy idolizes the butler (hence the title). But, the butler (Ralph Richardson) is involved in an affair that he is hiding...but not too well...which the boy stumbles upon. The butler's wife...well, you sort of hope she will meet a bad end...and she does...falling to her death from a window while trying to catch her husband's infidelity. The boy sees part of the incident and jumps to the conclusion that it was murder...while it really was an accident. Of course, he wants to protect his idol, but only manages to make things worse...a sort of "oh what a terrible tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive" situation.Ralph Richardson is superb here, as are the two women -- his wife (Sonia Dresdel...who will remind you a bit of Gail Sondergaard) and his mistress (Michele Morgan). The only other actor here that most Americans will recognize is Jack Hawkins, who does nicely as the inspector investigating the death. However, special note should be made of the young actor who plays the boy -- Bobby Henrey, who does much better than most of the child actors of that era.I highly recommend this film! It's a good "page turner".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The "idol" is Baines (Ralph Richardson), the butler in the French embassy in London and the ambassador's little son, Philippe (Bobby Henrey), is the one who loves and worships him. Baines is devoted to the boy and never tires of spending time him, regaling him with tall tales that Philippe believes, of course. One day, Baines asks Philippe to keep a big secret from the hateful Mrs. Baines and this secret eventually changes all of their lives.This is a wonderful movie. Richardson is flawless and little Bobby Henrey gives one of the very best child performances ever. He is completely natural, a real boy who dotes on his pet snake and would do anything for Baines, and acts in both English and French. The story is a domestic drama turned homicide investigation and it kept me on the edge of my seat. Heartily recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mr Baines (Ralph Richardson) and his wife (Sonia Dresdel) are left to look after a boy, Phillipe (Bobby Henrey) in a French Embassy house while the parents are away. Phillipe looks up to Mr Baines while disliking Mrs Baines, the housekeeper. He discovers Baines meeting up with another woman Julie (Michele Morgan) and is told to keep it a secret from Mrs Baines. However, she finds out with disastrous consequences...This film is well acted. Ralph Richardson gives a performance that holds back a little and is just on the right side of frustrating while my favourites in the cast are Sonia Dresdel and Dennis O'Dea who plays "Inspector Crowe". Scenes that stand out for me include the section where Mrs Baines is hiding in the house one night and we get a genuinely scary moment. I also found Inspector Crowe extremely watchable in his attempt to get the truth from Phillipe towards the end of the film and he delivers the wonderful line - "Will someone get this child out of here!" I found the film involved me gradually as it played out. The beginning was pretty mild and not very exciting as we focus on the rather annoying Phillipe with his strange accent. They should have cast someone else. However, the dialogue wins through at the end of the day and he gets some great lines, eg, when the police are in the middle of their investigation, he confides to Julie "we must think up more lies and keep telling them". Brilliant. And when he discovers that Mrs Baines has killed his pet "MacGregor", he puts forward the following as the epitaph for the burial - "MacGregor - killed by Mrs Baines - and the date". Genius.Another great quote comes when Dora Bryan who plays a prostitute called "Rose" is given the job of trying to find out who Phillipe is when he shows up at the police station.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ralph In A Jackpot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Fallen Idol is a tender, touching story of the attachment of a butler to a young kid in his care. The butler is Ralph Richardson in what is arguably the greatest film role he ever had. The young lad is little Bobby Henrey who nearly lands Richardson in what they call on NYPD a jackpot.Henrey is the son of the French ambassador to the United Kingdom and Richardson and his wife are employed as butler and maid at the French embassy. The wife is Sonia Dresdel one harridan of a woman so who can blame Richardson for indulging in a little romance with secretary/ stenographer Michele Morgan at the embassy.One day while tagging after Richardson, young Henrey discovers what's going on though he's too young to comprehend. But later on when Dresdel is killed in a fall at the embassy, Henrey in his little efforts to protect his idol Richardson, just digs him a deeper and deeper hole.The film is directed by Carol Reed from a Graham Greene novel. The story was changed considerably from what Greene wrote and I personally would like to have seen it as Greene wrote it. Still this version which relies primarily on the chemistry between Richardson and Henrey is still a fine film.Greene and Reed would team up later on the even more successful The Third Man. If you liked that film, you'll like The Fallen Idol.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deftly Handled, Character-Driven Thriller Starts Slow But Builds Momentum on a Web of Deceit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A year before his zither-ignited mystery masterwork, "The Third Man", producer/director Carol Reed made this supple, slow-building 1948 thriller replete with his trademark technical precision, and now the Criterion Collection has resuscitated the film with a fine print transfer on a new DVD. Written by novelist Graham Greene, Reed's frequent collaborator, the small-scale, London-set story is focused squarely on Phillipe, the undisciplined eight-year old son of the French ambassador to the U.K. With his parents often away, he has formed a strong attachment to Baines, the ambassador's manservant, but he remains fearful of the strict housekeeper, who happens to be Baines' shrewish wife.As it turns out, Baines is having a passionate affair with a comely embassy secretary named Julie, and Phillippe stumbles upon them during a tryst. This revelation leads to a series of deceptions that culminates into the death of a key character. It first looks like an accident but not in Phillipe's eyes, as he believes he saw Baines perpetrate the crime. Lies beget more lies until it becomes a labyrinth for the police to find the truth. Reed takes quite a while to set up the basic premise of the story, and it isn't until around the forty-minute mark of this 96-minute film that it really hits its stride. At the same time, he cleverly sets up the story's viewpoint through Phillipe's eyes by using low angles and long distances on several wide-angle shots to show how the boy eavesdrops on fragments of conversations to piece together what he thinks is the truth.Georges Perinal's atmospheric black-and-white photography helps set up the right mood, especially in the nighttime shots of Phillipe running through the blackened streets of London, and even with a child as the protagonist, Greene's screenplay has a bracingly adult tone throughout. Ralph Richardson shows perfect pitch as Baines, a man who maintains his butler-style composure even as he gets caught up in his own deceits. Even though his French accent makes him hard to understand at times, Bobby Henrey plays the boy unaffectedly, and it's interesting to see how Reed and Graham set up Phillipe's innocence as a plot driver yet risk losing viewer sympathy with the boy's frustrating behavior. Mich?le Morgan brings understated ardor to Julie, making her passion for the staid Baines palpable if not exactly believable.Sonia Dresdel effectively portrays Mrs. Baines with wrathful fury, while Denis O'Dea and Jack Hawkins make the inquisitive detectives far less than the stock characters they are. There are some beautifully executed scenes, such as the constantly moving hide-and-seek game and the paper airplane landing at the feet of one of the detectives. There is also an unexpectedly funny scene at the police station where a blowsy hooker (played by Dora Bryan) becomes a maternal figure to Phillippe but can only talk to him like a potential client. While the plot complexities in the last half-hour are deftly handled, the ending is something of a disappointment for all that precedes it.Although there is no commentary track from an appropriate film scholar as is standard practice for Criterion, the 2006 DVD has one solid extra - a 23-minute featurette, "A Sense of Carol Reed", which paints a portrait of the under-appreciated filmmaker through remembrances from his colleagues. It shows him to be a rather obsessive personality who struck a strong partnership with producer Alexander Korda but lost his way creatively after Korda's death in 1956 until he died in 1976 (Reed did make the Oscar-winning "Oliver!" in 1968). Also included is a slide-driven listing of the Reed filmography through various posters and lobby cards, as well as the original press book for the movie.</fullReview>

I completely enjoyed this movie's story from beginning to end. If you are a fan of The Third Man, I think you will enjoy this movie. For myself, I think I will make it a point to check out some more Graham Greene stories.All of the actors were perfect in their parts, but I was most impressed with the little boy who played Phile. The way he would call after Baines and his broken heart after an episode with Mrs. Baines was amazing. Even bit parts like the prostitute at the police station were perfectly cast.I hope you enjoy this movie as much as I did. Why is it only available on VHS, though?On a Carol Reed note, I would love to see Odd Man Out on the big screen. Enjoy the movies!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exceptional, though by the end of the film I sure wanted to slap the kid!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE FALLEN IDOL is a very good film about a child and his attachment to a butler. The problem is that the butler is married to one of the most vicious and hateful women in film history--and you actually can easily understand when you find out the man has a mistress. The other problem is that the kid accidentally finds out about this relationship and he can't help but blab to others about the butler and his "niece". And, when the vicious wife finds out, a series of events are set into motion that make it appear that the wife was murdered by her long-suffering husband. Unfortunately, the police become suspicious not because of the dead wife but because every time the kid tries to talk to the police to help his friend, it makes it seem certain that the butler DID kill his wife. After a while, I even found myself fantasizing about slapping the kid (just as the butler's wife had done)--just to get him to stop trying so hard to help! The film is exceptionally well written and keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout. In many ways, it reminded me of two other exceptional films--the Charles Laughton film, THE SUSPECT as well as Robert Young's THEY WON'T BELIEVE ME. This is very nice company, as these other two films are amazing films. The only negative about the film is the child's acting. Although he tried very hard, this was a very young child (about 6 I'd guess) and his accent kept changing throughout the film. He'd forget to use it and then suddenly begin using an unusual French-English accent. The film makers should have spotted this and re-shot a few scenes. Still, this is a minor quibble as the film is still nearly deserving of a 9 and is splendid entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Aesop's Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Carol Reed, best known as the astounding craftsman of The Third Man, here takes what will become a trademark visual technique of Dutch angles, stark contrasts and deep focus, and with it serves a parable set mainly inside a single house. As we watch, that house becomes a virtual metropolis, or it would be through the eyes of a child. Guileless 8-year-old Phillippe, son of the French ambassador, finds in his butler Baines the notice and affection that his rather inattentive father has neglected to provide. Baines tells him tall tales, takes him for constitutionals, and helps him dodge the severe household command enforced by Mrs. Baines. The ambassador leaves, to reclaim Phillippe's long-hospitalized mother, and Phillippe is left to the responsibility of his servants.Limited to his room by Mrs. Baines, the boy obviously flees and, noticing Baines, follows him to a teashop, where Baines is at the heart of a thorny, sobbing t?te-?-t?te with the pretty Julie, whom Baines stutteringly introduces as his niece. Phillippe accompanies them through town: a romantic catastrophe for the grown-ups, a family romance for the child. He's instructed by Baines to keep the day's proceedings super-secret. But the usually oppressive Mrs. Baines, in a shudder of softness, may find the story out yet. And what with one thing and another, there's a body, arms and legs splayed at unfeasible angles, at the base of the lavish marble staircase, and a boy who believes he's seen a murder committed by the one person in the world he can truly count on.The faces here are, categorically, the ideal ones. Simultaneously the awkward, startled adulterer and the valiant stand-in father, Ralph Richardson dominates as Baines. His rich, clever voice never sounds more sure than when he's perjuring himself, or more hesitant than when telling, at last, the truth. Sonia Dresdel tackles Mrs. Baines boldly, definitely not a sympathetic character, but never just a mean nag. Michele Morgan is reasoned as Julie, and the peripheral cast incorporates Bernard Lee, probably better known as M. But it's the extraordinarily candid Bobby Henrey who inhabits the heart of this film as Phillippe. It's via his perception that the action is seen, and via his actions that the excitement, inside and out, (almost) uncompromisingly unfurls.Maybe, though, it depreciates neither the stellar performances nor Greene's astute, evocative fable to state that the real luminary of this buried BAFTA-winning tale could be the embassy itself, its marble tartan foyer, its huge parabolic staircase. From the beginning, when Henrey gazes expressively, mournfully through the banister columns at his father's departure, to the climactic tad of sleuthing, it's the material area of the film that retains at the end of the day. For all its other intrinsic worth, Reed and Greene's child noir leaves us with a threatening, grand moral doubt. And with that flight of steps, immense, wavy, impossible to remove.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Fallen Idol" is one of the few films I have seen that tackles with some subtlety and insight the power imbalances between adults and children -- especially as they are complicated (in the case of Baines and Phil) by questions of class and status within a household (the French embassy). The scene in the police station, featuring the young boy and the prostitute Rose, is clever in every sense of the word: it is funny, but also complicates some of the thematic concerns of the film (class, access to economic power, the politics of sex) without hitting the viewer over the head with those connections ...as might occur in a mainstream Hollywood film today. That Reed managed to draw such a brilliant performance from a 9 year-old non-actor is truly impressive, but one need not take Bobby Henrey's lack of previous acting experience into consideration in order to recognize the brilliance of all involved. This is a great film, one that continues to unfold even with repeated viewings.</fullReview>

Baines is having an affair with a woman who works at the Embassy and the boy starts spying on them. After Mrs Baines falls from a window by accident after an argument, the nervous boy runs away into the back streets of London and sees a copper, who takes him to Chelsea Police Station, the nearest one in that area. The boy thinks Baines has murdered her but he is cleared in the end after evidence proves this.The movie is beautifully shot in black and white and had an excellent, haunting score.The cast includes Ralph Richardson as Bains, an excellent performance from Bobby Henrey as the boy, Jack Hawkins (Zulu), Bernard Lee (M in the Bond movies), Michelle Morgan and a young Dora Bryan.This is British drama at its best.

		<shortDescription>Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Fallen Idol is the third film of British filmmaker Carol Reed's that I've seen. Prior to that I've watched the dreadful Oscar-winning musical Oliver!, the solid Charlton Heston biopic of Michelangelo, The Agony And The Ecstasy, and now this. Yes, I have also watched The Third Man, the 1949 film attributed to Reed, but have always hedged upon taking the Warren Commission-like stance that it was Reed's film alone, and not an Orson Welles film merely bearded by Reed. Well, after watching The Fallen Idol, the 1948 film that directly preceded The Third Man, I can tell you that I have no doubts that the bulk of The Third Man was a Welles project that used the functional journeyman studio director Reed as a studio front against the American blacklist.This is not because The Fallen Idol is such a bad film- it's merely mediocre, even if it is based upon a Graham Greene work (as is The Third Man)- The Basement Room, but that there are only a few techniques in the film which augur the grandiosity of their usage in the later film- which was so Wellesian, that to contemplate that Reed soared to greatness out of mediocrity, for the single film he collaborated upon with Welles, then resumed a mediocre career, when the more Occam's Razor answer is that it was Welles who guided the vision of The Third Man, is to simply not recognize verities of the way art is created and the way artists work and mature.As example, the two later Reed films I mention differ from The Third Man in that they are in color, in different genres, and made many years later, so that one could argue that Reed may have simply 'lost his touch.' But, given that The Fallen Idol was made a year earlier, is in black and white, and based upon a work by the same writer, the comparisons between the two films is apt, although the difference in quality is stark. But, why would Reed agree to such a thing? Well, he wanted to break into the American market, where this film did not do as well as other films by Britons as Alfred Hitchcock and David Lean, he shared political sympathies with and an artistic admiration of Welles. Plus, he got locked into a career track that led to greater financial success and recognition even as the requia for his solid artistic talents diminished in need. If you were a man who recognized his limits, and had a chance to help an idol whose techniques you aped, in exchange for personal success, would you refuse? Or would you do so, and deny the obvious to your grave?Yet, especially in recent years, there seems to have been a critical movement afoot to try and argue that this mediocre film is somehow on par with The Third Man, and since it is so manifestly inferior, it begs a reasoning of the motives. The one which makes the most sense is that some critics want to argue that Reed was some visionary auteur, and that The Third Man was not such a great sore thumb in an otherwise workaday filmic resume. In short, the argument is clearly meant to bolster the claim that Reed was the force behind both films, rather than just the first one, and a beard for the second. Yet, The Third Man clearly is an oddity- due to its great quality, and unlike the bloated solidity of The Agony And The Ecstasy or the execrable dotty musical Oliver!, this earlier film is the key to unraveling The Third Man's real provenance, for without it, those who deny Orson Welles' hand in that film can obscure their arguments with time, technical developments, and technique, while The Fallen Idol acts as a smoking gun that reveals its creator's limits, its alibiers' motives, and its successor film's great ineffability. And, for that, there is no contrived misreading needed!</fullReview>

Two Good Ones are Invaders from Mars (1953) and The Window (1949).Here We Have a Decidedly Adult Story Shown Almost Completely Through the Eyes of a 10 Year Old. There are Constant Questions, Misconceptions, and Deceptions. The Film is About Lies. The Idol Baines Says... "Sometimes a lie is a kindness" (paraphrasing Shakespeare's "Cruel to be kind" line). The Movie is Full of Lies. Mostly, but Not Entirely, About Extramarital Affairs.The Movie has a Certain Edge About Adultery and Comes Close to Breaking the Code a Number of Times. It is Clever the Way These "Truths" are Interrupted by Dialog or Other Things. It is an Engaging Film with Some Noir Flourishes and Tone. The Kid's Adventure Through the Streets and at the Police Station and Some Distorted Perspectives and Expressionism Around the House.The Film is Slow At Times and Not for All Tastes. But it is a Well Crafted and Acted Piece of Work with Some Memorable Scenes. Not All of This Works, Especially the Ending that Goes On Far Too Long. Above Average but Not Great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This Carol Reed/Graham Greene collaboration is a sort-of warm up to their 1949 classic "The Third Man." Not as well known as the later picture, "The Fallen Idol" is actually a bit more psychologically complex. It's about the frequently necessarily duplicitous world of adults as seen through the eyes of a little boy, unable to understand why it's o.k. to lie sometimes but not others, and who sees the man he looks up to as his father figure (Ralph Richardson's butler Baines) turn out to be so much more flawed and untrustworthy than he had thought. It's even a little bit tragic, even if the tragedy is one that we must all endure at some point in our lives: that transition from the simple answers of childhood to the complicated ambiguities of being an adult.Richardson is superb, as are the two principal females, Michele Morgan as Baines' lover and Sonia Dresdel as his terrifying wife. There's at least one astonishing scene -- that in which Baines, his lover and the little boy play hide and seek in a huge empty house while Mrs. Baines looks on unawares -- even if as a whole the film's style doesn't rival that of "The Third Man." And "The Third Man" is probably the more fun of the two, but if you liked that one, you will probably like this.Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing performance by Bobby Henrey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of three movies the great British director Carol Reed made with the famous author Graham Greene. The others being "The Third Man" and "Our Man in Havana". This is an outstanding movie with some incredible performances including Ralph Richardson as the butler who may be involved in a murder, and the Son of a French diplomat in England played by Bobby Henrey who idolizes the butler. The Butler works in the French embassy. The amazing thing about this movie is the performance by 8 year old Bobby Henrey, which we find out in the extras could not act at all. Reed would spend countless hours with Henrey to get just a few lines of dialogue, mostly by the kid mimicking Reed. You can't tell any of that in the movie, it just looks like an amazing performance by a kid actor. I consider Reed to be much in the same class as Hitchcock, although their film-making styles are completely different. This is a very entertaining movie, and I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the first of three adaptations of Greene novels by Reed, a butler at a London embassy is suspected of murdering his wife. Richardson is excellent as the butler, managing to express a range of emotions while maintaining a low-key demeanor. The other performances are good also, although the young actor who plays the ambassador's son becomes increasingly annoying and too much attention is given to his creepy little snake. As he would do with his next film, "The Third Man," Reed creates a chilly atmosphere and masterfully builds the suspense. Given the low-key nature of the film, however, the score by Alwyn is a bit too bombastic and distracting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Fallen Idol" (1948), directed by Carol Reed and written by Graham Greene, was released one year before the team combined to create "The Third Man." The latter film is more famous, probably because of the charismatic acting of Orson Welles. However, "The Fallen Idol," although more subdued, is equally good.Almost all of the action takes place in the French embassy in London-- an enclosed world where tensions and hatreds run high. There are only four main characters: Ralph Richardson as Baines, the perfect butler; Sonia Dresdel as Mrs. Baines, the perfect witch; Mich?le Morgan as Julie, the woman whom Baines loves; and Bobby Henrey as Phillipe. the son of the French ambassador to England.Baines and Julie are meeting in secret, as Baines tries to get up the courage to tell his wife he wants a divorce. By bad fortune, Phillipe gets caught in the middle of this triangle. He himself hates Mrs. Baines, for some very good reasons. Every time Phillipe tries to help Baines, his friend, his efforts go awry and he manages to make the situation worse.Sir Ralph Richardson was a great actor, and his muted performance is a testimony to his skill. Mich?le Morgan has to look naive and innocent, somewhat of a stretch for her, but she carries it off pretty well. Sonia Dresdel is perfect as the (surrogate) stepmother no young boy would want. Bobby Henrey is outstanding as the young boy who doesn't want to know any secrets, but somehow knows them all.Carol Reed's direction is flawless, and the rich black and white cinematography is outstanding. Reed has the gift of introducing bits of humor at moments when the action is most tense. (I was especially impressed by Dora Bryan as Rose, the prostitute who only feels comfortable when she is saying, "Would you like to come home with me?" )This is definitely a film worth seeking out--it would make an interesting double feature with "The Third Man," but is strong enough to stand on its own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I almost didn't watch this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I almost didn't watch due to the fact the tcm description said it was a view from a child. And tvs and movies usually portray kids as smarter than adults and annoying know it alls. But this movie was great! Phillipe acts like a little boy. He's naive, he trusts adults, sometimes gets on your nerves. And adults do lie to kids except this time the lies get out of hand when the kid doesn't know when to stop lying. I really love the cast how it is. The wife was really hateful and hitting the child was deplorable. My only question is what kind of parents did this child have to leave him alone. Really the child was lonely, there were no only children around and the butler was his only friend. The acting was really natural which made the story believable! If you get a chance.. watch it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stairway To Paradise (Or Not, As The Case May Be)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my memory I have always rated this higher than the subsequent (one year later) Greene-Reed collaboration The Third Man and now that it has just been re-issued I see no reason to amend that verdict. Coincidentally both films turn to the Continent for their love interest, respectively Michele Morgan and Alida Valli and if Morgan was, hands down, the superior actress, both led with expressive eyes and shared the same waif-like build. Here Morgan does wonders with a part that on paper is almost non-existent and gets across wonderfully the anguish of a young girl living away from home in a foreign country and turning for emotional sustenance to a man one step up from a husk by virtue of a shrewish wife who has, over the years, sucked all the spirit out of him. Ralph Richardson turns in one of his finest ever film performances supported by Sonia Dresdel as the shrew and Bobby Henrey as Philippe, the ten-year old catalyst is beyond praise in a role that, like so many child actors, he was never able to replicate or even approach in later years. Sprinkled throughout like hundreds and thousands on a celebratory cake are cameos from the likes of Dandy Nichols, Jack Hawkins, Geoffrey Keene and Dora Bryan phoning in her perennial tart-with-a-heart. For me this is far and away the best thing Reed ever did though others will probably disagree and I've already ordered the DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My brief review of the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rather well directed with some interesting angled shots, Carol Reed's vision of the material is very solid and his directing is what keeps the film interesting. The story is slow and sluggish to develop, with not nearly enough exciting and gripping bits to maintain interest, but some well done intermittent segments, such as the hide and seek game, are of interest. In terms of characters, they could have been much more fascinating - most of the adults are dull and unexplored as individuals. Some of the editing also causes disruptions in continuity. Compared to 'Odd Man Out' and 'The Third Man', which Reed directed in the years immediately before and after this film respectively, it does not work nearly as well. It is a fairly good film in itself though, and it is certainly worth checking out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A surprisingly good film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was made in the days when child actors were saccharine sweet and monumentally fake. Thus the portrayal of eight year old Philippe by Bobby Henrey was somewhat of a phenomenon. Fact is that the entire film is incredibly authentic. Of course, Ralph Richardson brings the whole thing into three dimensions. But the direction of Carol Reed puts him once more in the realm of the greats. Even the music, so annoyingly pervasive in films of this era, is subdued by and large. Each one of the main roles, and most of the minor roles, are real.I suspect that even a generation that grew up on color films and who see black and white as quaint and obscure would love to see this film.All in all this is a film worth seeing more than once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A compact, modest success.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In comparison to "The Third Man" and the earlier "Odd Man Out", this film of Carol Reed's comes across as a minor work. The camera is restrained; there is no real effort at visual complexity. The story is simple and devoid of all those layers the above two films have. The story is however a clinically effective one, solidly filmed and well played by the cast. I can see perhaps why people may take to it more than "Odd Man Out", although I maintain that "Odd Man Out" is a more fascinating film and a greater one as a whole.Part of "The Fallen Idol"'s trouble is that, as Pauline Kael says, things are too understated and muted. There is not quite the dramatic frisson; everything is softly revealed and perhaps not shaded enough. The filming is not quite staid or dull, but it is when compared to "The Third Man" and "Odd Man Out". Perhaps summing this up, there doesn't seem to be enough directorial vision to the film. There is a general theme of the difference in child and adult perspectives to events, which does pay dividends, but nothing on a great scale. The ending - possibly a cop-out, possibly not... I can't quite make up my mind about it; it makes things much more cosy, loses the blackly comic tragic angle, but comes up with some very deft touches of dramatic ironic. The film may not exactly astound, but it is really a very creditable project. This is emphasised by the finely judged playing of the great Richardson as Mr Baines, the engaging child actor Bobby Henrey - from whose perspective we often see the action - and Sonia Dresdel, playing Mrs Baines with a peculiarly prissy, unbalanced malice. A fine performance; a little more animated than Richardson, who is nevertheless affecting in his slow, coiling, slightly askew respectability. Michele Morgan isn't especially interesting; a shame as her part is a bit of a weak link; a very standard character rather lacking in nuance or interest. The romance between Richardson and Morgan is only passably conveyed; a sign of British cinema's reticence perhaps... Powell and Pressburger or Lean - "Brief Encounter" I am of course thinking of, specifically - may have handled this aspect better. Maybe it is the actors or the script that add to this void of impression; "Odd Man Out" and "The Third Man" have very satisfying strands of illuminating romanticism in them. At times it is a bleak romanticism that pervades these films; "The Fallen Idol" offers only coy hints, and not a great amount of chemistry. Possibly this can be put down to the film being poised, much of the time, from a child's eye view of the world.A major thing that lets down the film is its very inconsequential opening section; it struggles to really draw the viewer in. The pace does pick up admirably later on though, with the cleverness of the script becoming ever more apparent. While the screenplay is nowhere near the sprawling brilliance of "The Third Man", Greene does an effective job in dramatising the story. What with this well-judged if perhaps a little unspectacular screenplay here from Greene, and the astonishing flourishes of Robert Krasker's camerawork in "Odd Man Out", one sees a few pieces slotting into place for the trio's work [along with other players, of course] on the coming "The Third Man".The ending brings the film much closer to conventionality; while the script is very clever in spinning its tale, the film doesn't have a maverick mark upon it, which one has come to expect from Reed. Yes, the last shots are very nice, and well done, but things very much veer towards normality, rather than the movingly ironic, as they have been promising to. "The Fallen Idol" is very much a laudable, impressive film. A small-scale winner, but by no means a Carol Reed film that astonishes and dazzles the eye and the mind.Rating:- ****/*****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strange but rather inquisitive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Fallen Idol' is in theory a good and interesting film. The final result can be disappointing. At least on an early impression. This is a complicated movie to rate and judge. It's not confusing or inconsistent but it's complex and doesn't always make sense. Nevertheless, it can grow on you with time.Visually it is one of the best-looking films in black and white. The plot is interesting although it could be better worked at times. This film is often said to be "hitchcockian" for its film-making and "suspense". There is some suspense but nothing all that "hitchcockian". And that's where lies one of the weaknesses of this film: it definitely could use more true suspense, more darkness, more terrifying moments.The film takes place in London, in a fancy big house with a french little boy named Phillipe, the butler Baines and the butler's wife Mrs Baines. Phillipe idolizes the butler, but can't stand Mrs. Baines. And rightfully so, she's a horrible person. She is mean for Phillipe (she even slaps him) and she hates MacGregor (Phillipe's little pet snake). MacGregor is a cute name for a little snake and, even though I never think of any snake as being cute, I think MacGregor is a cute snake. Phillipe is very fond of his beloved MacGregor and very loving towards him. Mrs. Baines is so cruel that she burns poor innocent MacGregor alive! So it's not like she doesn't deserve her fate, even if accidental.Phillipe witnesses Mrs. Baines's accidental death, but thinks he saw Baines intentionally murder her. Phillipe is a strange little boy. On one hand, he's utterly cute and adorable. On the other hand, he's not annoying but he often has erratic behaviors and seems to be a very confused and immature boy and has the bad habit of stubbornly lying. He doesn't seem to have a stable personality. That may be in part due to the abuse he suffered from Mrs. Baites. Or perhaps he was already born with some kind of personality disorder. He also runs away like crazy after witnessing Mrs. Baines's death as if he was terrified but acts as if he wasn't. He lies to the police and his clumsy attempts to protect his idol almost put Baines in trouble. Phillipe is a complicated character, definitely not an easy one to evaluate. He seems like a child who is losing his innocence and hides his emotions as much as possible.Actors do well in their roles: Ralph Richardson as Baines, Mich?le Morgan as Baines's lover Julie, Sonia Dresdel as Mrs. Baines and Bobby Henrey (who really is french) as Phillipe.This should definitely be on Top 250.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well-Crafted Psychological Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Fallen Idol" is a well-crafted psychological thriller with a story that moves rather slowly at times but always keeps you involved. Director Carol Reed and novelist Graham Greene collaborated even more memorably on the great classic "The Third Man", and this one shows a few of the same merits. The characters are efficiently developed, and you quickly feel that you can understand them. When thrown into an unpredictable and hazardous situation, they don't always make the best decisions, but you feel more empathy for them than frustration.Reed used the basic idea of Greene's story as a starting point, with a butler, who is idolized by a young boy, getting himself into a tangled situation. Some significant details are changed, so it's a rather different story, but in itself it works pretty well. Ralph Richardson heads up a solid cast. Richardson is very well-cast as the butler, and he makes the character believable and interesting.For the most part Reed's technique is straightforward here, allowing the plot to be the center of attention, but there are some nice distinctive touches as well. Everything fits together naturally, and it is well worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Misunderstandings of adult world seen through the eyes of a boy...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>RALPH RICHARDSON was always one of the great British actors I admired, remembering him fondly for his wonderful scenes in THE FOUR FEATHERS where he is a soldier blinded by the desert sun--and ten years later as Dr. Sloper, the overbearing father of THE HEIRESS.Here he has another great role as Baines, the butler at the British Embassy in London, who is having an affair with a mistress (MICHELE MORGAN) which is discovered by his jealous wife (SONIA RENDELL). These are the adult relationships which lead to lies and deception when the young boy (BOBBY HENREY), who is looked after by Baines when the Ambassador and his wife are too busy to care for him, misunderstands certain truths.When the jealous wife is accidentally killed, the police suspect Baines and his mistress are behind the event. The boy, who has only partial knowledge of the truth, tries to help them but only makes things worse in the end through his misunderstanding of certain key facts. The story ends on a note of disillusionment for the child.It's a simple tale and yet complex at the same time, because of the relationships. Masterfully photographed in gorgeous B&amp;W cinematography, it captures the mood perfectly and makes for an absorbing, if rather slow-moving story, with overtones of humor and suspense under the superb direction of Carol Reed.Richardson has seldom been better, but would give an even more powerful and polished performance a year later in THE HEIRESS.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfectly ordinary drama, over-praised throughout the years...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Graham Greene adapted his short story "The Basement Room" about a youngster in London, the son of the French Ambassador to England, whose friendship with the manor's butler is tested after the butler's wife, the no-nonsense chief housekeeper, dies under suspicious circumstances. Ralph Richardson (resembling a jowly Kevin Spacey) is fine in the lead role, yet his character doesn't allow for a great many dimensions. The rest of the film follows suit: it is straightforward storytelling without mystery. After a lively beginning, it's rather disappointing (and exhausting) to have the proverbial inspectors called in, manipulating the lad into spilling what he knows. One can easily pick up all the nuances the picture has to offer within the first sixty-minutes of its running time--the second and third acts being predictable, obvious, and melodramatic. ** from ****</fullReview>
