		<shortDescription>A dark, graphic view into the underworld of pornography</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly, this film is hugely under-rated. For those reviewers who call this film a "waste of time" or place it in the "hall of shame", maybe they should go back to watching more obvious and simple films. 8mm focuses on "snuff" movies and follows Nicholas Cage as he ventures into the dark underworld of the pornographic industry. I'm not a great fan of Nicholas Cage (I still wonder how he ever made it as a movie star), but in 8mm felt he redeemed himself from past performances. Other actors in the film put on great performances, notably Joaquin Pheonix, and James Gandolfini (of Sopranos).What makes the film worth watching though is the emotion, dark imagery and tense moments throughout the film. The storyline too is very well thought out although does have a few holes and untouched areas that may have helped develop the film further. There is no Hollywood ending, forced propaganda, or marketing. What you do get is graphic scenes, moderate violence, and an insight into "snuff" movies (which really is quite disturbing).Having said that this movie is not for the faint hearted, so if you're a "puppy-dogs and ice-cream" kind of person I'd suggest watching something else. If however, you feel you will be able to stomach such a film then prepare yourself for a moving film, which will leave you feeling that little bit darker at the end.I highly recommend this film. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I walked into the movie theater last Friday not expecting at all what I was about to see. I'd heard about it, thought "Oh, another Seven". Same screenwriter, but I was way off track. I can stomach a lot, having no problem stuffing down popcorn during very graphic scenes. In 8MM, my coke had trouble going down. 8MM did not have consistent gory/violent scenes, but the way the movie was made made you fill in the blanks of what the makers of the movie could not screen. And if you pay attention and immerse yourself, you fill in more blanks than you really think you could, or want. As Max put it: "the devil changes you." The perversity and deep rottenness of the human minds displayed in 8MM is what disturbs you. Then you realize, that "snuff"-movies are real, that there are individuals twisted enough to endorse/enjoy/take part in it. And worst of all, that these individuals don't look like monsters, they're perhaps just overweight nearsighted men who look like your dad, your son, your brother, even yourself. And if you don't look out,(no matter how secluded you think you are in your suburban home, with a wife, a daughter, and a dog named Shep) you dive into the pit of perversion and rottenness as well, finding no way out. In conclusion: excellent music, acting very sufficient, the plot: a must see. Just don't bring popcorn, and prepare to walk out of the movie theatre disturbed, asking questions, and a little bit more suspicious of those walking around you, and yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Haunting and disturbing Brilliant Realistic Masterpiece!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The intensely intriguing storyline of 8MM follows the haunting search by a private investigator (played superbly by Nicolas Cage) for the makers of a grotesque and disturbing snuff film in which a young woman is murdered. Starting by looking through endless missing persons files (in an attempt to identify the victim), Cage ultimately follows leads to the world of underground seaze films and the people who are involved in making them. Throughout his creepy investigation, Cage becomes more and more disturbed by the Snuff film and stops at nothing in an attempt to track down answers to what really happened. This film is So intriguing and suspenseful, there are scenes that will leave your heart pounding in anticipation of what's to come. I don't know if I have ever seen such an intriguing and suspenseful Drama/Thriller ever before! This film is so realistic, there are times when you feel as if what is going on is real, and you begin to feel more for the characters than you usually do in a film. The last 20 minutes of the film are heart pounding and breathtaking! Director Joel Schumacher delivers one of the most mind haunting dramas you will ever see and gives us a story that won't be easy to forget. It's dark, moody, creepy, brilliant, and disturbing! And when all the pieces finally come together, you'll be glad you went along for the ride. Wow, It's a sick world we live in!! I give this movie 4 out of 4 stars!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beware Of Brutal Topic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, this is a tough subject but not as sordid a film as I figured it would be, although be warned the last 30 minutes are really rough in spots. Speaking of spots, this is a bloody movie in spots, too and very profane after the first 40 minutes. Yet, despite the unpleasant nature of the story (making a "snuff film" - filming the killing of people) it's a riveting one, well-acted and doesn't overdo the violence. The characters in here are some of the most despicable you could find - killer and porn kings.Even our hero here, played by Nicholas Cage, starts off as a clean-cut fairly straight dude, and changes for the worst, too. Joaquin Phoenix has a good line in here, with the prophetic statement, "The devil doesn't change; he changes you."James Gandolfini and Peter Stormare play characters about as bad you'll ever find in a movie. This film is not, as they say, for all tastes. It will turn off a lot of people but it is interesting and good revenge story, if you like that sort of thing and know what you're in for before watching this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>8MM was a very dark and powerful film featuring the seedy underground world of pornography and snuff movies. It was, to be frank, fantastic. Nic Cage, rapidly becoming one of my favourite actors, walks through with a disgusted air and even Joaquin Phoenix, who I've never been that impressed with, hit the nail as a porn shop managerDeeply disturbing, yes. Highly compelling, yes. A good buy... you bet!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Admittedly, I haven't seen a lot, if any, of the movies or read the books other people have said have covered this territory already, but I found myself caught up in the story and not bored or thinking, "Ho-hum." I haven't liked Joel Schumacher lately(his two BATMAN movies were a joke, and A TIME TO KILL was exploitation at its worst), but this one was pretty good. Admittedly, like in A TIME TO KILL, this sometimes comes close to an exploitation movie(particularly through the performances of James Gandolfini and Peter Stormare), but that's only part of the time. Most of the time you feel sadness and outrage, and like in Schumacher's very good FALLING DOWN, you aren't asked to condone Cage's actions near the end, you're just asked to understand them.This might not be the type of part Cage is known for, but I found him compelling in the role(and if something upsets the man who ate a cockroach on film, you KNOW it's heavy-duty stuff). I do admit the film would have been a little unrelenting without the presence of Joaquin Phoenix, though; he was like a breath of fresh air, and I liked how matter-of-fact he was. I can't say I enjoyed this movie, but I'm not sorry I saw it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very gritty and dark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I watched 8 MM, I didn't know what to expect, but I noticed that Joel Schumacher directed it and I am a fan of his. Also it stars two other terrific actors like Nicholas Cage and Joaquin Phoenix, so usually that equals a great film. 8 MM turned out to be a terrific dark drama that I'm not so sure that I understand it's low rating. I was actually expecting it to be in the 7.0 range when I went to check it out on IMDb, but it's in the low 6.0's. I understand that it's an extremely dark movie that not too many people would wanna take a look at, but for what it was, I thought it was great. It took us into the deep dark world of porn and what some sick people get off on. It's not just about that, but also it takes us into a detective type of drama that makes it into a scary type of thriller.Tom Welles is a detective that is given a strange short movie called a "snuff film", where a beautiful young girl is being brutally raped and then murdered on film. While it's supposed to be fake, it looks incredibly real and terrifying. Her relative asks him to find out wither it is fake or real and if she's still alive. This means he has to go deep into a world of brutal porn that is out of his league. With the help of a porn salesman, Max, they go to find out if this girl is really alive or not, but end up getting into some serious trouble when the directors and "actors" find out about them.8 MM is in no way for the faint of heart, there are some extremely disturbing images that I really wouldn't like to see again, I'm sure most wouldn't either, but this is a great dark drama that I would recommend for a watch. Nicholas did a great job, but Joaquin really takes the show here. He made his character incredibly believable and almost sympathetic. Joel really made me believe the story, he shot it wonderfully and didn't over do anything. I would recommend this film for a watch, it's a great thriller that is impressive as well as scary.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A solid thriller!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some sensitive-minded people may surely be disturbed by the dark revenge and self-justice in this film, but "Se7en"-author Andrew Kevin Walker has done another fine work with his script! Although the storyline is obviously taken from Paul Schrader´s "Hardcore" (1974,?) the film is suspense-packed, violent and endowed with good performances of its actors, especially Peter Stormare did a brilliant job with playing the weird bondage-porn director Dino Velvet! I also was truly surprised how good director Joel Schumacher had created a morbid atmosphere, just in unhappy memory of his disastrous "Batman &amp; Robin"-flick..! Another pleasant fact is, that "8MM" doesn´t deal with the Hollywood-typical stereotypes and clichés, so finally we´ve got something we could really call a dirty mainstream production - or at least a nice try of it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disquieting but effective for mature audiences. *** out of ****.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>8MM / (1999) ***Starring: Nicolas Cage, Joaquin Phoenix, James Gandolfini, Peter Stormare, Catherine Keener, and Amy Morton Directed by Joel Schumacher. Written by Andrew Kevin Walker. Running time: 123 minutes. Rated R (for strong sexual content, nudity, violence, and for strong language).By Blake French: Joel Schumacher's new disquieting thriller, "8MM," is the kind of movie that starts out hesitantly calm, but contains an atmosphere where potentially detestable material may become apparent, as if the film is preparing us for something much more bellicose. Sure enough, a half hour into the picture, we take possession of plot points regarding subjects beyond human imagination. Our very effective condition propels us into a sleazy world of hard core adult contents. "8MM" is a tense, dramatic production with tantalizing dialogue and a driving theme of action. There is a scene in the film in which a character explains a relative, although somewhat overlooked, concept. "When you dance with the devil, you don't change the devil--the devil changes you," he declares as he walks down a long, dark ally with another character.  Nicolas Cage stars as Tom Welles, a highly acclaimed private detective living with his wife Amy (Catherine Keener), and their newborn son in a homey, relaxed country house. As the film opens, he is called upon by the widow of an important political man, Mrs. Mathews (Amy Morton). This elderly woman has discovered the contents of her late husband's secret safe and his extremely concerned about some of them. Most of the objects found in the safe are normal. One in particular, however, a film strip, is not what you would call ordinary, but suspicious and concealed. Mrs. Mathews explains to Tom what he will see on this tape is something of unimaginable terror. Tom views the 8mm tape, watching in horror as a young girl is raped and brutally beaten to death in front of a camera operator, a silent viewer, and a muscular man wearing all sorts of S&amp;M clothing. The well-developed conflict brought to our attention at this point: Mrs. Matthews is requiring Tom to find out if the tragic events that occur on tape are real or not, and if her husband had anything to do with this atrocity. Welles opens a missing person's case and reports to his wife that he will be away for a few weeks on duty. He first searches through countless files containing young kidnapping victims. The results: a fifteen year old girl named Marianne who ran away from home six years ago with the company of her boyfriend as they were heading towards Hollywood, California. Next, he converses with several key characters including her depressed mother, a scruffy acquaintance, and her so called boyfriend who is now serving time in prison. He claims Marianne ran off to work at a strip club. These characters point Tom in the direction of an underworld of "snuff" movies, where he meets an adult book store clerk named Max California (Joaquin Phoenix). He and Max become friends. After some negotiating, our fellow porn genius agrees to share his knowledge with Tom and lead him to the makers of the 8mm snuff film. There we meet Eddie Poole, a perverted photographer, (James Gandolfini), Dino Velvet (Peter Stormare), a disquieted man who believes smut to be a form of art, and The Machine, the man in the S&amp;M mask who murdered Marianne in the video Mrs. Mathews found. "8MM" has an excellently developed setup. A setup that indicates us on the snuff film, as well as the setting, character motives, personalities, dramatic premise, and plot points. The only component that is missing is the history and or in depth elaboration on Tom Welles. With such an important character, one who drives the entire narrative through line, we need to feel a lot of empathy so that we may root for him. Unfortunately, the filmmakers present the audience with only the minimum introduction. The side characters are also descriptive. In their own presence, contribute to both the story and atmosphere. Director Joel Schumacher's work has always been some of my favorite. With movies like "Falling Down," "Flawless," and "Batman &amp; Robin," I was never expecting him to construct a dark, grim, film such as "8MM." This feature is tasteless and nasty, repulsive and unsettling--while all these bases are relentless within the context of the plot. No doubt many audiences will be offended throughout, perhaps even to the point of where they walk out of the theater. This is a production on the verge of an NC-17 rating and is adult in every atom of its being. The perverse and gritty character motives and mature subject matters all fitted appropriately here, but the film still goes over the top in many areas. Some of the movie's characters are a bit too obvious. The villain, for instance, I could predict from the first five minutes he is on screen. Whenever there is a character who seems to have no cause or purpose in the plot, he is normally the bad guy. Here, although the character twists are effective and the casting is brilliant, we receive several clinches that many views will be able to detect immediately.Nicolas Cage is obviously the right choice for Tom Welles, a man who is more submissive than brutal, but is placed in a situation where deep down he desires bloodshed, but knows his morals challenge him otherwise. "8MM" is a movie that frolics with this character's emotions and values, and at the same time lives up to a premise that is way out of his league.Brought to you by Columbia Pictures.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"8mm" sucks you in from the moment you watch the snuff film with Nicholas Cage, not letting you go until the very end, where it spits you out encased in a cocoon of bloody phlegm.The director successfully creates a gritty atmosphere that remains constant right up until the end, but the plot isn't so lucky. As others have pointed out, things get ridiculous towards the films finale, which if crafted with more tact could have made "8mm" a great film rather than simply an entertaining one.Cage gives a good, rather sombre performance as the private investigator hired to determine the authenticity of a snuff film found in the late husband of a senator's safe. From there on he's plopped into the festering world of deviant pornography, forced to explore the seedy bowels of stomach-churningly filthy underground sexual practices. Amy Morton's performance as Mary Ann's mother is perfect, conveying the emotions of a distraught, depressed mother beautifully. Joaquin Pheonix steals the show as the charismatic owner of a sex-shop.Full of suspense, this film should at least entertain you as you watch with disgust and repulsion some of the dirtiest human habits imaginable.7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not for the faint of heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When it came out, "8mm" became notorious for its dark and perverted subject matter. Any and all warnings that are given in association with this film are warranted: this is a dark, dark, thriller, and one that revels in a lot of sordid subject matter. How this was never threatened with an NC-17 is beyond me.Tom Welles (Nicholas Cage) is a well-respected private detective. One day, he gets a call from a recently widowed, and exceedingly wealthy woman named Mrs. Christian (Myra Carter). It seems that when Mrs. Christian was going through her husbands things, she came across a film reel that appears to be a "snuff film" (a "snuff film is where someone is actually murdered on screen, not merely acting like it). Tom is hired to find out if the film is actually real.Andrew Kevin Walker wrote the suspense hit "Seven," and the two films bear a number of similarities. Both deal with grisly and bizarre subject matter, and take no prisoners when they show it all. But "Seven" had something that "8mm" doesn't: a sense of atmosphere. Try as he might, director Joel Schumaker can't establish an ominous atmosphere, which mutes the film's impact.The acting varies. Nicholas Cage is effective as Tom Welles, though that's to be expected because this is a role that Cage could play in his sleep. Joaquin Phoenix shines as Max California, the porn star clerk who becomes Tom's sidekick. The rest of the cast is not so great. James Gandolfini is okay as Eddie Poole, but Peter Stormare (Dino Velvet, a mysterious hard-core porn producer), Anthony Heald as Mrs. Christian's lawyer, Daniel Longdale, (looking strikingly similar to Geraldo Rivera) and Catherine Keener (Tom's neurotic wife)are awful."8mm" works, but it's not masterpiece. The story is easy to follow, as long as you don't stop to think about how the film gets from one scene to the next. But the final 20 minutes are bad; they're not credible, and everyone acts like they've lost their brains."Seven" contained an ingenious twist ending, and while "8mm" doesn't offer that, it takes a few unexpected turns, and the story is not formulaic.This is a good film, but not a great one. Recommended, if you can get it for cheap.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Schumacher's best work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the list of my 10 preferred films 8MM occupies the fifth place. This film is simply perfect. To begin the music is excellent, it contributes to give an at the same time sad, strange and beautiful particular environment. Then the actors whose initially Nicolas Cage are all very talented, especially Joaquin Phoenix and James Gandolfini. The scenario writer Andrew Kevin Walker who had largely proved reliable with Se7en did an extraordinary work. But what I enjoyed me the most in this film it is that there is a morals. In its investigation Nicolas Cage tests each minute more and more compassion for the wildly assassinated young girl whom it ends up making the decision not only to find all the authors of the snuff but of all to kill them.That's what I call a hero. This film is not on violence or sadomasochism but on the punishment. If in the true life each time that a snuff is carried out all passed as in 8MM,it would be a large thing.For me it is the best film of Schumacher which is at all events one of the largest realizers of the world. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Voyeuristic Thriller About Human's Capacity For Evil</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a lot to be said about skill. Joel Schumacher is responsible for Batman &amp; Robin, one of the most horrendously made movies in the past 15 years. One could have said upon leaving the theater in 1997 that Joel Schumacher is one of the worst directors working today. Two years later, Schumacher creates something, albeit with commercial sensibilities, that succeeds on many levels. 8mm is a murky, scuzzy passage through the miserable, dystopian criminal world of snuff films, taken on by a private investigator who is dismayed and scarred by what he unearths. It probes the resources of violent exploitation films, but not as a violent exploitation film. It would more accurately turn your stomach than amuse. Andrew Kevin Walker, who wrote Seven, and again establishes a protagonist who confronts evil and nearly loses his sanity in an effort to understand its reasons. The answer comes almost at the end of the film, from its most vicious character, but his rationale wittingly refrains from going as deep as the psychological world of his deeds. Joel Schumacher has an attraction to sinister, perhaps Gothic environments, even if his previous films that follow that pattern aren't so great, like The Lost Boys. Here, with Mychael Danna's sorrowful score and the great Robert Elswit's guilty, peeping camera, he fashions an impression of apprehension even in the few scenes where the story takes solace in Cage's home life. One director would not be wrong to shock us with a comparison to the unsuspecting atmosphere of Cage's residential street or the opening airport shot, but Schumacher perceives the looming subterranean goings-on beneath the unsuspecting.The intent of the story is to consider a rather everyday individual and provoke him into such a troubling conflict with pure evil that he himself is pushed to torture and murder. He lives an unexciting but mostly happy life with his wife Catherine Keener and their infant daughter. He went to a good school on an academic scholarship, however while his contemporaries went through the most conventional motions to become lawyers, doctors, bankers, he chose a line of work comprised of following, shadowing, investigating, staking out, watching. For the sake of a comfortable living, he accommodates an upper crust circle of socialites and politicians. Nevertheless, this case which he almost does not take is unique. He is sent for by the attorney of a rich widow whose husband has just died. Whilst rummaging through the inside of her husband's safe, she and the lawyer find an 8 mm film of what seems to be the vicious slaying of a teenage girl by a large masked man. Cage convinces himself that the film, while horrifying, is simulation, but the widow wants him to confirm this for sure.8mm doesn't consider the story's dilemmas merely as opportunity for money-making set pieces like action scenes. When Cage has the chance to take revenge, he doesn't have the command of his motivation because he does not have the same capacity for murder that his prospective victims have, and he essentially calls a character wounded by this person and provokes her to talk him into it. That is a novel approach the protagonist's vengeful turning point, and it elicits subliminal moral uncertainty that the audience has to take in hand.8mm is a conventional studio thriller, but it is a real movie. It is all content and the suitable approach to that content. It is about human's aptitude for malevolence, conjecturing just deep it can go and how little we care to know of it in ourselves.</fullReview>

Cage gives an fine performance but he's almost outshine by a strong supporting cast like Joaquin Phoenix, James Gandolfini, Catherine Keener, Anthony Heald and Peter Stormare.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer (also in Pan &amp; Scan) with an strong:Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has an fascinating commentary track by the director, which the director comments the most controversial scenes and interesting scenes had to be deleted from the film. Which the DVD doesn't have any deleted scenes. DVD's others extras are Behind the Scenes featurette, Original Theatrical Trailer and a Collector's Booklet. Since this film was an Box Office Disappointment and Screenwriter:Andrew Kevin Walker (Brainscan, Se7en, Sleepy Hollow) disowned the film before it was released into theaters. Since the director and screenwriter:Nicolas Kazan (Bicentennial Man, Enough, Fallen) re-written Walker's actual script. This is a well made film that falls flat in certain tense scenes. Nonetheless, this film is worth a look. Super 35. (*** ?/*****).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Goes for the throat one second, the heart strings the next</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>8MM is not a stylistic feast or a tour de force. It is, however, a very great movie. Why? Simple, this film is how Joel Schumacher should have done his Batman films. Nicholas Cage plays an all too human hero in the role of Tom Welles. He's not perfect. He smokes, lies to his wife, and worries how to put his kid through college. He, like many of us, thinks his world is grim and gritty enough as it is. Then, when he is asked to investigate an old film, it quickly spawns a chaotic fall into an all too living "dead case," which claims a great toll on the character. Some would say this film offers nothing new, and, if you feel that way, so be it, but it does offer reinterpretations. Joaquin Phoenix portrays Max California, the stock character of the "violator of social norms with a heart of gold." Working in a seedy business day in and out has worn this character down, he knows too much to be able not to be dark. Phoenix captures this in his darkness of character but his purity shines through. Overall, excellent actors and a script which could be looked on as a man falling down. The film goes for the throat and heart and pulls it off well. The viewer feels for all the characters in some way, theres no set villian. In the end, everyone gets ripped off in some way, monetarily, socially,physically, or emotionally. Fair warning though, the film does make some viewer's angry. It did me, but that was half the enjoyment of this film. How well it played the audience. So, if you liked any films like Just Cause, Falling Down, or Bringing Out the Dead, this film works on some of the same levels. How long can any one person fight? How far should we go to punish the guilty? When does something become wrong? One would think Schumacher would have made his characters and his Gotham in the Batman films at least half as seedy as he made the back rooms and characters Tom Welles deals with, and, if you have seen this movie, you know that would have been a more Burton-esque Batman. Overall, 8MM gets one of my highest recommendations, but I would watch it before I bought it. Its worth a watching, but its not everyone's cup of tea.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A similar formula....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>used about five to seven years ago; this film may remind you of "Se7en" in that it exposes ways of life some would rather not see, admit to or acknowledge. Also the movie "The Cell" used exactly the same soundtrack when we see the Vincent D'Onofrio character as an abused child.The same incidental music as we are following Nicolas Cage, an esteemed private detective, attempting to find the whereabouts of Maryann Matthews, a nameless teenager, who disappeared somewhere in the trenches of L.A. There is no red light district there, but if you walk along Hollywood Boulevard it is close enough to the way NYC used to look on 42nd Street before the mayor cleaned it up.James Gandolfini is especially sleazy as a small-time porn producer; Anthony Heald as a sleazy lawyer (sorry to be redundant) and Cage is hired by the widow of a wealthy industrialist's who wants to solve the mystery of this 8mm film. She is mystified as to why her husband would have really commissioned a "snuff" film, although the point of knowing this after he is deceased seems a slight mystery.Cage is very good, and Catherine Keener is his wife, who is not given a significant role, but is good enough. Peter Stormare also could have been given a meatier role, his character was more interesting than Gandolfini.The visuals seem similar to "Se7en" in that we see the seamier side of life, one scene where the nun hands Cage the victim's suitcase and asks him to give it back to her family is especially touching. There are also a few subliminal references to religion; the wealthy widow's name is "Christian", she lives in a compound, isolated from the world, but not protected from the harsh reality of her husband's perversion. Also, as Cage is chasing down Machine (well portrayed by Bauer), Bauer/Machine's mother takes a bus to her church meeting, and also has a statue of the Virgin Mary on her lawn.All in all an interesting film that could have been more developed. I have not seen the sequel. The fact that this is a Joel Schumacher film really has no bearing on anything; The film itself represents a story, presents it well, and is worth watching. Know beforehand that this may not be for everyone's taste, however. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Eight millimeter is a gritty and disturbing look into the world of underground illegal pornography with a wonderful performance from the supporting cast including James Gandolfini(the sopranos) who play's a sleazy porn star agent, and Peter Stormare(Fargo) a twisted pornographer with the delusion of artistic genius. the film to say the least is fantastic but certainly not for the easily offended or faint hearted. starting with the discovery of a snuff film in a deceased business mans secret safe, a private investigator portrayed by Nicholas Cage(Raising Arizona)goes on a physically and emotionally draining journey to find out the authenticity of the film and who was involved in its production definitely a film that has to be seen to be truly appreciated i suggest not watching it to late at night. i give this film a definite 8.5 out of ten.Gritty, Disturbing and fantastic, definitely take a shower after watching this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of best movies I have seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>8MM is one of best movies I have seen. Nicolas Cage plays his role very good, which I expected having seen "Lord or War "recently. The plot is interesting and so are the dialogs between characters. There are quite a few tense moments in the movie ? which is probably why I liked this movie that much.Again trough it is only a movie as someone may say ? it shows you a bit of the reality out there- the one which people don't want to admit that it exists. The movie is basically a mystery with some action elements. My opinion is that its rating on IMDb should be much higher ? but well I guess not everyone likes movies like this one ? trough I wonder why since there are many other movies that are much harder to watch than this one.One of the best things about 8 MM is its soundtrack honestly it is rare to find such a carefully chosen music to go with the scenes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As the user comments show this movie is either very much liked or very much disliked by its viewers. Although I don't want anything to do with the subject matter of the movie (snuff movies) I belong to the first category of viewers. This is an almost unprecedented movie for Hollywood, telling a very unusual and unsexy (no pun intended) story.Together with the outstanding performances that is exactly why this movie deserves so much more credit. The plot is good and dirty, the acting is solid throughout and the score is just brilliant and haunting. Joel Schumacher deserves applause for taking on this project and for choosing Nicolas Cage for the lead character he made a very good decision: no-one can play a man torn-apart between two extremes better than him --&gt; see Adaptation!Because it is so dark and unconventional for Hollywood standards this movie is not getting the praise it deserves. Granted, it is not a run-of-the-mill feel-good movie, but a sinister and dark picture from the writer of Se7en. 8MM is as good as Se7en and it deserves the same treatment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbing subject matter, yet a great film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll never forget first seeing this film in the theater. When I heard that this film was written by the same writer as "Seven", I expected a truly sick and twisted film. Now don't get me wrong, this most certainly is a sick and twisted film, but it wasn't nearly as graphic as I expected. Maybe that is due to this film having a different director, but nonetheless the film wasn't as graphic as I'd expected. With that said, and having watched this film a number of times, I still wouldn't recommend this film to everyone. If you like thrillers and can handle the subject of pornography and "snuff" films, then you should definitely give this film a chance.I'm a little surprised that this film has such a low rating on IMDB. I can see why someone wouldn't like it, but I can't see why it would have such a low rating. I would assume that most viewers couldn't handle the subject and therefore gave the film a low rating.All of the actors involved in this film did a very good job. Nicholas Cage was great as always (sometimes a little over-acting, but most of the time he was great). James Gandolfini, Joaquin Phoenix, Peter Storemare, Anthony Heald, Catherine Keener, and the rest of the supporting cast all pulled off solid performances.Joel Schumacher really needs to stick with films like this. He really does a great job with thriller/drama type films (and needs to steer clear of certain super-hero films). Joel did a great job with this film and I look forward to his next work.The only complaint I have about the film is the music. There were some times were the music was perfect or tolerable, but there were others where it was just horrible and detracted from the film. Some of the music in the film was too bizarre and didn't fit with the film.Like I said, I wouldn't recommend this to everyone, but I thought this was an excellent film. I hope you enjoy the film. Thanks for reading,-Chris</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark and disturbing, yes, but it should also be clearly noted that 8MM avoids, for the most part, the almost always destructive influence of Hollywood.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>8MM is a dark, disturbing movie. It's literally dark due to the low lighting, it has a mesmerizing but undeniably creepy score, the performances from everyone involved are subdued and sinister, and the subject matter, above all, is not exactly uplifting. It is not surprising, then, that many people are going to leave this movie with a disgusted feeling, thinking that they have been tricked into watching a movie that left them feeling badly. On the one hand, it should be noted that 8MM was never exactly advertised as light entertainment, but even more importantly, all of the dark elements above go together very smoothly, even if not very happily. 8MM, it cannot be denied, is simply a dark movie, and the way I see it, there is no reason that that alone should count against it. Nicholas Cage takes on the role of Tom Welles, who is a loving husband and father with a comfortable family life, and is very similar to several other roles that Cage has played (see The Rock and half of The Family Man, for example), except that his ultimate fate in this movie is something that has yet to be encountered by any of the other characters in his iconography. Having taken the rather unexpected turn after law school of pursuing a career in surveillance (he was sure that it was going to be the big thing in the future), he spends much of his time as a sort of private detective, mostly for people who suspect that their spouses are unfaithful. His latest job, the one with which the films concerns itself, is the one that will Change His Life Forever, as has become the saying about this movie.The widow of a wealthy man has hired Welles to investigate what appears to be a snuff film which was found in her late husband's private chamber, wanting only to learn that the film is a fake and let the matter rest. Whether or not snuff films are real or are simply urban legends is a subject which the film wisely chooses to avoid, for the most part. Welles explains to the woman that snuff films are made just like Hollywood movies, with special effects and make-up and the like, and that they don't really exist in real life, but the rest of the film leaves the matter up to individual interpretation. The mystery surrounding snuff films is not something that 8MM seeks to resolve, but is instead a starting point that the film uses to create an interesting story. From there, we are taken on a wild ride through the depths of the Los Angeles underground porn world, which is by itself probably the most destructive element of the entire film, if only because it's so obviously over-exaggerated. You have the mindlessly twisted director, Dino Velvet (Peter Stormare), who makes some serious porn videos with the sick and twisted content of your choosing (and many of which star the charmingly named "Machine"). Then you have the unfortunate Max California, who went to Los Angeles with lofty goals and wound up as a smut peddler in the underground, and ultimately talks Welles into allowing him to give Welles a tour of the underworld of the sex trades, a job that would also change HIS life forever, and not necessarily for the better. And by the way, does anyone know why Joaquin Phoenix keeps getting these less than enviable roles? That poor guy gets the shaft in every movie he's in!The tour that California gives Welles of the underworld of the sex trades is by itself the most hilariously unrealistic part of the entire film (and, by the way, the fact that this character is named `Max California'- and I'm thinking `Maximum California' ? coupled with the fact that he is involved in this particular profession is clearly making a statement about The Golden State, and there's really not a whole lot of room for individual interpretation as to what that message is). I'm not exactly an expert on anything that goes on in the illegal underground of any major city, but I find it highly unlikely that there are basements under buildings down dark alleys that have stacks of porn which are labeled in large print as to what they contain (one particular stack, loudly labeled `KIDS,' comes immediately to mind). And even if places like this did exist, it's even less likely that they would have one big guard standing at the door, indifferently surveying the entering clientele about whether or not they are police officers. What does this guy expect? `You a cop?' `Oh, yes, as a matter of fact, I am. Thanks for asking, I'll leave you alone now.' I would like to have seen THAT guy suffer Max's fate.There are obviously a lot of moral questions presented by the film, and they are presented in some pretty interesting ways, not the least of which is the scene near the end where Welles telephones the mother of the girl in the alleged snuff film and asks her to talk him into killing who the man who made the film (James Gandolfini, who is wonderfully villainous in his role as the guy who is literally sick and twisted for no good reason). Welles knows that he is not a murderer himself, even if this murder would be beneficial to the greater good of mankind, and this is exactly the kind of help that he needs to commit such a murder. This is a very unique scene in that it's very rare for the protagonist to be so reluctant to kill the man who he has been searching for throughout the entire film, especially because the vast majority of the audience will be rooting for this guy's death ? I know I was. It is interesting to consider the motives of writer Andrew Kevin Walker - who is not a stranger to dark films that culminate in a hero forced to murder a despicable villain ? in adding this scene in the film, because it is the exact opposite of what we would expect from the typical Hollywood film. 8MM is a film that has a lot to say, and not all of these things deal directly with the subject matter that it deals with. The existence of snuff films and the violent exploitation of various groups, such as women and (particularly) children, is the disturbing topic on which the film bases a number of questions about the uprightness of modern American society. We start off concerned with whether or not the snuff film is real, then we're further astonished to learn that it IS real, and finally we're left questioning ourselves because we were so eager to witness another violent death. It seems, then, that the film's main concern deals with the hypocrisy of American society, in that we are shocked and disgusted by violence and death at the beginning of the film, but then only a couple hours later we want nothing more than to see more of it served.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Engaging the first time round ***possible spoilers***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie one and two halves times. I bought the VCD just to see Joaquin Phoenix as Max California. I said two halves because after the first viewing "8MM" is about as exciting as a Maths exam. I can't even sit through this movie for a few more times for my favourite actor (Phoenix). Having said that, "8MM" is one of my favourites. Firstly, it introduced me to the great talent that Phoenix is. Secondly, it made me think long and hard about the perversity in human beings. And what I thought about made me sad, but nevermind. Third, I truly enjoyed it when I saw it on HBO. I can't deny that. "8MM" doesn't make me feel dirty, it doesn't excite me *that* way, it *didn't* bore me...it just made me sad. Granted, Joel Schumacher doesn't seem to know where he's heading, and the ending was kind of stupid. Nicolas Cage could have been better, but then, he could have been worse. The whole movie seems terribly messed up...but hey, isn't that what the pornographic world is? Terribly messed up?**possible spoilers**Amy Morton was absolutely wonderful as the stressed out mother. She had me sympathising with her, and among so many messed up characters she is the one I remember the most. Along with Max California, who was excellently portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix, who seems to have a way of changing his voice for his roles. Like many other users have said Max was the only comic relief in the movie. It was quite tragic and stupid on the script writers' part what happened to him. Phoenix played Max's last scene with such terrifying realism, it was painful to watch. (According to Schumacher on the DVD though Phoenix *really* -became- Max. He wasn't acting there, he was truly terrified of the other actors.) That guy who played Dino was also good, in fact almost every cast member was good, except Catherine Keener who annoyed me terribly and, sadly, Nicolas Cage, who looked like he was sleepwalking through half of it. But then again like I've said before, he could have been worse. So now do I really need to reinforce my opinion that Joaquin Phoenix is the best thing since sliced bread, and he was the best thing in "8MM"?"8MM" is definitely a dark movie, but on the other hand its darkness makes it realistic. Because what happens to Mary Anne is something I see happening right now. That is the sadness of it, that and the fact that normal people like you and me (like Machine) are twisted enough to want to make people suffer because "they can".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of Schumacher's Better Efforts.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every time I think of Joel Schumacher I cringe. Is Batman &amp; Robin really so bad that it makes me want to disregard the rest of his films? He's not a bad director, hell I enjoy some of his work, yet I still cringe when I hear his name. Let's take a look at 8MM, something that is the polar opposite of B&amp;R.It stars Nic Cage as a private investigator, hired to find out if the content on an 8MM tape found in a safe of a recently deceased millionaire is real. The tape is referred to as a snuff film, which is a pornographic film that ends with the murder of the female. So, already we have ourselves a pretty dark and disturbing film here. Yet, as I watched it I felt that is played it a little too safe.Upon research you will find out the writer and the director had a falling out over the film. The studio wanted it to be a bit lighter, and the director agreed. While the writer, who also wrote Se7en, wanted to keep the gritty disturbing feel he had originally wrote. The final product is a film that tries to be more hardcore then it actually is.Nic Cage really seemed to be playing by the numbers here. He is more monotone then usual I thought and didn't really seem invested in his character. Joaquin Phoenix on the other hand immerses himself into this world. Playing the sidekick who is smarter then he looks. The supporting cast also includes James Gandolfini, doing what he does best and Peter Stormare. Both stretch out beyond the page and embody their characters. With Gandolfini, we've seen him do this character before. But with every performance there is just one little thing that makes them all seem different every time.I was really underwhelmed with this flick. It was a bit longer then it needed to be, just over 2 hours. You go along for the investigative ride and are interested with the story, but at the end you just feel empty. Never connecting with the relationship between the main character and his wife he neglects. Some scenes that were meant to be powerful came off as comedic to me, specifically the "Give me permission to hurt them" bit near the end.I did enjoy the film, but wanted more. The ingredients were there to make a really good film, but the final product falls a bit flat. It's a rental, or if you are really a big fan of anyone involved . I will say this though, I wouldn't mind if Cage went back to making movies like this instead of the filler he's been cranking out the last few years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but not brilliant!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>8MM has come in for some strong criticism, some of it justified but most of it not! Yes the film is VERY dark &amp; disturbing and it's not like viewers are not warned of this fact! Some of the scenes set in the 'seedy sex world' can be quite hard to take and I'll admit to gasping with horror a few times during the film - but I was expecting that. I think the film runs at an excellent pace and I became engrossed in the story - I wanted the to end to come, not because I wasn't enjoying the film, but became I wanted to find out what REALLY happened to the missing girl. The ending is good, but is also a bit predictable in my view, which was slightly disappointing. Also, Nic Cage wasn't really convincing in the final few scenes, which is a shame, because I did start to lose interest then, because by then I already knew what happened to the missing girl (I won't ruin it). In fact, in my view, Nic Cage is the only thing that stops this film being brilliant, as opposed to just being good! I think this may have been a simple case of miscasting - I'm sure someone like Johnny Depp would have made Welles more convincing and a bit more 'gritty'. Joaquin Phoenix is brilliant as Max California and I think his character should have been used more then it was. He provides some humour in what is a very dark film and adds depth to the movie. In summary, 8MM is good but not brilliant and as stated above, I think this is down to the miscasting of Nic Cage in the role of Tom Welles. However, thankfully I was able to see beyond that and enjoyed the film for what it was... an eye-opening look at the seedy sex underworld with a gripping story included. I'll give it 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>8MM is a very dark, disturbing film that isn't for everyone. Nicolas Cage puts in an excellent performance as a private detective named Tom Welles who is hired to investigate whether a snuff film is real or acted. His journey takes him farther and farther into the realm of pornography. Every minute of this film is suspenseful and riveting. I also found Joaquin Phoenix's performance to be outstanding as well. This movie does a wonderful job of creating a dark mood and exploring the motives and drives behind its characters. One of Cage's best, and a severely under-rated film.</fullReview>

This research is entering a sordid world of shocking snuff- movies.The film shows a world known only by the urban legends where appears to the desire adolescent to succeed in the world of film and fashion, so present in our day. The illusion and the desire become deep disappointment and humiliation when the reality shows that by having a pretty face is not reached the cherished triumph in most cases.The best part of the film is when the main protagonist discovers the plot and completely changes the behavior shown so far. The emotions and feelings open step a discharge of anger translated into some acts to the whole world have been passed by the head to hear any news horrible related to the underworld that shows the film. Nicolas Cage, magnificent actor in "Leaving Las Vegas" meets in his role as detective embodiment to man that inevitably crosses his limits when the horrendous of reality exceeds his mental capacity without remedy. Very human performance of Cage in his relationship with Janet Mathews (Amy Morton) the mother of the girl disappeared.The first part of the film presents a good pace and increases the interest as displayed new data on the case, but the outcome, which shows the second part of the film offers lower brilliance in some of the proceedings of players and certain added at the end, too used in this genre of films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"8MM" is unique masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tom Welles (Nicolas Cage) is private investigator, who is hired to discover if a "snuff film" is authentic or not. Welles is hired by a wealthy widow, whose well-known husband passed away recently. She has found a reel of S8-film in a safe. On the film is a cruel slaughtering of a young girl, who obviously does not pretend or act in this so called "snuff film". Welles soon sinks deeper and deeper into world of people who are making these kind of movies.Here in Croatia there are lots of movies on TV at Saturday night. When you decide to stay at home on Saturday night you just want to watch one good movie. That Saturday on TV there where movies like "Unforgiven", "Fallen", "The 6th Day", "Seabiscuit" and lots more. But I decided to watch "8MM". I didn't read what is this movie about, I just sat there and prepared myself to watch just another thriller. To tell you the truth, I was blown off with it. Blown off by everything considering this movie. Let me tell you why.Without good script there cannot be a good movie. This script was written by Andrew Kevin Walker, writer of "Se7en" and "Sleepy Hollow", two brilliant movies. And in my books this is his third brilliant script. It's just unbelievable that there are persons who hire other people to make "snuff film". How sick you must be to watch this? On that question the whole movie is based. Cage is a man with family (wife and young kid). So one average man is entering in this world. It's brilliant how Schumacher showed us the character of Tom Welles. Welles never imagined that he'll get that deep and that close to truth. When he first saw this "snuff film" he was disgusted but he wanted to find that girl who was on the movie. He wanted to know the truth, just like that old lady, just like the mother of Mary Ann, just like all of us.My favorite scene is when Cage asks the mother of the girl on the "snuff film" if she wants the truth no matter what and then again when he asks her if he can hurt the man who is guilty (Eddie Poole). There are so many emotions in character of Janet Mathews (Amy Morton is excellent) and in acting of Nicolas Cage. And here is the brilliance of this movie. By killing a killer you become one too. And that's what is all about. You become one of them, you are putting yourself on their level. When Cage comes back home and sees his baby-girl, he just cries. Cause sometimes all you can do is cry. But all the tears of this world won't bring murdered people back too life (connection with "Se7en").Cage did his job brilliant, but the real score of this movie are supporting actors. Joaquin Phoenix, James Gandolfini and Peter Stormare. Phoenix especially shines in his role and Gandolfini and Stormare ("Fargo") are excellent choice as bad guys. All actors presented the world of pornography. The ultimate massage to all of us is that this people exist and these crimes are here. Deep in the underworld? Yes, maybe, but we just can't forget that these things are happening on this world, maybe in our country, our neighborhood, very close to us. I just want to say that this is one of the most underrated movies on IMDb and for those people who say that this is one of the worst movies ever made, I advice you just to look deeper at this movie or go ahead and pick some easier movies other time you sit in your sofa, at your perfect world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For 40 years directors have been trying to replicate Hitchcock. Schumacher has come close. Those of my generation have been waiting for that void (Hitchcock) to be filled by a worthy protégé; he may've arrived. Having turned two Grisham books into exceptional movies, Schumacher may have what it takes.Were he to have filmed "8 MM" in black and white, it could have even passed for film noir. The cynicism required of that genre's characters is certainly there (though Cage's in the end spoils it a bit with too much of a "Leave it to Beaver" type finish; I would've ended on a darker note centering on the dissolution of his marriage. Lower camera-angles a-la "The Collector" would've enhanced the fear factor). Chris Bauer's "m-my name's George..." as he lays in the rain in the cemetery at the end, nervously putting on his glasses ... chills are sent up one's spine.Chills that Hitchcock would have given us. Schumacher, you've got what it takes. Just keeping making more like "8 MM".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Cage rocks the screen!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nicholas Cage always seems to have about a half dozen films released every year, with very few ever deserving a second look. But for every 5 five cheesy action flicks he does, he'll show us he can still act by doing a small engaging character drama. The nephew of famed Godfather director Francis Ford Coppola, Cage delivered arguably his best performance in Leaving Las Vegas. A role that earned him an Academy Award for Best Actor in 1996.8MM was released in 1999 and has been a sort of lost gem that does deserve a second look. A talented supporting cast of Joaquin Phoenix, James Gandolfini &amp; Katherine Keener kicks this film up a few notches. Although the plot and subject matter might turn a few people off. 8MM refers to an old movie reel that is found in the safe of a recently deceased wealthy industrialist. It's a snuff film, where a person is killed on film after being possibly raped or tortured. The elderly widow calls on Cage's character of Tom to investigate the authenticity of the film. Tom is a suburban family man with a wife (Keener) and a baby daughter. He works as a private investigator and after viewing the disturbing film, decides to take the job. Cage usually inhabits these crazy, eccentric characters, but with Tom he grounds him with a quiet professional dignity. As he and a young adult book store employee Max California (Phoenix) dig deeper into the world of underground pornography and fetishism Tom will risk going down a dark path that some people never return. There is a great quote from Max that goes "There are some things that you see, and you can't unsee them. Know what I mean?" Tom and Max start investigating porn producer Eddie Poole (Gandolfini) and find that he is connected to the making of the snuff film. Tom then visits the murdered girls mother and this is where the film really gets a lot of its heart. The girl was Mary Ann Matthews; a real person and not just some statistic. She is not a forgotten runaway, but a lost girl who drifted too far away from the people who loved her. Tom wants to find the people responsible more for the girl's mother, than for the job he is being paid for. I won't get into the ending or any spoilers, but it could be looked at a few different ways. The plot and story in general needs to be taken as entertainment only. It tries to be real and authentic, but it does take place in a "movie world" and not the "real world". If any of that make sense. As I write this Nic Cage is on a streak of terrible action movies so he is due for a winner and soon.8MM was directed by Joel Schumacher, most known for a bunch of 90s action movies like Batman &amp; Robin, A Time to Kill &amp; The Client. A straight to DVD sequel was released in 2005 and only uses the original title to con people into renting a shitty movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Incredible film, picking up the box I never thought it would be about this (I don't normally read the back of boxes as it spoils it for me). The disturbing bits were some of the pornographic scenes and the pornographic violence scenes that were shown during the movie. However it was a very enjoyable and gripping film that I throughly enjoyed. I recommend this to you as a midnight-thriller (as such), but I do warn that it is a long film so best so stock up on snacks before watching. I give 9/10 for the brilliant performance of Cage and the excellent screen play &amp; script quality. This film also has excellent music that keeps the suspense and the moment going. As a final note, the film does contain some blood, gore and horror and some very disturbing films. This film is not suitable for young.</fullReview>

With a great beginning and middle i found myself really disappointed by the end, where it just turns into your average macho punch em up film.Cage is excellent as always but the real stand out performance here is Joaquin Phoenix as Max the porn star clerk. Phoenix is flawless in his role and really elevated the movie. Catherine Keener has a small role in the movie as cages wife and is rather under used for an actress with such great talent.Overall worth checking out but prepare to be disappointed.</fullReview>

The writing - the last line of this movie is "Save Me". Every goosebump on your skin just went up. Cage's concern for the girl is so haunting and believable. There are parts of this movie that are 100% about Joel Schumacher about being unflinchingly honest about man's capacity to get turned on by the dark side and his struggle with that that is so non-Hollywood, non-sanitized and non-preachy. If you liked Silence of the Lambs NOT because Tony Hopkins was sooooo creepy but because it exposed honestly a dark underworld - Buffalo Bill, etc, you will be drawn to this film. Cage's empathy, acting as a conduit for Joel, I found to be deeply moving. I have a hard time understanding why people have such contempt for this movie. My guess is that they are in denial about their own dark temptations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark,disturbing,thrilling... and for that worth a watch!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really liked 8mm. Didn't know much about the film in 1999, nor had i seen the trailer, nor had anyone told me about this film. That is the best way to go into a movie; nothing is present beforehand to put you off viewing the film or over hype its quality. And it paid off. This movie has good, grounded characters (Cage as a detective investigating the origin of a snuff film and Phoenix playing a sidekick type character helping him); an interesting and thrilling plot and additionally for me, an ending that i was satisfied with. And that is so important! I know Joel Schumacer has done some terrible films in the past like Batman and Robin, but this one is filmed well, paced well and is definitely worth a watch once or twice again. It's very dark, disturbing and has some great twists.My score = 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful statement that goes nowhere</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was struck by how poignant this film portrays itself to be. Yes, it's dark, dirty, and disturbing, but underneath all of that there is an incredible statement on our lives. We catch a glimpse of this in a few scenes, but it can never seem to break through. It feels like this film is on the verge of something really great, but ends up dwelling in the disgusting underworld of porn and snuff. This world is so horrible that the light can't find it's way through. No matter how you feel about 8mm, it will make you think and effect you in some way.It builds to a very intense climax, but continues on only to end flat on it's face. Although not a great film, 8mm may be an important one, and one that should be seen. **1/2/****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbing Images and Atmosphere, Plus Strong Acting from Nicholas Cage, Anthony Heald, and James Gandolfini, Highlight " 8MM "</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>" 8 MM " is one of the most disturbing films I have ever seen, but it does not wallow in its own depravity, only touches the surface. It begins by acquainting us with the life of private detective Tom Welles ( a strong performance by Nicholas Cage ). He is not a particularly happy man, pleased only by his concerned wife ( Catherine Keener ) and his newly born daughter. His job is disturbing and deplorable; he does not relish it. One day, he receives a call from Daniel Longdale ( a slimy, smarmy performance by the great character actor Anthony Heald ), the lawyer for a rich widow, Mrs. Christian ( Myra Carter ), asking for his services. Once he arrives, he is told of a reel of 8mm found in her late husband's safe. Longdale explains that they had to get a locksmith to open it. Welles is concerned and views the footage, the camera showing his reactions, with quick cuts to the murder. It turns out to be a snuff film, featuring a young girl being brutally murdered by a man in a leather mask. Mrs. Christian will go to any means necessarily, no matter how much money it takes, to find out who this girl was and if she really was killed. Welles begins his journey, much to the chagrin of his wife, starting out by looking through missing-persons files at a investigatory bureau. The clerk explains the process he should use to find this girl and points out the coffee machines, saying they will be his best friend in the next few days. His search is long and tedious, and he finds the girl, Mary Ann Matthews, a high school student from dreary urbanity. We meet her mother ( Amy Morton ), a cashier at the local food store, and feel her pain as she tells Welles of the circumstances of her daughter's running away. We sympathize with her because she is not a bad mother, just lonely and confused like most of us. With a lead from the girl's diary, he journeys to California, where he begins investigating local porn shops, looking for any evidence of her, anywhere he can get information about the type of film she was in. In one of the stores, he meets a youthful clerk named Max ( Joaquin Phoenix ), who serves as his guide to this world. Max is not a pervert, just a punk rocker with a brain, one of the many castaways of that world. He is only trying to survive and Welles' deal is intriguing, but also pays. Easy money for easy work ( or maybe not ). Welles soon comes into contact with a variety of degraded smut-dealers, including the venemous and paranoid Eddie Poole ( a repulsive James Gandolfini ), the owner of a small-time movie-making office, and Dino Velvet ( a creepy Peter Stormare ), a filmmaker who is a lizardy portrait. In his scenes, Velvet slinks around with a soft, malevolent tone in his voice and evil in his eyes. The point of the film is to show how dark and despairing this country really is. This is what is behind the closed doors, the shut curtains. Welles is a strong character, truly conflicted by his sense of what is right and wrong. Nicholas Cage brings out the despair in this man with a subtle touch. James Gandolfini is quite good as the porn shop owner, displaying force, yet repressiveness in all of his scenes- we truly realize that this guy is a sleazeball. Anthony Heald is impeccable as Mrs. Christian's smarmy lawyer and we appreciate his sliminess, the true embodiment of a counsel. Peter Stormare is haunting as Dino Velvet. Myra Carter, Amy Morton, and Catherine Keener support these men nicely, their performances subtle, not over-done, but human, Carter grieving and broken, Morton strong-headed, but lonely, Keener confused and supportive. The performances in this film are excellent, but the atmosphere makes it, a gritty, dreary montage. This is a dark, disturbing piece of underworld Americana, with true emotions about good and evil, and how power, the chance of stardom, can dilute a young woman and make sleaze so overbearing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Under Rated dark film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, I agree, this film is Under Rated.Do not be fooled, if you're looking for a nasty horror, gore-fest snuff film, then this is NOT it. Instead this is a thriller based story that unfolds to reveal the nasty world on snuff films.The subject matter is somewhat interesting, but the characters are by far the most interesting part of this film. It does seem to be extremely well cast. You really do despise the Eddie Poole guy (well known for doing Sopranos), he is one nasty man. The dark locations and seedy settings are truly comparable to the writers other hit Se7en.I had no idea what the film was about, and assumed 8mm was some reference to a gun, but I was clearly wrong. Nicholas Cage has done some mediocre performances in the past and hence I was willing to watch this film. From the off set I was gripped; I must admit I enjoy dark films like Se7en, Sleepy Hollow and now 8mm. I cannot begin to describe how dark and seedy the film is and how horrid the locations are, but it really is done well.Nicholas Cage truly portrays his character well, being a middle-class non-descript (ordinary) private detective, but is lured into this dark and seedy world. His curiosity getting the better of him, and a sense of finding justice ? our hero is born (I cannot say more than that). Tom Welles really does seem out of his depth. Again, as previously said, the other characters are cast well and all seem to belong to this ghastly underworld.Joaquin Pheonix plays the ever-inquisitive sidekick very well and it was the first time I took notice of him. Again he fits into the role well.Other than cast and film settings the plot is nicely balanced too. It's not complex, so don't expect a murder mystery as such, but its far more complex than any action movie and is somewhat interesting, if not plain disturbing. It's not as far fetched as the likes of Hostel, nor is it as graphic. In fact the scenes of violence are kept to a minimum and hence the story and acting prove to be strong.So if you enjoy being thrilled by the darker side of films, then sit back, close the curtains and prepared to be disturbed. I would suggest decent sounds (be it surround-sound or Hi-Fi) are needed; there is the odd quiet then loud scary moment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, solid mystery/thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, the movie graphic, both in violence and sexuality. This is the kind of movie that critics just ache to criticize. I'm sure they were coming up with wisecracks before the film even appeared on the screen. How can you make a movie about the world of hardcore pornography, and not include images of hardcore pornography? Of course, it's shown within the boundaries of an R-rating, but there's no reason why it shouldn't be shown. You can't show "Schindler's List" without horrific images of the Holocaust. Why is it OK to show horrific images in one movie and not another? Neither film tries to be exploitative. Joel Schumacher has made some lemons, but his work is often very good. I think "Falling Down" is a great movie, and "Phone Booth" is one of the best films I've seen this year. This is also one of his good films. It's a mystery, and has some interesting detective work--which I'm a sucker for. Not to mention, it has Nicolas Cage. He's one of my favorite actors, and makes every moment of the film credible with his performance. I also like Catherine Keener, but too bad she didn't have much to do in a small, moderately nondescript role. And who could not love James Gandolfini? The same goes with Peter Stormare, who makes a wonderful villain. Jaoquin Phoenix is fully convincing in his offbeat role. The film is dark and disturbing, but that's a good thing. It's a thriller, not a damn Disney movie! You're looking to be disturbed. It's written by Andrew Kevin Walker, the talented screenwriter of "Se7en." Trust me, don't believe the negative press. This is an exciting, suspenseful film that grabs your attention. My score: 7 (out of 10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Buyer beware. Know what you're going to see &amp; you won't be disappointed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I heard a lot of hype about how terrible and graphic this movie is. Of course like most of the public, when I hear something like that, then I have to see it for myself. I'm a believer that if you want to be critical, you have to see the movie first. And I'll try any movie at least once. For this movie once is enough, which is not to say that I regret seeing it. I believe people should be open to new experiences. This movie is basically a murder mystery. People keep comparing it to Seven, but as I've said in previous reviews, there's no point to comparing movies, they should be judged on their own merits. There are many reasons to see a movie, to be uplifted, to laugh, to learn, to be shocked, to be enobled. At the box office, there was a sign about 8MM saying, know what movie you are going to see, no refunds, graphic content. This is a movie that attempts to tell a story about a man's descent into his own horror when he discovers how far he is willing to go to find who murdered a young girl. He also discovers that he's willing to cross the rather fuzzy line between good &amp; evil when he himself is faced with vengeance. Some of the movies best lines are delivered by Joaquin Phoenix. Especially in the realm of how evil and ugliness affect your soul. This movie *is* affecting &amp; ugly, but not in a pointless way. It is admittedly a "slice of life" that few of us would seek to see or enjoy, but is nevertheless, there. If you're not the type to like seeing the under belly of society, don't go see a movie about it. This movie was tastefully done, if that can be said about a movie where much of the time is spent seeking porno movies of people being killed. In all events, know what you're going to see &amp; you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Private eye Tom Welles (Nicolas Cage) has a regular family life with his wife (Catherine Keener) and a baby. Daniel Longdale (Anthony Heald) is a lawyer of recently widowed Mrs. Christian. She found a shocking snuff film in her husband's possessions and she wants Welles to check its authenticity. He is hired to find the missing girl. He finds a missing report for Mary Ann Mathews which leads to California. He enlists the help of porn store clerk musician Max (Joaquin Phoenix). The trail leads to pornographer Eddie Poole (James Gandolfini) and then Dino Velvet (Peter Stormare).I really like the moody feel at the start but the L.A. stuff is borderline silly. Some of the investigation is a bit too old school. I get a sense that director Joel Schumacher is trying to hard-boiled this thriller more than necessary as a style choice. Nicolas Cage is able to keep this train on track with his intensity. Phoenix adds a good dash of color. This movie is like one of those serial killer movies. It is both disturbing and compelling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A descent into depravity.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This effectively somber and seedy drama plays somewhat like the George C. Scott film "Hardcore" of 20 years previous. There's no denying that it gets pretty grim and ugly, so it's not for all tastes, and will be hard for some viewers to take. Nicolas Cage does a solid job as a private investigator named Tom Welles, who's hired by the elderly Mrs. Christian (Myra Carter) to examine an item she's found in her late husbands' possession. It seems to be an honest- to-God snuff film, and Toms' job will be to find out if in fact the girl in the film really did die. His investigation takes him into a pornographic underworld populated by an abundance of stereotypically twisted monsters. They're not all bad, though: Joaquin Phoenix, in a highly engaging performance, is a new acquaintance named Max California whose dreams of fame and fortune didn't pan out and who now works in a sex shop. Max, seeming to be somewhat bored, welcomes the opportunity to assist in Welles's inquiries. Among the assorted lowlifes are slimy film director Dino Velvet (Peter Stormare, who's a real scene stealer), "Machine" (Chris Bauer), the masked star of Velvets' epics, and volatile thug Eddie Poole (James Gandolfini). This film is not exactly unpredictable, as it leads to a fair bit of foreseeable developments, and as it plays out falls into the "talking villain" trap more than once. Still, this is a reasonably compelling, fascinating walk on the dark side of life, at least in the early going, before the story telling starts becoming more conventional. A good supporting cast really helps. Anthony Heald, no stranger to slime ball roles himself, is an attorney, Catherine Keener, rather wasted, plays the thankless role of the concerned wife, and Carter is fine as the guilt ridden old lady. The best scenes revolve around the haunted mother of the murder victim, extremely well played by Amy Morton, and the climactic confrontation with Machine is also superb in the way it dispenses with some clichés and negates any sort of preconceived notions we might have had about the character. Jenny Powell, who plays the victim, is a stripper in real life and some actual porn actresses pop up in bits. The look of the film is appropriately gloomy, with lots of night scenes and the aforementioned climax which conveniently takes place in the rain. Overall, not bad; the film has some humour but mostly plays it straight until its inevitable conclusion. Followed by a direct to DVD sequel. Seven out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like Hardcore but with Suspense and Revenge on the Side. Good Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I put off watching this movie for 12 years thinking that it was just a remake of Hardcore from the 70's with George C. Scott and Peter Doyle and the private eye. Hardcore was one of my favorite movies as a kid. Jism Jim and George C. had some great lines in the movie and it was seedy and scummy enough to inspire this 13 year old's imagination.Fast forward 25 years to last night, my old lady wanted to watch a thriller on the Roku and this one popped up so I caved in and watched it. You know what? This is how a remake should be done. The story is altered enough to make it fresh and new elements are added to boost the juice.The original Hardcore had the guy's runaway daughter get into drugs and porn and associating with a snuff film producer. George C. Scott takes over from the lame private eye and teams up with a peep show girl to traverse the sex trade underground in search of Rattan, the snuffer, and his daughter. Once he finds her, she is alive and it is over.In 8mm, Cage is the private dick trying to figure out if the girl on film is really dead and he teams up with a loser who works at an adult book store to traverse the seedy underground of the sex business. Of course the chick really is dead, but Cage finds the film makers and gets revenge for the snuffed teen. Also there is a twist with his client's lawyer being in on it and double crossing Cage. So this movie is similar to Hardcore but darker and with revenge, action and a lame twist thrown in.I've got to say that Schumacher must've found the scumiest locations in each city to shoot because man he made New York, LA, Cleveland, and Pittsburgh look like the most depressing places on the planet. Great acting by Gandolfini as the seedy and greedy producer and the guy who played Dino Velvet, ever so creepy and deranged.If you've been putting this off because you're a fan of Hardcore and think that this is just a straight remake, give it a look see. It is different enough from the original to be interesting and has some more elements to it.As far as the twist. It was lame and almost predictable. A better twist would have been to mimic the old movie and have the girl alive but all strung out and in love Dino and the Machine then having her kill Cage so that her mother never finds out where she is. Now that is a much better twist and in the spirit of the original film. But overall the movie was dark, depressing and good. Give it a chance. AnchovyD</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first heard about 8mm when I was surfing the writer Andrew Kevin Walker's name due to penning 'Se7en' and at first I thought a film about a snuff, This must be good but then I saw who the director was... Joel Schumacher, the guy who completely obliterated the old Batman franchise, I also read that Walker wasn't happy with the film as well. However, I was willing to give the film a chance as it wasn't exactly Batman and Robin.When I watched the film though the first half an hour it seemed more like a soft drama, but then after the story started unravel (NO SPOILERS!)it turned slowly but surely into a adrenaline filled thriller with bits of horror to keep your flesh chilling. I'll admit it isn't the best film ever, the film does take a while to turn up the heat but nevertheless it is still keeps you on the edge of your seat so to speak.The best part of the film is easily towards the end of the film (SPOILER ALERT!) when Nicholas Cage's character goes to assassinate that Machine bloke by breaking into his home and the record player skips causing a chilling symphony of tension. Genius! I mean I thought you couldn't watch a Joel Schumacher film without the help of a scotch, but with 8mm your guaranteed to get a thrill. To Walker's defense I think It wasn't as thrilling as it could have been, I mean the if they made a little more disturbing or darker or even longer, also I think some of the characters weren't as interesting as they could have been as some of the Supporting could have offered a lot more with regards to character and emotion. I think it would have made it from a good film into a great film.And that's all I pretty much have to say on this film...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A private investigator is called in by a wealthy widow to determine the authenticity of a "snuff" film found in the personal safe of her late husband. It's an interesting plot that sends the investigator (Nicholas Cage) combing through the seedy underworld of illegal pornography in order to find the maker of the film. I know, it sounds like a bad b-movie plot that is filled with gratuitous skin shots of would-be actresses, but it isn't. The film is filled with excellent acting. In particular I liked Joaquin Phoenix as the smart and savvy porn store clerk who dreams of being a rock star but got stuck working at a XXX bookstore. Peter Stormare is also excellent as Dino Velvet, a twisted porn producer/director who is as creepy as they come. 8mm is a well made and entertaining move.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>8MM is a good looking film. With a solid cast, a powerful premise, moody lighting and a feel for atmosphere, it is a slick thriller with flowing action. However, if you prefer smarts to good looks there's no way to feel but cheated. This film is but a pale version of what it could have been in the hands of a serious director willing to take some risks.Certain kinds of material can't be taken lightly. If you're going to make a film about sexual violence you should be aiming at more than just entertainment. 8MM aims to reveal some of the darkest corners of the human mind, where sexual perversion goes hand in hand with extreme violence, murder and psychopathy. The mere conception that this snuff-world exists, an underground porno-industry with thematics like sexual assault, real acts of rape and murder caught on film, and that some people are attracted to this kind of material to satisfy their sick forms of desire, is absolutely scary. Private investigator Tom Welles (Nicolas Cage) goes into the heart of this world to discover if such a film, of a girl being violently assaulted and murdered, is real or not, and who's behind it. It is one of the strongest premises to a film I've ever seen, and it could have been a real classic, comparable to `Seven' and `Silence of the Lambs'. The errand of Tom Welles reminded me of Friedkin's `Cruising', where Al Pacino plays an undercover cop in pursuit of a serial killer obsessed with gay sado-masochist practices.8MM promised such a descent into hell. `If you dance with the devil, the devil doesn't change, he changes you'. That is the key-idea of the plot. To find out the truth, the main character has to plunge deep into this world of madness, and by doing so, he'll have to risk his own sanity. Cage says that in the movie: `I want to understand!'. But it's an empty plot he's working with. Although affected, Welles never looses his balance entirely. Why is he obsessed with this murder? Why does he want revenge? If this had been a brave script, the Welles character should have become obsessed with these movies. To understand the psychopathic attraction of repulse. In fact, his very own balance with insanity should have been the reason for his need for revenge. Because maybe that perversion, although repulsive to him, is also attractive to the darkest corners of his mind. The more you see, the more you don't mind seeing. And it should be that hatred, the hatred for his own weakness, that is the weakness of the human soul, that should be the drive for his need for revenge.Maybe a director like Fincher would be willing to explore that path. Joel Schumacher certainly isn't. The visual dress-up of this movie, with stylish looks, dark photography and strong colors, doesn't hide that fact. We never get to understand who Welles really is. His family problems are not explored, and the growing threat to his family is never entirely believable. The scene where Cage makes a phone call to the girl's mother before killing Gandolfini, to get `permission' to perpetrate revenge, is unrealistic and simply ridiculous. The final confrontation with the Machine character is the sum up of this movie's failure. In a script that doesn't develop this character the way it should, all you get is the Machine mumbling some psychological explanations with no consequence to the story. The simple fact that all this needs to be verbalized is a demonstration of what Schumacher was unable to show with his direction. And it's a real shame. A story like this had potential to explore tremendously strong solutions. I have nothing against happy endings, but what are we supposed to conclude from this?Just look at `Seven'. You can't have a film telling you the world is a horrible place, but they live happily ever after.</fullReview>

If you take a look at se7en, angel heart or silence of the lambs, 8mm can't compared in ways of intensivity or how disturbing it was. There are of course some hard scenes in it, but they are personal to the viewers. The second thing I want to mention is that, the immaskation (don't know if that's a word) of maschine is just great! -Spoilers!- He is just a stupid, poor, fat boy. That is really clever I think, because it's a serious way to deal with that kind of topic insteat of wanting to scare people. Ok, what people can critisize is the way "Cage" asks for the right to murder maschine. If he hab murdered him just directly it would have been ok for some reason, but noone can should get the legitimation to kill another. -Spoilers end!- Overall a good movie. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nicholas Cage has played disturbed, hole-in-the-souled charactersbefore, but he had really reached a whole new level of dark in 8MM. In it, he plays Tom, a PI who has had it good thanks to a loving wife and a newborn baby daughter. His happy life takes a swerve when he is hired to find out if a snuff-porn film is authentic or not. His journey takes him to a myriad of cooky characters and false ends that somewhere along the line, he lost track of reality himself. Totally bizarre and disturbing, 8MM definitely has a solid grasp on the viewer. He (or she) can't help but feel sympathetic for Tom even after he took a dive into the abyss. I wouldn't be a bit surprised if the role gave Cage himself a jolt of the senses; makes me wonder if this is the reason why he did a heart-warming tear-jerker like THE FAMILY MAN a year following 8MM!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well acted and directed, but this movie is filled with severely unpleasant and disgusting material, which took away any chance of me actually 'enjoying' the film. It has a very convincing atmosphere. Nicholas Cage and Joaquin Phoenix are both very good. But the ending didn't ring true for me. Joel Schumacher is a good director, I haven't seen his 'Tigerland' as of yet, but I think most of his finished products are beneath what he is capable of.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A paradox of sorts.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching this movie, I was at first skeptical of the plot. A man on a search to find out if a "snuff film" is real? I was unimpressed. However, once I began to watch the film, the plot had me hooked. As Tom Welles (Nicholas Cage) is drawn deeper and deeper into the seedy, dark world of pornography, you begin to feel for him. Joaquin Phoenix as Max California offers himself as a side-kick of sorts, and the chemistry between the two is excellent. Max shows Welles things that Welles will never again be able to "un-see." It probes into the deepest, darkest wretches of the world, making you realize that there ARE sick people out there.Which brings me to the paradox. This film really made me think about what a perverse world we live in. About the sick and twisted terrors that some people engage in on a daily basis. And yet, after all this thoughtfulness, a standard Hollywood-style over-the-top ending was tacked onto it. For those of you who have not seen it, I won't spoil the ending here. It felt out of place, as did what eventually happened to Max California. I felt that Max's final scene was both unnecessary, and uncalled for, and that it degraded the final product. This movie is a paradox, because it brings some new, fresh ideas to the forefront. It makes you think about things that some film makers would have avoided, delving into dark and sick territory. And yet, after it's all said and done, a typical, cookie-cutter ending makes it feel like a let down. Great movie, disappointing ending, and a disappointing final scene with Max California. I still would recommend this movie, simply because it makes you think. But, not just about the dark subject matter, but also about Hollywood, and what the film makers seem to perceive as an "ending."Eight Stars out of ten, with a 1 1/2 points deducted for the ending, and the other 1/2 point deducted for poor ol' Max.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated and chilling study of what people will do for pleasure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>8MM has been maligned by critics for being sick, irredeemable and trashy. Knowing these things before I saw it, I was quite surprised by 8MM, and found it to be an engrossing and well-acted thriller. Notorious for introducing snuff films to the mainstream, 8MM is the story of Tom Welles, a private investigator (Nicholas Cage) who is hired by an old woman to find out if the snuff film her husband owned is genuine, and if the girl who is supposedly killed in it is still alive. Welles is drawn into the seedy world of underground porn to find out about the makers of the film. 8MM is a dark, disturbing (although not as much as it could have been, thankfully) and somewhat sad thriller, sad because the people who make and enjoy snuff films are just regular people, who are starved for pleasure and excitement in their lives. Their are a couple of flaws, mainly Peter Stormares awful performance as a snuff auteur, and sometimes the film feels overlong. 8MM is a depressing, yet occasionally excellent thriller. 7.5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>8mm has once again proved, how committed an actor Nicholas Cage is, to have chosen to act in movies like this. Its so gripping and pulsating, I wonder how it got a rating less than 7 - it deserves much better. First of all its breaks a lot of Hollywood cliches and then it embarks on a totally different path, that it leaves you spell bound and asking for more.Credit should go to director Joel Schumacher, for having made a bold and well-made movie like this. Its a MUST watch for anyone who likes suspense movies with a touch of class. If you are yet to watch it, be ready come face to face with some ugly realities and hypocrisy in this society and come out with a sense of guilt. Don't miss this movie.</fullReview>

The violence in the film is gruesome, but done so tastefully that you think you see more than you actually do. The cinematography was excellent, in addition to the ways in which the shots were lined up.

		<fullReview>When you think back at "8Mm", what comes to your mind first is the depressing feeling you get during the whole movie. Joel Schumacher manages to create a special atmosphere: he uses pale colors, it's dark or rain almost all the time. Just like it's needed for a movie with a pretty original subject: snuff movies. Real or not? Tom Welles (Nicolas Cage) is hired to investigate if a snuff movie, in which a young girl is brutally murdered, is authentic or not. Cage enters into a dark universe filled up with lunatics or psychos. He gets very involved in the case, and ends up doing things he never imagined being capable of. As Joaquin says, "You can't change the devil. The devil changes you". Still the movie is sometimes too slow and boring (in the first part). A subject like this could've had the result a way better movie, but this one's worth to watch. You'll not forget it easily and whenever you look back at it, you'll see darkness and madness. Vote: 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of course this film is not for the squeamish, which is why 8MM hasn't received much critical acclaim and has such an unfair rating on this site. Considering Se7en is similar in many ways, I am surprised that this movie has had much less success, almost slipping by unnoticed.This is a brilliant film. Driven by Nicholas Cage's excellent performance of a man falling into a world he didn't know existed. The downward spiral of a naive, out-of-their-depth character into a hidden underworld hasn't been portrayed this well since Lynch's Blue Velvet. Whilst singling out Cage, I should also point out that the entire cast is excellent. Each actor being well-cast and adding great dimensions to their characters.My only criticism is the stereotypical wife who is loving at the start of the film, and then gets all hysterical and threatening to leave at the end. Sound familiar? But other than that, an excellent achievement of creating a dank, sinister theme that only gets worse as the movie accelerates.Anything that Andrew Kevin Walker's name is attached to, I will make a point of seeing. I love his stories. Anyone who loved Se7en and Sleepy Hollow owes it to themselves to watch and enjoy this outstanding piece of film-making.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I waited a few weeks before adding my comments on this film. It really affected me for days afterward. I would wake up with this film on my mind. I think its a good film but I believe it could have been brilliant. The premise is excellent: a private detective is employed to find out the truth behind a snuff movie. So much could have been achieved by this film but the team making it sold out somewhere along the line ( maybe they did it for the money? ) As it stands Nick Cage does a better job than many people realise. The comment "sleepwalked through his role" has been levelled at Cage a bit but I think this is intended on his part and I don't think he makes any acting mistakes. He walks away from this film spotless. Max California is cool and when he and Cage are onscreen togeather its really enjoyable. The soundtrack is interesting - slightly jarring yes but I liked it. See this movie - its worth it - even if it sucks in places - it does make you think about the root of all evil. This film has done me good - I just wish it could have gone all the way.</fullReview>

Nic Cage is on top form, and Joaquin Phoenix gives the film an extra boost whenever he's on screen as the cool, streetwise Max. I think he should have been in it more, cos the two of them really had good chemistry. I didn't find it *very* disturbing, which is good I guess. It gives you a little bit of insight into the dark underworld of film making. I think my fave bit in the movie, is when Tom and Max are sat watching a 'snuff' movie, and are just sat there, their eyes fixed on the screen, with their hands over their mouths, disgusted at what they see. Brilliant acting from the fab-as-always Nic and sexy-fab-soon-to-be-huge-star Joaquin.....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are planning on seeing 8MM, I will first say, it is not a happy movie. This movie is very dark and ominous in nature. I'm not the kind of guy that only watches dark, somber movies - If a person is stuck to only that genre they might end up being creepy and depressed themselves. I like variety, though. In 8MM, Nicholas Cage plays Tom Wells, a detective who is hired by a rich elderly woman to investigate a film she found in her dead husband's safe that depicts what apears to be a pornography bit but ends with the girl being murdered. As Mr. Wells goes deeper into his case, he gets the assistance of Max California, an employee at an adult book store who turns out to be smarter than he appears. Tom ends up going in over his head and delves deep into the dark underworld of pornography. This movie has an excellent soundtrack that conveys the creepy sense even further. There are a few good comic relief scenes, which in a movie like this are usually welcomed. This film has some good twists, and is very interesting. The actors do a good job in this film, especially Nicholas Cage. Go see 8MM if you are in the mood for an interesting thriller with some twists and a dash of comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw this movie I hated the bad guys so much I walked out of the theatre angry. This is a good thing by-the-way. Not only are the bad guys repellent creeps they are also, in a way, pretty ordinary. You'll never look at a complete stranger the same way again.I thought Nic Cage did a very good job of portraying a squeaky-clean private eye Tom Welles (he's just so innocent looking) descending into the world of hardcore pornography and unknowingly letting it change him.Joaquin Phoenix plays wanna-be musician Max California who is also Welles' sidekick. I'd never really seen him in any movies before this but now that I've seen him in a likable role, in a movie where there are very few likable characters, I look forward to his next movies.Some parts of this film to me are very disturbing, for example the first viewing of the snuff film where we see the girl cry or finale with the jumping record. Joel Schumacher certainly has redeemed himself over Batman and Robin (shudder) and should stop being the victim of nasty criticism by critics who are rubbishing this brilliant film only because Batman and Robin was terrible.If you like your thriller movies to be deep, intense and nerve-racking then watch this movie. In case you didn't know the movie was originally about 3 hours long and an alternate ending had Welles kill himself by driving into a wall.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing this movie in the video store, me and my friend decided to borrow it thinking it might be interesting. By the time we'd finished watching it a whole new side of society had opened up and revealed itself to me. The story is simple- a private eye, hired by an old lady to find out the truth behind a film she found in her deceased husbands safe that shows a young girl being murdered on film- is the murder real? Who were the men who perpetrated the crime? And so begins the journey into a side of society we rarely see, let alone believe exists, a journey that is both dark and disturbing but almost true. It makes you wonder, do you know your friends as well as you'd like to. Is there something that there hiding. Do they have a side that we'd dismiss as fiction? Although this movie isn't gory or graphic(except for one scene) it still has the power to shock you with its images and themes that run through the film. The way Nicholas Cage's character changes is entirely believable. I mean wouldn't you change if you went from being a family man with a happy, one sided view to life, to a man who has been corrupted by a world he never knew existed? Overall a brilliant study of the human character and the many faces a person can have. You have been warned though this movie is very disturbing and should not be watched alone (or if you have a weak stomach) 9/10</fullReview>

"8mm" has got to be one of the most disturbing movies I've ever seen. Now, I admit, movies like "Starship Troopers" had more BLOOD that this, but there's a crucial difference: In Starship Troopers, the blood was gross, but not unsettling or disturbing. In 8mm, however, the very knowledge that innocent people were being killed for the sake of porn was downright disgusting. I have no idea how this film got an R rating, while films like American Pie originally got NC-17. If you have a tough stomach, and are interested in snuff films, you might want to consider this.</fullReview>

I wish I could provide you more about the message shown in this movie, better than just plain 'be careful of what the truth might tell you', but unfortunately not.But that doesn't make this movie bad or crunchy. On the contrary, in somewhat ways, the dark alleys and the hard-core society has it's own attractions.Here, we can see the dark side of human freedom and sexual exploitations. And when money conquers, even the sickest act or taste could be performed. That's about it.Almost all the story we're seeing sick sexual habits and dirty life, far different from the usual movie tells. And this is the original part of this movie. Add some more blood and detective chit and chat, and you get more attentions. With more addition on family matters, you get 8MM.Nic Cage is standard usual, not very good, but good enough for this movie. The other cast just kinda following him around just trying hard to shape up his character. It works well.I got a chance to read the original script, and I kinda like it that way. But that doesn't mean that this final output is bad. It's good and very recommended for late Friday Movie.</fullReview>

Well he gets dragged down into the underworld. Through the whole movie he uncovers things that happen in the US and gets deeper and deeper into his job and some things through the movie are disturbing things.

		<fullReview>My view on this film was that it was very good, but almost a little too dark. Nicholas Cage gives his best performance ever, in a movie. The character he plays is similar to the one played by William L. Petersen in MANHUNTER. Cage must try to get into the mind of the perpetrator and almost gets sucked into the very world he's investigating. This film almost shows a little too much. My philosophy on films is that in crime movies, it is best not to show a ultra violent murder, but rather, allude to it. The film, THE DAY OF THE JACKAL (original) did this well. In Hollywood today, there is too much overstatement. I am tired of this trend. This film revolves around the death of a young woman and the "snuff" film trade. As Cage's character digs deeper into the case, he uncovers more and more corruption and grift than he imagined possible. The key thing I like about this movie is Cage's character. His experience in this movie breaks him. We see a transformation in the character from the beginning to the middle to the end. He is in essence, a 3D character; in the sense, he goes through all the emotional changes a "real" human being would in this situation. There is no NASH BRIDGES charm in this project. Please keep this in mind when you view it. The film tends to be gritty.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A lot of people took notice that this film was written by the same guy who wrote Se7en. And they do have a lot in common. They are both very disturbing, they both evoke thoughts you don't want to think and they both show the gritty, messy backside of society.Se7en was a punch in the gut, 8MM feels more like a slap in the face. It doesn't hit as hard, and there are parts of this film that feel just a bit too exaggerated and bizarre to be real. I'm talking about how Stormare behaves. He feels like a clown, and it's even worse when you have seen Big Lebowski where his character is equally bizarre.On the other hand, the scene where Cage phones the mother is one of the most evocative and disturbing sequences I have ever seen in any movie, and at that time some of the sensations that Se7en evoked are brought back to life.On the whole a good movie, no more and no less.

		<fullReview>The subject of this picture is very strong and unpleasant to many common people.It's simply about snuff and bestiality movies.These films are not a myth,they really exist somewhere in our world.So prepare for the journey into sheer brutality and perversity,where all human rights disappeared.To sum up,this cold,gloomy,at times very violent and even disturbing picture with magnificent performance by Nicolas Cage is absolutely worth watching.For me,this is one of the best flicks of the 90's.Check it out in pair with "Last House on the Left" or "Last House on the Dead End Street".By the way,this guy called Machine is a real sadistic killer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is horrible... that's why I rated it 8</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>8mm does exactly what it was made to do, to disgust you. It shows how filty people can be, not that we didn't know already. But sometimes being, more or less, forced to put up with them for two full hours, leaves the mind to linger on that realization... at least a lot more than the pace of modern watch-listen-and-dump-out-of-our-way-too-busy-minds media would allow. All in all a daring movie. But I would have expected nothing less from the writer who showed that being a hero is not all fame and glory... and that sometimes you just have to change the tempo of your life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frankly saying, when i was gonna buy this movie, i did not expect too much from it just because it happened to me to read a review of it in a magazine. But i was surprised. On the whole it is a very god movie, by the way, far better than David Fincher's "Se7en", which is just a dark and boring, predictable film. But from the very beginning, 8mm is a gripping and shocking movie (but a little bit too long), very well photographed by Robert Elswit (The Hand That Rocks The Cradle). So, Joel Schumaher and Nicholas Cage manage to create an outstanding and scary movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rated this movie a seven of ten mostly for subject matter. None of the 'pornographic' scenes were explicit. I liked this movie because it is willing to exploring the dark side of our society.Nicolas Cage's performance seemed to convey a professional yet uninvolved, perhaps remote character, modern day (1999?), middle class self employed family man. Marital problems from being away from home to much, and personally 'distant'. Detached maybe but compassionate.For me the movie doesn't really answer the question; 'do snuff films really exist' or are they just an "urban legend". I think if they exist/existed law enforcement agencies would have prosecuted at least one by now.So the movie is best viewed for it's protrayal of one man's confrontation with the dark side of our culture and the extreme feelings it can invoke. (compassion, the personal cost of dedication and perseverance in finding the killers/revenge, hate, horror). I also appreciated the writers giving the murderer what I feel was a unique and realistic motive (in our day) for what he does as expressed by the murderer himself in the final scenes of the movie. I always wondered if some of them felt that way, maybe they do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warning: The following includes some details about the movie plot!This movie got to me. You get immersed in the dark and gloomy atmosphere in an honest way, that takes the sting out of the (arguably) "happy" ending. I just finished watching it, and I feel it will not go away from my mind now, for a while, like Se7en, which still haunts me from time to time (and which was dark in a similar way, not because of some graphic images).One very good scene is when Tom is pointing a gun at Eddie's head. What do you make of Eddie's behavior in that scene? Does he mean it when he says he wants Tom to end his misery (remorse?)? Is his sarcasm really the words of a frightened man with a gun to his head, or a desperate attempt to still detach himself from the murder of a young girl, which Tom had made him relive?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely Intense and Disturbing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Really deserving of an NC-17 rating, "8mm" reminded me of George C. Scott's descent into sleaze (or Hell?) and depravity in "Hardcore". Hired by a rich widow to investigate an alleged snuff film found in her late husband's safe, Cage embarks on a tawdry odyssey into the hellish environment of the lowest levels of the pornography and S&amp;M industry - and the darker impulses within his own formally smug self long kept hidden. The menace and danger is palpable throughout. Cage's performance is quite good and convincing. The film itself has logical problems: five people get murdered in this plot, yet not once are the police involved or even a concern. But this is not a fatal flaw by any means. Some people will dislike the subject matter intensely, and thus rate the movie lower than they should. I found it compelling throughout; I sure wasn't bored. Recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good, solid thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite previous comments it is not boring, it does not have intrusive music, and it does not rain all the time (only once, I believe). If you want a rip-roaring all-action thriller then this is not it; if you want an intelligent, thought-provoking film about a private investigator (he was a PI wasn't he? He wasn't meant to be a ridiculously-muscled tough guy? I have been reading reviews for the same film?) then see this film. Surprisingly enough, in a film about a private investigator this bloke actually does some investigating, he doesn't just run about waving a gun in the air and hitting people (although he does do that too on occasion). This is not boring - it is actually (to my mind at least) far more interesting.This is not a perfect film. The scenes between Cage and his wife are liable to induce nausea (particularly, I would suspect, in Britain!), and Cage's performance is not great. But it's adequate, and Phoenix and the baddies are very good. Actually, I think I liked this film better than 'Seven' (if we must compare).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The devil changes you</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There were a few things that bothered me about the film, besides the actual concept of snuff films. Although, there were a few things that interested me as well.I thought it was amusing how Mary's mother offered Cage's character a drink - and seeing him refusing it so casually, just made me think back to Leaving Las Vegas. Little incidents like these that link characters from other movies together amuses me. However, it made me think that perhaps Cage was making me recognize his character in Leaving Las Vegas too much. Like when you're watching a movie and you become distracted by the actor. It made me realize that Cage's acting in this one was sub-par. I wasn't involved in the story enough and his acting wasn't convincing me to believe the story. It was a bit embarrassing to watch him watching the film in the beginning. He was too awkward, and too obvious. Did his talent take a holiday in this one? The monotonous narrative (the phone calls) over the momentous (too overpowering) music made me cringe. Was an editor hired for this movie? Was everything done in one take? Did Cage shoot all this in the wee hours? I don't understand what went wrong, but something was definitely missing.I really enjoyed Joaquin Phoenix in this one. Though not the most likeable character, he portrayed it convincingly (well to the non-S&amp;M-buff like me) and affably. The wife had not much substance to her character so not much to work with, but I believed the patience required by her character was stretched a bit far.The message that stayed with me throughout the second half of the film, may I roughly quote "The devil doesn't change. The devil changes you." This is what made me able to stay with the second half. If this hadn't been said, I would have found it very difficult to justify the downhill slide of Cage's character into the depths which he so loathed. But, this made it make sense for me.I guess I was lucky I had heard so much about the film beforehand, because it desensitized me to material that would have, under circumstances in which I knew nothing of the film prior to watching, would have horrified me and left an indelible impression on my mind. As it was, I was left with the concept that if evil is stronger than good, it can't help but change you. And no matter how good you try to be, seeing the lowest depths of human depravity can never be removed from you, once exposed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This just doesn't seem to be a movie that strikes as good a chord with people as other recent movies. I suppose that's what I found so appealing. 8mm went deeper into both the subject matter and audience deeper than most movies would even look. My friends were disgusted. I sat quietly and thought to myself. The movie makes one think about just how dark the inside of a person can truly be. I seriously don't think you can walk away a little unchanged after viewing this movie. I want to hand out congratulations to Joel Schumacher and Nicholas Cage. One aspect I really enjoyed about the movie was the mood that Schumacher set. I notice that the deeper cage gets into the sado-masochistic plot, the darker the lighting gets. I don't suggest this movie for the weak-stomached, easily(or not so easily) offended, or on the first date.</fullReview>

It was not the suspense of the movie that caught my attention but it was the beastly the crime that took my attention. It seemed very realistic to me, the move was no fiction to me.

		<shortDescription>A Misunderstood Morality Tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can see how 8MM would be viewed by many as a movie about depravity. In many ways, it is. Some of it is even naive. Its portrayal of the adult film industry is not realistic - or rather, it shows that side of the entertainment business as it might have been three decades ago. I mention this because it begins with the truth that, for all intents and purposes, snuff films are simply a modern myth. It then goes on to portray certain aspects of the porn business in ways that are also myth.Aside from that plot flaw, I found it to be one of the best studies of a man trying to do the right thing in a long time. It questions how far one is willing to go and how much one is willing to give up to find the truth. It asks whether the life and death of a young tramp from the wrong side of the tracks is worth bothering about.Nicolas Cage is excellent, as always. [And Sean Penn, as another of your ex-friends, I don't care if you think Nick no longer acts.] And Joquin Phoenix, in a supporting role, shows that he is destined to become one of the best actors of his generation. He so physically transforms himself for his role as a Hollywood punk that he is hardly recognizable.I really thought this was an intriguing movie. It's subject matter will make it repellant to many viewers. Also, it is too serious to be called an entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I want to make this clear: overall, I thought this was a good movie. Tom Welles (Nicholas Cage) is a private investigator hired to find the victim of what appears to be a snuff film, found by a widow after her rich husband's demise. In order to track it down he has to make his way into the deep world of violent and horrific porn.You really have to know what you're getting into. It's the same thing with any movie that's disturbing - if you get taken by surprise you can have a really unpleasant experience. Se7en was like that. Schindler's List was like that. Closetland (a much more obscure movie) was also like that. But if you don't mind, or you're ready for it, you can get through it much more easily.The climactic scenes are worth the wait. Cage becomes vengeance incarnate, and the dialogue is gripping.By now you're probably wondering about that "boring" part from the summary. Okay. I can't stand when a movie tries to take the easy way out of anything, especially something as important as character development. Catherine Keener plays Amy Welles, Tom's wife. Tom also has a baby. This movie was LONG. This movie had a lot of plot to get through, and the wife and baby were there purely to make it look like Tom cared about his family. He didn't. They never have any effect on him, you never expect him to sacrifice anything of his work for them, and he doesn't. The movie would've been far better if they just hadn't been there to weight the plot down with pointlessness. It's like they didn't trust Nicholas Cage to be a good enough actor to portray being a good person. He did that fine, generally. In his scenes with Mrs. Christian (Myra Carter) he shows great empathy and compassion.It bothered me a lot. It bothered my girlfriend even more, and so she *didn't* like watching this movie. But all in all I'd still have to give it a thumbs-up. I just wish they'd trimmed the fat a bit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film shows the gritty side of the porno film industry. If you thought "Boogie Nights" showed the seamier side of the industry, this goes far beyond that. It goes to the underbelly where, I'm sure, most "legitimate" pornographers would not care to let you know their industry goes. However, that is not where the real story lies. The story attempts to make you ask yourself the question, "How far would you go?" The film gives constant contrasts to the light and dark side of our behavior, not only through the dialogue, but also the film itself goes from a very dark hue, to very bright several times, showing the dichotomy in all of our lives, or at least our thinking process. I recommend the film for those viewers who want to think about the questions it raises. Also, visually, it did not delve as deeply into the violent nature of porno as it could have, and I applaud the director for that decision. It did more with good editing (credit the editor for that) than with actual visual exploitation. The ending was pretty much what you would expect, but it couldn't have ended otherwise and been a film based in reality. Go see it, but be prepared to do some "self-introspection."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tom Welles, private eye, is hired by a wealthy widow, whose well-known husband passed away recently.She has found a reel of S8-film in a safe. On the film is a cruel slaughtering of a young girl, who obviously does not pretend or act: A snuff-movie.Welles takes up investigation, which leads him to the girl's mother and from there to Hollywood, into the office of a porn flick producer.Welles' rising obsession to solve the case also carries him away from his wife and new-born daughter.But when finally names are at hand, Welles suddenly finds himself on ice much thinner than he planned......It's such a simple premise that has been expertly made by Schumacher (didn't thi8nk i'd say that again after batman), and an original move by Hollywood, having one of the most bankable stars (at the time) starring in something so sleazy, dark, and disturbing, that it could put off fans of Cage for life.The film is basically a retelling of Dantes Inferno. Welles descent into the dark side of life, experiencing this part of life, rather than just knowing about it from the comfort of his home.It's a difficult film to watch, knowing that normal everyday people get there kicks from watching stuff like this, and the rich deciding someones fate, just because they can. But this is te thing that shocks the most, normal everyday people, who are not bad guys, just business persons trying to make money, doing this, because they get paid.Walker gives us a great story, and Cage again puts in a flawless performance as the tortured Welles, knowing that this job won't ever be too far behind him.The rest of the cast are good, and Schumacher rewards us with some stunning set pieces, most notably at machines house near the end, where a vinyl record being stuck has never been more un-nerving. This film isn't for anyone, but if you read between the lines and don't take it as a standard thriller, you will find something dark and disturbing here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Tom Welles (Nicolas Cage) is a small time private eye who mostly deals with routine cases involving infidelity and such. But all that changes when an elderly lady who's tycoon husband recently died asks him to determine the authenticity of a small reel of film found in his safe. This film shows a young girl being brutally raped and murdered, a 'snuff film.' It's more than Welles has ever had to deal with, but he goes ahead with his duty. His quest to find the truth takes him to Hollywood and New York, where he is forced to enter the seedy world of underground pornography and the unsavoury people who make and endorse it. To find the truth, Tom must dance with the devil...but will the devil change him? Here, Joel Schumacher has created a most grim, unpleasant film, with dim lighting, impressively draining any colour and light out of it. He takes us on a downbeat journey into the dark corners of society that most people would like to shut their eyes on and, if he's done anything wrong with the film, he's done that right. David Fincher would probably have been a better director, with a style more suited to the material, but he's still pulled it off with aplomb. We also have some great characters, from Tom as the right-to-do good guy with no idea how his life is about to change, to some brilliantly seedy villains, including Anthony Heald, James Gandolfini and Peter Stormare. Not forgetting Joaquin Phoenix as Cage's edgy sidekick.Everyone thinks Se7en, Andrew Kevin Walker's other famous script, is one of the greatest films ever made and while I don't think that of this film, I personally preferred it, as I think it pulled off a more thrilling and disturbing story. I now know how much his original script was chopped and changed, but now it wouldn't be the same film if I saw it like that.Not all films can be humour and light. But then, some films are all the better for it. This is not good enough to be called a 'classic' film, but it's one you'll probably still remember years after you've seen it simply for it's sheer bleakness. ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Eight Millimeter (1999): Dir: Joel Schumacher / Cast: Nicolas Cage, Joaquin Phoenix, Peter Stormare, James Gandofini, Anthony Heald: Title suggests a small object displaying the most vile evidence to the dark side of the human mind. Nicolas Cage plays a detective sent to view an eight millimeter film displaying a teenage girl butchered for sexual pleasure. When the girl is listed as missing he visits her mother and eventually embarks upon the grim reality of snuff pornography. His investigation leads to the minds that manifest them but Cage makes an unsettling decision towards the conclusion after a phone call. Director Joel Schumacher does a tense portrayal of the horrors of snuff films. It presents a stronger argument than his overrated A Time to Kill. Outstanding job by Cage who makes a tearful phone call where questions are presented and viewers are left to ponder the justification. Joaquin Phoenix works in an adult video store where his nature isn't as stereotypical as it first seems. He will assist Cage with information until fatality kicks in. Disturbing performances by Peter Stormare, Anthony Heald and James Gandolfini who represent the corrupt society at its most unlawful and sadistic. Dire facts presented when a leather mask is removed and the film's real message is revealed. This is wear appearances are deceiving when our eyes and minds have familiar expectations.

		<fullReview>A very different film, for Schumacher, that stands totally detached to all his others, where he enters some really dark territory. This is thanks to the 7even writing talent and genius, Andrew Kevin Walker, in a story that hits reality deep, and like 7even, has you walking out the cinema, very numb, this one really leaving a bad taste in my mouth. Like Seven, this writer works his special magic to shock. High ranking PI, Cage, uncomfortable in the role, or could be just be his character, where if this true, he's really convinced us. He's a family man with a kid, has a bad habit, his wife (Catherine Keller) duly reminds him of. Cage does make smoking look like an art, especially in this. Taking on a new case, where some disturbing evidence has been found, a 8MM roll of film, a semi pornographic movie, involving a strung out young girl who's been bludgeoned to death, which like Cage's reaction, is a bit of a hard to choke scene. Is it fiction or reality? That's what this old woman is paying Cage to find out, after the recent death of her husband magnate, where amongst scant belongings, this disturbing evidence was found. So Cage is sent on a journey that has him knocking on doors, whatever, and has him seen trolling the streets of seedy film sets, porn shops, whatever. On his travels, he forms a partnership with a struggling rocker/porno shop rocker, Max a colourful energetic performance by Joaquin Phoenix. Eager Max and Cage, end up in the New York, where soon the nasty truth of the girl's fate becomes known. The small of bad guys, sickos, including the late great, Gandolfini, a hide under the rock, cringing character, a sleazy talent agent who gets it off with young girls, during their audition phase. He has some sick vices too, when explaining the girl's demise, which his recount is disturbing, where we really at the darkest point of the movie, where you really want to scream revenge. The baddies, pornographers, are really nasty and despicable pieces of work, truly evil, where you won't encounter scum like these guys for many years to come. The showdown between Cage and the masked man in that snuff film (slicer and, podgy mummy's boy, Chris Bauer, the molester from Devil's Advocate) is grippingly fantastic. 8MM is a very shouldn't of cop flacked movie. It's important to the fact that, these are the realities of desperate starlets, who are trying to make it in the acting or modelling worlds, and evil can come in the purest forms and facades of people of people. Cage's character is so dumb to admit snuff doesn't exist, but when viewing that movie, has him even holding his doubts, as well as long shocked gasps. 8MM is not for everyone. There are some sick and truly repulsive scenes. It's a very dark and psychological journey, we share with Cage into the world of vice and corrupt minds, better put to rest, with bullet holes in them, or like Gandolfini, who's really good here, playing a different kind of type, to the tough roles he normally plays. What was weird, once was, I overheard a woman commenting on 8MM, saying "Yeah it was okay". I found that really a odd opinion for this movie, and it's disturbing tones and themes of story. I heard of one person, not being able to sleep after seeing it, where one I know, had nightmares, after seeing it. Judge for yourself but don't miss it. Anthony Heald is cunningly great and solid as the corrupt attorney to the powerful and dead magnate. Love the unforgettable music score at the end, mumbo jumbo lyrics.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite a lack of concrete evidence to support its existence, the snuff movie has endured for decades as an urban legend simply because the idea is so perversely intriguing and downright plausible; surely someone, somewhere has been murdered on film purely for the purpose of entertainment. This is the central theme of Joel Schumacher's 8MM, a thrilling descent into the grimy world of extreme pornography which sees Nicolas Cage as private detective Tom Welles, who is hired by a wealthy widow to find out whether a reel of film found in her late husband's safe is really what it appears to be?a snuff movie!Cage gives one of the best performances of his career as a man forced to confront pure evil as he submerses himself in a world of fetish, porn and violence, and discovers precisely what a sick and disturbing place the world can be. Written by Andrew Kevin Walker of SE7EN fame, this is unrelentingly grim stuff made all the more provoking by its gritty sense of realism, the classy direction from Schumacher, and the excellent supporting cast, which includes standout turns from James Gandolfini as porn casting agent Eddie Poole, Joaquin Phoenix as sex-shop cashier Max California, and Peter Stormare as deviant director Dino Velvet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film with very low expectations. I was expecting it to be some silly thriller about some private investigator trying to find out the truth abut a six year old crime. But after I saw it, I was really impressed by it. I think this is one the most under-rated films around to date. After I saw 8MM, i decided to check the rating for it on IMDb. I was surprised by the rating that it had. I was expected it to be a 7. But it is in the low 6 range. 8MM is a movie that is in not for the faint of heart. This movie has some very disturbing scenes in it. But I thought it could have been a little better if some of the sexuality/nudity was cut out. Nicolas Cage did a really good job playing the lead character. It also has great performances by Joaquin Phoenix, James Gandolfini and Peter Stormare. This is one of Joel Schumachers better films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grim but gripping</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>8MM is a grim but gripping thriller where private detective Nicholas Cage is engaged to investigate whether a snuff movie is genuine or not, and finds himself reluctantly embroiled in the world of those who make such things.The film successfully raises moral issues, not least concerning Cage's actions towards the end of the movie - has he become like those he seeks to hold to account? - but I think the issues are sufficiently clear, in terms of right and wrong, that the film is not compromised in this area.However, I am a little concerned that in some respects the film may derive part of its appeal by accessing the prurient interest of the audience concerning the content of the very snuff movies it rightly portrays as appalling. However, it is difficult to see how you could make a film on this subject otherwise.The film is well made and well performed, but this is strong meat and should not be approached as if it was a straightforward run-of-the-mill crime thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fantastic movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Its so rare I see a good original script get the kind of funding and attention this movie got. Someone had their thinking cap on when they decided to produce this. The cinematography really seals the deal for me on this movie. The script is genius, the acting is great, but the casting stole the show on this film. I have never been so pleasantly surprised with the casting as I was with this movie. Juaquin Phoenix is a master of his craft. He could play Tina Turner and I'd believe it. Is there any limit to his range? Unlike "The Village" where Sigourney Weaver couldn't keep up with him in scenes, Nick Cage does a great job. This is a true thriller. It doesn't rely on silly CG stuff or fictional monsters, it is about something much scarier. Real monsters. The ones living among us every day. Yes it delves into the world of adult film, but not in a gratuitous way at all. In fact there is very little in the way of nudity or adult material. Just enough to show the viewer what private detective Tom Wells is going through. If you're a thriller fan, this is a must see movie. Watch it, you'll thank me after.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An extremely compelling and intriguing film. This movie made an impact on me because of its powerful acting, its passion and its reality. I do not know why this movie got bad reviews, and I know its not an all-time great, perhaps because it is not uplifting or fun. This I can understand for it is dark, gloomy and real, and this may not be to some people's tastes. Undeniably however, the film is quite brilliant. Most notably I must point out Nicolas Cage. This is one of his best performances, a man brought into a world he had not thought about and most do not face, but nevertheless is out there. The shock of this sick side of humanity scares him, particularly as he thinks of his own family and his daughter growing up in this world. He struggles to cope with the notion that some people are turned on by rape and killing, as most of us would struggle to cope. Yet the sadness is, this movies portrays reality, and it hits us like it hits him. Cage was filled with emotion in this film and it showed magnificently, he was passionate about vengeance, and the scene of him asking the mother of the murdered girl to say how much she loved her daughter, so he could find the rage and ability to kill those who did it, it was incredibly powerful, as was the scene of him bursting into tears near the end of the film. The bad guys were acted excellently, they were so despicable and it can be attributed to good acting. On top of this was good action and incredible suspense, with a solid plot. However the point is this. If you can handle this movie, it puts you, like it did with Nicolas Cage, in touch with a reality we most likely haven't and don't want to face. It makes you aware of this world, and how some innocent looking people may have a sick underlying life. It gets it message across with rage and power, and makes you tougher, and aware of yourself and how you need to be for others. This is a solid powerful movie,that won't be loved because it can't be, but nevertheless, is brilliant in most respects.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I do understand that movies are not real life, but an art form. As the saying goes, art imitates life. This movie may have been viewed as the ultimate Good Guy VS Bad Guy flick, but in my eyes it had many levels of understanding. Nicolas Cage's character, Thomas Welles, is so full of emotion at times you can feel what he is feeling yourself, a task that many actors can not succeed at doing. Even though the plot is predictable at times, this movie opened my eyes to the stereotyping that goes on in the minds of human beings. 8MM is hard to watch on a squeamish stomach, and you won't be able to take your eyes off of it. Watch it, understand it, and you will never look at your neighbor or a stranger the same again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>why the bad reviews?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just viewed the movie, and came right to the IMDB to see comments. I am surprised by the negativity. Many have dismissed this movie as predictable Hollywood fare. Others have said "it's not really disturbing, just because it's about illegal porn." Exactly how jaded are we now as a society that the subject matter isn't enough to be disturbing? Well, that's much more subjective - to my main point. I think Cage did a fine job of portraying a man on a mission to understand "why?" To me, this was the essence of the movie. I disagree with the assessment that there was an unexplainable shift to avenger. I didn't see it that way. I understood his motivation completely. I agree, "Seven" was fantastic, but just because this didn't top the shock of Seven doesn't mean it's somehow inferior. Cage far exceeds Pitt as a character actor (though I think Pitt is a great actor - too bad he's normally considered only for looks and not innate ability). Bottom line: I followed Cage's character throughout, and I understood and sympathized with every move. Maybe that says more about me than the film. Hmmm..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>8mm is an excellent film, highly underrated and dismissed by way too many people. Well acted, and despite what people have said, well directed. It's quite refreshing to see a detective in a film actually do any detecting, as opposed to the standard Hollywood convention of having our hero get a lead through a snitch or a coincidence. You genuinely feel in this film that the detcetive has earned his trade, and deservedly works his way up through a chain of people until he meets the person responsible for the snuff film. The film is dark, and our imagination is left to run riot, and this can be disturbing. The basement scene where the pornography is for sale is bad enough already without one of the signs on the stalls reading, "Kids." Some finely timed set peices towards the end, and a cathartic climax for our hero, this is a slow burning film that will stay in the memory for a long long time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark and Thrilling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>8 MM was an engrossing murder-mystery reminiscent of Basic Instinct. Tom Welles is a private investigator who must re-create a possible crime which occurred some five years ago. His only initial lead is a short "snuff" video found in a deceased industrialist's office safe after his death.Nicolas Cage puts on an acting tour-de-force as Tom Welles, an introspective private investigator who must piece together an obscure set of leads in a search which is bi-coastal. Welles becomes so engrossed in his investigation that he re-visits old vices and takes on the air of a stalker. With the assistance of an aspiring musician temping as a porn store clerk (played by Phoenix), Cage penetrates deep into an underworld far seedier and sadistic than mainstream smut.The plot, while perhaps farfetched, was believable throughout. The suspense was palpable and the action nearly non-stop. Just when you thought that the film's climax had been reached, the script mutated, taking viewers to even tenser moments. The plot was anything but predictable and had me guessing up until the credits.Dino Velvet, the head of Dino Velvet studios, is masterfully acted by Peter Stormare. The crossbow is a nice touch indeed.For those with a taste for the dark and out-of-the ordinary, 8 MM is a must-see. This is a much deeper film than Snake Eyes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very well made thriller, not for the faint of heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joel Schumacher's 8MM is a stomach churning ride to the dark, depraved side of humanity, and at times is so unnerving and bleak it can be overbearing at times. Its also captivating in its ugliness though. Humans have always had a fascination with dark, intense aspects of our world, and this film knows that good and well, showing you some truly nasty things but leaving the choice to see it through to its conclusion fully up to you. Shumacher, although a diverse guy, isn't known for venturing very far into the scum bucket (even his Batman films were kid friendly garish gumball machines), but there's a first for everything, and he should be proud of the finished product here. Nicolas Cage plays a small time private investigator with a wife (Catherine Keener) and small child. He's summoned by the lawyer (Anthony Heald, eternally smarmy) of an ailing widow. She has found a mysterious 8mm videotape among her deceased husband's possessions. On the tape is what appears to be a harrowing, graphic snuff film in which a young girl is murdered by masked men. She hires him to originate it and confirm its authenticity, launching one of the grimiest, nauseating investigations since Fincher's Sev7n. He's led to porn shops, underground sex dungeons, kinky night clubs and brushes shoulders with all sorts of weirdos and unsavory cretins. The only help he gets is from sex store clerk Max California (Joaquin Phoenix in a very well written role). He comes across the ultimate speazeball porn producer Eddie Pool (James Gandolfini will make you want to rip his throat out and urinate down it), mysterious debonair Dino Velvet (Peter Stormare letting his freak flag fly), and their masked enforcer known only as 'animal'. There's also a cameo from a young Norman Reedus too. It's quite the rabbit hole of deplorable human behaviour he falls down, and soon we see the edges of his soul begin to fray from what he's seen. Cage, when he's not campy, is quite good at showing someone who's mental state begins to tatter based on their experiences, and he goes for it here, making us nervous if he's gone too far to ever return to his family with his soul and sanity in one piece. It's quite the movie, and like I said there's parts of sheer nastiness (I can't watch the scenes with the snuff tape these days I get panic episodes from it), but if you're willing to pay the mental toll to see an unflinching, and very well made thriller with a neat cast, go for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark side of our everyday lives</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When people act good, with kindness, love and compassion we usually don't question their reasons because there is no damage and we feel that is our human side at work. On the other hand, when people act in a bad way, hurting us we usually go in depth questioning and pondering about their reasons for such behavior. This movie is about that other side of human nature, the evil side, which is not always evident but nevertheless is always there, lurking behind the facade of everyday tamed animals. Depicted is a quest for answers which guides us through a maze of sex, death, sadism and money. The atmosphere is dark, gloomy and follows the tune that the story sets perfectly. We are presented with a everyday society with loose moral values which are just enough to make things work, and legal. Then, we pass over that moral barrier which is so thin that crossing it is barely noticeable. What we see on the other side is decadence which can shock us but that path we have been following all along while still on the "good" side was leading here and is hardly a surprise. The performance of the actors is on the spot, engaged enough to make things believable but not over dramatized to make them "steel the thunder" from what the movie is all about. Being able to mold the story without putting yourself first puts the performance in line with the story. The power of this movie is it's ability to show us only pieces of the whole picture and let us imagine the idea while guiding us forward. Yes, this is an explicit movie but more because of the overall context rather than some particular segment.This is not a movie for those not willing to question some aspect of our everyday lives that we take for granted but for those looking for something different, something that looks outside the box, this is a home run!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Conscientious private eye Nicolas Cage has to find out if a snuff film is real or not</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"8mm" is an above-par detective-thriller and solidly neo-noir. A wealthy man dies. His elderly widow commissions Cage to find out if an apparent snuff film in the man's safe is real or not.Cage is a family man, loyal to his wife and baby. He isn't for an instant tempted as he delves into the world of the foulest kind of perversions in order to complete his task. Nevertheless, he changes or is changed.The story takes its time, so that we can get to know the apparent victim's mother and others who were involved in the film's making. We get to know Cage and his disgust at what he is seeing and finds so hard to understand.The movie is very suspenseful, especially as it gets toward the end. At that point and earlier, it is quite dark too, in theme and look. The direction and production design are very good.The script is above-average in developing themes. The biggest theme is the existence of an evil that combines sex and extreme violence. At the end, Cage appeals to his wife "Save me", but the appeal has to go far beyond her. Another major theme is the evil of porn even when it is not as extreme. As in many neo-noirs, corruption is a theme. The two sides of human nature are shown. While Cage is honest and ethical where it counts, nevertheless his job cannot be done without lying at times and impersonating police and other officials. And by the end, he cannot live with himself without an extreme act of his own. The line separating the punisher from those deserving of punishment is very thin indeed.The elderly wife who wanted to know how evil her husband may have been took a non-Christian path at the outset. She needed to forgive and forget. Cage, who wanted material goods for his family, became her agent and shared in her non-Christian path. No one was praying for those who participated in the snuff film. Cage becomes an instrument of revenge and hatred. He makes a plea to be saved, but to his wife it appears, not God. The film, maybe unconsciously, explores what happens when people choose a non-Christian path.Is this movie exploitative? I cannot say. It perhaps depends on the viewer. I did not watch the scenes in which the snuff film was shown. Some images can stay in your mind a long time. I didn't want to see these. The same goes for "A Serbian Film", which I did not view at all. The film "Hardcore" is the forerunner of this film. On the other hand, I do not see that a film can show worse images than others I have seen from battlefields and wars of human casualties.</fullReview>

Cage goes so over the top with his character that he's going down the other side. He's a PI that becomes so personally involved with his missing persons case that he loses all objectivity, this might have been more realistic if it didn't happen shortly after taking the case. The character of his wife is so poorly written."She didn't realize he'd be away from home as a PI!?" His wife is so annoying I was hoping the film wouldn't get back to her. The best performance was given by Jaoquin Phoenix, he is believable and the only character that I cared about. He helps Cages PI find the truth and even though he knows more about the world their about to become intimate with he doesn't let it cloud his judgement, shame the PI doesn't have the same focus. It's unbelievable that a PI as smart as Cages character, it is an impressive job he does finding the girl in the film, would do in the film makers in the end and leave such a trail of these killings to himself- the phone call to the girls mother.

Nicolas Cage plays Thom Welles, a private-detective, who has been hired by the widow of a recently deceased leader of a steel company. The widow has found a piece of 8MM film in her husbands private belongings. It shows the murder of a young woman, and the widow wants Welles to find out if the movie is a fake or not. Welles is about to enter a sick and twisted world of pornographers, as he search for the guys who made the film, and the girl on it(if she`s alive, that is). Not a classic, not very good, but worth a shot if you want a thriller which theme is snuff. It tells us that people who see/make snuff-films are indeed extremely sick people, but many of them look just like normal persons. 6,5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Controversial Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One thing I can't understand is the understating of this movie. Critics claim that it was supposedly too long, and that it was bleak and relentless without a point. This only proves the age-old "USA vs. Sexuality"-dilemma really exists. If a movie shows a considerable amount of skin, some people are going to hate it, but to say that 8mm does this without a point is a huge error. First, let's examine the surface of the movie. The subject, for one thing, is very controversial, and to make a movie about snuff is very risky, if you're planning on a blockbuster hit movie. This pretty much eliminates the accusation of the movie being sole entertainment.The visuality is all together very dark, and sex is presented in a non-exiting manner, which proves that the movie isn't just another skin-flick, and anyone watching 8mm as a porn movie, should have his/her head examined. Also, the violence in the movie is ugly and non-appealing, reminiscent of another understated film, Fight Club. In other words, it doesn't exploit what it is against.The plot is said to be prolonged and boring. If they had ended the movie where Tom Welles escapes the porno lair, having killed Dino Velvet, what would the film had proven? That snuff is morally wrong? That there are weirdos out there to take advantage of us? Please, those are old subjects, which needn't be reminded of. The story needs to go on in order to justify the sex and violence shown in it. As Tom Welles kills Machine in the scary ending scene, Machine sums up the whole movie with his death line, and the ending shot of Welles' anxious face reveals to us the real message. Which is? Killing a man is wrong, whoever gets killed, and whoever is the killer. Every rapist, serial killer, mass murderer, is still a human being and no human is more worth than another. An old subject too, someone might say. Well, why does USA still have the death penalty? That's something a lot of people don't think of.In bringing this message forth Joel Schumacher and Andrew Kevin Walker have done a nice job. Walker was all ready familiar with the subject in the equally controversial "Se7en", and Schumacher had touched the subject of social criticism and alienation in his most overlooked film, "Falling Down". 9/10</fullReview>

With the help of the streetwise Max (Joaquin Phoenix), Welles relentlessly follows a bizarre trail of evidence to determine the fate of a complete stranger. As his work turns into obsession, he drifts farther and farther away from his wife (Catherine Keener), family and simple life as a small-town private eye.

		<fullReview>All of you talk rubbish, this movie was FANTASTIC. The only reason I can think of why it has been so slated here by most people is that it is an absolute one hundred per cent SERIOUS film. It is not far-fetched, the plot is not ridiculous, this movie portrays an aspect of REAL LIFE that many of us are not aware of and that is why it is so mesmerising. It is tragic to think that people need their movie screens to explode with spectacular but utterly ridiculous premises in order to enjoy a film. Okay, those films are good fun but more films should have the same level of realism as 8MM. It is a dark, disturbing film that brilliantly handles its horrific subject matter. We have to imagine that we are Tom Welles, a normal everyday guy who as a private detective investigates the underworld of porn. By the end of the film, he has been changed by what he has seen. 'You can't change the devil, the devil changes you.' This film makes us realise that terrible things happen in life that are invisible to normal everyday civilians and that is a daunting thought. The villains are the most despicable ever depicted on film. They do the most monstrous things imaginable yet off duty they appear to be normal people who could easily be your next door neighbour or even your son. We realise that these people show no signs of the vile atrocities that they commit and this makes them all the more terrifying. There are some truly amazing sequences that display high degrees of all kinds of emotion and horror. Watch this movie with an open mind, concentrate hard and soon you will become immersed in the journey the plot takes and it will leave you with things to think about.</fullReview>

It is not far-fetched, the plot is not ridiculous, this movie portrays an aspect of REAL LIFE that many of us are not aware of and that is why it is so mesmerising. It is tragic to think that people need their movie screens to explode with spectacular but utterly ridiculous premises in order to enjoy a film. Okay, those films are good fun but more films should have the same level of realism as 8MM. It is a dark, disturbing film that brilliantly handles its horrific subject matter. We have to imagine that we are Tom Welles, a normal everyday guy who as a private detective investigates the underworld of porn. By the end of the film, he has been changed by what he has seen. 'You can't change the devil, the devil changes you.' This film makes us realise that terrible things happen in life that are invisible to normal everyday civilians and that is a daunting thought. The villains are the most despicable ever depicted on film. They do the most monstrous things imaginable yet off duty they appear to be normal people who could easily be your next door neighbour or even your son. We realise that these people show no signs of the vile atrocities that they commit and this makes them all the more terrifying. There are some truly amazing sequences that display high degrees of all kinds of emotion and horror. Watch this movie with an open mind, concentrate hard and soon you will become immersed in the journey the plot takes and it will leave you with things to think about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disturbing film yet compulsive to watch.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Eight Millimetre is a very disturbing film, yet a very well made film as well. It's the sort of film that everyone really should see, but no-one would blame you if you didn't! The film makes you wonder "How on earth did the censor let them get away with that!", yet, in its own way, its a very strong argument against censorship, because the disturbing turns the story takes are what make the film such a unique and realistic portrayal of a very bad part of life.Nicholas Cage plays a private investigator who is called upon to investigate a snuff film, which was found in a safe after a wealthy man's death. The question his widow wants to know is - is the man she adored and to whom she was married for forty-five years really the distinguished gentleman she has always believed him to be, or was he a mentally-disturbed pervert who gets kicks out of watching innocent young girls being killed? And, worse still, did he pay for the girl to be killed on film, for his pleasure, when there were no other snuff films available?In order to find out, the investigator has to get down into the gutter of life, and search through the worst and most perverted porno manufacturing networks he can find. The girl went missing six years ago, and the police haven't got a clue, but there are clues on the film, such as a tattoo on the hand of the masked killer, and a fleeting image of a man in the background watching.So what exactly is so disturbing about this film? In order to explain properly, I'm going to have to write a SPOILER. So please only read on ONLY (a) if you have already seen the film, or (b) if you are completely sure you're not going to see it, or (c) if you want to know exactly why it's disturbing and don't mind knowing what happens in order to find out. OK? Here we go: *******WARNING: ******* SPOILER ******* SPOILER *******The Disturbing Features:The film is disturbing largely because the investigator is so shocked by what he discovers that he brutally murders the girl's killers, and gets away with it as well. He literally gets down into the same moral gutter that they are in.Another disturbing feature is that, in order to make himself angry enough to start killing, he cruelly calls the dead girl's mother on the phone, tells her how her daughter was killed, six years ago. When she naturally breaks down into hysterical sobs, crying out "No, no, no! I love my little girl!" it helps him to start the killing, just as he'd hoped.Another disturbing feature is that he insensitively calls the widow who started the investigation, and blurts out that her husband did indeed commission the film, and paid for the killing, so the elderly widow, unable to cope with the sudden dreadful news, commits suicide.And yet another disturbing event is that right at the end, he receives a letter from the girl's mother, emphasising that he did the right thing, in murdering her child's killers. So basically, this film is saying "Forget about the police. They'll do nothing for six years or more. If someone has killed a child, the best thing to do is to take the law into your own hands."Some people on the internet who are concerned with pro-life issues, have been arguing that the message of the film also carries strong implications that those who shoot abortionists may be doing the right thing, the best thing, after all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie for almost the entire running time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a good, atmospheric film for about 9/10 of the running time, then it reaches a climax and curiously keeps on going. The movie has a good atmosphere and is an interesting look into the world of underground porn, the problems mainly lie in the fact that cage is not a great actor and ends up as 2-dimensional as everyone else in the film. The most irritating thing about this movie was the fact that the ending beats you over the head with the point. For the most part fans of thrillers arent dumb, although it seems the director doesnt realize that. 7/10 in my opinion, worth seeing but not paying to see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being only 15, I have watched thousands of the most gory horror and slasher films and never felt shocked or repulsed by any of them. And then I watched 8MM. Everything in this film is so explicit, from the dialogue to the violence but does this make this realistic portrayal of the sick world of snuff any good? I don't think so. 8MM scores points for realism, but that's it. I think films are made to entertain, does 8MM entertain? No, it doesn't. It makes audiences feel so sick to their guts that they will never feel the need to ever view this film ever again. But I do think it is an important film that every person will need to view at least once. But it still isn't a good film. "There's no mystery to it, I just LIKE doing it." That line is completely shocking. To think that a normal everyday person can do such things is shocking. 8MM is just an unentertaining film. That's it. And don't even get me started about the music. Ugh! It's terrible!AUSTRALIAN CLASSIFICATIONR18+ Medium Level Violence, Adult Themes, Sexual References.Yeah, I know, I shouldn't be watching it. I'm not old enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>8mm is a movie I didn't want to see because it seemed to me like another SnakeEyes. I was wrong. Director Joel Schumacher does a nice job of putting the film together, but he tends to drag out scenes here like he did with Batman &amp; Robin and A Time to Kill. The storyline is interesting, but Cage unusually lacks depth and the two main women (his wife who was very good in Out of Sight) and the woman who hires him are not effective at all. Kudos to Joaquin Phoenix and James Gandolfino who put in very nice performances. Overall I would call it very dark, very disturbing, but worth catching one day on HBO or Cinemax.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>8MM shows the dark side of human nature...and I like it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>8MM is one of the most disturbing films I have ever seen. Everything about this movie is dark and depressing, including the music, the cinematography, the characters, and the plot.... yet I could not turn my head away. This movie shows the dark side that is deep down in "some" of us. It shows that anyone is capable of great horrors. Nic Cage's character is a private eye that finds himself in a brutal underworld that eventually twists him into that which he loathes. After witnessing the worst that mankind can dish out, he becomes an avenging angel, although a twisted one. He is willing to lose everything he has to right the greatest of wrongs. Mr. Cage's performance is fair (far from his best), but the plot and characterization are strong enough to make up for his slightly stiff performance.One of the great performances in this film is that of James Gandolfini. He is brilliant as the sleazy porn producer named Eddie Poole. If you have ever seen Mr. Gandolfini's performances in True Romance, Get Shorty, or the Sopranos, you know that he is capable of creating some of the most interesting (and sometimes disturbing) characters out there. He outdoes himself in 8MM. He is the scariest of all individuals. He is a man that cares about nothing but his own financial welfare. He talks about a young woman's death as if it was as significant as the squashing of a mosquito.I recommend this film to all of those with an open mind, and a strong stomach. It is not an easy film to watch, but the end result is well worthwhile. But I do warn you..... 8MM is a required taste.</fullReview>

Tom Welles really begins to become obsessed and even a bit crazy as he gets closer to the truth. A shocking and disturbing thriller with a frightening and compelling story.

		<fullReview>This is a very well-made, non-exploitive or pandering look at an incredibly vile realm of human vice. Two major problems take away points:1. It's been done before. "Cruising" (1980), the much-maligned film about a vice cop undercover, in the gay S&amp;M milieu, who ends up a part of it. Same subject, different treatment. 2. There is a clichéd sub-plot of the neglected hero's wife, and her anguish at what the job is doing to her man. Sound familiar?There are drugs, and there are drugs; there is porn, and there is porn. We all know that. This excellent film visits a subject that needs no amplification. If society encounters real snuff film makers, it knows what to do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>8MM is certainly a unique movie. No copycatting here. I found it somewhat enjoyable in that it held my attention. However, as I watched I found myself waiting for the BIG shocker. It didn't really come. There were only 2 possibilities. The snuff film was fake or it was real. That's it. I don't think that it was a lack of shock, but rather another example of how desensitized to violence we've become. I was not shocked. I felt that I could sit through the snuff type films. In actuality, who knows? I may toss my cookies. I don't know. My other point has to do with James Gandolfini. Boy, Mr. Tony Soprano is sure getting around. He plays the sicko way too comfortably. He's starting to become typecast as either a slobbish psycho, or a secretive type with a conscious (Al Love in A Civil Action and, oh yeah, Tony Soprano). At any rate, 8MM was a decent movie, but let's not alert the Academy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An eye opener. Dark and wonderful. Cage at his finest. Not for the queasy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are a few movies which jolt you, which leave you with a weird taste in the mouth, which make you think, ponder. This is not one of those movies. This is a movie which grabs you by the shoulders and haunts you, for a considerable amount of time. It takes you to much darker recesses of the human mind. You discover how sadistic, perverse, and sickening man can get. This is the movie that makes you swear off pornography. For good.Nicolas Cage seems to get better with every movie he does, and this is a powerful acting job which ought to help him bag an award. He was great in Leaving Las Vegas and Wild at Heart, but this is definetely him at his finest.The movie can be described simply as dark. As the movie ends, you feel the need to see light, to restore yourself to the life you know, the world outside the dreadful world you have glimpsed in the movie. The movie, objectively, portrays nothing graphic, but the suggestiveness makes you read between the lines automatically. It's a shocker. The kind of movie that will be criticised almost as much as it is liked. It is made for a very specific audience, and the film school students will lap it up. As should the critics. Watch it, but be well prepared. A thrill ride, yes, but terrifying. Opens you up to lots you were unprepared for. Definetely for the Titanic-lovers. A movie you want to see preferably alone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't understand how one cannot at least appreciate this film for its honesty and its realism. It's an amazing film with terrific performances, a amazing soundtrack, and a story that isn't lost to action sequences. This film works because it never forgets that it's a social commentary and a morality play. It shows us what can happen to any normal person when they see the unspeakable. Cage is driven to murder. There is a moment in the film that makes it brillant. Cage has a gun pointed at Eddie Poole, one of the men responsible for the film. Poole taunts him, and Cage finds he can't pull the trigger. Then, he walks out to his car, and gets his cell-phone. He calls Mary Anne's mom and tells her what happens, and asks permission to kill Poole. This shows us Cage's humanity. It shows us of his normalness most of us have and it shows the effect that seeing what he has seen has created in him. It shows the emotion we would have. This is not a fake film. It's gutsy, and isn't afraid of the consequences it has. People said Cage had lost his reputation as hollywood's most risk-tasking actor. I feel this brings back that status. A Box Office king like Cage had guts to take this part. Even though it wasn't much of a success, it is Cage's most human character and a magnificent performance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hardly ever do I see a film where the last 30 minutes are better than the rest of the film combined. 8MM is a good film, but it all plays like a typical murder mystery until the end. Toward the end characters are stuck asking some pretty tough questions of themselves and not liking the answers they find. Cage does a very good job playing a private investigator basically, who didn't know this underworld of illegal pornography existed. Phoenix is in for some comic relief, but I want to say something about James Gandolfini. Gandolfini plays Eddie Poole. Ayone familiar with his work should pay attention to one of the most natural actors I have ever seen. Eddie Poole could have been a cardboard cut-out, instead he is very hard to forget. I've never really been a big fan of Joel Schumacher's work and I didn't love this film, but the scenes at the end are examples that Schumacher has real talent. Just keep Joel Shumacher away from the Batman franchise.</fullReview>

Because of all the outrage over this film I just had to see it...and as it turns out it is a surprisingly good film. The best thing a movie can do is to transport the viewer into another time, place or situation...whether the vision is ugly or angelic, comforting or disturbing. Otherwise, why bother to sit through one and have it serve up the comfortable and familiar all over again (which must be at least 90% of the movies out there). 8mm is disturbing, but so what. The monsters in 8mm truly exist...whether the public gets outraged or not. It be nice if the world was a warm and fuzzy "When Harry Met Sally" place to live in...but alas.... My only gripe about the movie is it contained a few too many "hollywood" film moments and cliches...a few too many guns just out of the hero's reach and too many instances of talkative villains at crucial moments....good stuff all around though.....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't usually begin reviews like this, but here it seems appropriate to do so. I have read the user comments on here and most of them are really negative comments. People didin't find it disturbing enough, or it wasn't as descriptively graphic as Seven and so on. And since I personally liked this movie it actually bothers me that some people didn't appreciate this film. Not that people didn't like the movie, that I can understand, it is a dark story, but that people can't at least give kudos to what the movie has to say. I had a similar (although more disturbing) reaction to Last House On The Left as I did on this one. It wasn't a film that was made to enjoy, it was made to show the horrors that human beings can inflict on one another. I believe 8MM has walked a similar path.Perhaps my appreciation of this film is due to to my surroundings and my somewhat current events. Here in Southern Ontario just a few years ago we went through the Paul Bernardo trials. He was convicted of crimes very similar to the ones perpetrated in the film. And what we got at times were very graphic descriptions of what he did to his victims. He was a sick b*****d that lured unsuspecting girls to his den and then he and his wife would assault, torture, dehumanize, sodomize, rape, hold against their will and then kill them in disgusting manners. This film reminded me of that case. And it also reminded me that killers of this sort are not monsters, in society that is. They are normal and perhaps even attractive people that have charm. And that is how they get their victims. 8MM really showed what it must have been like to be one of the girls that went through this. And it paints a sick twisted picture of humans fetishes. So I guess what I am saying is that 8MM is not Star Wars. It is not even Schumacher's other brilliant look at the decay of society, Falling Down. At least in that film people had a reason to laugh. It wasn't always appropriate to do so, but they were permitted to. 8MM is not funny. It is not a light subject matter and it is not a brightly lit film where everyone lives happily ever after. 8MM is a sick movie but that is what it supposed to be. You can't have a subject matter like this and expect to see Nick and his wife and daughter on their patio having a picnic at the end of the film. It just wouldn't happen. Darkness is a part of everyone's life. We all have our Achilles Heals. We are all intrigued by Pandora's Box and there is a tiny bit of the Dark Side in even the most virtuous people. But most of know what is acceptable behaviour in society, sadly some of us can't accept that responsibility and monsters like the ones in this movie do exist.As I said, I didn't love this movie, but I did like it and I certainly appreciated what it had to say and how it said it. It was horrifying and it was disturbing. Why people criticize it I can understand, it is not for everyone's taste, but don't for one second diss it because it is not disturbing enough. Just the fact that things like this actually happen is enough to make you disturbed. And remember monsters like this are real. They really are. If you want proof, just go check out any major Toronto paper's ( Globe and Mail, Sun, Star ) archives for the last seven years ( they are all on the net). That monster is still alive. This film was almost about him. Almost.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was excellent! The plot's involvement with the porn industry would make anyone despise the industry. The film opens people's eyes to the filth that is present in our world today and may even spur people on to take some kind of action. The cinematography was very good and the camera was used effectivley. The editing was likewise! If the film was disturbing in a negatie way like some people have said then wouldn't the censors have it banned? 8 mm has a morale tale behind it that is clear enough for everyone to understand.

		<fullReview>On the face of it, this is a story about how a private detective put his feelings too deep in an assignment involving disturbed people. Despite such a seemingly pedestrian plot, I was drawn ever deeper into the movie as Cage's stone-faced yet soulful disposition broke down into that of remorse, hatred and dilemma. Schumacher's formulaic treatment works better for me here than in 7 -- 8mm is intense with a purpose, dark with a light at the end of the tunnel, slow with just the right amount of anticipation, seedy with a kind of slickness that compels disgusted viewers to glue their eyes on the action. IMHO really one notch up as the numeral in the title suggests...Also, unlike too many goody-two-shoe films of the same breed, this one actually lets Cage's character gratify his hatred of the villains. It is NOT a story about righteousness, because if someone you care for were the victim of such heinous brutality you will want to skin the murderers yourself even if that can't bring her back. Somewhere in 8mm is also probably a lesson for legions of Mary-Ann's out there who would want to run away to become "Hollywood stars."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Apart from the fact that the whole idea was actually borrowed from another movie made years ago, I was appalled at the way the director handles all (I mean all) situations as if they were booby traps undermining our family values and our little but happy lives. The movie can be seen successful if a director unveiling his ideas so overtly and obviously is forgiven in that sense. I was almost disgusted to see the same schemes as in Se7en, the same grayish green colors, even the same rain. I was angry with myself to have been watching Nicolas Cage, after a disaster like The City of Angels. I loathed to see a placard reading "way strong" or "way hard to swallow" or something like that.Although, I must admit that we had a quite fun with my friends right after the screening, joking over our little, pathetic, vicious, pornography touched lives, and happy that Nicolas Cage is returned home to his coward, pitiful wife who doesn't even have the courage to dump him forever after she leaves him. There's just one thing good about this flick, and that is the emerging star brother of River Phoenix, Joaquin (formerly Leaf)</fullReview>

When I realised that is was Nicolas Cage I came to the conclusion that this was a film to catapult him from second row to first. His voice during the film, his behaviour, his "familiarity" is just 100% "Cage" as I know him from previous movies. Well, I liked the movie but sometimes it seemed to me that the director's wishes and Cage's abilities (or disabilities) were in conflict. Anyway, the world of 1999 needed this movie and the people who made it did their job good. Applause!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you strip away the meat in this movie it is basically a private-eye seeks missing girl story. However the subject matter and story make it very interesting and I found it entertaining top start with.The problems started to seep in after a rather defining scene three-quaters of the way in. All of the main players were in the same room and things came to a head. After that it was almost as if they thought "Well we have a private-eye/missing girl story and so far we've missed all of the cliches, so we'll put them in now."From that scene onward the film took a real nose-dive. You have three "gun just out of the reach of our hero" scenes, one "gun just out of reach of the bad guy" scene. The "private eye one the phone to his wife telling her to get out of the house and don't ask why" scene. The obsessed private-eye with a wife who is going to leave him cos he's married to his job. The whole nine yards.When Cage watched the suspected snuff film for the first time, the acting made me cringe and wince as much as Cage was doing on-screen. And the scene after he catches one of the bad guys and is on the phone to the old woman is, and I mean this literally, the worst thing ever put to film. I was so embarrassed that I just sunk right down into my seat.The whole part of the wife was completely redundant, as was the plot-line involving the lawyer.This movie had massive potential but was drowned in needless cliche. There is also a parallel with Se7en with the good guy being so immersed in the world of evil that he is trying to penetrate that he begins to commit evil acts himself. A story line that I enjoy, but again it's been done a little too much.Would I recommend it? Not really. The good three quaters at the start is not good enough to justify the abysmal ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>8mm turned out to be a completely different film to what I initially thought it would be. But nevertheless, it ended up being just as entertaining. I believe that Nicolas Cage was completely outshone by Joaquin Phoenix, and it was just unfortunate that Joaquin's character took away any possibility of development. 8mm, and other films similar to it allow society the ability to comprehend that there is more to life than the circle you live in. Sometimes a trip to the other side is required to notice where exactly you fit into the grand scheme of things. Although Seven is a completely different film, you can see the parallels between the two, and I'ts fulfilling though saddening and frightening to see the dark canker underworld that in a sense, supports our society. 8mm was as dark and damaged as Seven was and indeed cements a permanent foothold in my list of favourite films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe I´m a pervert for saying this, but --I LOVE THIS MOVIE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Screenwriter for 8MM is Andrew Kevin Walker, who also wrote the awesome Se7en. Even if I hate comparing these two films (everyone does it...damn), I have to admit that these two films have much in common. The atmosphere of realistic disgust, great plot, great acting, and EXCELLENT ending. Both films also break many Hollywood cliches. Now for 8MM itself. Unfortunately, I still havent seen Leaving Las Vegas (damn me...Nicolas Cage is my favorite actor and I haven't seen his Oscar role), but Nicolas Cage´s Tom Wells MUST have been his next best performance to LLV at least. Other actors did a great job as well (Joaquin Phoenix as Max California or Peter Stormare as "Jarmusch of porn" Dino Velvet). Joel Schumacher did a good job as well (almost as good as David Fincher). The music was stunning....exotic rythms from Arabia...that's what I call a refreshing music after all those Horners, Zimmers etc. I can't help myself, but since I´ve seen 8MM I have to think about it. Like Max said : "There are things, that you're going to see, that you can´t unsee. They get in your head and they stay there." In short....a dark, depressing and all around awesome thriller. In my opinion 8MM IS better than Se7en. Definitely worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An average thrill.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is about a private investigator, played by Nicolas Cage, and how he is affected by a disturbing investigation into the murder of a young girl in a "snuff movie" shot on 8mm film. Given the plot and content of this movie you would think there would be plenty of explicit sex and violence but don't believe the hype, this is a mainstream Hollywood production and all the sex and violence is cleverly implied. Nicolas Cage turns in an adequate if seemingly subdued performance as his character becomes more and more depraved by the world of extreme porn but I think he is more suited to playing all action heroes as in 'Con Air' and 'The rock'. There is also a good supporting cast playing a range of sexual deviants but the character of Cage's wife is given very little depth and she is only ever seen at home with their child. The story line gives you just enough to keep you interested until the climax of the film but the plot becomes progressively flawed ending with some clichéd scenes. And for those who have seen the film, if Nicolas Cage's character was so concerned for the feelings of the mother of the missing girl, why did he not find out the location of her child's body when he had the chance? Surly this should have been his number one priority to relive her suffering.? Overall this film is about revenge and justification for murder prompting some interesting debate among the audience, but wait for the video release</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Marvelous, Yet Disturbing Film. One To Watch - Once.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this movie with only a vague notion of its subject matter and context, and in my opinion this is the best context with which to judge this film. Although a shocking and disturbing film, this was one of the best films I have ever seen - Joel Schumacher on top form, recalling the days of 'Falling Down' rather than the latest Batman efforts.The characters in this film were marvelous and in the end you begin to get a REAL feeling for the character Tom Welles and although you may not agree with his actions or methods you still understand them. This kind of empathy and understanding is rarely seen lately and is a credit to both Nicolas Cage and Joel Schumacher. One impressive surprise for me was Jaoquin Phoenix, an impressive performance I thought and Phoenix seemed to me the perfect man for the job.To sum up - this is a brilliant film and shines above anything seen in recent years, but beware. 8mm is a horrible and disgusting film and is not one for the squeamish or easily offended. If you know what this film is about and you still want to see it then I'm sure you'll agree with me about the quality of the film - but I doubt that anyone could bring themselves to LIKE the film. I have no desire to see 8mm again, but choosing to watch it the first time round is one of the best cinema-related decisions I've made in years.</fullReview>

On the bad side I see only the end of the film where, following already seen American patterns, the good kills the evil, a private justice, the old western law, something that in Europe would have probably seen the arrival of the Police or far less violence. In the Italian version (120 min) there is violence, but the thing that mostly disturbs is the environment shown, an environment that is probably not only fruit of the director imagination: It is sad to see how far can human mind go and that should induce people to think. So a good film that forces to think and opens a window over an obscure world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having JUST watched 8mm I feel compelled to write a few things about it.Firstly, I would like to say that it had me on the edge of my seat throughout. It was ugly, sordid and nasty but also enthralling. I left the cinema feeling a little beaten up!Second, the script by Andrew Kevin Walker was outstanding. As in Se7en he has created a world populated by some of the worst people in cinema history. But again he has created real people. (Most of) the cental protagonists all have credible reasons for doing what they do and there are moments that are genuinely touching.Joel Schummacher has gone some way towards redeeming himself for his Batman travesties. I like him when he gets his hands dirty. He has now made TWO good films: Falling Down and 8mm.What s#*ts me is the lousy casting. I agree about the casting of BAD GUY actors as the BAD GUYS. Every one of the "villains" was played by an actor who ALWAYS plays villains. In a film that (give me some room here) tries to show the 'real' effects of violence and HARD core porn it is a cop out to portray the "bad guys" as... well, BAD GUYS! It cheapens it for me. He might as well have had all the bad guys with twirly moustaches and capes.Nic Cage played Nic Cage which, admittedly he can do quite wll from time to time. The real star was Joaquin Phoenix. He's shaping up to be quite a good, quirky actor. The new Sean Penn or Johnny Depp, if you will.I did enjoy the film alot. It's not an ideal "date flick" but it makes for powerful, confronting viewing.I might change my mind with time (It did finish less than two hours ago ) but right now I'm giving it a 9/10Cheers</fullReview>

The ambiance in the movie is one I never saw or felt before. I think especially the art direction and certain actors (Joaquin Phoenix, Peter Stormare) helped to create the ambiance.

It's the kind of movie you actually don't know if you liked it or not when it ends, but after a while you realise it was quite good. Why? Because it left you shivering and THINKING.While I was watching the movie, the only movie that made me feel like this was Seven, I then decided to look in the IMDB to check if it was related to find it was written by the same guy..So, to my opinion, even if I thought I saw everything Hollywood had to offer, this is the kind of movie that lets me know there is still people doing original movies and not focusing on happy ending. Glad to see there is still people like this.If you are disturbed by the subject, maybe you shouldn't see the movie, but this is the kind of thing that happens in real life, maybe not that extreme of course, it's a movie, but you can find most of this stuff over the Internet quite easily, this makes you really think about how sick some people are.And as a final word, on the funny side.. people who talked about throwing up, you sure miss a lot of horror movies to get that feeling when watching a movie ;-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>8mm does not deal with the subject matter as honestly as it should have.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall, 8MM wasn't a horrible movie. I had its definite good moments. Take for instance the scene where Nicolas Cage's character wants to kill one of the men responsible for the killing of the girl on the film, but he is not psychologically strong enough and hence he phones the victim's mother and asks for her permission. This scene was truly outstanding. There are other good scenes or ideas as well. I like the line where, Joaquin Phoenix says that once you are in the underworld, you will see things that you cannot unsee. This man seems to be a good person who was somehow trapped into this dark underworld of graphic pornography. There was one point where he said "I don't condone it". He obviously doesn't like what he is doing, but now that he has crossed the line he is trapped. This should have also been what happened to the Cage character. The audience just doesn't feel the trauma that I'm sure he would have been feeling during his investigation. The film should have delved more deeply into the traumas that he would have experienced. I heard that there was another ending shot, where he had seen so much and was so disturbed that his only out was death and hence he drove his car into a wall killing himself. This type of ending would have been very bleak, but at least it would have allowed the film-makers to deal with the subject matter more honestly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw 8MM and I liked it. However, it wasn't as good as I wanted it to be. The movie, while always interesting, is slowly paced. The movie is barely over two hours but it felt much longer. My biggest complaint about the film is that it isn't as visually graphic as its subject matter would imply. The film investigates the underground world of ultra-hardcore fetish porn. I find it odd that we don't even get to see the 8mm film that's being investigated in its entirety. We mostly see Mr. Cage's reaction to it, which seemed to me to be overdone. His reactions are too surface for my tastes (he scrunches up his face and says "ooh" and "ahh" a lot). I feel something subtler would be stronger. I don't think the filmmakers were brave enough to allow us to truly feel the pain of the implications of the film's themes. I found it too easy to dissociate from all of the movie's characters. Of course, if the film had a stronger stomach, it would be accused of reveling in the same elements it seeks to condemn (though I've heard this criticism leveled at the film in its current state). An NC-17 DVD release of the uncut film may improve the film but the over-the-top villains would still prevent this from being a truly disturbing film. The climax of SEVEN worked so well because many of John Doe's arguments made sense. The bad guys here have nothing interesting to say (except to say that they do it "because [they] like it." Bravo to the filmmakers for eliminating any pop-psychology babble).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>8MM is definitely not for everyone, a few groups of people left during the final half hour and I really can't blame them. It's definitely one of the most disturbing films I have seen in a very long time but thanks to another great script by Andrew Kevin Walker it succeeds very well. Nicolas Cage pulls off yet another great performance and it was nice to see Joel Shumacher get out of his Batman &amp; Robin style and take this film seriously. The issues in this film are very serious and are taken to extreme, the whole part about "snuff" films is highly disturbing and graphic but it needs to be. All the performances are well delivered and the story line goes through many twists that bring a similar resemblance to Seven in mind. The only thing that was disappointing about it was the music which sounded like something you'd hear in Dances With Wolves. But other than that, I'd recommend it to anyone who can sit through something disturbing who also must have a strong stomach.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seeing "8MM" reminded me of how many movies these days come out that claim to be "thrillers" and then don't deliver any thrills. This film is the exact opposite of those movies. I've seen a lot of thrillers in the past few years, but I can't remember very many that have delivered genuine suspense- A Simple Plan and Fargo are the only ones I can think of. There is one scene in particular, where Nicolas Cage's character is walking around a guy's house looking for him. The suspense in this scene is something similar to the climax of "The Silence of the Lambs," and it matches that scene in its ability to create suspense that you can literally feel; it's so unbearably strong that you could almost cut it with a knife. It was made by some of the same people who made Se7en, and there are similarities- the dark lighting and atmosphere, the look of the cities covered in rain and shadows, the strong suspense. While Se7en was an exceptionally well-made film, I liked this one even more, because it didn't feel the need to hammer its point home with overkill - this one is simply content to show us how the characters are affected by what has happened to them, and this works much better. There is some graphic violence and some bizarre sexual scenes, which are certainly not for the squeamish. Anybody who's seen Se7en will know whether they can take it or not. However, I hope you check it out, because I would definitely recommend it to you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As usual Nic Cage is able to take the dark side of his own persona- which he readily admits he has- and use it to give depth to his character. It is the small things- flinching at what he sees on the screen, tacking Mary Ann's picture to the motel wall that gives his performance depth. This is a disturbing movie- it haunted me for hours after I had seen it- truly- it probes the underbelly of life- where the maggots crawl-- worst of all- it's the respectable people who can be the rottenest inside. Joacquim Phoenix really played well with Cage- almost like a robin to a batman... Not for the weak at heart- but a film that asks some tough questions and the answers are not pretty at all...</fullReview>

A few plot twists seem a bit contrived, however, and the film is occasionally slightly slow in its pace.Good acting overall. Cage is decent, while Joaquin Phoenix is excellent as a symbolic Virgil to Cage's Dante. Despite being written by Andrew Kevin Walker, it falls well short of being a new 'Se7en'.</fullReview>

After the abysmal "Batman and Robin" and "Snake Eyes" I was worried that Joel Schumacher and Nicolas Cage might might mess it up, but both did a fine job. This movie is not quite as good as "Seven," but how many films are? It has several interesting performances including Cage as a detective, Joaquin Phoenix as video store clerk and Peter Stormare (the nearly mute killer in "Fargo") as a porn auteur. "8MM" is very, very dark, but that is to be expected from a movie about snuff films. It could have just been a soulless attempt to shock the audience, but I found it very involving and interesting. Even I was surprised at some of the material about the ultra-hardcore sex trade they were able to get in under the R rating. Those who have a difficult time with such things will most likely call the film garbage, those who can look past the subject matter will find much to appreciate in the clever but disturbing screenplay and the bleak, evocative art direction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A dark and disturbing thriller reminiscent of "Seven" (surprise - same screenwriter). After his "Batman"-flicks, I did not expect Schumacher to come back to form, but this is almost a masterpiece. When Nicolas Cage sets out to discover the origins of a "snuff" movie, he is forced on a trip down into the deepest pits of human perversion, learning things about himself and man in general that nobody would like to know about. And we are forced to go with him. Cage's performance is flawless. Like his "Snake Eyes", "8MM" is also about the act of seeing and film-making. Peter Stormare is over-the-top as the "Jim Jarmush of porn", but nothing compared to "Machine" (the guy with the leather mask). Be prepared for some really nasty twists, gross sexual details, and abandon all hope for nice and decent Hollywood entertainment. I loved it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty good except for one weak point...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...and Nicholas Cage is that weak point.Almost everything works in 8MM: the secondary actors are excellent, certainly Joaquin Phoenix, who was a total revelation when I saw this 8 ears ago. The cinematography is pretty good and the screenplay is great. One of the best screenplays ever written. The screenplay is so good that even if it was directed by Joel Schumacher, who is a horrible director, its power cannot be diminished. I love the tone and the pacing and the general concept of the story. The ending, at Machine's house, is truly suspenseful. Some scenes are genuinely heartbreaking. There's nothing "happy happy" about this story. The only thing that prevents it from being great (aside from the sometimes pedestrian direction from Joel) is the presence of Nicholas Cage.I always have difficulty accepting Cage in any "normal" role. Nic usually excels in neurotic roles but in 8MM, he plays a normal guy, a private detective, who is slowly lead into a dark world with almost no point of return. The story needed an actor who could play a "dull normal" of sorts who becomes obsessed with his new case and is seduced by a dark side within him, a side he never knew existed in him. One of the many tragic aspects of the story is watching a married man with a newborn baby go over the edge and lose all sense of what's good and what's wrong. This aspect about the story automatically makes the casting of Cage a mistake: does anyone really believe Cage as a nice guy who never explored his dark side? Any other actor would have been a better choice than Cage, who seems to confuse "normal" with lifeless. He's such a non-presence here that the film almost falters irremediably because of it. The role needed an actor who was able to emote internally as he becomes more and more involved with the story. We needed to see him change gradually and see him fight with his internal demons, which never really happens with Cage. He has a blank expression almost throughout the entire film. Things aren't help much with Joaquin's star-making role stealing the film from right under Cage's feet.The other awful aspect about 8MM is the villain played by Peter Stormare. He 's way too camp to be 100% believable here. He almost looks like a villain who belongs in a, huh, BATMAN movie. I don't blame Stormare but Schumacher's direction here. His character should have been more subtle and Schumacher couldn't help but include some campy element in the grim story.But aside from those weak aspects, 8MM is one of my favorite stories ever. Notice that I didn't say films. Like I already said, the film is pretty good but the story itself is great. Andrew Kevin Walker's screenplays is one of my favorites. I like the story so much that I downloaded the screenplay from the web and read it. It's that good. It's well reported that Walker and Schumacher fought during production and I definitely believe this happened. What could have been a great one-of-a-kind film was turned into just a good thriller with some really thought provoking ideas in it. It's a shame really. But as it is it's still worth watching, certainly for fans of Joaquin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Dark, mysterious and effective detective story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've grown a bit of a love/hate relationship with Joel Schumacher over the years. I enjoyed 'Tigerland' and liked 'Phone Booth' in places but his Batman films leave a lot to be desired. '8MM' is one of those films that tells me that I know, deep down, there's a good filmmaker inside Schumacher, somewhere.8MM's dark tone and eerie atmosphere throughout is one of the things that constantly stands out in the film and this is a good thing. Even when Welles (Cage) is with his family and not in any trouble, the foreboding atmosphere is present creating and nice feeling of consistency. As for Cage's character himself, he shows that he's right at home in the detective, noir role that is harder to pull off than it seems and offers an effective voice for the voice-overs that occur at nicely paced occurrences. What also adds to the film's environment and overall tone is the use of the colour black. Despite the obvious lack of lighting and windows on the dimly lit locations, other things such as people's cars, jackets and even sunglasses are used to good effect.What was also good is the fact that although this is a detective story; we're trying to find out 'why?' as opposed to 'what?' We know that there's a film that's the problem and that it needs figuring out as to 'why' it was made. Because of this, the sense of mystery as to why it was made in the first place is felt a lot more effective than a 'what' detective story. An example may be 'Sleepy Hollow' as the detective tries to discover 'what' is killing all the villagers only to realise that the 'why' behind the reason makes itself known far too close to the end. In 8MM, the question is asked at the very beginning and sets the story off very effectively. This is supposed to be a mystery, after all.Although the film does rely on cause and effect a little too glaringly at times, such as the 'finding the clue in the toilet' scene when the person living there hadn't found it in all those years and the fact the classic 'bad guy gives it all away' piece is there which then seriously aids the hero in his attempt at escaping. What's more; there're a lot of telephone exchanges between Welles and his wife early on which seemed unnecessary and the finale, although gripping in its build up, fell a little flat when it came to the decisive battle between hero and villain.With a few minor things aside, even if they badly stick out during the viewing, 8MM is dark, eerie, nicely paced and entertaining enough to warrant a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I totally went to watch this movie unknowing the content and I was shocked but at the same time gripped by the intense plot. This is not a film to watch rather it is a film to experience. No beauty or romance just a story that cuts to the gut of porn film dealers and the brutality that occurs. However the violence is purely used to strengthen the plot which I think was importation in this film to give it validity. The bad guys are really the bad guys in this! Then diametric to the "darkside" was Nicholas trying to bring justice but finds that just being the hero isn't enough. He has to struggle as to what is right and wrong with dealing with some of the worst scum. Joaquin Phoenix is good to have in the film. He brings a medium to both of the opposing sides. Also, he really makes you feel for his death and only further strengthens the absolute cruelty of the porn producers. Finally, the ending is the best part of the film. It really builds it up to a climax. So it's a film that asks questions and explores which engages the mind of the "experience-er".</fullReview>

I don't know what changes were made to Andrew Kevin Walker's script, but if Machete's lines are the same, Walker is brilliant. (Spoilers here!!!) The fact that he does what he does because he likes it made the entire movie worthwhile. I hate when the killer in a film became the person he/she is because of some past trauma or psychological condition. It can work, but it has been so over done. Here we are presented with a man who kills for the sheer thrill of it. He knows he can get away with it, he knows he is protected, and most of all, he gets paid to do it. He looks nothing like we expect, he lives in a normal, suburban neighborhood (the only cliché was the fact that it was next to a graveyard), and he lives with his mother/grandmother.That said, the film itself is also very well done. Schumacher almost redeems himself from destroying the Batman franchise in the 90's. The characters are well-rounded, though I would have liked to see a little more of Catherine Keener's character, but she did well with the small part she had. Nicholas cage does an excellent job as the private investigator who gets in too deep, and Joaquin Phoenix was perfect as Max California ("I'd hate to see you in a situation where you needed a battery operated vagina and didn't have one"). However, I think it can be safely said that the best role in 8 MM was Peter Stormare. His portrayal of Dino Velvet is downright scary. He's depraved, he's sick, he's a pervert of unimaginable proportions, and he's an "artist". He shows no concern for the lives of others and is obviously interested only in making twisted films for good money.All in all, I gave this film an 8 out of 10. Some may consider that a bit high, but I think when you put all the elements of this film together, it adds up pretty well. Yes it is shocking, yes it is dark (in fact, it's one of the darkest films I've seen in a while), but it's a well written, well directed and well acted work. Definitely worth seeing at least once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you have children, this is a violently frightening movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the moment I happened to flip across this movie, about 10 minutes into the story, I was mesmerized. This movie will take you into the most vile underbelly of our deceitfully, pretending to be wholesome, society. Nicholas Cage nails his character from the moment he steps onto the screen. As he travels along the path his journey takes him you see his gradual realization of just how depraved and sick people in our society can behave and the lengths they will go to to feed that depravity. He has an outward nonchalantness about him, like he "has seen it all" sort of attitude because of his chosen line of work. Very quickly he begins to realize that what he has seen is nothing compared to what he is beginning to see. This movie is well-written, well-directed, well-acted and well-thought out. It draws you in and never lets go until the very end and at the end you wonder if his character or you, for that matter, will ever view things quite the same ever again. Unfortunately, what is portrayed in this movie, snuff-films,really do exist and there is no telling how many missing teenagers end up like this child in this movie, that is why I say if you have children be afraid, be very afraid. The entire time I was watching this story unfold I was thinking about my 15 year old and at times it made me feel physically ill. This movie is definitely not for the faint of heart or the squeamish. It is gritty, in-your-face realism and the tones and colors in this film make you feel it's tenor the entire time.If you like taut, psychological thrillers then this movie is for you. And as another review stated, sometimes you don't have to actually see, in its entirety, what is happening your own imagination can, unfortunately, fill in the blanks on it's own. The only reason I gave it a 9 and not a 10 is one scene in the movie is never really fully explored or explained (the suicide) you are just kind of left to draw your own conclusions, which, maybe that was the whole point of that particular part, but, alas I shall never really know the truth. Just be ready to see something you never really wanted to see or know about in the first place. Martha-Alabama BTW: Afterthought--I wanted to see this movie when it first came out and then I forgot about it and then found it flipping channels on satellite. That explains my review of a movie that is several years old but just now reviewed by me :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No don't worry this film isn't entirely about Joaquin having blue hair, but it does it for the girls, as does his role as a naughty undergroundy porno guy type, but also a disturbing thriller uncovering a quiet secret world of the 'snuff'. Fairly perverted and at times sick, this will satisfy those with unusual film appitites and Schu' doesn't let you down in the directorial department delivering some beautiful filmaking. Fans of Cage's previous work will find he is on full form as the 'good guy' but will pity his poor wife and baby, anybody who wants to see the bad side of Joaquin will sink their teeth in deep. Be warned- this ain't no run of the mill Cage thriller, get ready for something interesting...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie, though at times sickening and very hard to watch, is amazing. We all know about pornography and twisted people in leather and whips, but most of us don't delve deep into thinking about the lives of these people. This movie does and it is disgusting. I didn't really realize how big the underground porno industry is, though the film is fictional, there is no doubt in your mind, that somewhere, this is really happening...girls wanting to get famous, sickos looking for new and different ways to fulfill their darkest fantasies. And the character Tom Welles is easy to support and cheer for, because what he feels when he looks upon this industry, is exactly what you will feel. Nicolas Cage is brilliant, and captivating and Joaquin Phoenix is also delightful to watch. His character Max California is the only lovable character in the film and Phoenix plays him well enough to make you fall in love for his joyous character, so that in his last moments you will feel for him and be shocked. He is also darn hot too, in his little Gothic way. Unfortunately though in this film, justice is served. And as an audience you know that in the real world, that just isn't the case. Though it is satisfying to see the bad guys get what they deserve, you know that it would be far more believable if Cage's character Tom Welles had been killed by the disgusting Machine character. I especially found Cage's performance at the end of movie to be completely truthful and I nearly cried for Welle's poor tormented soul. This movie will have you on the edge of your seat, and though it is restricted to 18+ I recommend younger teens (15/16/17) to see it, so they don't take the easy way to fame. Death.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once the film started, I knew I was going to enjoy every minute of this film. Nicolas Cage gets himself deeply involved with a very rich mysterious client who lives in a huge mansion and has a horrible film which her recently deceased husband had hidden. Cage meets up with some very bad degenerates who love Sex more than anything else and make their living trying their very best to horrify their sick customers. There are excellent film locations in California, Long Island, N.Y. and many other places where Cage has to try and track down certain characters in order to solve this mystery. Meanwhile, Cage has a wife and baby who begin to wonder why their husband and father is kept away for such long periods of time. This is definitely a great film to enjoy from beginning to end.</fullReview>

Anyway, the film itself is both disturbing and touching, especially the scenes involving Cage and his baby daughter. The villains are evil, exploiting young women and coming across as creepy pond scum. Cage's character is a street-wise private eye who gets a strange case, looking for a porn actress who appeared on one of the snuff movies mentioned earlier. Was she really murdered, or is it a hoax? We work out the answer soon enough, or rather Nicholas does. I think this is his best film, and I recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>8MM starts with private detective Tom Welles (Nicolas Cage) receiving a phone call from an attorney named Daniel Longdale (Anthony Heald) who represents Mrs. Christian (Myra Carter) whose rich husband has recently died. Welles meets Mrs. Christian who says that she has discovered a reel of film in her late husbands safe that appears to be snuff &amp; seemingly show's a young girl being brutally abused &amp; murdered, she asks Welles if he will investigate the film &amp; try to put her mind at rest that it's fake. Welles accepts, with a little detective work he learns that the girls name is Mary Ann Mathews (Jenny Powell) &amp; that she was reported missing several years ago. After speaking with her mum Janet (Amy Morton) the case takes him to California where he meets porn shop clerk Max California (Joaquin Phoenix) whom he enlists to help guide him through the underground world of S/M &amp; hard porn to find the men responsible for the supposed snuff film... This American German co-production was co-produced &amp; directed by Joel Schumacher &amp; is a reasonably entertaining thriller with a sleazy undertone. The script by Andrew Kevin Walker (who apparently left the film after a disagreement with Schumacher who along with Nicholas Kazan reworked the script) moves along at a decent enough pace although I was starting to get a little bored by the end &amp; I think at 2 hours it's too long &amp; drawn out. The story is simple with basic mystery elements that don't particularly grip or engage, the whole thing is somewhat predictable &amp; it paints the entire S/M &amp; porn community as gun carrying sadistic freaks which clearly they are not. Virtually all the character's in 8MM that Welles runs into are scum who peddle sick porn for their own gain &amp; care little for anyone else, nothing like having a balanced point of view... I also found the climax where Welles phoned Mary's mum for justification &amp; permission to take revenge on the people reasonable for her daughter's death really silly &amp; just didn't work for me. Having said that it still provides decent entertainment &amp; is certainly watchable if you want something a little darker than usual. The actual porn &amp; violence content is rather low, there is some nudity &amp; gore but things are generally kept to a minimum, there is however plenty of very strong language. With a supposed budget of about $40,000,000 8MM doesn't do anything to justify that sort of money, the film looks slick, it has a gritty washed-out look &amp; is well made for sure but nothing really stands out. The acting is OK especially the likable Phoenix although Cage isn't that good &amp; is undistinguished, bland &amp; forgettable as Welles as he makes the transition from a normal everyday life to one filled with porn &amp; darkness. I quite liked 8MM, it's a pretty good thriller but ultimately the misinformed moral stance on S/M &amp; porn in general hurts it &amp; the story itself could have been a little stronger as it contains one of the most unsurprising twists I've ever seen &amp; little justification is given for anything that happens. Worth a watch but by no means a masterpiece, try to catch it on TV for free.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This Hollywood flick explores the underground world of snuff films, with entertaining, albeit disturbing, results. The film, to its credit, doesn't shy away from the subject matter, giving it a suitably dark and depressing tone. I also quite like the setup; a wealthy old man with a skeleton in his closet, only to be revealed after he dies. All the actors fit nicely into their characters too, with Nicolas Cage giving one of his better performances in a difficult role. Of course, as a Hollywood production, it does have some requisite glitz but its still a solid, effective film. The commentary with director Joel Schumacher is decent and informative, as he rarely lets up.</fullReview>

Joel Schumacher jumps his way into the hidden worlds of voyeurism and pornography, putting on the screen the worst perversions of human beings.

		<fullReview>I knew this movie wouldn't get the rating it deserved because of how awful and disturbed it leaves the viewer. But then you realize that it is real. None of the sex or violence is gratuitous. The film displays the deepest levels of perversion found in the human heart, and pits against that perversion the only kind of hero that could face it down: flawed, pained, tough, and at his core, genuinely good and caring. No punches are pulled. For the sex addicts, the film has sympathy, but no mercy. They are shown as losing the battle with their own souls, but at least fighting it. That's how addicts are, and as in real life, nothing saves them in the end. Nick Cage is correctly cast as possibly the only man in Hollywood capable of the role. Phoenix has you hoping from the start that Max can be saved, even though you pretty much know better all along. It's an amazing film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Between 'Terrific' &amp; 'Trash'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is often made out to be 'very provocative, intriguing, shocking, etc.' or a horrible performance by Nicholas Cage that should not be two hours long. The truth is, naturally, somewhere in between.I feel that the film was, indeed, rather shocking at times; it drew me in very much at parts, and I felt very much like I wanted to see the end of it. At times, naturally, Nicholas Cage takes away from the film with his over-the-top nature, and the overall acting is not spectacular. Nor is the plot -- although the basis is very intriguing and lured me in, I found that there were certain portions of the plot that would have been better left out. However, other parts of the movie were truly provocative and interesting. The film provokes a lot of mixed feelings, drifting in between 'terrific' and 'trash.'I was captivated by the film, and I certainly enjoyed it, but there was a lot of other junk thrown into it that took away from many parts of the movie. Overall, if you are interested in a shocking topic such as snuff, it is worth a watch without a doubt. However, do not expect a gem. If you are weak at heart, do not watch it, and if you enjoy that which makes the weak at heart squeamish, it is decent enough. If you like the basis and idea behind this film, definitely see the 1979 film 'Hardcore.'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unfairly lambasted mystery thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all; I see that a lot of criticism for this film is stemming from the fact that it's 'unpleasant'.... but since this is a film about underground 'snuff' film-making, how could you expect it to be anything else? What do you want? Pink, fluffy elephants? A house made of ginger bread? How about flowers, and birds that sing love songs? Then you really would be complaining; the underground world portrayed in this film is unpleasant (not that I've ever been), so it must be portrayed as being unpleasant. Criticising it for that is simply ludicrous; if you don't like films of this nature, don't watch it is my advice. That being said...the film follows Tom Welles (Nicholas Cage), a private detective that is hired to hunt down the origins of a snuff film found by an old widow amongst her husband's things. More importantly than that, the old lady wants Welles to find out if the girl is still alive...however, while conducting his investigation, Welles is drawn into a world of things barely legal and his investigation develops into an obsession...8mm tries to be two things; an intriguing mystery and a heartbreaking drama, but it doesn't lampoon either one effectively enough to be classed as either. The mystery side of the story, while very good, is far too short, and it seems that Welles gets to the bottom of the mystery without too much effort. The mystery also hangs too much on Joaquin Phoenix's character; a street smart...ahem, pervert, that knows everything. If it wasn't for him, Welles would most likely have been sat at home twiddling his thumbs wondering why he hasn't got any leads; and this doesn't inspire a great confidence in our hero from the audience. That being said, the mystery still moves well and the underground world of snuff film-making is very intriguing. The drama stems from the girl in the video's mother and Welles' resulting lust for revenge. This actually works a lot better than I thought it would; but it still doesn't really make you feel anything for any of the characters. In the final third, the movie turns into a revenge thriller and it somewhat loses it's way, but it's still more than exciting enough and there are scenes towards the end that are very powerful.As I said, the world portrayed in this film is intriguing. It's a journey into the unknown for the audience (at least I hope it is!), and the way that it is shown in this film is excellent. A vast array of characters are on display; we've got the mask wearing 'Machine', who is an enigma in himself and has one of the film's more potent lines ("I do these things because I like them, I do them because I WANT to"), then we've got the director, Dino Velvet, played to perfection by Peter Stormare (a very underused actor), Joaquin Phoenix's character and various other shady characters. The director; Joel Schumacher has proved himself to be something of a one hit wonder after the magnificent 'The Lost Boys', but this film is more than enough to prove otherwise; his direction is superb, it's moody when it needs to be, it's exciting when it needs to be and it's morbid when it needs to be. The acting all round is good, with Cage gaining all the major plaudits. Cage should make more films of this nature; he has a sleazy look about him that could be utilized. Not to mention the fact that he's very cool...Overall, 8mm isn't a great film and it most certainly could have been a lot better. If you want a film about snuff films, I would recommend 'Tesis' over this one, but if you want another after watching Tesis; 8mm is the place to be. Not a great film, but well worth watching. Unless you're one of those people who'll criticise it for being unpleasant, in which case; don't bother.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a kind of surprised when I see that 8mm only gets 5.6 stars ( in average ) in here. In fact, I used to watch this film for more than 20 times ( I got the DVD ) when I was in college, and I think it is one of the best film I even seem in these years.I actually can understand why most people don't like the film. I guess it is because this film digs up the underground world that related to the "Underground Porns" Well, as you can understand, most people just can't accept the topic, and thus don't like the people, movies, and books that talk about it ( Well, people like ignoring things that they don't like but actually exist. How stupid is that? )Anyway, 8mm sure is a powerful and underrated movie. Its' story, script, casting, and the characters' acting are all wonderful. The first half of the movie may seem a little slow, but the second half is very breath taking, especially when Max gets killed, and Tom (Cage) tries to run away ( I still remember when I watched this part the first time with my girlfriend, I fast forwared so that I could find out can he really escape before I went on with the film, and got my ass kicked by my girlfriend...... ). Also, the guy who plays as Max in the movie has the best performance, and lines in the film. I will give 8.5 stars out of 10 for this film. However, this is a film that only for those people who have an open mind, and willing to see the dark side of our world.P.S. : See the comments on this film from the users "int32", and "Fat-Boy99". I am highly agree with them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not very good, but OK for this kind of a movie, I guess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before watching this film, I had no idea there was something called "snuff films". Apparently, snuff is porn that suddenly turns into a real-life killing, right there, in front of the camera. I don't know if these films exist for real, but I know that they are rumored to be real enough. The movie deals with these sick films, or, rather, one film in particular. A widow finds a snuff film in the safe of her dead husband, and so she hires a private investigator to find out about whether or not the killing is real. The P.I.(Nicholas Cage) has to see and experience the most disturbing and disgusting things during his investigation; fetish porn, several other snuff films, etc. The film shows how he finally snaps, near the end of the film, after having experienced so much filth. This sounds good enough, and it could have been good, but the directing lacks the intensity and raw emotion that it should have, leaving the emotion that is in the film feeling forced. The plot is fairly good, but it moves along at a very bad pace. Almost the entire second half is dedicated to the P.I. flipping out after having seen too much, and it just seems like the director wanted to milk this theme for all it was worth. The acting is mostly good. The characters are, with the exception of the main characters and one or two supporting characters, badly written cliches. Though I did think the overall theme was pretty good, the execution was very bad; they really wasted some good potential there. I recommend this only to big fans of the mystery/thriller genre, or to people who the theme appeals to. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The unexpectedly low rating of 8MM I think can only be attributed to the choice of the movie's main theme - snuff &amp; porno. Although the scenario tries to compensate the gritty elements by over-injecting 'the family values', and (unconvincingly) sugaring the main character in his home sweet home, many believe the movie is revolting due to the very fact that it's about the snuff. On the other hand, others expect the movie to overshadow porno flicks they accustomed to, and blame the director because it hasn't ( big surprise huh ). I think that the unbiased appreciation of 8MM can only come from these who don't fall in either group, which is surprisingly small, so here I'll try to comment from this point of view.*MINOR SPOILERS*. Cage's hero, PI Tom Welles, investigates origins of a snuff movie, but the path leads too deep, and at the end his family is in danger. No surprise that the film ends with the bad guys dead and the family saved. The real interest is to watch the Welles' character, its transformations along the path, especially his resistance to kill Eddie, who actually didn't kill himself. The scene where Welles doesn't know what to do with Eddie, and calls to Mrs.Mattews to get a licence to kill, and receives none, I think is a turning point for him. I personally doubt that this would be a first kill for a PI with such a reputation, but imagining it is, Cage acted this transition from an average guy into a resolute killer very, very convincing.I think the movie is worth watching, but certain tolerance is required, both for hard 'snuff' and soft 'family' parts. ***/****</fullReview>

The possible murderer, when his face is revealed, just adds the final straw to your already lumbering misery. The very muck Cage must wallow in would leave anyone a little warped and as a viewer I couldn't look at the human psyche the same way again. You see the supposed murderer's face and you don't get what you expected and this stops you dead in the tracks. You realize that the darkness hidden can lay dorment, until the ways it can be released, are opened. The person's face doesn't matter. The face and person are only shells..the wickedness can stay festering..boiling..until the proper time and place lets it come forth.

		<shortDescription>Good movie, disturbing and truly twisted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is one of those movies that people either really like or really hate. I for one happen to be in love with dark,twisted movies,and this one is no exception. I'm not going to waste my time explaining the plot, there are many other comments already on here that can do that,but I'll state why I like this movie. I've always liked Andrew Kevin Walker, but Joel Schumacher...never really liked what he's done, but this has to be his best. The imagery in the film is very depicting of filth and can stick to your head. The music in some scenes is brutal and disgusting, and the acting is superb. I really like Cage and Gandolfini together. Gandolfini brings his brutal character physique and aggressive personality alive, and puts together the perfect porno advertiser or whatever. The story had a few flaws, but I'm glad it got made. Actually, I wasn't surprised one bit why it had such a low rating, it was filthy. Most people don't want to see this, as it shows the pure weaknesses of our society, primarily American. I'm sure if this took place in Asia, it wouldn't be as bad. Give it a shot, and be fair, but still, proceed with caution.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie, but too Hardcore for Cage fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie on video after I borrowed it from a friend. Having seen Cage hits, Gone in 60 Seconds, Face/Off, and Snake Eyes, I was expecting another great Cage movie, of which I was not disappointed. And with a class act like James Gandolfini(The Soprano's), one couldn't help but be pleased. The story: Tom Welles(Cage) is hired by an old lady to investigate a movie she found after her husbands death, that has the brutal murder of a young girl in an S+M video. So Welles goes looking and gets caught up in the chase. When he does find the murderer, he confronts him and kills him. The story is all whacked, but it is suspenseful, and interesting at times. Using skills like that in Snake Eyes, Cage gives a brilliant performance, but any hope of the movie being worth watching (to most people anyway) is clouded by the S+M flavor which in my opinion istaken a little too far. If this does not bother you, and you are looking for good acting and decent action, this is for you. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good thriller!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I cannot understand why certain comments about this movie are so negative. It's been a while since I saw it, but the acting performances of Nicholas Cage and the rest of the cast are that strong that I saw the movie from beginning to end without taking a breath, so to speak. To my opinion, 8 MM is much stronger that Se7en in its very disturbing and sick message.I guess there is a certain disbelief among viewers of this film about its theme. The facts depicted in 8MM do take place, snuff movies do exist, e.g. in China where making such movies is punishable by death.The film, apart from being a thriller classic - it will be valued as such in due time, look for example how "Citizen Kane" was first greeted by audiences in 1941, and how it is viewed today - also has a signal function, namely presenting us with a terribly disturbing fact of our present-day society, pornography and its terrible children. I think that 8 MM was made before movie audiences were ripe for it, and I predict that within a couple of years, this excellent made movie will be rediscovered, and valued higher than the 5.8 it surely doesn't deserve!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbed,but flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Simular to Paul Schrader's Hardcore(1979),which saw a father entering the underworld of the pornography business in an attempt to find his daughter.8mm sees private investigator Tom Welles(Nicolas Cage)enter a far more sinister and perverted underworld in an attempt to discover the truth behind a film where a young girl appears to be brutally murdered.Aided by Max California (Joaquin Phoenix),a would be rock star who works in a porn store and knows his way around this underworld,Welles finds himself getting drawn deeper into the investigation and more obsessed with seeking the truth to the point where his investigation actually puts his family in danger. He finds himself getting so emotionally attached to the investigation that he goes to all lengths to find the truth and ultimately get revenge. 8mm is a disturbing film which definitley leaves an impression on you. A few things i would like to touch on. Firstly, in Hardcore when George C. Scott's character went into the pornography underworld to find his daughter, he drastically changed his look in an attempt to fit in so nobody would think any different. Now Cage's character comes off as pretty unrealistic for not taking this approach. Even his guide Max California remarks on this at one point during the film. Given that Cages character is supposed to be a well respected and intelligent detective you would think he would do something about this. However despite this little quirk Cage's overall performance is very good, even though there were other people who would have been more suitable for the part. I was reading another review of this film where the reviewer recommended such individuals as James Woods,Sean Penn and Harvey Keitel. I would strongly agree with James Woods as i could see him portraying the part of Tom Welles with greater success as his look is maybe better suited for the role and i could see him showing a greater insight into the effects that the case has on Welles. A lot of people have had negative things to say about the ending of this film, saying it made no sense and they should have gone with the original ending of Welles killing himself. Now while that would have been interesting, i believe the current ending does make sense as i will explain. ***SPOLIER*** In killing the bad guys Welles gains retribution, not only for the girls family but himself as he found himself getting emotionally attached to the case. The breaking point was when he discovered how the girl was murdered by Eddie Poole (James Gandolfini) as he actually rung the girl's mother up to get permission to kill them. At first he was unable to go through with it, but hearing the mother distraught and upset seemed to give him the extra motivation to kill them. 8mm is one of those films people are either going to be replused by or enthralled by as it contains such a dark and seedy storyline. While i found it to be mildly flawed, overall i enjoyed it. I gave it seven out of ten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Relative to what has been said before, I watched this film and wondered why Joel Schumacher hadn't devoted this kind of dark intensity to Batman &amp; Robin. I didn't see all the graphic stuff since this was what the USA network made of it, and I think the cut out parts gave an edge from uncertainty as to why Tom was cringing from what he was watching. This movie kept me on the edge of my seat throughout.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can almost forgive Schumacher for his Batman movie after this. The only thing I didn't like was the very ending (Cage and family safe). Someone wrote below (SPOILERS AHEAD) that the original script had Welles killing himself, which makes much more sence to me. But I have a better ending: Cage does escape (Dino Velvet survives), kills Eddie Poole, but misses Machine. And, when he returns home, finds two 8mm film reels, one in each bed (his wife's and daughter's), THEN kills himself. Remember Dino warned him of that if he didn't cooperated, and do you really think people like Dino doesn't have associates and henchmen to carry out such treats? I don't know about you, but the film is a lot like Cruising (1980) with Pacino. In both films the hero enters a warped underworld which eventually corrupts them (Pacino ends up killing his gay "boyfriend").Now that I think of it, one thing I didn't like: Cage. His performance sucked big time. Can anyone honestly tell me that during the entire film his character didn't flash "POLICE/DETECTIVE/PHONY" in bright neon lights? No wonder no one bought him as a pornography buyer (he looked way to clean, educated and staight arrow). It was supposed to be like that, but to such extreme I don't think so. Even his dialogue was so phony and cop-like... Now, had he dressed up like Max California... I mean, didn't he learn anything from him? Well, had his character being played by James Woods or Harvey Keitel or Joe Pesci or Chris Penn or Sean Penn (all of them ooze sleaze and filth and corruption).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not a bad idea but the film is overdone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lurid thriller about the dark and disturbing underworld of hardcore pornography. Nicolas Cage stars as a private investigator who gets recruited by a wealthy widow to investigate the authenticity of her late husband's 'snuff film,' in which a young girl appears to be murdered. Against his better judgment, he takes the case and the investigation draws him into a disturbing netherworld of sadism and sexuality that threaten to break his sanity. Unpleasant, even borderline unbearable at times, like you'd expect considering the film's graphic subject matter, though well-crafted and performed by a talented cast, but it's let down by unconvincing characters and an unbelievable climax. **?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the dark side of human nature exploring sexual perversion to its horrifying conclusions in this case.Reasonable acting performances add to a chilling subject which, if I have one criticism only about this movie, is rather rammed down the viewers throat incessantly throughout the picture.It only gets a 6/10 because of occasional inconsistent direction perhaps designed to throw the viewer but ends up just being annoying in the final analysis. However if you can stomach it this is worth one viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A spooky look into snuff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>8MM is the type of film you have nightmares about, but well made ones at that. Joel Schumacher brings Andrew Kevin Walker's Eight-Millemeter to the screen with superb acting (mainly by Nicolas Cage, but the supporting cast is also very good), a terrifying story with more twists than a pretzel factory, and many other great things. Of course not for all tastes, but for fans of mystery films, or even Cage/Schumacher fans, this film is for you. True, snuff is no matter to bring to the screen, but Schumacher puts it on the screen so well you forget about it's bad effect (except on the person Cage is trying to find in the movie). Well done suspense thriller, one of Schumacher's best.</fullReview>

The build up was far too slow and boring. Not enough of the underworld was reveiled visually during this "slow beginning" to give the viewer the outrage necessary to bring the films powerful ending to the maximum potential effect. The story was good, the players were good, but the weak direction managed to miss the mark (for me).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Somewhat boring, dark, detective drama. Wait for video!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just got back from seeing 8mm and was very disappointed. First let me say that there is very little in the way of disturbing or shocking scenes as suggested by the ads and reviews. With a few cuts, that wouldn't affect the story at all, this film is an easy PG-13! They never show the girl being killed (or even cut) for that matter. The one sex scene (if you can call it that) is of a guy getting an enema by a swedish nurse for like 3 seconds which was pointless anyway. Cut 30 seconds of Cage walking into a topless bar, one other 5sec kill and bingo PG-13. I guess 'hoopla' sells tickets...Personally, I expected great things from the writer of Seven and not so great things from the Director Joel Schumacher; At least Joel didn't disappoint. Seven was a dark movie for a specific reasons while it seems Schumacher did it just emulate a successful film. There is one scene, where he runs to save his family, which actually seemed to rely on that fact that you had seen Seven in some stupid attempt to generate suspense. There was no real reason to run to them but a few hinted words somehow suggested they were in serious trouble. (Only if you paranoid and just watched Seven.)Unlike Seven the story holds your hand all the way through and never really puts you in an uneasy situation. The story is filled with standard cliches and the characters often act without any logic. The ending action sequence starts a bit interesting then quickly degenerates into standard Hollywood cliches. "Hand over the film!" "Let me tell you the plan before I kill you!" "Let me argue with someone else so you have plenty of time to plan your escape!"The film might have worked as a drama or perhaps a character study if we actually cared about the characters. Cage alternates between a smart cocky detective and petrified husband seemingly without reason. (Perhaps he just watched Seven)Unless you're bored, save this for video folks it's rather dull stuff. Or just rent Seven and pretend it stinks...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ridiculous.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was one of the worst I've ever seen, it did not left out a single clichee one could imagine about a Hollywood-so-called-Thriller. The protagonist is a loving father &amp; a private investigator who is engaged in a special task: finding out if a suspected "snuff" movie is real.Certainly, he get's involved deeper &amp; deeper, smeary pornoshops (run by mexicans) &amp; sex theatres are his field of investigation as he's searching for the murderers of the woman in the "snuff" movie. Assisted by a "smart" (he read a book) sexshop employee, he's catching up with a murderous bondage-film producer and his personal perverts who are responsible for the film... ...and what do you expect? They are portrayed as the simple evil, no need for explanations, backgrounds, history: they are the bad ones, and he's the purifier. Boom. Killer of the killers. End of film. Is it that bad? Yes, I'm afraid so.Ironically, "machine" (the mega-pervert who did the killing) is even pointing at his ridiculous character: In the last scene, our hero forces "machine" to put off his leather mask (yep, of course he's wearing one) and recognizes that "machine" looks just like the normal 08/15 guy from the street. Then "machine" says: "blablabla I'm not a monster, my parents never abused me, I had a nice childhood, I just love to do what I do!"I just love to kill people. Yeah, sure, "everybody loves killing people" (Bender). It's not only the total lack of character what made this film so boring, it's also it's ugly "I have to kill these people"-attitude which makes you sick. In one scene, our hero has tied up one of the killers and tries to shoot him...but he can't. So what does he do? He calls the mother of the killed woman, says that her child is killed and asks her whether she loved her child so much that she wishes to see the killers dead. The mother cries yes, she'd love her child, he goes back to the tied killer and slaughters him.To come to the point: This film is breathing the foul air of lynchmob-supporters (certainly the police does not play any role in it), moralizes in a ridiculous form against pornography, does not take it's characters serious and wastes your time with a stupid plot. Probably the only good thing about this film is that it does not try to pseudo-psycho-analyze ... even that would be too much plot.Don't waste your time with this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Starts off strong, but collapses- **/****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"8MM" starts off strong but implodes at the end, unfortunately defeating the credit most of the film offers.Nicholas Cage plays Tom Welles, a Private Investigator hired by the widow of an industrial magnate (Myra Carter) and her lawyer (Anthony Heald) to examine if a "snuff" film found in her late husband's safe is real. The snuff is terrifying; it features a man in a leather mask stabbing a young teen (Jenny Powell), who has been reported missing. In order to discover the truth, Welles must enlist aid from Max California (Joaquin Phoenix), a porn store clerk, as they travel through the depths of human perversion and encounter villains in the "alternative" porn industry, including Dino Velvet (Peter Stormare), Eddie Poole (James Gandolfini), and Machine (Christopher Bauer), a twisted S&amp;M fetish killer.Max California is by far the most interesting character in "8MM." Both the script and Phoenix's acting allow the audience to peer into the mind of the smut store worker, whom we sympathize with because he is good comic relief and a lonely type, working in this wasteland only to support his unsuccessful music career. Max delivers some lines expressing how the pornography industry lured him into this hell and how it is impossible to escape. In fact, Max upstages Cage's detective Welles, who is possibly the most boring person in the film. The script provides no back-story or personality for our protagonist, nor any insights into his mind. Welles's only redemption is Cage's able acting.Another great role is that of Machine, a psycho who wears a crude leather mask. Before we learn anything about Machine, he makes a fascinating maniac. Is he an evil freak with a mental illness? Is he a seemingly everyday man with a split personality? Either way, Machine is an ominous monster. Then, the screenplay goes so far as to ruin our intrigue. Rather than leave his identity to the imagination, we actually get to see Machine for who he really is. In an anti-climatic fight for life, the haunting mask is removed, accompanied with cartoonish, moronic dialogue that was intended to be witty. The revelation of Machine for who he really was is intended to be ironic and surprising, but this cliched scene was so not clever that I felt a surge of disappointment and anger at how "8MM" had degraded since it began. "8MM" mainly succeeds at presenting a disturbing, sickening tour through the corrupted minds of pornography addicts. Welles and Max actually go to a secret subterranean dungeon where illegal porn trade is dealt. Stunning and horrifying are two adjectives that describe this culture of filth. Almost every type of sex is produced and purchased here: bestiality, child porn, mutilation, fake and gory snuff, hermaphrodites, brutal S&amp;M, etc. In one scene, several men masturbate to a female doctor, breasts exposed, stabbing a man in the buttocks with a syringe. A blow to one's mind and stomach are packaged into this film. It's overwhelming to realize that in the chasms of civilized human society, there are a few vile minds who resort to this abhorrent "entertainment" for pleasure.However, all of this powerful terror collapses in the last 45 minutes. All the villains come together against Welles in an over-the-top, half-witted battle with lame, corny gothic overtones. Everyone hugely overacts this scene, most noticeably Peter Stormare's Dino Velvet who has some cheesy lines to deliver ("Kill them, Machine! Kill them all!). Also, one person's appearance as an adversary is not the least bit shocking. In fact, the first time this character was introduced I said to myself, "He's a bad guy." This big rendezvous, no matter how poorly executed, should have ended the film. Instead, Welles runs away to his house rather than killing the unarmed bad guys. When the screenplay finally calls upon our protagonist to wrap up the movie, your interest has already faltered because the film should have ended 20 minutes ago. There's once scene when Welles has a killer tied up. The good guy has a gun, the bad guy is helpless. During this episode, the killer incessantly and obnoxiously explodes into outbursts of bloodthirsty insults about his killing of an innocent. Welles is being tortured by the taunts, but he doesn't shoot the murderer. What he does is runs to his car and moans. This is a perfect example of painfully stupid false endings "8MM" offers.Eventually, the phony conclusions, over-acting, na?ve showdowns, predictability, and boring personas bring "8MM" down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"8MM"- A very decent and enjoyable thriller despite some issues and a very messy third act. A good, solid effort from all involved in front of and behind camera.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yet another one of those films that was critically panned but enjoyed a somewhat better reception from audiences, "8MM" is a fascinating little film from way back in 1999. It's a troubled film at times, no doubt, and it can seem incredibly antiquated by today's standards (it really is a product of its time), but it's still a very solid thriller thanks to director Joel Schumacher's keen eye and writer Andrew Kevin Walker's twisted vision.Nicolas Cage (in one of his more "restrained" performances) portrays private investigator Tom Welles, who is hired onto a new case to look into the authenticity of an alleged "snuff" film. Soon, he is pulled into a dark world of underground, illegal pornography and criminal activity, and it will not only push him to the brink, but it just might force him to make several dark and twisted choices that could destroy his entire world...It's a pretty well-publicized fact that there was some behind-the- scenes drama on the film. In particular the fallout between director Schumacher and writer Walker. I will say I am a fan of both (don't laugh, Schumacher has made some great films outside of his two laughable "Batman" flicks), but it's pretty obvious their sensibilities weren't going to exactly line up perfectly. That being said, I do think this film is still quite well-made and Schumacher did a very serviceable and decent job with the material. And honestly, it's wildly stylish and well-shot. Is this the best version of the film we could have gotten? Probably not. And should someone else have directed instead of Schumacher? Probably. But I still say it's a good film and Schumacher's keen visual eye is to thank for much of that. So I disagree with the assertion some people have about it that Schumacher "ruined" Walker's film.The biggest strengths of this film are the performances, likable characters and the good pacing and structure at which the film plays out. Cage and supporting roles by the likes of Peter Stomare and Joaquin Phoenix are all extremely well-played and you care a lot about the protagonists completing their journey in the story. Phoenix is particularly of note thanks to just how "out there" he is willing to take his character- a sex-shop worker who teams up with Welles to investigate the alleged snuff-film. The film also moves quite briskly. Upon recently re-watching the film, it was surprising just how quickly the climax came. It trucks along well and never drags.If I were to point out any major flaws with the film, it's that unfortunately the film as a whole seems very routine, some of the music and imagery does clash and the third act does fall-apart and derail itself for a time. The writing and various twists and turns the film takes do seem somewhat cliché. Really, you can probably grasp where much of the film will be going from the first act and it robs a touch of the suspense you should otherwise be feeling. The bizarre musical compositions may be nice on their own, but they feel oddly out of place at times and can become a distraction when meshed with the sharp visuals. And the third act... oh, boy. I won't spoil it, but I will say that the movie suffers a bit of an identity crisis during the final 30 minutes, with multiple climactic scenarios, hard-left twists and some wild tonal shifts playing out seemingly over and over again, leading to a weird sense of feeling borderline tiring. It all works for the goal the film is working to achieve, but I can't help but feel the three or four "climaxes" presented could have been rewritten and folded down to one or two larger and harder-hitting sequences.That being said, a problematic third act cannot detract from an otherwise solid and well-told film. I can forgive many of the issues thanks to those well-directed sequences of investigation and suspense that the film specializes in and for the fairly compelling work from the actors involved.I give "8MM" a very solid 7 out of 10. It may not be the perfect follow-up to "Se7en" that fans of writer Walker were hoping for... but it's an enjoyable suspense-thriller nonetheless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>8MM stands out as a fine thriller. The plot was enough to keep me entertained and I think anyone who likes a bit of suspense and investigation will like it, though it didn't focus a lot on the investigation aspect as it could have; I mean, the investigation is pretty shallow and clues appears without much thought onto it.With that being said, I have to mention the subject of the film: the underworld of pornography and sadism. Most characters in this movie are as disgusting and despicable as it gets. Also, some scenes might be disturbing, even though violence shown isn't over the board. Well, with a movie about a private investigator trying to sort out if a snuff film (a movie showing the killing of someone) is true or not, you get the idea of the content shown in it.I think the overall movie was really good. It had enough to keep me entertained to see what would be the outcome -- and I thought it was good. A nice flick to watch at night when you pass by it while changing channels.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, hold on to your hats... this is a wild one! Nicholas Cage's performance as Tom Welles goes from one extreme to the other: he is both over-emotive at times and wooden at others. The pace is a little slow at times. And without knocking the actual quality of the film, it is not always easy to watch. Well neither is A Clockwork Orange, and that movie is a complete masterpiece.I think Joel Schumacher's direction is excellent; the one scene where Cage has broken into Machine's house and the record is stuck at the end is as frightening as anything I've seen in recent movies. He also draws excellent performances, not only in his leading cast, but in the supporting roles. Nicolas Cage, not one of my favorite actors, does an outstanding job in a role that is complex and multi-dimensional. His persistence to find who killed Maryanne Mathews is relentless and at times heart-shattering. James Gandolfini is superb and despicable in the role of the smut producer who helmed the snuff film. Peter Stomare as the heartless director Dino Velvet is likewise disgustingly realistic. But there is more...Not only are the acting, photography, settings, costumes, dialogue, pacing, and the haunting background music all superbly managed, but the movie is also that rarity among the torrent of mindless trash which Hollywood, in its extreme contempt for the modern audience, inflicts on us today: it is a movie with a deep, even profound, meaning, a meaning with cosmic implications.Overall rating: 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

It takes you to the dark and dirty side of human nature, and is very gripping. This is a not an action flick or a one man army kinda thriller - this one will leave you haunted. This is one of the very best films from Joel Schumacher, and has a great cast then almost unknowns Joaquin Phoenix as well as James Gandolfini - great job all all involved.Overall, "8MM" is a disturbing thriller.

		<fullReview>Joel Schumacher's '8MM' is A Masterful Film! An intense, unsettling, powerful film, that offers a solid punch. Without a shed of doubt, amongst the best films from the late 1990's! '8MM' Synopsis: A private investigator is hired to discover if a "snuff film" is authentic or not.'8MM' is an absorbing yet disturbing watch. The journey of its protagonist, Tom Welles, played by a mesmerizing Nicolas Cage, is difficult to stomach &amp; impossible to digest. It narrates a horrifically tragic story, with commendable conviction. Andrew Kevin Walker's Screenplay is intense &amp; powerful. Joel Schumacher's Direction is excellent. He has handled the film superbly. Cinematography is atmospheric. Editing is razor-sharp. Art &amp; Costume Design are perfect.Performance-Wise: Nicolas Cage is mesmerizing as the shocked protagonist. The ever-impressive actor once again proves his potential, by delivering one of his finest performances to date. He's the soul of '8MM'. Joaquin Phoenix is exceptional. His scenes with Cage are simply superb. Catherine Keener is wonderfully restrained. The Late/Great James Gandolfini &amp; Peter Stormare are loathsome throughout. Anthony Heald &amp; Amy Morton are sincere.On the whole, '8MM' is one of its kind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nicolas Cage plays a "surveillance specialist" hired to determine whether a snuff film found in the safe of a recently deceased Pennsylvania millionaire is authentic?a job that leads him into the seamier recesses of the porn industry on both coasts. The director of this creepy wide-screen thriller is Joel Schumacher, who will surely live in infamy for Batman and Robin; he seems much more in charge this time, maybe because he has something to work with. The sturdy script is by Andrew Kevin Walker, the former Tower Records cashier who also wrote Seven, and there's a similar impulse here to rub our noses in terminal slime and evil. The desire for retribution that's honored so unambiguously may be morally based, but it's the morality of Mickey Spillane, and I wonder if the defense of vigilante justice in Schumacher's earlier A Time to Kill is more than just a coincidence. I can't say I warmed to the results, but I was solidly held for the film's two hours, and the secondary cast?including Joaquin Phoenix, Peter Stormare, Amy Morton, and James Gandolfini?is unusually sharp; with Catherine Keener, Anthony Heald, and Chris Bauer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am very impressed by this film, it is very well put together and keeps your face glued to the screen.The film follows a Private investigator hired to investigate if a film he watched is a real snuff film, and when he starts investigating it takes him deep in to the porn underground. When you see the places he goes to it shocks you what people do in this underground world it really disturbs you, and some of the videos that Nick cage's character watches really makes you winch even though that a lot is shown off screen, they really did a good job at making a lot of the material look real and disturbing. Even though the film is very disturbing, the story just keeps drawing you in because you want to find out what Nick Cage is going to do to the guys that are making these sick and demented videos and you can't help but cheer for him in the end because a lot of the characters in this film are very disturbed.The cast in this film is absolutely brilliant, Nick Cage did a fantastic job in this film even though it is not an action movie. Peter Stormare did a fantastic job in this movie as well I found his character very creepy and demented and did a fantastic job, and I could go on all day with how good the acting is but it is just better to watch the movie.I highly recommend this movie it has a great story line and a solid cast with great acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What DID you expect?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Almost universally lambasted upon release for all the wrong reasons time continues to be kind to 8mm, a film which will surely remain the pinnacle of Joel Schumachers checkered directing career. The movie explores the darkest side of the human soul as Nicholas Cages private detective is hired to find a missing girl who appears to have been murdered in a snuff movie. Schumacher never found favour with the critics even at his peak when his output was as erratic as most other even revered directors. Some expected Seven part 2 as it was scripted by Andrew Kevin Walker.Sorry its not a serial killer movie. Others moaned that it failed to explore the real underbelly of pornography/snuff movies. What i say to that is this is a movie not an investigative documentary.Cage under performs beautifully here. None of the bug eyed histrionics which have blighted so many of his performances. Even when he finally explodes into a rage by beating to death James Gandolfinis character it comes across as entirely believable The supporting cast are also excellent. Joaquin Phoenix plays the only other sympathetic male who tags along with Cage. The rest are a rum bunch of sleaze bags and villains. Peter Stomare hams it up magnificently as the porn mogul and Anthony Heald excels as the sleazy lawyer.My only complaint with the story are in some of the all too convenient plot contrivances which assist Cage in tracking down the location of the missing girl.Schumacher successfully ratchets up the tension in both the scenes where Cage escapes from captivity in the warehouse and at the end when he tracks down "Machine", the final remaining member of the snuff movie crew. When Machine is finally literally unmasked he asks Cage "what did you expect?" A question as pertinent to the detractors of this masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Thriller that Everybody should see</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review may contain what some consider spoilers. 8MM is one of those amazing films that time seems to have forgotten about(quite unfairly if you ask me). In the film Nic Cage plays Tom Welles, a private detective, who has been called in by the widow of millionaire to determine whether or not a snuff film found in her husband's belongings is authentic. Welles investigates the case as if it were a missing person's case. The case brings Welles deep into the world of underground pornography. James Gandolfini does a fantastic job playing the head of the distribution company that released the film. Cage does a great job playing a subdued investigator who starts to slowly question his own morals as he gets deeper in the case. Joaquin Phoenix plays Max California,a clerk at a local porn shop, so convincingly that I actually forgot that it was Joaquin Phoenix in the role. Character actor Peter Stormare plays one of the most subtly intimidating villains in a thriller. This is one movie that should appeal to everybody. Even those who aren't usually into thrillers should be able to find some entertainment in this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Torture &amp; Murder In 8MM</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joel Schumacher has quite the reputation of being a director that dumbs down films with melodrama or by stripping the script off any depth. '8MM' is quite an intense chilling thriller that does touch on some very disturbing themes. However, Schumacher doesn't delve into it enough. He's more focused on the mystery of the missing girl angle. This could have been a though provoking film but the director seems to be too concerned with the Hollywood aspect. The film does make brief suggestions about the power and influence pornography has on people but it doesn't explore the psyche that draws people towards it. That said, '8MM' is a decent thriller. It had me engaged from the very beginning. Moreover the solid execution, especially the camera-work, art direction and the haunting score create an intense atmosphere. For a Hollywood flick, '8MM' is quite graphic. Nicolas Cage is brilliant and so is Joaquin Phoenix. James Gandolfini is a scene stealer as the sleazy pornographer. Catherine Keener isn't given much to do other than playing the concerned wife. Overall, it's a decent flick which could have been more than that if it was in the hands of a more capable director.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a fan of psychological thrillers, so when I discovered "8mm" was available on Netflix instant stream, I figured I'd go ahead and give it a shot.I think it's important to mention this movie was written by the same guy who wrote the movie "Se7en", in other words, if you're expecting something light and fluffy, you're in for a rude awakening. This movie is ultra dark and unsettling yet oddly intriguing.I wouldn't feel comfortable saying I "liked" this movie, I think that'd be kind of messed up to say you liked something like this, but I will say that I was drawn into the story and was genuinely concerned what happened to Nicolas Cage's character.I would recommend this movie to others, but I think one viewing is more than enough. This movie isn't for the faint-of-heart, know that going in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoiler The movie is great! Running through the movie, you pickup a regular story line like any normal arthouse film... but at the dramatic conclusion, it is possible to realise a message.Yes the film is a based on the grim reality of Snuff films, and that one was made for a rich man... but the movie had a whole new front to it, kept in the backround, and not exposed until the end.When a girl is killed on camera for fetish sexual enjoyment by a man who called himself machine and wheres a bondage mask with lots of knives, you would think the man had a very bad childhood, such as the main characters childhood on the movie: The cell, with Jennifer Lopez. But this is incorrect. This murderer had a mother who loved him and a father who he claims was in the normal genre. In machines life, nothing took an incorrect turn.At the end of the movie, he states this: I am what I am... daddy didnt rape me, mommy didnt hit me... I do what I do cos I like it.Killers and heartless people (some of them) are like that just because. Past events do not always take control what we do in life...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's quite funny but I often judge films by the expectation I had before I watched it. So if I now have to judge 8mm prior to my expectations I have to say it's a pretty decent film. Everyone I asked about this film said "uhh don't watch it it's sick.." as well as reviews from allmovie.com etc. telling me to avoid watching it. I agree, the film is sort of sick somehow but I have seen worse in films people never complain about. I thought this movie would be more sexual than it is...in fact you "only" see an innocent girl get brutally killed and lots of ugly perverts in gimp suits. The scenes themselves are not that sickening only the story around it makes it pretty sick. Films like i.e. Pulp Fiction, which everyone seems to like apart of me are far worse or sickening than 8mm. Bad comparison but relates more to expectations of films. Any film made by Quentin Tarantino is more sickening than this one. Despite the fact that Tarantino is totally overrated anyway. However, not a great film but certainly not as bad as some people say it is. Pretty poor acting of Cage, horrible acting of Phoenix but some cool scenes such as the final scene where Cage chases that pervert at the end. Soundtrack is also rather poor.5.5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Starts well, but slithers into murkiness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A couple of viewings of `Leaving Las Vegas'(1995) (qv) convinced me that Nicolas Cage is an actor capable of carrying off difficult rôles quite well; one viewing of `Captain Corelli's Mandolin' (2001)(qv) convinced me that it all depends on who he is working with. It's a question of chemistry, I suppose. Joel Schumacher pulled it off with the unlikely coupling of Julia Roberts and Campbell Scott in `Dying Young' (1991), which says a lot for Ms. Roberts, and again with Susan Sarandon and Brad Renfro in `The Client' (1994). In `8mm' this fusing of compatibilities was barely more than half right.The first half of the film is very good: Cage downplays his style and interpretation, almost to the level of being frustrating. Deeper into the film, as the sordidness squirmed ever more into the depravity of slinky underworld, the sick snivelling world of sinful sex and `snuff' on celluloid, Cage tended to lose control, such that his performance became overstrung. Admittedly this is a difficult rôle trying to come to terms with a harsh scenario and the torrid scenes of violence. More care by both Scumacher and Cage in the latter half of the film would have maintained a better balance, more in keeping with Cage's interpretation in the first half.This is a film which had to be made: its job was to bring out the murk that lurks in the shady underworld, product of the bestiality which mankind seems to be bent on sliding into, and which does not seem to worry any politicians ranting and preaching all over the place ??? However, worth slightly above 6/10 on my scale.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I walked into this film with no real knowledge of what the film was abut. The word's "Snuff" and "porn" were thrown at me but i never really investigated what the people meant by that. So... getting to the story A private investigator Tom Wells (Nicholas Cage) is hired by an old widower to investigate whether a recently discovered 8MM "Snuff" film is actually real. Wells watches the film and in trying to prove that the horror he saw is fake and the whole movie follows his investigations to prove the girl Mary Ann Matthews is still alive.8MM is not a good film... it's story demands that you cannot leave this film without being like the enemies of the state without being slightly effected by it. The Story is an excellent premise but would have worked slightly better if the movie was shot slightly gritty then it is. Joel Schumacher does a great job with it but it still seems a little too Hollywood to pack a real punch (even though the graphicness of the movie- goes against it) The placings are great- you are on an edge from beginning to end and that is where the movie succeeds, you like Tom do not know what to exspect. As for the performances Nicholas Cage is awful in 8MM, so awful in fact that some of the scenes are unwatchable, he just seems so Woodern that any emotions you could feel for the character (until the sentimental last 5 minutes) are gone. On the other hand the supporting cast is great, Catherine Keener tries to make the best of a bad situation and Joaquin Phoenix is absoutely amazing as the porn shop clerk, he brings black comedy as well as real emotion to the role and he steals every scene he is in. Overall 8MM is a gritty movie or as much as it could be with it's limitations of a big screen hollywood movie but it hits the right notes and the character of Tom Wells is very encouraging as it somewhat shows someone doing something wrong but that not all good things are the right thing to do. The direction is thought through, Schumacher has defiently given the supports a lot of work (sadly missing on cage though), The sorroundings are edgy and dark and the movie footage is sick enough to understand the darkness of the movie. Overall a slightly tied up verison of Seven, with slightly better and pointful direction and a script which packs a punch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is absolutely sick. I could not believe that I actually paid money to buy this euro-trash. When I first read all the other negative comments on this page, I thought "these people are morons". But after I actually VIEWED the film, I changed my mind. This movie is very sick.Nicolas Cage plays a private investigator hired to find out if a 'snuff film' is authentic or not. (SPOILERS) Now, when he figures out everything, things get very stupid. In a way, it is somewhat similar to 15 MINUTES. But, since 8MM was made before 15 MINUTES, that isn't logical. But, when Cage finally discovers who is responsible for the killing depicted in the film, it all becomes very sick. And as if it wasn't bad enough with showing us how some people are so addicted to pornography, we get to see men on their knees telling of how they killed someone with no remorse. James Gandolfini may be a good actor, but he chose one sick-*ss part to play here. And after seeing this, I really do feel that Nicolas Cage must have some mental problems of his own. Because he is always playing a person with some sort of problem, EX. BRINGING OUT THE DEAD- he plays an ambulance driver on the brink of madness. Here, he plays a homicide detective on the brink of madness. To like a movie about killing that is this graphic, you must be a killer. 8MM is a movie that opens our eyes to the sick world that we live in. Let us thank it for that much, anyway. 8MM: 1/5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are certainly more graphic and disturbing movies out there but this one is pretty bad. And Cage seems oddly miscast, in a role that might have been played better by someone like James Woods. In fact, in ways this reminds me of a Woods film from some years ago, the equally unsettling and hard-to-watch VIDEODROME. The ending of 8MM is straight out of HALLOWEEN and FRIDAY THE 13TH, which to my mind means this is really a horror movie in disguise (kind of like JUMANJI). If viewed as a horror movie, it lessens the nastiness a little, but not by much. Cage in a horror movie? I believe this is what 8MM ultimately is. That is Michael Myers/Jason he fights to the death at the end, isn't it? By the way, anyone else as annoyed by the wife in ths movie as I was?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The very thought of a snuff movie can make your hair stand on end.Never the human soul has sunk as low in perversity and depravity.Here the actors-be it Nicholas Cage or another one- take a back seat to the topic.Maybe it was a mistake to use a very famous actor."Tesis"(1996) was more convincing,because the lead was a girl -played by an unknown actress,except for Carlos Saura's fans-,and it's easier to identify with the boy or the girl next door than with a superhero whose family gets in the way at that."Tesis" put the stress on responsibility,and in its last part,"8mm" gets back to basics ,that is to say to personal justice,and I'm not so sure Cage's character hates what he's doing in the name of revenge.Leniency runs rampant towards the end.And,as a precedent user mentions it,is Cage naive enough to believe that when he's done away with Mary Ann's killers,there will not be other members of the network to carry on.When wealthy people are involved,horror knows no bounds. The three enemies are only sadistic puppets in the hands of respectable VIP acting in the shadow.Schumacher's movie is not devoid of qualities though:the female parts are the most interesting:-The old wealthy lady wants to know,even if truth is so unbearable it can destroy everything in which she believes, a husband she has cherished all her life,a life of honor and dignity .Too bad her part was underwritten,because it was a very endearing character.-Mary Ann's mother is given the choice by Cage:wouldn' t it it be better to ignore her daughter's fate and to be able to think that she's happy somewhere on this planet?But as the old lady,she wants to know.We can easily identify with these two women:what would we have done had we been in their shoes?I really wonder.-One of the torturers (aptly named "Machine") prides himself on having led a normal life during his childhood (compare with Karl-Heinz Boehm's character in Powell 's "Peeping Tom" (1960)that remains the masterpiece of the genre.)He's leading a peaceful life with his mother -another character that should have been more developed,in lieu of the sex-shop's owner which remains conventional.This is a terribly traumatic work.Not for anybody.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Think of a world where a rich man can have a woman kidnapped, raped and murdered and have it captured on film for his own sick amusement. You have just imagined the world in which we live. If power absolute corrupt absolutely then so does murder thrills for fun, or is that person who enters this dark world of depravity too gone already? 8MM pierces the world of snuff film trades as a hardboiled detective played by NICHOLAS CAGE pierces the darkness of this seemingly demonic world and almost falls to it himself. Like the movie MANHUNTER, the profiler or in this case investigating P.I. almost falls the celluloid depravity he seeks to stop. The film touches on a key note, a person who investigates this stuff for a living can spot the real from the fakes....it also has to do with the eyes. There was a investigation during the watergate era into this trade which had ties to opec region cuba spain and red china, yet, the clumsy FBI lets it flourish. I suppose the old monicker is true, evil flourishes because it hides in some of the darkest places on this planet...the human soul. Cage as I have stated here before gives the best performance of his career. (next to LEAVING LAS VEGAS) The film is uncompromising in it's view on the trade but does not go deep enough yet, tells a 3D human story and about how the investigation ultimately affects the relationship between cages character and his wife. Realisitc and fast moving and also moving in a emotional sense the film is a damnation on the trade not a glorification. 10 stars out of 10. Not for the squeemish.</fullReview>

We could've seen the lead character getting dragged deeper into the world of snuff, and questioning his own desires. Instead we got the same old boring conventional action hero morality, the eye (or more) for an eye mentality, and the assertion that Cage is actually doing the world a favour by killing the bad guys.Did anyone ever stop to think that Machine's elderly mother might be just as upset at her sons death, as the mother of girl he is 'avenging'?And yet, if you stop watching before the final third, which is deeply unoriginal, there is fairly experimental and challenging stuff here. Not quite a study into psychosexual desire, but then this is a mainsteam film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Schumacher headed in right direction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When conversations turn to the topic of consistently bad directors, B-movie hacks like Larry Buchanan or Al Adamson easily come to mind. However, I have found Joel Schumacher's work steadfastly mediocre. He made his feature directorial debut with "The Incredible Shrinking Woman", an inane sham starring Lily Tomlin. A piece of junk called "D.C. Cab" followed. "St. Elmo's Fire", "The Lost Boys", "Flatliners", "Falling Down", and "A Time to Kill" are inferior mainstream Hollywood fare. Hell, he wounded the Batman franchise. Therefore, my expectations were meager for "8MM", which looked like a rehash of "Hardcore". So, I was surprised to encounter a modestly exciting story. Less an excursion into the world of pornography (or more exactly of bizarre fetish gratification), it is more of a noirish thriller. Cage's crisp, precise articulation recalls Bogart in "The Big Sleep". Joaquin Phoenix is no Bacall, but delivers an adequately subdued performance as Cage's escort. A capricious, foretelling ending and a liberal anti-smoking message are a couple of faults I had with the picture. With the praise afforded "Tigerland" and my reaction to this film, perhaps Schumacher may start producing some challenging work. 2.5 out of 4 stars.</fullReview>

Yes, BRINGING OUT THE DEAD did have its moments, but once again, that's because it was offbeat. He was lame in the virtually unwatchable SNAKE EYES, and he is just a shade better in 8mm.It seemed that the story in 8mm was going somewhere interesting at first. There was much dialogue about Cage's character being influenced by the evil around him. Then, just when Cage was about to step into the darkness the film makers pulled back and gave us just another Hollywood Action/Revenge flick. Yep, the same old thing. And if you watch as many films as I do, the same old thing just doesn't do it for you anymore.Kind of ironic, huh?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>CONTAINS SPOILERSSometimes films that are off-kilter in their approach often throw up ideas and questions anyway, despite of themselves. This film is strange because I think the screenwriter possibly took his story from bits and pieces of other films rather than looking at real life, which I think is a comman problem in the industry as a whole. It's only long after seeing the film that I found it was by the seven guy which explains the similar production design which pushed the film further into splendidly risible self-parody. The whole bit with the girl being executed on film was a straight lift from 'Hardcore'. The scene at Machine's house at the end seemed taken from 'The Dead Zone'. The line 'because he could' has been used as many times as 'you're playing God' in the American cinema. The villains seem straight out of 'Scooby Doo'. The PI character with his squareness seems to come from much older films and is particularly jarring. The various 'can't get the gun/knife' etc seems an omnibus of film history itself. In keeping to genre conventions a film about exploitation inevitably becomes exploitative itself and this prevents American film from ever becoming art. Film makers always have one dubious eye on 'entertaining' the audience with lots of 'happenings' rather than focusing on 'ideas' or deep questions about the human condition which the average Hollywood producer is afraid of, perhaps holding to the perceived idea that the American public is allegedly anti-intellectual. Certainly a lot of reviews on this page allude to 'entertainment' as being a factor as to why they saw the film in the first place and were disappointed by it's slowness or were entertained in spite of it's slowness. The film's questioning of snuff as a myth suddenly becomes ironic as we are left to ponder whether the film itself can be trusted as it is a patchwork of so many film myths itself. The moral questions posed by the film quickly become irrelevant because the film's characters are doomed to follow genre conventions in solving problems in a way unrealistic to real life. Therefore the film unexpectedly becomes interesting because it becomes a critique of itself and cinema in general. For instance, is there any real 'reality' anymore if films are just about other films now? Can morality in the real world have any bearing in films like 8mm that are cut and pastes from other films which may, in themselves, have all manner of bogus moral perspectives, studio compromises and audience demographics in mind that make even less sense when amalgamated into one, which seems the case in this film? Certainly, taking a figure from the days of the Hayes code and planting him in modern LA makes for a curious cinematic experience.Having said that I don't think the film makers wanted to make an exploitative film. I think the moving and well judged scene in the kitchen where Cage asks the lonely mother whether she would want to know about her daughter's fate is authentically that of the real world and suggests the film maker's were sincere. However, once the film returns to 'the film world' we cease to believe in it. We are led to believe that an employee of a wealthy man would be both able and willing to walk into the porn underworld, a world presumably light years away from his own experience, ask for a snuff movie (which brought a fierce backlash when the tougher PI asked for it) and then somehow 'find' the right people to make a real snuff movie when the more likely reponse would be porn merchants calling the police long before he asked the 'right' people. We are then led to believe he and they would be party to something that would bring them the death sentence for something which did not involve a huge amount of money. It is also hugely unlikely that the PI would ring the girl's mother in order to get permission to commit homicide. It is just beyond credibility. Also the very public death of Machine would almost certainly cause the PI to be linked to his other act of murder, especially as the dead bodies of the two other protagonists in the warehouse would be found. But as we are in 'filmland', consequences are not part of the plot therefore once again rendering any interesting moral questions superfluous. The final letter becomes a disclaimer tacked on by the film maker's which is ultimately meaningless, despite a potentially interesting question about breaking the law to prevent an even greater evil.Although the film does not work it is fascinating for an entirely different set of reasons thrown up ironically BECAUSE it is sincere. It makes you question the nature of reality and the nature and process of modern film making today. There is no audience for this film. Funnily, it seems the producers made it for no deeper a motive than the wealthy man who wanted to see a snuff movie. He had the money and because of that he did it because he could.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Eight Millimeter" flirts with the latest cinematic taboo, but its would be exploration of sex and violent just isn't up to snuff. The most shocking thing about this movie isn't its perverse subject matter or casually virulent misogyny, but the fact that scanning this slick yet grimy trash gives you an insight or two about the nature of movie violence. Manure, it seems, can fertilize an idea or two. At heart the movie is a standard police procedural starring Nicolas Cage as Tom Welles, a suburban family man who's also a surveillance expert. One gray day, a rich window summons him to her mansion. She has found in her husband's safe, a reel of film that appears to show a girl being murdered - a snuff film -and wants Tom to (dis)prove its authenticity. In his quest for the truth, Tom views and reviews this terminal smut while following leads through a cartoonishly seedy underworld (populated by the likes of Joaquin Phoenix and James Gandolfini). The movie is as stagnant in tone (what else do you expect from Joel Schumacher?) as it is sensational in detail (what else do you expect from Andrew Kevin Walker?), emerging as just another exploitations film about exploitations. "Eight Millimeter" makes only superficial attempts to penetrate the glaze of such sleaze and to question the appeal of the sex-death fetish. What does the myth of snuff say about our attraction to movie violence and its covert connections to movie sex? This Freudian mess is best addressed by a film that contains no nudity and no bloodsheed. A fast rush of violence and then a lasting aftershock of nausea - the nausea comes because the viewer - usually just a passive consumer of cheap thrills - so closely identifies with the agent of aggressive horror. And when it comes to motives, what can be more shocking than that?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie stunk</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, first of all Nicolas Cage..... He does ok with comedic roles, but that's about it, and in 8MM, &gt; he just doesn't get the job done. His acting style does not vary--it's just seething looks and angry outbursts--and we never get a feel for the man behind the investigator.As for the movie itself, well it's certainly dark, but that does not make it good. First of all it makes SMBD culture look perverted and dangerous, something that has already been portrayed in the media and does not need any help from clueless directors. People can wear leather masks and not be psychopathic killers, but you would never know that from this horrible movie.Second, all this noise about this movie containing the message that "just because a person looks 'normal' does not mean they are not a psychopathic killer" is a pretty sad bit of praise. What horror movie HASN'T worked on this premise? This is nothing new, and it certainly wasn't done any more effectively in this mess of a movie. Did anybody actually gasp in horror when the Machine took off his mask? If you did then you live in a pretty comfortable bubble, cause I grew to know a long time ago that no one is what they seem, and there is no such thing as a "normal" person, because the word itself is subjective. We are taught from a young age to not trust someone just cause they are nice or look fine--did this movie provide any groundbreaking interpretation of this basic bit of info that I somehow missed?Finally, I hate to break this to all of you "believers" but there is no such thing as "snuff" films, so the idea that this movie somehow sheds light on the industry is a crock. Sociologists and investigators have spent years trying to find these films and not ONE has ever emerged. They are nothing more than an urban legend, so 8MM did not enter risky territory. All it did was provide 2 hours of dark, boring drama that has been done before. Yawn.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What I liked best about this movie is the private-eye character played by N.C. Married-with-children, working in a small office in his suburban home, Tom Welles is a refreshing change from the archetypical P.I., usually a disillusioned alcoholic, w/ a dusty office and more than a problem w/ women and the police. Sadly, the common places start here. Eager to find out why a disgusting hard core movie was stored in her dead husband safe, a rich old lady calls up our hero for help. TW starts right away and, succeeding where the FBI failed, finds the girl that was apparently killed in the movie.Flying coast to coast many times, immune to jet-lag and airline food, TW starts descending into a dangerous underworld where depravation and big money are linked. Young girls that give up their hopes for a movie career and end up in the porn industry; young boys that give up their hopes for a music career and end up in the porn industry; TW will eventually find out that people would do anything for money. Is that it? Yes, more or less. Even Machine, part time killer and porn actor is just the son of a religious and unsuspecting old lady (just like TW's client, only without all the money). That's the way a lot of movies are today: you get a plot people saw a thousand times and just add sex or violence or both. The need of quick justice that TW feels in the end is the odd part that I didn't quite understand. Calling the police and promising himself to raise his daughter in a healthy and loving environment would have been a lot better. Don't get me wrong, the movie is good, Nicolas Cage is perfect for the role and the plot is, if anything, simple enough not to have major weak points. But without the snuff-movie thing it would be a pretty plain detective story, well done, w/ good actors, but nothing more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the past five years,Nicolas Cage has stabbed John Travolta with a spear,flashed his willy in Meg Ryans shower and drank whiskey off Elisabeth Shues knockers. He has no idea of what convention is,and has made a career out of trashing taboos.So it hardly comes as a surprise that Cage took on this part.For a movie about snuff films-there is relatively little that shocks.The eponymous reel of celluloid contains nothing more than a washed-out flickery murder,that is supposed to be stomach churning.It is not. Cage gives a typically restrained performance as Tom Welles,and is really very good,but the movie lacks the bite that was promised.Its not due to the script,which resonates with standard violence and at times dark humour,maybe instead its down to the direction of Schumacher which is mature enough,but still has a penchant for flair without style,(speeding cars,flaming corpses and lots of knifes)that really destroys the atmosphere that had been created.While its an eternity away from Batman and Robin,for such a black film,its far too colourful. 8MM really falls down with its conclusion,once the truth about the film has been revealed,it loses its direction,and Cage takes on an avenging angel role,hunting down the perpetrators in a series of not-very interesting stalk scenes,complete with requisite dark houses and eerie sound effects,which while effective,its not really the right ending for a movie about snuff.Sevens ending delivered a real shock to the system that left you disturbed.8MM sets out to disturb,and the only ending it can muster is a scooby-doo mask revealing revelation,in which a WCW throwback is unearthed as being no less normal looking than the guy that cuts your hair.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you see lots of movies, you will probably not find this to be shocking or "sick". You will find it to be boring. Its slick, but hollow. The victim is dead at film's start, so the viewer has no emotional investment in the case--other than your basic good vs. evil thing. So we are left with a sleuth movie devoid of plot twists (or much plot) or cleverness. The movie is too lazy to give us a couple of other suspects who turn out to be sleazy, sure enough, but innocent. Of course, the bad guys are very bad (and wear black and leather a lot) and the good guy is very good. (How about a little nuancing like in "Tightrope" where Clint Eastwood gets a little revved at the seedy things going on around him) Style and dark titilation are left to satisfy the viewer, but they are not close to enough. Stunningly bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess feeling uneasy while watching this film is quite understandable when you know that the writer to the 8MM script, Kevin Andrew Walker, is the man who wrote the script to the very disturbing Se7en. In 8MM there is an uneasiness that you forget about as soon as you've turned off the video, the experience of watching Se7en stayed with me for weeks. 8MM is a good film, I liked it even though there are some parts of the film that are too unbelievable and too clichéd to be really appreciated, and the last half hour does not live up to the expectations I had. Nicolas Cage is good, as is Joaquin Phoenix. Peter Stormare's portrayal of loathsome Velvet was a bit over the top, even though director Joel Schumacher might be blamed for that.[Possible spoiler follows.] Overall, a good film that sadly loses its power in the last half hour.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warning: Plot Discription in the following review!8MM talks about a detective, Tom Wells, who goes underground into the world of pornography to discover the truth on whether a snuff film where a girl was murdered is real. After being haunted by what he discovers, he must bring the creators of the snuff film to justice and hope for the whole experience to become a distant memory.This movie was very different. I must give it some credit on its originality, however. I feel though, that, because of the constant discussion on the world of pornography, this film should have been rated NC-17.Nicholas Cage's character, Tom Wells, lives a fairly distant and private life. I came to the conclusion that he likes to keep to himself a lot, and this hurts the relationship between him and his wife. He is always very focused on his work, and that always seems to come first over everything else.This was a different film that wasn't particularly into my interests. It became slow and sometimes boring at parts. Nicholas Cage gave a steady performance, definitely not the best of his career, however. Face/Off and Leaving Las Vegas portray his skills as an action, dramatic and romantic actor very well. My grade: C</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While I agree with most that 8mm has some flaws (it's use of cliches, stereotypical bad guys, a mostly wooden Nick Cage, and lack of police intervention) these minor deficiencies do not take away from the complex message the film conveyed. In fact, most of these so-called flaws can be explained in a satisfying way.Nicholas Cage's character Tom Welles could have been developed a bit more, but I think there is enough subtlety in his character to draw us into the decisions he makes later in the film. He is not a moral giant, he obviously has some struggles as he lies to his wife about his resumed smoking habit and takes the case that drives him to the edge initially for the money. He is a complex character who loves his wife and child but also has a very dangerous career. Although he is at times very wooden, he is effective at convincing us that his struggles are mainly going on inside of him.What Tom Welles witnesses during his well crafted investigation is truly disturbing to a relatively new-jack P.I. and to the audience watching his journey into the pits of darkness. The reason that 8mm works is because it is a slice of life film that makes no apologies for its raw portrayal of its harrowing, perverse subject matter. Most people do not sit around at the dinner table and talk about the lifestyles of people engaged in the hardcore pornography industry but nevertheless it is a subject that needs to be dealt with to some degree.Not only does 8mm reveal this gut-wrenching sub-sector of the mainstream, but it also shows us that all kinds of people contribute to its existence even the filthy rich "upper crust" of society. The point of 8mm is to show that these types of people and events are real and sometimes the only motivation people have for the evil they do is because they like it.I do not think Tom's wife's role was as pointless as most people think. His wife was not necessarily supposed to be a three-dimensional, well-rounded character. In a sense she represented the side of Tom that was pure and innocent, the only thing that probably kept him from going permanently insane. She was opposite to, but served a similar purpose to the character "Jezebel" played by Elizabeth Pena in Jacob's Ladder who represented evil to Tim Robbins' character. As Tom descended into the evil realms of society, those "cliched" phone calls to his wife served a moral purpose to keep him from ingesting all that he had witnessed. She is the anchor that his soul desperately needs to tie him to the part of society he represents.The pace of 8mm is excellent as the tension gradually builds and the ugliness of the characters behind the snuff film is demonstrated. I also agree with those who said that when Tom called Mary Ann's mother to ask her permission was a brilliant piece of filmmaking. Rather or not you agree with Tom's actions towards the pornographers, you should at least understand them. The story was not supposed to be a feel good movie where Tom just calls the police, the criminals get prison time, and Tom walks away from the case. We are supposed to see how his journey affected him and the results are just as unpleasant as the things and people he was so repulsed by.What is so horrifying about 8mm is the fact that Tom Welles' quest for answers as to why these men did what they did goes unsatisfied. To realize that there are people out there who kill just for pleasure and exploit the naive &amp; desperate for the almighty dollar is a truly sobering experience.8mm is a film to remind us that there are individuals in this world that become victims to the evil that lurks inside of some people and that we should care what happens to them. Granted, the answer is not for everyone to take justice into their own hands but this was just a film to spark us into some thought and action on what should be done.I do not understand how some viewers saw the ending as being "happy." In comparison to "Seven" where the end is clearly ominous and a no-win situation, 8mm is just as bleak. After all, Tom Welles vengeance cannot bring back the girl who was murdered and his conscious must bear the marks of the evil he witnessed but also the viciousness that his own soul carved out. We can all imagine the torment that Brad Pitt's character endured long after his ordeal, why can't we see the same torment that will plague Nicolas Cage's character for the rest of his life.As said before, Joaquin Phoenix is spectacular.How would you respond if taken down this dark path? I guarantee you would never be the same again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Joel Shumacher, most recently noted for his Batman movies pulls another "Lost Boys" out of his hat for a ride through a darkened looking glass at the sub-culture of X-treme pornography that lurks beneath "Everywhere, USA".So much for the intro. I have to admit that I am drawn to films that move the viewer into realms that are essentially forbidden. Written by the author of "7even", this film is another journey into the dark soul of humanity.Unlike most of the critics, and most of the reviews on IMDB, I felt this was a powerful film, adeptly paced and marvelously acted. What makes this film stand out from the numerous films of this genre is that the victim (a young "throw-away" girl) is the main focus of the film, and not the depraved person that preyed on her. This film breathes life into a lifeless person, and makes her story the crux of the film. It is for this reason that Cage's character descends into Dante's Inferno, and is willing (more like compelled) to put his life on the line in order to reach the truth.The film's final climax between Cage and the character known as "Machine" is every bit as chilling as the end of 7even, as Cage's character confronts the horror, only to find, quite literaly, "the boy next door". Machines final dialog is numbing in it's revelation about himself and perhaps about us as well.This is a dark, disturbing film that does not end when you leave the theater (or turn off the video), which is a testament to the power of this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nic Cage plays a private detective who learns first-hand that people who become sexually aroused while watching defenseless girls being brutally raped and stabbed to death are both slightly deranged and boring to talk to. As the film progresses, Cage's character is submerged into the dark side of human nature, while the audience is submerged into the world of MPAA-approved sodomy, rape, bondage and slasher-style sex scenes that forces them to grope for the exits. 8mm may have been more redeeming if there was something resembling a coherent script holding it together, but as such it's just another dumb action movie with an intriguing premise. While a lot of people might think of it as an intensely disturbing psychological examination of human sexual depravity, I thought of 8mm as little more than 2 hours of watching Nicolas Cage act worried. The porno scenes were nicely edited, though, and the glimpses of violence and gore that director Joel Schumacher slips in are subtle enough to make you cringe but not explicit enough to warrant an NC-17 rating, a small miracle that I'm still marvelling at. All in all, if you're looking for entertainment tonight, I suggest another often overlooked yet entertaining Nicolas Cage film, Raising Arizona, perhaps the only film where Cage's acting ability isn't called into question. Or better yet, rent The Big Lebowski, a movie that involves a similar plot (Girl gets kidnapped, guy investigates girl's disappearance, wacky antics ensue) but doesn't attempt to aggressively confront the viewer's stomach for raunchy sex scenes.</fullReview>

While this film was supposedly "Welcome to the Terrordome", I had more of a "Don't Believe the Hype" feeling. Then again, that would be one of the few emotions derived from this formulaic death march, a movie with all off the subtlety of a Carrot Top film. I heard all the buzz about this movie before its release: how "gruesome" and "disturbing" this film is; how the test audience's reactions were so extremely polar; how it was so much like "Se7en". Don't Believe the Hype! This movie might be "disturbing" to people who live in a steel-hard shell and don't understand why people would volunteer to be handcuffed or tied-up and whipped. I wonder how anyone could be shocked by anything in this film, since the plodding, predictable script takes 90 minutes to reach the first (and only) real plot twist. By this point, you know exactly what is going to happen in the final 40 minutes, and the plot twist just doesn't wind up mattering that much. I know the MPAA overlords forced cuts of this movie, but I can't see how any additional footage would save this turkey.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have just recently viewed *8mm*, and not once was I disappointed by how the plot elements intertwined together. It is indeed a rollercoaster ride through the depths of one's love for his family and towards the fascination of solving a mysterious death of abominational proportions. Nick Cage does a respectful performance, not counting his overacting of first viewing the infamous film. To observe him change from a flinching coward to a nonchalant investigator of graphic media material is remarkable. Most of the performances in the movie are believable, but some of the actors do go overboard with their vision of "psychotic" acting. Indeed this movie is not for the sqeamish; not only is the snuff film viewed time and again *though many cut-aways occur*, the graphic detailed language is not for everyone who is easily offended. A great referance to this movie would be a nonfiction book titled *GODS OF DEATH*, by ...Savroy(sic). The book can be found at your local library, but it speaks of one investigator's journey into the darkness of the world where pornographic snuff is made and viewed. This book may even be the basis of the film, by what I can see. The viewer of this movie, it seems, has to make an assumption-- do people actually believe that pornographic snuff is urban legend, or do they fear that it is real but can't handle the image that the world around them is actually that brutal. *examp.-Jewish Holocaust*</fullReview>

Never in the history of film has a film been so dark, so moody and so terrifying just over the details of one single murder. Many have compared this to Seven, but what Seven does with six grisly, very graphic murders, 8MM does with just one you never see. This film also attacks American cinema at its very roots. Most plots now a days run in formulaic fashion: Bad guys kill/maim/harm the loved ones/property/way of life of our hero, the hero loses something, then gets back who S/he is by finding said bad guys and killing them. The concept of vigilantism is rampant in most of todays movies and America has been desensitized to it, this movie is a wake up call. See this, but not on a date. You just won't get any.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When i've heard about 8mm i knew what i was going into. Critics in the newspaper said it was a dark film dealing with dark characters. 8mm is sure dark, but in the right side of the word. The movie takes you into the lowest dumps of new-york and cali, as well as to the castles of high society, to meet with all kinds of characters, and see a whole new world, that exists right under our noses. Tom Wells, played by Cage is asked by a late millionaires' wife to find if a snuff film found in her husband's safe is real or a fake. Tom takes the job very seriously and goes out there to find the sources of this horror film. To my opinion, Tom is encouraged first by the money he is about the earn from this job, but as deeper he goes, he is kind of appealed by this strange new world he discovers. He wants to uncover why these people doing it, and as Mr.Kalifornia (Tom's little helper) said, "But you are not Either disgusted of what you seen, right?". I found this film interesting especially because i know it really exists. It is not fiction, and not a sicki thoughts of the writer. It is out there, and maybe it is preferable not to know about it at all, after all, the world is ain't no pleasantville...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is not on the screen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of fuss has been made about the explicitness of some scenes on 8mm. Well, there are really some explicit scenes, but the major shocking elements are the ones that you don't see: almost all violent action happens away from the eyes of the audience, on films seen by the characters. All the audience sees is the reaction of that other audience, what opens space for inference, and what we infer about it is much worse than any explicit violence we see in movies everyday. A film for those with the guts to let imagination go free!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overhyped on the violence angle, works best as a murder/thriller story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is really the kind of film you would only go to see once. Although what you've probably heard most about it is the violence, this really acts as a driving force behind the main story, which is essentially Nicolas Cage's character seeking to find the truth behind a so-called 'snuff movie'. During this investigation, he comes face to face with the very worst side of sleeze, and the sex industry in America. I think it portrays very well the reactions and emotions of a 'normal' guy, ( Cage plays a family man, and often portrayed in the movie talking to his wife and baby daughter ) when faced with this kind of violence. Cage does pull this off very well, and the acting is always good, if a little 'over-cooked' in parts. The comparisons with the film '7' I think are misplaced, I never felt the same sense of shock or fear in '8MM', and the motivations and forces which drive the characters are entirely different.The one failing I found was the final scene, which I thought was hammily acted and entirely predictable. If you go see this movie, don't bring you Mom, but don't expect to see something you never have before either.I'd give a 6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Daring, gruesome look into the underground porn scene. Heavy, but intense.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying that this movie truly made me think about things. We all know that the world is getting sicker and sicker, and yet we don't seem to worry too much about it. Making a movie about snuff movies, seems to be the last taboo to be broken by the hollywood scene, I mean what more can we expect? Seeing this movie gave me a good insight in the underground porn industry on the US west coast, one that I will likely not soon forget. It starts with a perfectly normal, suburban white man, Tom Welles, who wastes his time doing private detective work, gets this assignment from a wealthy widow who wants him to find out if a snuff tape, left by her deceased husband, contains real footage, or is a set up.Welles begins his investigation from scratch, which comes over as pretty realistic, I mean how often don't you see in movies coincidental leads and tips etc.? Anyway he embarks on his crusade and meets all kinds of interesting people. first of all Max California, a smart kid who happens to work in the porn industry. He recruits his services and both descend to the deepest rat holes known to humanity. Gruesome images, illustrative characters and a gloomy atmosphere make you want to call mammie. Slowly you start to see a chance in Welles, how obviously is affected by all the dirt he sees.Anyway the film continues and via a surprising plot, it reaches its end. What struck me most about this movie was the relationship between Tom Welles and the mother of the missing girl on the movie. This relationship seemed very sincere and the emotional aspects really came over as naturalistic.Cage is excellent in this movie. Although a bit constrained by the script and the director, he does deliver the goods. Phoenix is a great supporting actor, but one doubts if he can carry the weight of a star role. All the other supporting actors are sublime, especially Welles wife, who witnesses the transition her husband is going through and the pain it causes her.Although not the most brilliant storyline, camera work and plotline, this movie makes you think about your daily existence and makes you wonder why people do what they do. Don't take a date, but go alone and reserve an hour afterwards to ponder about what just happened.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>8MM, the guage of film and guns.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nicholas Cage plays Tom Welles, a PI. He's asked by the widow of a wealthy man to view the contents of her late husband's safe. In it Welles finds a roll of super-8 film. In this he finds a snuff film showing a young girl being brutally murdered. His task? To find if the girl is alive. Since this is all in the first twenty minutes it should be pretty obvious to all that she was of course killed. What would you do if she was alive? Welles rapidly gets drawn into the seedy world of S&amp;M and porn, his descent Dante-like. His guide through this is a leather clad Joaquin Phoenix, a porn store clerk. That about sums the full extent of the movie up. Joel Schumacher, a director who should be made to apologise for what he's done to the Tim Burton Batman, isn't up to this. He's trying to present a gripping thriller crossed with social commentary. This is the realm that only Oliver Stone and a few others have ever been good at.The script is from the pen of Andrew Kevin Walker, writer of Se7en, a classic of the nineties, and I expected better. Gone is the dark brooding sense of confinement, the metaphorical darkness replaced by a set where there are no working lightbulbs. The characters are left illuminated by neon (another Schumacher speciality). The ending also sits in the film like a cat in the driving seat of a fighter plane, it's totally out of place. Rumours have it that Walker and Joel had on set fights when the director added the ludicrously upbeat ending. At ?4.50 (about $7.50) I feel that I'm owed some money back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Angst and stereotypes spoil a potential hit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film that explores a very dark and seemy underside of life. Thus said it seems a pity that the people involved in this underworld seem almost as if out of a gothic movie. This two-dimensional stereotyping detracts from the plot and gives Schumacher the chance to exercise his action credentials.I wish that the film had continued its opening character development rather than almost snap into the action. It was a shame that the role wife and child of Wells was diminished throughout the bulk of the film. Cage gurns his way with shock and angst throughout the picture and by the end you really rather he would adopt another expression.Despite this, the film does deal with disturbing issues and does not glamorise it at all which is to its credit. The way that the hero can only cross the line by asking permission is a masterful piece of cinema and well worth viewing just for that. The film is shocking and horrific in places and viewers should be aware but the villains are too 'comic book' in character which counteracts this horror.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, I am a sucker for Seven. It's one of my favorite movies and though I've seen it a good many times I still think it's a masterpiece and brilliant in its way to create a gloom-soaked and horrific atmosphere. Writer Andrew Kevin Walker has a knack for creating true-to-the-touch characters and speedy, strongly driven dialogue.It's sad to discover that his plot for 8mm doesn't offer the edge and excitement the story would need. It sinks pretty quickly into uncommitted, conventional storytelling and both characters and plot lose credibility.I must admit I was a bit perplexed when finding out Joel Schumacher was going to direct 8mm. David Fincher had the innovative and aesthetic style to add the right atmosphere and mood to Seven. And I did find it difficult to believe that Joel Schumacher would be able to make the story as intense and convincing. Don't get me wrong, Joel Schumacher is an exceptional director and Falling Down and A Time to Kill prove it. But he is also justly unfavorably reviewed for his lousy Batman attempts. Unfortunately, even Joel Schumacher can't mask the fact that plot- and tension- wise, the movie hurtles wildly off the rails. Cage delivers a standard lead performance and the rest of the performances are way over the top.Sadly, the whole venture is as uninspired as it is unnecessary. Still, the hunt for a snuff-movie producer is a great premise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My thoughts on 8mm</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, I saw the controversial "8mm", yesterday. Hmmmm.... Reasonable - but there seemed to be just a little too much of an effort to make it appear true-to-life. Sort of "Seven" meets "The Pawnbroker".I go to the films for either spiritual enlightenment or escapism. There isn't that much in the way of spiritual enlightenment nowadays, ("Good as it gets", "Shakespeare in Love" and "private Ryan" excepted) so escapism is my motivating factor. "8mm" portrays Nicholas Cage as a slightly over-the-top "sensitive new age dick" (SNAD) - almost gratuitously so. The in-your-face hyper-realism, in terms of seedy, dark and ugly conurbations and a plain wife (who seems to be a powerful disincentive for marriage) is unnecessary. For some strange reason, "Seven" seemed to work with this formula but in 8mm, it was a touch incongruous. There were terrible (and tragically puerile) holes in the plot and I was left feeling a little flat at the end of the film - but there were many redeeming factors. Worth a visit but only just. I think Cage was good in "Guarding Tess" and - as a comic book hero - reasonable in "Con Air" but someone like Brad Pitt would have been better for 8mm.People may comment on the gruesome aspects of the film but, next to some other films, I'd say "8mm" was almost tame. I think the gruesome hype has been grossly over-stated. (Unless, of course, the film had been greatly cut down for the Australian market. (I doubt this, somehow). Two days before, I saw Matrix. Much more enjoyable...............</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You can pick that 8mm is going to be a stinker in the first few minutes. Here's Nick Cage at the beach. Then here's Nick at the airport. Cut to Nick with his loving wife. A small touch of obligatory sex. A Glimpse of the Cage chest. Cue onto the set his adorable baby.One, two three,Here's Nick to see.And who's Nick? He's a loving, husband and father. He's Nick Cage the conservative. He's a humble private investigator just trying to make a living in amongst the trash that is his stock and trade. But he's a pretty wimpy P.I.That's all well and good but more than most, 8mm seems to go by the storybook. Such an effort is made to establish the worthiness of Tom Welles (Nick Cage) and the nastiness of the porn industry with whom Tom has to deal, that all semblance of movie magic disappears.This may have something to do with the subject matter, which is snuff movies; those home videos said to show actual murder. The Moral Majority in mainstream America might have had something to do with the tone of 8mm.I got the feeling that veteran film maker Joel Schumacher (Falling Down, A Time To Kill, Batman And Robin, Dying Young, Flatliners, The Lost Boys) might have been a bit overawed by the material, but then with his experience, you would have hoped that he could have been a bit more inventive.In fact 8mm has something of the opposite effect, seeming to be more sleazy than the material it's supposed to be denigrating. But then that's the nature of film. It augments and glorifies whatever it regards.And that has a lot to do with the music. In 8mm the music has a decidedly Arabic flair and Arabic music is played over the end titles.But then back to Nicholas Cage, who played Tom Welles so monochromatically that Tom seemed like an eternally doleful Basset Hound. There are only so many minutes that I can happily watch an actor never change his expression or demeanor.Oh he goes a bit frantic at the end but by that time I was bored.I found myself wishing for a Cary Grant or Jimmy Stewart as Tom, either of whom would have added some much needed depth and humour to the film, but there I am again probably showing my age.But another of the myriad qualities needed for a good film is credibility. We're meant to believe that Tom is a sleuth; chiefly a chaser of adulterous partners. Would he have been so horribly shocked by a snuff movie? Wouldn't he have seen this sort of thing before? Oh where's Humphry Bogart when we need him?One Holier Than Thou Fly</fullReview>

		<fullReview>8MM was probably one of the most disturbing films I have ever seen. Not to say that it was a bad film, because it wasn't. I went to see it the first day it came out and I wasn't expacting to see what I was seeing. I basically thought that it was going to be a disturbing picture about the underbelly of today's society, the side no one likes to talk about. But toward the middle of the movie, I almost felt dirty, realizing the kind of people out there that live in the same world as us, this is so vulgarly displayed in 8MM. This movie is about a private investigator, (Nicholas Cage) who is asked to explain the bizarre contents of an 8MM film cartridge. It is a cheap porno movie that involves a young teenage girl who is forced to have sex with another masked man and then is butchered after she does. Cage is put on this assignment by a rich elderly widow, who found the film in her dead husband's safe. She asks Cage to find out if the film is real or not. Find the girl if she is still alive, and she will give him his reward. Cage isn't too sure about the assignment, but after he views the film and is repulsed by what it contains, he feels like he owes it not only to the woman, but to the girl as well. He must start from scratch, leaving his wife and infant daughter behind, and slowly descend into the underground world of sex, murder, money, and lies. Making friends with a porno salesman to help him on the way. Before long, Cage is pulled between coming back to his loving wife and his longing to find the wherabouts of the makers of the film, after he discovers that the girl is realy killed. Then his struggle for sanity when the way of life that he has been subjected to starts to get him. I won't tell you anything else about the film, but I will give you some advise. If you have an open mind about movies and aren't one of those people who critisize things that they don't aprove of, this film is for you. If you don't like to watch sex, nudity, murder, profanity,(and all those other wonderful things), this film is definitely not for you. Also if you do not like to hear about the underbelly of today's society, then don't even pull this one off the rack, you will not approve! In my personal opinion, I liked this film very much but I have an open mind to new things and new ideas. I think that this film went to the limit and came out on top. I give this film a 7.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Falling short of possible excellence in "8mm"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the tradition of "Seven," this latest neo-noir thriller attempts to attack the foundations of comfort and stability in the life of private detective Tom Welles. As in Polanski's "Chinatown" the detective character bites off more than he can chew by simply taking the Christiansan case. Unlike in "Chinatown" however, 8mm never hides the nature of Welles' case. The plot focuses more on the effects of this snuff film case on Welles, played effectively by Nicolas Cage. But there is much more to the film that really doesn't relate directly to the 8mm film. Welles' character is hidden and jumbled throughout the opening of the film. His smoking habit is attempted to be hidden from his wife, Amy with breath sprays and aerosol perfumes. His work prevents him from being completely honest with his wife, unlike Brad Pitts character in "Seven" and his relationship with his wife. So we have a secretive enigma in Welles, who dives into the seediest and most secretive world of pornography and violence. While Welles journeys down into this underworld, he encounters various people. Most interesting is Max California, played by Jaquin Pheonix. He reads "In Cold Blood" with a porno cover imposed on it. Although he works in an "adult bookstore"he doesn't endorse the industry...although he looks the part. Like Max says, "you dance with the devil, the devil don't change-the devil changes you." So 8mm reveals it's themes of appearance vs. reality and the idea of being caught up in the "devil" simply by dealing in hell for a while. Both themes in relationship to the 8mm film clip of Mary being sliced up by the masked Machine seem to work in the movie, that is until about 30 minutes prior to the films close. Welles changes as a result of his encounters during the Christiansan case-however, we really don't know Welles to begin with. Does he smoke or not? Does he like working long cases away from his wife, or is he money crazed? Does he really care about the girl in the film, or is he simply feeling guilty for being violent with Eddie in the end? The other characters in the film are much more clearly defined than Welles. Max is an example of better characterization in the film. His ambiguity is due to necessity (you can't read Truman Capote in an adult bookstore). Perhaps Welles had already changed as a result of his occupation. Again, as in "Chinatown", the detective starts out ambiguous ad desensitized and slowly becomes overwhelmed and shocked by the evils they encounter along their journey with "devils." The problem with "8mm" is in that it attempts too much without putting ample time and detail into Welles and his character. As a result of this distant characterization of the lead, played by Cage, the ending falls flat and comes across as a "sell out" ending. "Seven" left audiences feeling outraged at the films close. "8mm", however, re-affirms the "good" in society and redeems the Welles character-yet every message in the film seems to scream out against such hope and redemption. While "8mm" opens with great intentions, it loses sight of its' goals and falls short of the greatness of the noir genre, as "Seven" and "Chinatown" more effectively exemplified.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"8MM" is one of those movies that everyone has a strong opinion about. They can either be intrigued or disgusted by it. I myself found myself intrigued. Not because of the disturbing subject matter, but because this is one of the most gutsy and riveting films of the year.In the film we explore the dark, seedy underground world of underground pornography. The story centers around Cage who plays a detective responsible for finding a young girl who is believed to have been used in a snuff film. The films dark tone remains strong throughout the movie adding to the films bleak atmosphere. Although the film's content is disturbing it is very true. It is what is happening in modern-day America today. The film is honest. It gives us what we don't expect. That is probably why it was hated so much. I praise the director for his fluent direction. Nicolas Cage gives us one his most riviting performances. The characters are also great, Phoenix is terrific in his supporting role. You can actually feel the hateful malevolence that goes on during the movie. The script could be a little more polished but it doesn't slow down the films raw intensity at all. Of course, this film is not for everyone. The film serves as a wake-up call to America in the sense that the film is an honest gutpunch that is starkly and horrifyingly presented.Rating: ***1/2</fullReview>

It's no holds barred: director Schumacher seems to have no hang-ups in telling/revealing the truth -- is it truth or is it fantasy? How important is the "truth"? Does a parent of a missing teenage daughter really want to know what happened to her beloved child? Truth and consequence? He's not afraid to show the horrid "truth", the explicit gutsy (literally so) scenes. If you believe it's all true, you'd feel morally "ravaged" after this emotionally traumatic journey. If you like to take it as all fantasy -- so be it, and you just might dismiss the fact that all those missing young girls are immaterial? You'd also either able to stand the loud and urging Middle Eastern music that kept on playing along this "quest" of a journey of the main character, or, you'd just might find it much too distracting/annoying. (I wonder if the chosen piece of music denotes some Middle Eastern chant for death/loss or impending danger?) Mind you, the "filth" is not just the underground "8mm" stuff, it also points to the "filthy rich" perspective. You would wonder how all this ends? You would like it to end soon. Nope. You shall have a "complete" ending. Heart or heartless? You'll have to see the movie.Catherine Keener delivered a deeply subdued portrait as Cage's wife. Seemingly cold and hauntingly restrained -- suggesting a strained marriage? When you're not overpowered by the nauseous subjects, the nuances of the supporting roles and scenes could be studies in themselves.You are warned: you are entering an "unsafe" zone. Compared to this film, "The Dead Zone" is not so scary after all.If you haven't seen "The Dead Zone" (1983, Christopher Walken) directed by David Cronenberg, a Stephen King story, it's a gem of a film worth viewing/experiencing. "Kiss the Girls" (1997, Morgan Freeman, Ashley Judd) directed by Gary Fleder. For a livelier Catherine Keener, try "Walking and Talking" (1996 with Anne Heche), "Box of Moonlight" (1996 with John Turturro), and "Living In Oblivion" (1995 with Steve Buscemi).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Se7en, Leaving Las Vegas, 8MM?!?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, I'm a huge Nicolas Cage Fan, and I'm trying really really hard to say that this was a good movie.There were SO Many great parts to it, his acting, the direction, the cinematography; however, there were really several aspects that kept it from being a truly great thriller.Someone mentioned the soundtrack - I agree with the idea that it was a tad bit out of place and too loud at some points. Perhaps it was just my position in the theatre, but I really think more consideration could have been given to the music. I understand what they were *trying* to do. I feel they were trying to make it haunting and suspenseful and such, I just don't think they suceeded.Second thing is: The wife. It has been quite some time that I have been SO thoroughly *annoyed* with a character in a movie. My husband says they needed to have a wife and child in there for the threat at the end, but I completely disagree - I think what happened with Max California was enough. I felt more connection with that character than I did with this woman that was weakly worked into the script. The kid was cute, I must admit. I just think it could have been the same movie, same greatness without this annoyance. I do understand the angle of him imagining that this atrocity could happen to his daughter when she gets older was perhaps a driving force for him to solve this crime, but again, I think the connection with Mary's Mother was enough to fuel that fire.And third: Just the storyline in general. I have to give mucho credit to the filmmakers for bringing this sort of honesty to the screen - as was done with Se7en so many years ago. It was just a very disturbing thing to watch. I don't think I needed to know quite *THAT* much about the underground S&amp;M market.. but then again, that maybe the point... they needed to pull you in so far to fully understand exactly what this scene is all about. I *do* commend the filmmakers for shedding some light on this part of society that is not looked at very often at all.All in all: I have to say it was a good flick. Like Se7en, it was very disturbing, and nauseating, to say the least - but once a couple of days goes by and the shock of it all wears off, you're really able to look at it and see that it was very well done. I'd have to give it a 6 outta 10 stars. (=</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>rent SE7EN and save six bucks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like screenwriter A.K Walker's far-superior thriller SE7EN, 8MM starts off with good enough intentions: we've got a bland, unimaginative family man (Cage) embarking on a homicide investigation. From the atmosphere in the film, one would have to be sub-mental not to know it's going to lead him into the dark and seedy urban underground, and to reinforce this Nick has a sidekick character to preach how utterly perverted and unquestionably evil mankind is (just like SE7EN's Morgan Freeman.)These tried and true ingredients, however, cannot save 8MM from the predictable turns it takes (man, ANYONE could have seen that lawyer bit comin'.) The film bludgeons us with "theme", and as a result loses track of the actual plot. Our main character Cage makes some vague and rather unbelievable long shots during his investigation which all prove to be oh-so-conveniently right on the money. Also, 8MM certainly fell horribly short in the villain department: where SE7EN had a genuinely disturbing psycho-killer (Spacey), 8MM has a bunch of dumpy pornmakers with garbled accents and a corrupt lawyer who looks like Geraldo.Blah. And don't even get me started on the actual filmmaking. I have only three words for you: lighting lighting lighting! Sure Joel Schumacher's films have always incorporated unusual and creative lighting techniques, but 8MM took it too far! Some scenes would have been better off if lit by an indiglo watch!Routine cinematic mediocrity. Only the threat of being banned from the local theater forever kept me from pitching my soft drink at the screen. Really.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A New Side of Nicolas Cage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the darkest movie I have seen Nicolas Cage in. I saw a whole new side of Cage's talents. I really could feel the anguish he felt in his portrayal of Tom Welles, as he watched some very graphic and violent "snuff" movies. And at the end, as he seeks revenge, I could feel his rampaging emotions...anger, disgust, despair. Cage was excellent. It's been a long time that I have felt fear while watching a movie, and this one really scared me. It frightened me, disgusted me, and made me squirm in my seat. Despite the mood of the film, and some of the more violent scenes, I liked it. Nicolas Cage really carried this film over the top. 8mm is just another example of his extraordinary talent in acting. I would not recommend this film for the weak-hearted, but for those who can stand extremely violent/graphic scenes, I would whole-heartedly recommend it...at least just to watch Cage's brilliant performance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hi, I have never posted a review here but I couldn't resist after reading the reviews of others on this site so here goes.... I saw this movie last night and the way the clerk said that the movie had some shocking scenes of hardcore underground pornography in it made me think I was in for a shocking movie. I guess for a more or less mainstream movie, but compared to the films of David Lynch or David Cronenberg this was just your average detective movie with revenge undertones.I found Nicolas Cage to be back in good shape in this movie since lately he had been doing action movies (con air, face off..). Anyway his performance was excellent and it's good to see he still does controversial movies. Joaquin Phoenix surprised me since his character is the best in the movie. I didn't hate anything really in this movie but I just got the sense that it wasn't showing you much the same way seven had this hype around it that it was really gory and shocking when I thought it was good, but far from shocking. All in all it is good but not shocking. If you want to be shocked just go to a slaughterhouse, that is truly shocking. This movie just shows the dark side of humanity. anarchus</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into this film expecting a dark, gritty, detective flick, with some "shocking" footage. That would have been easier for me to handle. I don't believe I was ever really shocked during this movie, but that was not ever really the film's intent.What this film did was much more disturbing... it presented the adverse material constantly, without reprieve. We are spared seeing clearly what we are looking at, but our imaginations do far more to convince us of a world unbearably heavy and bleak. I don't know if I could call this film "beautiful" but the images are so real yet so nightmarish at once . ..The acting is believable throughout, and I consistently identified with Nick Cage's character. Phoenix's store clerk is definitely the highlight: someone who sees what Cage sees, but mercifully has seen it all before. Although my heart was pounding throughout the last 45 minutes of the film, sadly the movie regressed into Batman-style action-flickiness (whew) more than once. But these are weaknesses, not downfall.Overall, the film left me feeling ill. Its philosophy, and cinematography, and music make this film worth seeing in a theatre, despite its weaknesses. In Se7en we hear: "The world is a good place, and worth fighting for." In 8mm, we question both parts.</fullReview>

The trailers make the movie seem like another Seven or The Game.. which is what I expected it to be like. This movie was entertaining and very dramatic at parts, which was cool. Also, Cage is an incredible actor.. but the whole movie left him silent and distant.. a person usually gets attached to his character early, but some of his lines in this seemed tacked on.. no, not like those catch lines from Terminator or Batman.. but it just seems every once in awhile he'll just say something completely out of line. I liked the conclusion, although it wasn't shocking like many expected it to be. On the Skatt rating I give it a 6.5.

You know who would've been great in this role? Roberto Benigni... I think he would've been as little more believable. The story is intriguing...but a good 15-20 minutes could've been hacked off this thing, including the crappy ending...There was really no need for unmasking "Machine".. Why put a face on evil?

		<fullReview>I'm guessing that people are going to see this as another main-stream Nicolas Cage action movie, it's not. This is another clever movie written by Andrew Kevin Walker (the same brilliant mind behind "SE7EN"). And like "SE7EN", it's very dark and morbid, yet you can't turn your head away. I highly enjoyed the first half of the movie, as Det. Welles (Cage) is investigating on who made the snuff 8 mm film, and if it's fake or not. The investigating was intelligent and brilliantly staged similar to "SE7EN." However, by the final act, the film is slightly disappointing, as it becomes routine and cliched. Cage as usual is good as the detective who's trying to find answers, and this is director Joel Schumacher (a really nice guy in person!), better films. I would put this on his 'good' shelf with "A TIME TO KILL," "THE CLIENT," and "FALLING DOWN," and not on his bad shelf with "BATMAN FOREVER," "FLATLINERS," and "BATMAN &amp; ROBIN." It is a good movie, but it's still not as good as SE7EN. **** out of *****.</fullReview>

This was ten times more sadistic than Se7en, maybe on account of the violent pornography but maybe it was just because of the message. Se7en was about "the world is an awful place but worth fighting for." This had two interesting signals: "Evil is a trap you cannot attempt to understand or flirt with" and "Those who are evil do it without motive, it's innate." I heard this had to get cut just to get an R rating and it showed when Nicolas Cage was in porn shops and such, because overall the movie was disturbing. It did delve into the ruining of the mind through this disgusting evil, which gave it some outstanding qualities. However, the kind of evil it explores is not for everyone, as it really runs into the heart of sin and the slums of humanity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I lost my faith in Joel Schumacher after "Batman &amp; Robin", despite the fact that he is a master of creating exciting visual compositions.But here he earns it back, in part. "8MM" is a common thriller with uncommon ambitions. It shows us unpleasant imagery of pornography, S&amp;M, and "snuff" films, but in a manner which is not exploitive of victims or so-called "professionals". There is a lot of violence, some of it very extreme, but none of it is self-indulgent on the part of its makers.But all that is easy enough if you hire a director with maturity and discipline. What Schumacher presents to us is a thriller with interesting characters, a plotline which does not necessarily take the beaten path, and a moral dilemma which may not be as easy to solve as one thinks. I'd like to see the actress who played the victim's mother in more movies--she has a great presence, a kind of glow, and turns a role which could have otherwise been another "Lifetime Original Movie" stereotype."8MM" is a well written, well photographed and edited film that goes on for about a half hour too long. Nicolas Cage, is good, as usual, but in his early scenes he's as dull as he's ever been. Also, the scenes with the hero's wife could be better written (they recall similar scenes between Johnny Depp and Anne Heche in "Donnie Brasco", but those were done much better).If there were a genre for these kinds of movies, "Se7en" would still be on top. It took the old "cops 'n' robbers" routine and turned it on its ear. "8MM" doesn't have enough creative energy or ambition to do it again, but it has its moments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Plumbing the Depths of Human Perversion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This rather predictable suspense/thriller has private investigator Tom Welles (Cage), and adult-bookstore clerk Max (Phoenix) teaming up to find the truth behind a "snuff" film that turns up among the personal effects of a dead old rich guy. Their search carries them into the questionably mythical underbelly of the sex industry, where they meet a particularly unsavory assortment of characters. But while the film attempts to shock us by plumbing the depths of human perversion, it continually fails to sidestep the pitfalls of preachiness and cliche.The perversions scattered throughout 8MM will certainly shock some movie-goers, but any sexwise websurfer will see through the shallow, sleazy, and ultimately meaningless shock devices. In all fairness however, Schumacher's sordid world of sex, death and dollars makes a fine canvas upon which good and evil can wage yet another battle in their eternal war.All said, 8MM goes where few films have dared. It is a brutal piece of celluloid with little hope or redemption at its core. But, on the brighter side, it has plenty of violence, nudity and filth. It also boasts a terrifically likeable performance by Joaquin Phoenix. Not a date movie, you may want to rent this one on a rainy day - especially if you are sick pervert.

		<fullReview>It's all been done before, and much better, even by this screenwriter (Seven). There were so many moments when this film could have been good or, at least, more interesting. The one scene that gave some idea of the real Tom Welles hiding behind his family-man facade was when the petty thief asked him for a cigarette. That one scene is not worth the admission price, but if you have nothing better to do of an evening, this movie won't disappoint as a standard thriller.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was *eeehhhhhh* ok. When Nic Cage was talking to Mrs. Christian he sounded like a ReRe in a suit, and he sounded like a robot wanting to remember his lines, but after he got through with her he got better into character. and from then on the movie was good. It wasn't as graphic as I thought it would be but I am glad, they were quite disturbing as they were. so when he finds the men who did 'it' my chin was on the floor, I could have never guessed them myself, so that was good, the dark tone to the movie was also good, eg the slums of l.a....

		<shortDescription>Engaging story mixes thrills with controversial subject</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wealthy widow hires private investigator Tom Welles, played by Nick Cage, to discover the truth behind an apparent snuff film found among her late husband's possessions. After Cage views the film he agrees to help discover whether the girl in the suppossed snuff film is actually alive or not.The movie actually shows very little of the snuff film, maybe ten to twenty seconds in all. In fact, the director focuses almost as much time on Cage's horrified reactions as he does in showing the audience the scenes. The scenes are handled very well and never seem exploitational or overly graphic. The result is very effective, leaving the audience to fill in the void.With unlimited resources at hand, Cage finds himself hunting down promising leads out in Holywood. Here, we are presented with the dark underbelly of a tarnished town, streets littered with the homeless and destitute. We learn that, like so many young and naive youth, our victim had run away from home (with boyfriend) to make it big in Hollywood. Later, boyfriend soon bails out of the relationship and our young victim is left to support herself. Soon after, she disappears.After hooking up with the manager of a Holywood adult video store, Cage is taken on a tour of the local underground porn industry, where just about anything is available for the right price. Except of course "snuff", which nobody seems willing to discuss, at least not without a fight. The snuff trail eventually leads to a sleazy porn producer and his new york contacts.At this point, Cage becomes personally involved, feeling sorry for the single mother who has no idea her daughter is dead. Diving ever deeper into the case, Cage soon finds his family life back home starting to fall apart. When Cage finally does meet up with the guilty parties he get more than he bargains for and a few surprises thrown in to boot.This movie is very thrilling and deftly handles the very dark and disturbing concept of snuff films (without actually having to get too graphic). The acting is good, however this is not Cage's best roll. There were times when I wasn't totally convinced of his character. Cage's acting in the first half of the film somehow seemed quirky and forced. Yet the last half showed Cage back in brilliant form, fully absored into the character and very believable.Like "Seven", also directed by Joel Schumacher, "8mm" is visually dark and moody, setting a nice atmosphere for such creepy topics as snuff. Much empahsis is put into the camera concentrating on the characters faces and showing there reactions.An exciting movie that covers a very sick urban legend. Or is it?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good... but wait for it to come out on video.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All in all, I suppose that this film was watchable, and, in fact, good. But, in retrospect, it isn't exactly a movie that I'd rush to see.I waited about a year-and-a-half for this to come out. Andrew Walker did an amazing job on "Se7en", and despite the fact that the person who's most famous for putting nipples on the Batsuit was directing it, I had confidence that both Walker and Cage could pull this disturbing subject matter off (anyone who has seen "Wild at Heart" knows what Cage is capable of doing-- he's come a long way since "Firebirds"). But alas, Hollywood got their hands on this film and I don't think that its current ending is the way that Walker envisioned it.Nevertheless, save a couple melodramatic scenes (the actress who plays Mrs. Wells has to go), the film was okay. Gandolfini, Stormare and Bauer all put in extremely noteworthy performances.Ulitmately, though, I suggest that any moviegoer not rush to go see it. If you're in need to see a flick, give it a shot; otherwise, don't plan your evening around it-- wait for it at your local video store.Basically, just be aware of the fact that it takes a major turn for dark and licentious; also, expect the worst and you can only be reassured, or pleased.Maybe next time Walker?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>BenjiMan here, and this will be my first review on this glorious site. I just saw the new anticipated film 8mm, and would like to put my 1 cent in. Why 1 cent? Because I work at business establishment that's so cheap that when you ask for a raise, they suggest you wear platforms. So once again, here's my 1 cent....So we have all been waiting patiently for this film since we all received wind that Andrew Walker was penning the script. We haven't heard from him since his shocker "Seven", and have been waiting quietly like good little girls and boys for his next thriller. Once again, Walker creates for us a very disturbing tale about how screwed up mankind can truly be. The script doesn't lack as a detective story, but I felt sorry for some of the actors and actresses who had roles that seemed pointless to me. Some characters seem to be there just to slow the process down considerably. I direct this comment mainly to the private detective's wife. Her only point in the film seems to be to make her husband feel terrible for doing his job. I must admit, even though she's doing what most devoted wives would do in this situation, she really does come off irritating to me. However while I'm bashing the wife, it's only fair to say that the film on a whole is not much of a character piece. With the acception of the young girl who is the center of the entire story. I will admit that the story does well in making you fall for this girl whom you've never met, and never truly see in action, except of course in the 8mm film.But now I turn our focus on the director. I for one was very worried about the direction of this film. Dare I mention Joel's last film? Oh wait! You say I already mentioned that in my title? Oh! Sorry! My fault. Well then. We won't mention again how terribly Joel crucified Batman &amp; Robin! I think I've said enough. I will say however that Joel does help redeem the weakly written characters by some admittedly nicely filmed scenes. You'll catch one suspenseful moment that will immediately bring you back to the days of Hitchcock suspense. So on a happy note, we're getting to see a little of the old Joel Schumacher. I'm sure a lot of us miss the greats like "The Lost Boys", and "Flatliners". But dear Joel could only do so much to resurrect this somewhat dead film. It just seemed that the producers, and overall production crew were trying incredibly too hard to recreate "Seven". And by using some disgusting porno as their guide, probably lured in a few pervs for a quick extra buck.But hey, these are only personal opinions, and if this particular storyline doesn't completely disgust you, then you may enjoy this film. It's just one of those movies that you may have to decide for yourself. So go give it a try, if you dare. And for the first time on this site, that's my 1 cent!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A solid thriller with several ups and downs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the intriguing preview trailer captured me way back in January, I finally got to see Joel Schumacher's new thriller: "8mm".Nicolas Cage, a private investigator, is hired to discover the truth behind a "snurff" film -a piece of upsetting sexual perversion.The movie has its best moments when Cage and surprising Joaquin Phoenix, who stars as clerk of a LA porn shop, dive into the devil underground porn scene.Most of the thrills evolve out of the shocking perversity and aren't nearly as clever and unexpected as in Se7en. Some cuts and transitions are quite creative and the darkness of Se7en remains. But don't try to compare 8mm to the brilliance of Se7en or you'll be as disappointed as I was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While it was fun to see how the hero, played very well by Nicholas Cage, would solve the case, the movie felt like a very R-rated episode of Murder, She Wrote. The way the movie played out would not happen in real life; all the clues were conveniently found only by the hero, and only when it would help propel the story. Cage would find a clue, which would lead him to another clue, and so on, and so on. In fact, now that I think about it, it seemed not just like an episode of Murder, She Wrote, but also like a RPG video game. Everything was too neat and perfect, and it all tied together way to easily. However, while I make it sound above like I hated the movie, this is far from the truth. It was very entertaining, and I enjoyed following the clues right along with Cage's character. I had a good time watching the film. It just appeared to me that the script was kind of lazy, and it had potential to be much more than it was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting, but lacking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I adored Se7en. It was a portal into the world of a fascinatingly deranged psychopath, supported but wonderful character development and cinematography. Andrew Kevin Walker's work was tight, precise and thrilling. Similarly, Nicolas Cage has turned in some stunning performances over the course of his career. I was ready for this film.8mm effectively establishes a visual ambience appropriate for a movie about snuff porn. The atmosphere is dark and gritty, with plenty of freakish players. The cinematography is somewhat reminiscent of Se7en's, with an interesting urban-apocalypse style. A few elements of Schumacher's earlier work are visible in certain shots - some of the "High Gloss Grime" from the Batman films show through in places.Possibly the best thing about 8mm was the way that it handled the extremely grim topic of snuff pornography. Given the potential for extreme gross-out shots that could generate great box-office results, the treatment was quite subdued. Cage's reactions to the film were beautifully done, and gave the audience all the information they needed about the evil of the clip.Unfortunately 8mm has none of the tightness of Se7en, and certainly none of the character development. It could be argued that the film's pacing and meandering story line are intentional vehicles to help the audience get into Tom Welles' (Cage) frame of mind as he solves a difficult puzzle with few clues. Instead, this approach left me restless. The relationship between Welles and his family and its effect on his motives were never really explored. One of the real strengths of Se7en was the empathy the audience feels for Pitt and Freeman's characters, built through solid dialog and good cinematic devices. This was wholly absent from 8mm.With such a strong cast and writer, I was expecting a gripping film. Instead, 8mm was simply interesting.</fullReview>

Nicolas Cage succeeds in portraying the private detective. His search for truth is very believable. The film asks a very big question: what about the difference between moral views and practical life? What about justice? Questions worth thinking. The actuality of the film is great, we all speak about the Natalee Halloway case, and Joram still walking freely. Does this film offer a solution?

		<fullReview>The depiction of the seedy underbelly of porn was very effective. OK, maybe it was a bit over the top but you could literally smell the stink in those holes that Cage visits. The entire main story arc was very good - it moved along well and the police work that Cage did was kept realistic. I especially appreciated the fact how the digital enhancement was done accurately for once (no fine unpixellated microscopic details like in CSI). The bad guys were a bit cartoonish but Phoenix did a good job as Cage's sidekick. If they had stuck to the central plot, it would have been a very good and thoughtful suspense film. On the other hand, the entire subplot with his family was very annoying. The initially supportive and loving wife suddenly threatens to divorce Cage because her feelings are hurt when he doesn't "share" details about his job - ignoring the fact that Cage is covered with blood and they are all in danger at this point. Cage, of course, after beating a man to death, shows his sensitive side by apologizing to his wife for protecting the family.However, if you edit out all that Oprah family values nonsense in your mind, the rest of the movie is quite good and well worth watching especially the ambivalence in the Cage character as he becomes more and more like the villains he's pursuing...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this dark and disturbing film the other night. I had seen it before and wanted to revisit it. I would only recommend it for the very mature as it delves into a subject that many would not want to know even exists.Nicolas cage plays a private investigator that is sent to investigate what is reportedly a "snuff" film that was found in the safe of a wealthy individual. He creeps deeper and deeper into the porn industry. We are not talking the sweet stuff that you find in your local video store, but the stuff that is out there for those who have very weird tastes.He has Joaquin Phoenix as his guide and, after running into James Gandolfini, he ends up back in New York where he runs into Peter Stormare and Chris Bauer and Anthony Heald. This is not a place where one would want to be.Catherine Keener plays his wife, but we don't see much of her. The story is about the fact that there are people who can't be satisfied by even the most perverse stuff out there, and they pay to have even more perverse films made. Why? Because they can says Heald.It's a world you probably would rather that you didn't know exists.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not one to typically leave comments about films although I am an avid film buff. I felt compelled to write a quick comment on this film for the simple fact that many people I believe miss "the message" of the film which to me was a most important one. Like movies, such as "American History X", this movie contained a very powerful message, which if looked upon with prejudice because of something else one simply did not like about the movie, could be sorely missed. I felt that the ultimate message of the movie, other than itself introducing the audience to the world of "snuff and underworld pornography", was that sadistic rapists, murderers and other perpetrators as such can really be anyone one thinks they know...that be a neighbor, a co-worker, a mutual friend....anybody that seems normal on the surface but is actually anything but what one thinks of them. Put simply, one can never judge a book by its cover - a killer or rapist could be anyone. As with this movie, if you think it is just a movie about snuff pornography or another blockbuster with Nicholas Cage, look closer there are more important messages in movies than just what they are about. As with American History X, most people believe it to be just a movie about a race war,,,white supremacy vs. color yet if one really admires the movie they see it as a movie about "HATRED", that hatred is baggage and if one carries it too long it just may destroy them!</fullReview>

This film takes the viewer out of their comfort zone and leads them down a path into territory that is unsettling and disturbing.Cage's performance here is excellent. Joaquin Phoenix also deserves a mention as his sidekick-for-hire. In a scene where they sit down to watch supposed "snuff" films, you can really feel the characters' mixture of emotions through their acting.A tremendously entertaining film and one that is recommended to fans of tough thrillers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>8MM brought to life a story that many film makers and production companies would have turned their nose up to, probably because of the subject matter.In case you didn't know already, 8MM is the story of Tom Wells (Cage) who is a private detective hired by a wealthy widow after she finds a 'snuff' film in her dead husband's private safe. His job: find out if the film is real and if it is, identify the murdered girl. The investigative aspect of the film was very well done.The director's use of darkness and shadows from the beginning gives the film a very gritty look and places the viewer in a rather uneasy mood. The subject matter of the film makes most a bit squeamish too, so this is not for those who are easily offended or cannot tolerate graphic stories. Yet, the film is what it is and it achieves the aims of disturbing, frightening and intriguing the viewer.The performances were terrific. The old lady and her lawyer were somewhat caricatured, Cage played the transition of his character to perfection, Phoenix was also praise-worthy and most of the seedy pornography characters gave fantastic performances. Amy Morton, in particular, was excellent - but looking at her IMDb database, it appears that she does few films. Would like to see her in more roles.</fullReview>

There are a few scenes involving graphic bondage/S&amp;M porn of various sorts and a great deal of violence.

"Hardcore" is a memorable film, while "8 millimeters" is a cheapened remake.Addt'l comment : are we supposed to be lured into some "cinéma d'auteur" claim by the title, and the fact that we see movie projectors running during the film (an anachronism in itself)?

		<shortDescription>Extremely disturbing but the quality shines through</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A rancid tale taking us through the underbelly of sexual depravity shocks but undeniably educates.Nicholas Cage, in one of his better performances, is Tom Wells, a surveillance expert who usually deals in small time jobs. On being called by an elderly widow, he finds himself party to a disturbing 'snuff' video her husband left behind. Featuring a young girl apparently murdered on film, the lady assigns Wells with the task of investigating the truth behind the tape and finding out if it is real and if the girl is actually alive.Consequently Wells gets sucked into the perturbing underworld that is the kinky and extreme sex industry, and finds himself getting emotionally involved to the point of neglecting his wife and young daughter.This is a fairly traumatic story, but there is no doubt that none of the content is in any way sensationalistic or even salacious. Yes, there is sexual material on display, and journeys through S&amp;M style brothels, but unless the viewer is particularly fond of this type of practice, none of the content of this film will arouse. It will also never commit the sin of shocking for shock's own sake.Indeed, it is a harrowing story, and not for the weak of mind, and the viewer is drawn into the message it is trying to put out, particularly at the end.In terms of performances, Joaquin Phoenix in particular puts in a great turn as Max, a sex store sales assistant who ends up accompanying Wells for the greater part of his investigation, trying to help him with his 'contacts'. James Gandolfini is also in fine form as a sleazy and despicable sex film company boss who seems to know more than he's letting on.But although the acting is excellent, the story and plot is the strength here. Sure, there are a couple of moments which are genuinely a bit silly (One sequence suffers an appallingly over-wrought soundtrack making it turn into something out of hammer horror), but the overall tension and depravity really mix well to concoct a smart movie which simply dares to tell a risqué tale and succeeds.The direction is very subtle indeed, and aids the story exceptionally well without every trying to be flashy. It is simply conducive to the story and you hardly notice it.Overall a fine film, well directed, and unfortunately believable. Well, as believable as a piece of fiction could be.Pretty good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Joel Schumacher isn't exactly one of the most beloved filmmakers as far as film geeks like myself are concerned. "The Lost Boys" was a fun teen horror/comedy. "Flatliners" was a fairly entertaining supernatural chiller, but failed to disturb as much as it wanted to. "Batman Forever" was utter garbage, and quite a few others he made I don't wish to see. Still, I had heard that "8MM" was a grim, disturbing movie. Anyone I know that's seen it always felt the same way about it in that respect, whether they loved it or hated it. Well, for me, "grim" and "disturbing" are terms that prove enticing, and I finally had to see this film. I was not only not let down, but found it to be a far more grim and disturbing (and GREAT) movie than I had expected. It starts off with the feel of almost any other "detective/cop-in-over-his-head" movies that have been coming out left and right for quite some time. Nicholas Cage plays a private eye who, when away from his job, seems to be your everyman with a family. He is paid to check out whether an alleged "snuff" film was real or not, and what he discovers are not only terrifying realities around him, but also terrifying realities inside him. At the beginning, because I was used to the aforementioned types of big-budget thrillers that have become all too common even years after "8MM" (which itself is easy to accidentally lump in along with the mediocrity if you haven't seen it), I quickly began to suspect that people found this disturbing because of its snuff depictions, but, even still, from that shaky start, I was fairly interested. What I didn't know was that this hard-hitting humdinger (as much of a horrifying journey of self-discovery as a suspense thriller) would slowly begin piling up the almost unbearable heaps of tension more and more throughout the film so heavily that, by the end, all bets were off and, as much as I loved it, I couldn't wait for this spellbinding and intense movie to relax its crushing grip. I found "8MM" to be moving in ways both negative and positive, and, though its violent scenes certainly didn't shock me at all, how good and effective the movie was certainly did. Believe you me, this is not your typical "taut thriller" (as many "critics" are often paid to call mediocre movies). If this were even just up to the expectations I had, I probably would see it as too mediocre for review. But, thankfully, this was no average time-waster, as it is surprisingly an edge-of-the-seat masterpiece that I enjoyed much more than I thought I would. I would like to note furthermore that one shouldn't get the wrong idea about people into bondage when they watch this movie. Some people out there are sickos (and I'm sure that there are people all over the world and in this country who are very much like the hateful, smut-peddling killers in this film), but many bondage fans would consider this film (and the films that it is about) too negative. Regardless, this is a fine film, and is probably one of the few thrillers from the 1990s that I could honestly say I was thrilled by. If you like those dark, emotionally intense movies that touch upon the savage and base desires of the often fragile human psyche, I would seriously recommend this. It is an excellent film. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>8 MM is not a magnificent movie nevertheless it is a sick ride through the world of underground sex and a window into the worst a human mind can produce. Nicolas Cage heads the great cast with an authentic performance that helps to reflect the truly awful spectacle we are seeing before us. Cage is one of the best actors around and even if he can sometimes be guilty of over-acting that is not the case here. He makes his character feel real and only that way could 8MM be successful. Cage is Tom Welles a private detective hired by a rich old lady whose husband recently passed away. She found in his belongings an old 8MM reel where a young girl is brutally butchered by a masked man. She wishes to find out if this snuff film truly is real or if it is all a fabrication. Welles goes deeper and deeper into a brutal and bizarre world as he seeks through the lowest of the sex industry for a hint to achieve the truth. There are some things in the script that never work very well as the character of Joaquin Phoenix who despite of a wonderful job seems wasted. Both the actor and Max California his character had much more to offer 8MM. A shame. However this is truly a powerful trip not only into the worst of us but to what the world has become and what happens in the part of town we don't go to. Or maybe some of us do! It shows what life is in this day and age and how money can pervert morals and even humanity. If you're impressionable or easily shocked do not see 8MM because the fact is this movie is not a pleasant experience. It is though a worthy one. I have found that is not common for this movie to be considered anything but mediocre by most people. While it has obvious flaws I can only think that some of those opinions come from a well known hatred of Joel Schumacher and or a feeling that the movie has either gone too far or that it should be even more shocking. I honesty think the regular audience was and isn't prepared for anything more extreme than what is portrayed on 8MM. As for Schumacher I fail to see the reason for such disdain for the man.8MM is by any measure a well-made movie. If you don't feel comfortable with the issue it deals with stay away and save a displeasing two hours. But if you like to see what evil can look like give this movie a chance and I promise you wont be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Plot -- Private eye Tom Wells (Nicholas Cage) is hired to investigate what may be a snuff film, featuring a young girl who has been missing for the past seven years. As he descends into the darkest corners of the porn underworld--and the human psyche--his life and even his very soul are at stake.Critique -- All the negative reviews this film got would lead one to think that it's unredeemably bad. On the contrary; this is an uneven but sometimes compelling thriller; the hostile critical reception is due largely to the subject matter. Make no mistake, "8MM" is not for everyone--certainly not for the squeamish. The film is admittedly a bit long, and drags a bit in spots. "Seven" screenwriter Walker was unhappy with rewrites forced on his original script, which may account for the flaws found in the finished film. Nonetheless it features some genuinely unsettling scenes as Wells realizes the depths of human depravity. Photographed in dark, dreary tones, the film certainly has the right look and feel, with a palatable sense of oppression. Content notwithstanding, it's indeed a well-made film.Nicholas Cage does well as a man who is forced to cope with a side of life he's never dealt with. Peter Stormare is appropriately sleazy as a porno filmmaker, and Joaquin Phoenix offers adequate support as a wisecracking porn shop clerk. There are some graphic scenes that would have guaranteed the film an NC-17 rating had it not been backed by a major studio. Nonetheless, there are also some moving scenes as Wells struggles to find a moral center in the midst of the evil he finds himself mired in. This is a flawed motion picture, but nonetheless a better film than expected.Rating: (***) out of fourReleased by Columbia Pictures</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film a couple of years ago. It really did scare me in parts. It plays off the old urban legend of snuff films; that women are being abducted off the street and killed on film, for the enjoyment ofperverts. These perverts will pay ridiculous prices for viewing these films, hence the motivation for the "filmmakers". Of course, not a single case of this has ever happened. But that doesn't stop 8mm from exploiting this fear. This film is not for everyone. Naturally, with subject matter ofsnuff films and s&amp;m, the picture will be dark and offensive to many. Joaquin Phoenix did a great job as Cage's sidekick.</fullReview>

The mans wife and lawyer find a snuff film in his personal safe and hire Nicholas Cage to fide out if it is real and who made it. This is a great begining. It gives you, the audience, and Nicholas a mission, and for the rest of the movie everyone is on the edge of their seat trying to figure out what happened. It is like a journey really. The end is fairly shocking and sick, but amazing none the less. This is a great movie and I would recommend it to just about everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I saw this movie I was about 16 y.o. and thought I could handle films like this... After the first hour my friend who was watching it with me, left because he felt sick - and all because of the movie. I also felt sick, but managed to sit though the whole movie.The thing with 8mm, is that it isn't as grafic as, say Requiem For A Dream, but this only lets you imangine all the gory details yourself, and this really emphasizes the effect of being very disturbing. This is why I think it is so underrated - some people just NEED to be served gore and grusomeness before they are shocked.*SPOILER* The best example of this is the snuff tape itself. You see the little girl and the large man in S/M leather gear, and IMAGINE what's gonna happen to her... Then you see her cry, and the guy pulls out a machette knife.. If you don't have enough imagination to visualise what happens next, you've played to many video games.The cast is amazing, but sadly doesn't live up to its full potential.**** out of ******</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am so, so tired of S&amp;M being equated with evil. Don't get me wrong, I don't have any urge to see a snuff film. The fact that the world of S&amp;M is the backdrop for a snuff film in this movie is what disturbs me. I have a clue for Hollywood: Not all people that like to tie up or be tied up, spank or be spanked, or play dress-up are murderers. Not even most. So get over it.That being said, Joaquin Phoenix is the only bright spot in this movie. He is totally cute as the intellectual porn store clerk. Nicolas Cage is totally un-cute as the aging private detective. Catherine Keener is extraordinarily annoying as the over-questioning private detective's wife. Yet another thing I'm tired of, Hollywood; "average" women being portrayed as just plain stupid.This movie is poorly written, poorly acted, poorly directed, poorly executed and too long. I can't really recommend it to anyone.Don't waste your time. See Se7en (1995) instead - at least that has Kevin Spacey (okay, and Brad Pitt). (Or, if you need a good, more true to life S&amp;M fix, I can highly, highly recommend Secretary (2002). Spank-o's are real people too. Seriously.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Honestly! I can't believe the sheer stupidity of alot of the people who have commented on this film. It's a brilliant film, but like Blair witch, people are looking at it through the wrong viewscope. Although this film obviously does have some of the conventions of mystery and noir films, it just isn't supposed to be a genre film, it's a film in it's own merit which is what sets it apart. Now for everyone who's complaining about how dark and sick the film is, would you honestly much rather that the world of snuff films was shown in a positive happy light as though it isn't a bad thing, downplaying the whole sick world?!? You idiots! You'd be the first to shout out if that was done, saying that it was glorifying the world, you people just don't know what you want! Although the film I felt messed itself up towards the end(spoiler alert)when Cage gets caught by the makers of the films, and makes his lucky escape, the statement that the killer makes at the end by saying that he is what he is because of who he is, not because what was done to him, was done in such a way to really make a statement against the whole arguement of whether killers and weirdos are the products of themselves or of their environments. A very important issue in society, that I felt was addressed very well.The film has balls, and like the director said, too many directors wouldn't do a film like that, because they want everyone to love them, so you have to give him credit for that, even if you don't have the intestinal fortitude or intelligence to appreciate the film.Despite how well shot it was however, I still didn't like some lame attempts that were made to make the film a noir/mystery/cop film hybrid, if he'd have stayed true to the film instead of the conventions, and the acting all round was more solid, this film would have gained a 10, but as it stands, i think only an 8 is fair. It's a brilliant film though, but obviously not for the squeamish given it's content.Accept it for what it is, not what it tries to be.</fullReview>

While he took a major career slip with Bad Company, hopefully he will regain some of his former magic and stop being a hack. Anyway, I felt the performances of Peter Stormare and Joaquin Phoenix were quite good in this film, but they weighed down by the fact Nicolas Cage was over acting in most of his scenes. The dark production design also aided in the power of this film, with all of the decrepit browns and blacks filling up the screen with tension. While this isn't necessarily a tremendous film, it is certainly one worth watching, even it proves to be a hit or miss with most people.</fullReview>

Nicholas Cage, Joaquin Phoenix, and James Gandolfini give great performances. However, the REAL great performance is from Peter Stormare, who plays a pornography director. His performance really stands out here. His role is minimal, but very memorable (just like his performance in "Fargo"). You know that someone's performance is good, when they appear in the movie for a total of about 15-20 minutes, and you find yourself remembering quotes by him months later.The story doesn't drag per se at the end. Rather, it just kinda tries to do a little too much. It's almost as though Joel Schumacher was determined to make sure there were no loose ends at the end. In some cases that's good....but for some reason with the eerie undertone of this movie, and the subject matter, something tells me that a few loose ends might have actually added to this movies appeal in the end.You'll know what I'm talking about when you see it.Need to see more Peter Stormare in the future.

		<fullReview>I settled down to watch this film, knowing little about it. Nick Cage was teh main reason I guess. I was immediately attracted to the dvd as I saw it, I have no idea why but I always can tell wether a movie will be good or not. Theres nothing more frustrating then picking a mediocre film to watch and wasting two hours of your life, as the after effect is depressing as hell. Having read about the nature of the film on the back cover of the dvd case I decided to settle down at midnight on my heavenly comfortable couch to watch it. Little did I know that on this rainy cold december night I was in for a gripping two hour ride. Like all good films, this movie grabs you by the scruff of the neck and drags you at its own pace, not allowing you to settleat all. You are thrust straight into action as Nick's character (private investigator) takes on a case that will chane his life forever. The dark and sadistic music adds to the great feel tot eh movie. Joel Schumacher whom I hadn't heard of before this film has done a great job allowing us an insight into a dark and evil side of hollywood, where many youngsters dissappear or perish in search for their dreams. In most cases their end is not graceful to say the least. First time I had the chance to see Joaquin Phoenix and he too stood out in the film, although his role isn't a major one in the film he has a presence on screen, which was an indication at the time for me that he will go on to do better things. Proved right I was as since then he has become hot property in Hollywood. My admiration for Nick Cage was increaed after watching this film. I believe he is one of the best actors of his generation, and the fact that he agreed to do this controversial film means he is diverse and willing to push himself alot further than others. He is the main attraction in the film, and it is his great acting that allows the viewer to delve deeper with his character into the world of pornography. I finished watching it around 2 in the morning. As the end credits began to roll slowly up the screen the distinctive and rythmic arabic music began, how appropriate it was too. I just remember distinctly, feeling elated emotionally. Nick's character goes through hell emotionally, physically and mentally leaving him exhausted. Thats exactly how I felt. You feel the tension in the film, you feel scared in the film, you feel frustrated as events unfold because they aren't what you expected. Schumacher breaks alot of essential "movie rules" I read about that directors have in Hollywood. Certain things that the audiences detest in films, good has to prevail in some sense is one example. Now even though I felt he broke alot of these rules I admired the way he added an ironic good always prevails touch. Injustice and evil is present in our world, but so is hope and Justice. Scumacher acknowledges evil and makes a statement not that good always prevails but merely that it does eventually. This film is about true evil, redemption,sacrafice,greed,injustice,suffering,pride and most of all "real life". I recomend it.</fullReview>

I can't think of the right words to tell you just how bad this movie was! Needless to say, I did not enjoy it. I can't say this movie grossed me out or made me sick, but I was surprised at how much nudity there was in this flick. There is not much to enjoy about this movie. Joquin Phoenix gave a great performance as did Nic Cage to a lesser degree. He seems to have the same mood in almost all of his movies as of late (excluding Family Man). All in all, this movie has no rewarding value, the climax sucks, so does most of the rising action. So, if you want to spend a couple of bucks to completely and utterly waste a perfectly good 2 hours, I wouldn't even reccommend you do so on this flick. Waste it on a flick for your kids that will at least make someone feel good. Try a Bug's Life!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hardly Cage's Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An interesting premise that became predictable and boring. The only reason I bothered to see it through to the end was the thought that if I had already wasted an hour and a half, it would not hurt to waste another half hour to find out what the killer looked like. I didn't buy into the whole psychological drama aspect of this film. Cage does not pull off (or the script does not allow him to) the whole "the devil changes you" philosophy. I think the film tries to accomplish too much and fails instead of just trying to succeed in one aspect. It tried to be a suspense film, mystery film, crime film, porn film, and psycho-drama all at once, which was simply too much for it to accomplish. Some of the script/directorial choices -- depicting the husband/wide relationship for example -- just seemed to take away from the film and distract from what could have been a decent point. Joaquin Phoenix was clearly the highlight of this film. The rest - acting, storyline, etc. was mediocre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nicolas Cage's slow (and I mean, really, really slow) descent into hell in Eight Millimeter is mind-numbing. About 45 minutes into the movie when I realized it was beginning to suck, I looked at my watch and was mystified to see there was another hour and a half to go. I was really rooting for this movie to succeed, as I greatly enjoyed Seven, and both were written by Andrew Kevin Walker. But for whatever reason, the tight structure and mood of the previous film are gone here. I'm partial to blame Schumacher, after he made A Time To Kill with glistening actors and turned Batman into a $120 million joke. A real fault in the movie, in my view, is lack of a truly great screen villain. Peter Stormare is the only one to come close, but his limited screen time is wasted. "We did it for the money," as a motivation is really tired. As for the hyped shocking scenes of this movie, if you consider a hefty man in a leather mask shocking, well, you're in for a treat. Otherwise, the events of Seven were far more stunning than anything in this film. The message the film delivers is beaten into your brain for two and a quarter hours. I think you'd be better off with Seven instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While this film has many good scenes, overall they don't work together as an overall movie. At first, the sleuthing is interesting and well-done. But once Joaquin Phoenix character is no longer part of the action, the film loses steam, and goes on and on after the solution has been reached. What is meant to be "shocking" is outright boring. The film doesn't even come close to being as disturbing as so many others out there. Not recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"8 mm" is one of those movies that you won't easily forget because of it's violent, dark nature of it's content and because it makes you think if it's possible that these kind of events happen in real life.Please do not think about this movie as the typical cop/detective flick with violent tones. "8 mm" is more than that; it's a moving experience in all the negative sense of the word. Let me explain myself...The events of this movie will make you feel angst, anger, and even fear due to the nastiness of the mafia surrounding the main plot.The Director digs on the snuff film plot but the main focus on the movie is all about the mafias that control a not very well known market of violence and torture.Also, "8 mm" succeeds on the Criminology aspects because it has to do with private investigation, judicial searching, and black markets. The ending has a great impact on the audience because it's filled with violence, sadness, and pity. You get to understand the nature of the evil of the villains.Please give this movie a chance and you won't regret; it's truly one of the most dark but powerful movies of the past twenty years. Seriously underrated. Be sure to get this feature that perfectly mixes action, thriller, and even horror.Special mention for Joaquin Phoenix for his portray as Max California. An impressive performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good movie in some ways, a bad one in others.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie began quite well. OK, it was nothing too impressive but it seemed to be a good thriller and mystery movie, focusing on the underground really heavy hardcore porn industry. The movie however loses much of its credibility in parts, especially toward the ending of it.In the end the movie even manages to change into a revenge flick, which is highly in contrast with the rest of the picture. The rest of the movie mostly picks a realistic approach of things. It provides the viewer a look into the dark world of underground porn and whether it's a realistic authentic view of it or not, the way its shown in the movie works out effectively, mostly because the movie doesn't hold back as much as most other Hollywood movies regarding this subject will do. The ending just doesn't really work out convincing because it raises the question about the Nicolas Cage character; Why does he get personally involved with the case so much? There are several hints given throughout the movie that from the moment you'll enter they world of underground porn it will change you slowly. But there's a difference between saying this several times throughout the movie (mostly by the Joaquin Phoenix character) and actually showing how it affects someone. The movie really doesn't handle this well since it simply doesn't really show any of this. It's just so highly unbelievable all. Elements like this once more show that Joel Schumacher is no more than a very average director, though he still of course made some good movies as well.A shame all, since in the beginning of the movie when all the detective work got done, this seemed to be a pretty decent movie with potential. It's not like the movie is no a total bad one to watch but it's just that the movie could had been a lot better.Unfortunately the whole way the story is build up and being told is also quite predictable. At least to me this movie offered very little surprises in its storytelling and 'plot-twists'.The movie has a surprising good cast. Nicolas Cage, Joaquin Phoenix, James Gandolfini, Peter Stormare and Anthony Heald are all big names in the business and they all appear in this movie. Definitely true that the presence of these people also helps to make this a better movie to watch than it would had been without them in it.Oh well, it still is a decent enough movie to watch, at least if your expectations aren't too high.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A humorous but heartfelt review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cripes, you would have thought James Gandolfini, Nicholas Cage and Joaquin Phoenix would have been able to save this overused and hammed up to the max plot. I only watched it because its hard to find a certificate 18 any more and what started off pretty promising turned to cheese - what I hoped was going to be an even more twisted re-hash of Cronenburg's 1983 classic 'Videodrome' ended up being as disturbing as your average TV gardening program.The scene was set well for a nonchalant and aloof private investigator Tom Welles (Cage) who is asked by a wealthy widow to investigate an 8mm snuff movie found in her dead husband's safe. This sets Cage off on a trail around the US to identify the young female victim, which eventually leads him through the porn industry underworld to the killers. Guided by the intelligent waster Max California (Pheonix), they hunt down all manner of filth trying to find clues in the seedy videos on the black market. Classic detective work leads to the runaway girl's suitcase and inside a number for porn producer Eddie Poole (Gandolfini) and the plot unravels to reveal the horrible truth behind the video. However, being constantly made aware of sanctity of life through the strained telephone conversations with his wife Amy (Catherine Keener) and his own baby daughter, Welles is faced with the age-old moral issues with vengeance and retribution.The film seeks to provide an insight into the workings of the black market for extreme pornography, but it comes across as a bad film made from a mediocre book and gives the impression that the hardest pornography the writer and producers have seen is Powdered Hussies in Kinky Bouncy Castle III. The scenes, though well shot and well acted, suffer from overkill and sets are overdone, making you feel like you are entering a comic book world rather than the real underworld. A witty and well-written script suits actors like Phoenix, but you can predict what all the other characters are about to say with the same worn out lines we have heard in the other ten zillion Hollywood Sunday hangover Blockbusters. The music almost absent at first, really begins to let the film down from about a third of the way in, eventually gaining a cheesy Lord of The Rings style crescendo that is so far removed from what is happening on the screen that you keep checking behind the seat for your Gran with a boom box.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Could Have Been</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This story of a pussy whipped private detective's descent into the writer's contrived hell has some redeeming qualities, but is dragged down by klunky dialog and overbearing moralism.The problem is that the concept has great potential for conflict, sleaze, good and evil. However, the writer and director seem to be afraid to trust the audience to just get it. As a result, too much of Nicholas Cage's acting is way over the top. His ducking and flinching and wiping his brow when watching what could be a snuff reel, is not only hugely overacted, but also patronizes the audience. Then, there's the dialog. As the irredeemable punk, complete with horn hiding hairdo, Max California (Joaquin Phoenix) says to Tom Welles: "When you dance with the devil, the devil doesn't change. The devil changes you." Wow. Timeless words of wisdom couched in marble prose, indeed. Or as Tom Welles replies: "Is that one of your lyrics?".The only scene that has some real acting involved, is the one between Welles and the mother Janet Matthews (Amy Morton). Anyway, just for it's subject matter, it's worth seeing at least once.</fullReview>

The movie (by which I mean the first hour or so, because I haven't seen the rest) was very tense and very graphic (which caused me to zap away more than once, take a deep breath, than zap back again) The point is that I still RETURNED to watching this movie, because it had me sitting on the edge of my chair the whole time. A must-see if you have a strong stomach and good nerves. Don't watch this if you are not good with violence (like 13-year-old me) or find the many nauseating sexual scenes disturbing (me again).

		<fullReview>A truly superb movie, Joel Schumacher pulls off his best movie yet, and all though not critically acclaimed, this movie deserved far better appreciation than it attained.The cast is excellent, the plot is intriguing and extremely dark, and the direction is perfect.Cage undertakes the role of a private investigator, on a quest to find a girl who he believes to be a victim of a sick underground porn world, and he is plunged (with help from Phoenix) deeper into the depths of the of this world than he could possibly have believed existed.The movie does show us how dark and disturbing some walks of life are, but it also very successfully shows us that there are some people who can be selfless and compassionate in the pursuit of the truth.As Cage's character develops, you begin to realise that he genuinely cares for about the state of the world around him, and you watch as he does all he can to improve it, while others simply go with the flow. I found the evolution of Cage's character refreshing and thankfully Cage's finest performance ever was in this role. His character is the only thing in this movie that provides us with some light in the darkness, and had Cage failed in his portrayal of this character, the film, for me would have been average at best, despite excellent support from the rest of the cast.Well Done Nicholas9/10 for the Film 10/10 For Cage</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Disturbing images; but empty of substance. Promising gritty realism, this film delivers visually, but fails colossally to achieve any plot points. The audience is submerged into a dark detestable world, but this world ultimately becomes simply another angle on the traditional horror formula. But worse: IT NEVER TRIES TO DELVE INTO ITS VILLAINS. SPOILER- Why do these guys do those things? Cuz they're BAD. Literally no time is spent developing the bad guys; they're just scum. I'm not saying I wanted to care about them, but how about casting some light on these important (pseudo)characters? Even remotely?I expected more. "Silence of the Lambs," "Seven": these movies bring you into the minds of monsters. That's why they're important and unforgettable.8mm had the potential to mimic true horror but wasted it by going the easy route of manipulative shock-value drama. What a disappointment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A non-audacious "Seven"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw in the credits Joel Schumacher's name I almost turned of the streaming, but decided to just lower my expectations instead. As the movie unraveled, I was surprised by what appeared to be a tight script and what was honestly a serious attempt from the director to invest in character development. Knowing, however, that this was a Hollywood mainstream movie directed by that guy in particular, I could be sure that the story wouldn't work out and ring true in the end. There is no way this movie go into such a dark direction and then stick to it. I wasn't surprised when I read in the trivia that the writer had a fallout with the director and the studio over changes. You can tell exactly what the scriptwriter wanted, and what changes were unacceptable to him. It doesn't have to do with the mystery itself, nor with the actions of the main characters. I wouldn't be giving away much by saying that the Nicholas Cage's character arc just cannot fit with the mood in the end. Suffice to day that Walker is also the writer of "Seven". If you compare both screenplays, it is kind of clear what he wanted for this one.It is still enjoyable for the most part. The investigation itself is nicely developed, the secondary characters are interesting, the director does give room for character development and the glimpses of shady movies we see are just enough to bring up the mood of a descent into darkness without making 8MM itself exploitative. We have to see something, of course, but not too much. The solution of the mystery is not unexpected nor annoyingly predictable: it feels right given what we saw before. However, the focus is always on the inner path of the main character and, frankly, there is no way Schumacher in a big budget movie can give the audience an arc that follows its logical conclusion.(As usual, I do not to give stars - they just seem unhelpful)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>the film revolves around 'snuff' (something disturbing, although we can download or see it on the news every night) but creates its 'dark and disturbing' atmosphere by trapsing us something neutral, the same tired Hollywood characterizations of fetishistic sex as 'underworld' and 'sleazy' that we've seen since the first days of film noir. S&amp;M is dark?! Actresses are poor drug addicts? Been in a porno shop lately? You'll see lots of rich happy couples renting gross movies in there; the 'dark ambiance' is not, as previously posted 'beyond human imagination' but is actually rather banal. Hollywood - home of the hooker - continues to produce movies where criminals and horrible characters are the pillars of what's actually a relatively clean cut multi-billion-dollar- a-year industry.That said (by way of a compliment) the conflict in nicholas cage's character - although its clear what it is supposed to be - is not credible. Why would he go out of his way (as a private investigator) to engage in armed conflict anybody? Watching that 8mm film over and over again would only do to him what it does to us - desensitize him completely. Maybe if there was a more pronounced problem within Welles's own family, or if he'd had an affair with the victims mother, Cage could offer us something more than his usual overcome-and- bewildered schtick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strange</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A strictly taboo topic rarely covered in films, 8mm touched on the very dark recesses of human nature. Schumacher did well to handle such a unpleasant topic, keeping the violence to a minimum. The haunting, almost bhangra score, a well timed performance by Joaquin Phoenix, and the seedy appearance of James Gandolfini add to the film. However there are two aspects of the film which badly let it down. Firstly Nic Cage as the lead, not bad but certainly not thought provoking enough. For those who have seen the film imagine a Morgan Freeman or Gary Sinise in the lead. The second and major downfall is the last third of the film. We are introduced to Peter Storemare's ludicrous director, the obvious "the lawyer was in on it" plot and a typical Hollywood ending. For a film not really aimed at your average cinema goer, the ending seems to want to please the masses and therefore gives the film an uneven finish. Unlike Seven (writer Andrew Kevin Walker wrote both) 8mm wanted everything to finish with the "bad guys are dead everythings going to work out routine" when really the gritty film needed a gritty ending.</fullReview>

A thriller about underground porno is right up my sleaze alley. I knew that a mainstream flick starring Nicolas Cage wasn't going to be too harsh but I was ready to see what the filmmakers had up their sleeve.Joaquin Phoenix tells Nicolas Cage, "There are things you're going to see that you can't unsee". After "8MM" was over, I knew exactly what he meant. Why can't I get this lameness out of my head? The pain! The torture! "8MM" is a wannabe shock movie. Unfortunately every step down the staircase to Porno Hell is lame and laughable. Every character is a cartoon figure. Nothing resides in any remote semblance of reality. I thought I was going to get the guided tour of Sicko-Porno land. Instead I got the Hollywood super shine, glossy version. Bleech.The spike through this movie's heart is the evil character known as "The Machine". Cage has tracked down the Machine and dukes it out with him. The Machine decides to take this opportunity to give a long speech to Cage in order to protest the stereotyping of wackos in leather masks. This one scene exposes the filmmakers as complete frauds. No way, no how, would a depraved lunatic take a break from his beating to give a monologue on his evil ways. "8MM" is a waste of time. It was made by fools who have absolutely no idea what they are talking about. 3/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>8mm showed unlimited amounts of promise- a script penned by the writer of Se7en and Sleepy Hollow, a well-balanced cast of newcomers (Joaquin Phoenix) and established actors (Nicolas Cage, James Gandolfini) and a controversial subject matter. What we ended up with was a pompous, self-righteous semi-thriller which seemed to deliberately shock and shamelessly imitate thrillers such as Se7en and The Silence of the Lambs. However, 8mm is nowhere near as accomplished as those films.First of all, the once suitable ending was completely changed to suit Hollywood's hero-loving standards. **SPOILER** In the original script, Tom (Cage) committed suicide by driving head-on into a wall. That seems more of a suitable ending than his mumbling nonchalance and the shedding of an occasional tear. The cinematography is very difficult to watch- the lighting is far too low-key, even if this is intentional to fit in with the 'shocking' subject matter. The soundtrack often overrides the dialogue, which isn't that hard considering that Nicolas Cage is only coherent for about 30% of the film.Joel Schumacer's directing is far too heavy handed, so much so that you can practically hear the grunts of exertion. His direction lacks finesse, style, or any sense of tact, and this shows painfully in 8mm. The pornography is overly explicit, tasteless, and the characters within the trade (Max California excluded) are nothing more than exaggerated caricatures. The characters are boring (again, Max excluded- it seems that Phoenix carries the entire film on his shoulders, and is horribly underused), and we feel absolutely no sympathy for them. The only sympathy we feel is for the people that paid good money to watch this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>8mm has great first act. Not to mention the premise. It's dark, gritty, uncomfortable and the subject matter, if nothing else, is relatively fresh. I couldn't imagine a topic harder than snuff films to make a mainstream movie for the masses about from Hollywood starring Nicholas Cage no less. Unfortunately any heaped upon praise gets taken away by a very disappointing third act. The kind that sink good films. Nevertheless before that point, my interest was peaked, the film looked and felt solid. It's too bad because initially there is some nicely done foreboding atmosphere that can only come from such creepy subject matter. The kind that draws those slimy dark undertones out from our brains, makes us feel uneasy, make us feel sick, scared, makes us wanna turn away or run.Nic Cage as the PI charged with finding out the origins and legitimacy of a supposed snuff film is how the film opens. He surprisingly fares pretty well. You wouldn't think so, you'd think he's been miscast, but he does well in material outside his norm. He oddly feels right here as our moral compass, but for all of the dreary stage setup, Cage's effort, and a nice supporting turn from Joaquin Phoenix, again, the latter part of the movie is a complete and utter washout. I can't elaborate other than to say the movie looses it's point and veers way off course with no way back. You feel it the moment it happens. It shows us the heart of darkness and then it plunges right into it with no regard for anything else in a very contrived way.There's some real promise in 8mm. A dark piece of material done similarly before but updated for today's light. It could have been memorable in the same canon of how Se7en gripped and shook audiences, but it falters under the Hollywood system of making movies. There's some great pieces here, but when the puzzle is put together, it feels forced and not in the realm of a plausible reality anymore. Through to the end, 8mm never fails to shock, that doesn't leave it from being a dark, mainstream disappointment.</fullReview>

The story keeps up the interest until near the end when a moralising tone spoils it somewhat. Cage is great and carries the movie a great deal as he is virtually on screen the whole time. James Gandolfini and Joaquin ' The Actor Formerly Known As Leaf' Phoenix provide sound support. This one might make it as a cult movie in a few years from now.

		<shortDescription>Good first half... (includes spoilers for the movie)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really liked the movie first of all... at last, I liked the first hour of it. The cinematography was excellent, the darkness and all that grey and black remembered me a lot of writer Andrew Kevin Walker`s other well-known work, "Seven". It just didn't rain as much as in "Seven". Nicholas Cage` search for the truth and the emotional change he goes through were very interesting to watch, thrilling. His scenes with the murdered girl`s mother were the best of the whole movie. The performance of Amy Morton as Jane Matthews especially stood out here. The movie gets very good the moment Cage's character, PI Tom Welles, teams up with Max California (Joaquin Phoenix), a clerk in a porn shop, Welles pays for helping him finding information in the s/m scene and the porn industry, a world completly alien to Welles himself.The two characters have a certain, very interesting way of dealing with each other, especially because Max turns out to be a totally different kind of person to what everyone would expect him to be at first. Max California turns out to even have a certain kind of innocence around him, something Welles has already lacked right from the beginning of the movie. But if you know at least a few Hollywood-made movies, it`s nearly needles to say that in a world supposed to be as bad as the one we see in "8mm", innocence can't survive. No surprise here, when still innocent and nice Max gets brutally murdered (while standing in front of a cross! Don't you dare to miss the deeper meaning here!) after half of the movie, just so Tom Welles can fulfill his descent into darkness. Oh please!At that moment, "8mm" turns into being just totally stupid. The first half of the movie, when everything was mostly about Welles, searching for the truth and Max helping him and both of them moving more and more into the darkness that is the porn industry in the eyes of He-who-killed-off-the-Batman-movies Joel Schumacher, everything was fine and very dark in a still fascinating way. That is, because we didn't have to see too much of the ridiculously stereotype bad guys who are supposed to give the darkness a real face. Here we have a movie, that COULD have been really scary if the bad guys would have been very normal and everyday guys. Instead, what see here are a bunch of bad guys who are that bad it wouldn't have made a difference if they'd have "We are evil" signs over their heads. And Super-Bad Guy "Machine" turns out to look like your friendly, four-eyed, living-with-his-mother kind of neighbour. Gasp! Wow, that's something totally new. I haven't actually seen that in a dozend other and better movies before and was therefore of course expecting Machine to have little horns and a tail. Oh please, again!What really made me frown was the end of the movie. I could accept somehow that Welles brutally killed off one of the bad guys and then burned the evidence of what he did. I could also accept him to go after Machine because it was just the natural thing to do for a hero in a Hollywood-movie. What I CAN`T accept about the end of the movie is, that Welles kills Machine in front of the man's house and then is able to just walk away without ANYONE asking any questions, without the murder on Machine or any other of the bad guys ever leading back to Welles. And it's not as if there wasn't any evidence. And what the hell happened to Max? Did Welles just leave him there in front of the cross, with his throat cut? Or did he actually call anyone to give his friend a decent burial?And then there's also the thing with the "disturbing pictures" a lot of people mentioned in their comments. I can't say that I'm good in watching "dark" movies. They usually make me feel very uneasy and most of the time I have to close my eyes if there's too much blood involved. But no uneasiness here. All I could think all through the movie was, that Joel Schumacher was just using those pictures of death and nakedness (Gasp! Naked people. Please AGAIN!! We see "worse" than that in usual german TV at 10 pm). Most of the time they didn't seem to be a real part of the movie like in Seven, they were very often just meant to make people think "Oh god. Look how sick some people are." and to explain why Welles more and more turns into the dark and brooding hero who at last commits murders, too, at the end. And so I was grinning about those supposed-to-be disturbing pictures. I don't think that's what Schumacher intended.So what I think is: Good performance by Nicholas Cage, especially when fighting over if or if not to tell the mother of the murdered girl about what happened to her daughter. Good performance by Joaquin Pheonix. The character of Max could have turned out to be very dull, too, with the wrong actor. Thankfully, they had Pheonix. VERY good performance by Amy Morton. Good cinematography at the beginning of the movie. Ignore the bad guys and turn off the movie the moment Max dies, to spare yourself a few ridiculous fight and death scenes and some actions by the hero that just makes you think a big "Huh??". Then go and rent the spanish movie "Tesis" (english title: "Thesis") which deals with the subject of snuff movies, too, but unlike "8mm" actually IS disturbing and makes you think a lot about what people are capable of.</fullReview>

Not because it shocked me, although it can get pretty disgusting sometimes (that's not a problem, i have a hard stomach), but because the way I see it that's the only thing the director tried to do with the film... shock people. When you're "shocked" once or twice in a movie that can be good, i like it; when the director tries to do this almost ALL the time things get boring, uninteresting and incredibly exaggerated. There's a long list of things about this movie that I find ridiculous, but I won't waste my time writing them down.

		<shortDescription>A descent into a world of violent porn.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The creators of this movie have really done a great job delving the deepest recesses of extreme entertainment. The past thirty or forty years have seen one taboo after another fall, and one line after another crossed in a variety of entertainment media: TV, books, films etc. The mainstreaming of violence and sexuality seems to have pushed what is considered extreme continually farther out. But how far can you go to shock and titilate once that's happened? This movie tries to answer that question. Actually it seems to be a virtual remake of "Hardcore" with George C. Scott made in the seventies, which had a simlar theme. Nicholas Cage's descent into a hell of violent pornography brings him into contact with one grotesque individual after another. The movie can't really resolve the situation that it puts Nicholas Cage's character into, in a way he has to destroy his humanity in order to save it, using brutality and violence in order to prevent it, or to avenge it. The movie excels at creating an eerie ambience, and what's scares is the idea that this is all too possible and real; unlike supernatural evil. The end goes on way too long and is a bit too clean, but the descent is really what this movie is about anyway, and the reason to see it, with caution.</fullReview>

Well, the bad news is that I have seen some amateur children's 8mm films that are better than this piece of junk. The movie goes nowhere! At one point, I was tempted to shoot my 32 mm into the projector so I could be spared. I hope Nic goes back and does more movies that could really display his acting skills and does not get caged up into being an action hero. These and maybe another 8 unmentioned reasons are why you should not see "8MM." ** Needs Improvement</fullReview>

I finished it this morning and immediately came here on IMDB.COM to see the comments.One comment disturbed me so much that I have to comment: One comment (didn't notice who) said that they couldn't understand why Tom Welles (Nicolas Cage) got so emotionally involved. Well, let me ask whoever asked that a question: If he didn't who would??? The police sure as hell is not going to lift a finger on a 6 year-old case. Welles is just giving revenge for someone who can't. I mean, do you actually want people like that walking the streets??Welles and the mother weren't the only 2 people who cared for Mary Anne. How about the old lady?For people who said that this movie is NOT disturbing, I can't believe you! You probably laugh at the "Faces of Death" videos (which I have NO intention on seeing thank you very much). Anyway, this movie is good for 1 view only for me. I hate sad flicks. Life is disturbing enough!SPOILER ****** SPOILER ****** SPOILER ****** SPOILER ******When I was watching the movie, I was kind of hoping that the wife wasn't there. Then Welles could have started a new life with Mary Anne's mother....just a thought. What do you think?</fullReview>

I liked the idea a lot and it seemed really interesting and creepy and underground and sleazy and all of that good stuff. But while the premise was great, the execution was excruciating. His relationship with his wife got tired after 5 minutes, his detective work was bizarre and very very lucky (he finds the girl's picture after - ONE day of looking? Who knows, we are not given any kind of time frame. He finds the diary in the toilet... what, the mother NEVER looked in the toilet tank for 6 years??? Did this toilet never run?) and his vengeance seemed misplaced. Why does he care so much? He wants to rid the world of all evil? I don't know... it was hard to follow, annoying... and the soundtrack!

		<fullReview>Nothing too impressive here. Schumacher's attempt at his own version of SEVEN feels staged and lifeless. Writer Andrew Walker tried to distance himself from this project (after his script was presumably toyed with too much) and rightfully so. Aside from a couple of intense scenes with Peter Stormare, the film never comes to life. The story isn't engaging (note to future filmmakers: quit trying to shock us into interest), and the investigation borders on laughable if not just plain boring. By the time Cage's character goes into his vigilante mode, you're supposed to identify, craving revenge on the ruthless bad guys. But by that point you really don't care what the hell happens to any of these characters.The hit-or-miss Cage evidently wanted to intensify his character's arc by playing the first half with a wide-eyed naivete. The plan backfires, and his effort comes across simply as poor acting. All in all, pretty lame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Somewhat predictable, vindicated here and there</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Plotwise, there's nothing terribly new in 8mm. The premise is strongly reminiscent of a Lawrence Block Matthew Scudder novel, though 8mm winds its own way eventually. No essential plot point is new to movie-goers, but the unoriginality isn't that blatant. In fact, the film can catch you up, especially as we see Welles (Cage) going through the legwork that used to be the staple of fictional detectives but which is now all but gone from cinema dicks.Phoenix, as Max, is the high point. He has the most room to maneuver as a character, as well as the best lines. While Welles is purposefully rigid (and thus prone to breakage), and the rest of the characters are generally vile, Max is someone we'd probably like to know and have coffee with.The pornographers are caricatures. Pure evil incarnate, almost ready for their supervillain costumes to be tailored, seemingly out of place outside, oh, Strange Days or perhaps The Fifth Element. This reflects story choice: rather than present us with a thoughtful piece exploring the banality of evil, we are given a morality tale where the bad guys wear black and the only gray areas have to do with the contradictions inherent in vigilantism. Some "moment of decision" scenes are compelling, but ultimately shallow if you pause to ponder the possibilities that might have been pursued. You could say 8mm's moral (and artistry) is the diametric opposite of Dead Man Walking's.The action is thankfully modest in scale. No Jerry Bruckheimer exploding subway cars or lethal germ warfare cannisters. Just guns and fists and knives and shivs--primitive and appropriate to the film's milieu.The establishment of Welles as an upright, decent fellow is overdone and unimaginative: broken-record scenes of him calling his beautiful wife at his suburban home, discussing their infant daughter (whose nickname is Cinderella), swearing his devotion, promising to call again. While we may need to see Welles as upstanding, this particular device is done to death.Other plot elements strike a sour note, but exploring them here would require spoilers. In all, some important themes and questions are raised, but unsubtly, as one would raise a banner or flag. There is no deft touch thematically. The trailers broadcast the moral of this movie's story: "You dance with the devil, devil don't change. Devil changes you." There's little surprise in the lesson we are to take away. (And the biggest surprise is given away by the cast list, for those on their toes.)One can picture Nicolas Cage accepting this role, imagining that it would make a statement about the violent and dehumanizing effects of pornography. The irony is in the limited and tame content of that statement. The film makes the case that snuff films and S&amp;M porn are bad for us; it seems oblivious to (or afraid of) the extensions of that argument--that ANY porn might be just as bad for us, that violent Nicolas Cage movies about porn being bad for us might THEMSELVES be bad for us. That would be provocative.Finally, it hardly seems just that this film (and Seven before it) received an R rating, while a comedy about the porn industry, Orgazmo, faced a possible NC-17. This latter film's nudity was restricted to male buttocks, contained nary a drop of blood, and its violence was all spoof.</fullReview>

And that made me sad especially considering his towering performances in Face/Off and Leaving Las Vegas. I don't really know who or what ruined this movie. The story is good, in a really bad way, so I don't think that it's Walker's fault. As for the actors they just do what they're told and that leaves me with the director. Joel Schumacher ruined the Batman series and now he ruined a good story. Up until this movie he alone could get me to buy a ticket but that time has passed.

I don't know what people think are intense about a film which has 20% of time in a room searching papers about a missing girl and another 20% with Cage and the girl's mom talking in an unbelievably boring tone and pace. This movie was hyped up as a thrill ride, it was not. It is a murder/mystery, but of course you have no idea if the girl was actually murdered or not till the end. Joaquin Phoenix was pretty decent in this as the porn pro. There is no interesting points in this movie, that is, I don't find snuff films interesting, but hey that's just me. This movie, because of its writer is compared to "Se7en," a really good film, but "8mm" has no surprise ending, which is what I expected and the soundtrack to this film, the background music and score, made me want to throw up. Thankfully, Cage will be in an upcoming movie with Scorsese, that should be a winner.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After hits such as Face/Off and Con Air, Nicolas Cage stars in one of the worst films this year along with John Travolta's A Civil Action. 8mm is so awful it doesn't even deserve to be rentable. The plot has Cage portraying a private investigator named Tom Welles, who becomes involved in a missing persons case. This missing persons case leads Welles into the pornography underworld. There are only a few scenes in this film that make it not a total waste of money. They include scenes of mystery and those that make you wonder what is going on, and with his family. Nicolas Cage is a very smart and brilliant action star; however, he must have let it slip his mind to go over the script with a magnifying glass. Instead of 8mm, watch more enjoyable movies such as Snake Eyes, Con Air, and Face/Off.</fullReview>

What he finds is the most shocking and disturbing thing he has ever seen, and his life is forever changed. It depicts a teenage girl being brutally murdered by a bondage-clad weirdo, and he sets out to find if the film is real. And he is plunged into the seedy world of snuff films, and what he finds can end up costing him everything, including his life."8MM" is written by Andrew Kevin Walker, who's previous work was the equally shocking "Seven. You can see the similarities between the two movies. They expose the dark side of human nature and show it in a way that is accessible to everybody. And that is the scariest part. The graphic murders in "8MM" are shocking enough, but the characters you meet later on in the movie are even more shocking and bizarre. You are repelled by the movie in one way, but drawn into into it in another way. "8MM" is not as good as "Seven", but it is not without interest.Interest doesn't always equal quality. The idea behind the movie is good, but the script is poorly written. Nicholas Cage has given some great performances in the past and present, but this is not among his best.

		<fullReview>How can you make a movie about Snuff film and the pornographic underworld and yet be able to make it so uninteresting and boring ? Well our friend Joel Schumaker just managed that. But what else can you expect from the maker of Batman and Robin? Over one hour of this film is about how the detective is trying to find the people who made the snuff film.I'm watching this and I'm thinking, that the director must really think he is telling something really interesting: how Nicolas Cages character is investigating. Then the films goes all nuts with so much honey covered-sugar-sentimentality that it makes you want to puke. Dialogs as Tell me how much you love your girl, so i can kill the men who did this to her? Or how about when Cage comes crying home saying "Save me!" or the dozen telephone calls he makes to his wife only to say that "Honey, I love you and I miss you soooo much".The original script by Andrew Kevin Walker was about how a man who is investigating a snuff film,. wanting to find out how people can do this kind of horrible things in our world, but ends up doing the same violent things to those same men, only his motives are not perverted but that of an avenger. This film however suffers the worst case of anti-climax i have ever seen.If Schumaker had made bambi, bambi's mother would still be alive. Everything in this film is too warped up and tied together that it is sickening. If you were looking for a film like Seven then forget it, this is not it. Want to see a film about movie violence, snuff-films and how it effects our society ? Wach "Tesis" instead, it's shocking, thought provoking and entertaining suspense film. Come to think of it, it's everything that 8mm is NOT.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this would be a breakthrough movie for Nicolas Cage, the kind of movie that would put him in demand in Hollywood. I was wrong, this movie was too long for its content. It may have been a good 90 minute movie but it was, at best, a mediocre 2 hour movie. The story and plot duration seemed to drag on for years, even though the duration of the story was to have taken place in a couple weeks. The music that was chosen to accompany many scenes was very distracting, it was a cross between "alternative" and "snake charming music".Cage is a private detective in the movie with a wife and child. He phones his wife almost every day while on assignment. The phone calls become very painful to watch. The wife complains the whole time that Cage is gone too long or she whines about his job. It's almost as if she doesn't know he is a private detective. The first scene of the movie has no place in the movie it is a complete waste of film. Cage also has a chance to wrap everything up in a warehouse scene but runs away and drags the story ending with him. I found myself listening to the conversations that were taking place in the theatre, rather than watching all of the movie. I would not recommend this movie, wait for the video if you must see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was promoted as being an intense thriller, but it's not. As a matter of fact, the film is way too slow to allow itself to be intense. Cage plays a boring private detective who stumbles onto a strange case involving what appears to be a murder on film. As he begins to investigate the validity of the film, he finds himself getting deeper and deeper into the world of underground porn. This film has an interesting premise, but just doesn't seem to build on it the way you would expect. The pacing is erratic, and Schumacher relies too much on shock value, and not enough on storytelling. This is however the same man who gave us the fourth, and by far the worst of the Batman films. I also expected more from the writer of Seven. Cage should stick to action, and Schumacher should just stop directing for a while and learn how to light a film. With the exception of an effectively creepy performance by Peter Stormare, there's just not much reason to see this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As you probably already know, 8MM is a film that deals with the shocking and disturbing reality of a VERY hard-core pornographic underworld. The premise finds Nicolas Cage's character (Tom Welles) searching for the creators of a "snuff" film to discover whether or not the film is indeed authentic. This sounded like an incredible original story line and something Joel Schumacher couldn't go wrong with. Unfortunately that isn't the case. Not only that, but somehow 8MM is seemingly dull for more than half of the film. It seems to drag through scenes with only an occasional shock of pornography or violence thrown in-between to try to satisfy viewers. The surprising lack of suspense (or even action, which I'm not normally a fan of) make the 124 minute running time seem much longer than it really is. Was there anything good in 8MM...sure. Nicolas Cage is always great to watch and also we learn something about a world that really exists, in which most of us know nothing about (nor do we want to). That being said, seeing a documentary on this or a well-crafted news package would've suited me just as well. My strong recommendation to you is to wait for the video...maybe! Grade: C-I would've LOVED to see what David Fincher (director of: Seven and the Game) could've done with this, but maybe it was more of the writing at fault than the directing!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as it looks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie may receive a lot of good reviews, it may be highly regarded in Hollywood circles, but the fact remains that it's boring and unentertaining. Cut about 40 minutes from it, it may be better. It starts out okay, but starts to become too dark and foreboding, to the point where you lose interest in the characters and the story. The plot really starts to drag, and the big revelation of the Machine's identity becomes riddled with needless speech/pulpit preaching. The directing, like most of Schumacher's movies is overstylized. Cage still gives a good performance, but it's one of those movies where you lose the ability to identify with what decisions the main character starts making. Wait for video, and only rent it if Se7en is checked out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"8mm" just isn't up to snuff.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`8mm' Coming out of Joel Schumacher's `8mm' I was hard pressed to remind myself of things I could praise about the film. I was highly anticipating it, and the movie does leave a mark on you, but nothing struck me as particularly good in this film. The movie is a violent, seedy mess of ideas and morals. I've never seen any film go this far with its adult underworld plot, but yet the film seems to manufacture its horrors in some slick Hollywood way that I can't put my finger on. If somebody wanted to do a film on hardcore S&amp;M, or even the legend of the snuff film, I think that picture would be about 5 hours long - there's just so much material. But `8mm' picks and chooses its fights rather amateurishly. Touching only on what is necessary to keep the attention span of the mostly single male audience. Nicholas Cage is, has, and will be a breath of fresh air on the big screen. I love his `do or die' acting style, it's endlessly entertaining. But here you can see the seams of his performance.Hard to believe, but you can tell when Cage is acting. It was a weird feeling that I couldn't lose during the remainder of the movie. It's a stiff performance that, I think, should have included more dread and sorrow. Schumacher also lets things slip by casting VERY familiar names in parts they ALWAYS play. JamesGandolfini and Peter Stormare as a evil pornographers? They give performances that we have seen them do better before. The masterful Catherine Keener is stuck with a lame role as Cage's wife. She can only sit on a bed and coo `Oh, Tom' so many times before you weep to what her career has come to. Only Joaquin Phoenix registers here with a deft and charming performance as a porno shop clerk with connections. After viewing the film, what are we supposed to take from it? By having Cage exact revenge on everybody, he could easily be considered as evil as the snuff filmmakers. The film tries to hide behind a complex issue and to present itself as the film daring to go over the line, yet when Nicholas Cage endures a second `I can't quite reach my gun' moment of tension, you then know that this is a Joel Schumacher film and nothing more.And how this mean and dark film gets an R rating, yet the good-spirited and violence free `Orgazmo' receives an NC-17???It's the most unjust ruling I have ever seen.</fullReview>

Both films attempt to show the vile, seedy underbelly of man's depravity but this later day version gets lost in a weak script and a mailed in performance by Cage. Throughout the entire movie it's hard to decide what you hate more, Cage's constantly nagging wife who questions every action he does or does not do ad infinitum, or Cage's indecisive excuse of a detective who cringes at every possible excuse for cruelty but yet pummels a bad guy to death with his gun. The basic premise is the same however, child runs away, gets lost in the underworld of hardcore porn, and someone tries to find her by immersing themself in the porn world before she is killed. George C. Scott's performance runs rings around Cage. If this subject is a priority for you, who knows, go rent the movie "Hardcore".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unrealized Potential</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this film with very high expectations (based on the press it has been getting and the writer), however I was depressed by how flat and lifeless the movie was. The storyline has potential to be a wonderful psychological thriller, but falls short in the presentation. While I happen to like Cage in most films, he does not fulfill the role well. The biggest problem that I can see with this film is that there is no connection to the characters. Unlike "Usual Suspects" or "Apt Pupil" where the connection to the characters draws you into the film and makes you relate to them (even in some demented way), this film leaves you caring nothing for anyone involved. There is no real development of the "villain" characters in this film, in fact you do not even meet them till the last 20 minutes or so. Visually the movie is well shot, but the editing is lacking some dynamics that would have improved the feel. My general impression is that the creators are trying to shock people more then develop the plot, and unless you are easily shocked, it will not work. Overall, don't waste the 7 bux to see this in the theaters, rent it if you want to see it.</fullReview>

Other then that though the supporting cast did great and the movie was gritty and intense.This movie is about an investigator who is hired by a lady because she found a tape that belonged to her late husband. On the tape depicts a young girl being raped and murdered and the lady hires the invesitagor to find the young girl in the film to make sure its not actually a real snuff film.This movie was actually really good the only reason I give it a 7 is because of the main lead in the film personally I think Cage shouldn't be anywhere near it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Coulda Shoulda Woulda</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like many Hollywood films of today, 8mm starts out promising but soon becomes tedious, overlong and anticlimactic ? the final showdown between hero and villain is far too crazy, over-the-top and unbelievable for a film that deals with such serious content.In between the stupid parts there are some genuinely good ones, and I can only imagine how ? in the hands of a better director and, perhaps, a more talented cast ? the story could well have succeeded.Joel Schumacher, who helmed the project, is good at what he does and sometimes turns in some genuinely excellent films (such as the Taxi Driveresque comedy-thriller Falling Down). But for every good film he makes, there are at least two bad ones ? Batman Forever and Batman &amp; Robin being a good example.Here, Schumacher borrows a few nifty tricks from David Fincher while adding in his own distinct visual flavor ? resulting in a movie that's great to look at. Nicolas Cage stars as Tom Welles, a private eye hired by a mysterious woman to uncover the origins behind a 'snuff film' found inside her late husband's private vault. The reel of footage, an 8mm print, starts as a sick porno flick and soon turns into a violent and realistic piece of evidence that captures the (apparent) murder of a young girl.Tom makes some calls and soon finds out whom the girl is ? a 16-year-old runaway who's been missing for seven years. Refusing to give up the case, he pursues her past ? all the way into a seedy underworld of sex, pornography and violence.Along the way he teams up with an oddball named Max California (Joaquin Phoenix), who takes Tom into the 'devil's lair' ? where they come face-to-face with an eccentric porn king (Peter Stormare, the silent kidnapper from Fargo) and a rough producer (James Gandolfini).The movie relies on Nicolas Cage to carry it, and to be honest he gives such an honest and believable performance that there are times when the film seems to be much better than it really is. Unfortunately many of the co-stars seem to be wasting space ? the character of Max, for example, is truly pointless, as it offers nothing and is simply a convenient way of carrying Tom from one situation to the next.Andrew Kevin Walker, the man who penned the excellent Se7en, scripted 8mm. Rumor has it there were disagreements between him and Schumacher over how to go about filming the movie, and so he dropped out of production early on. (Subsequent uncredited rewrites were later employed, which may explain the underwhelming finale.) If David Fincher (Se7en, Fight Club) had been handed this movie, no doubt the characters would have been expanded upon, the Hollywood ending would have been dropped; the deep themes of the material that occasionally shine through would have been made clearer and more abundant, and the film's dialogue wouldn't be so stiff at times.Because there are moments in 8mm where we can sense just how great it could have been ? there is a segment towards the end where the sick porn 'actor' who brutalizes rape victims claims that he does what he does because he likes to, and not because he was abused as a child or anything to such an effect. Then there's the character of Tom. Much could be written about the closing moments of the movie and his evolution throughout, but it would no doubt spoil part of the surprise. Suffice to say, after all is said and done, we get the feeling that Tom will never be able to return to society ? at least not normally. He's been deeply scarred by his journey, and the memories will never stop haunting him. He is clearly plagued by questions about his own sexuality as he goes home to his family and cries ? not only for victims of so-called 'snuff films,' but also for himself.The little elements like these are clever and insightful but the rest of the film is uneven and, ultimately, disappointing. It could have been so much better, and hopefully in a few years' time someone else will come along with a similar idea and it will be better put to use.2.5/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark, sinister but nonetheless gripping</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Under the direction of Joel Schumacher this is a powerful insight into the extreme actions sometimes used in the porn industry and the illegal snuff movie legends. Nicholas Cage plays the private detective and family man who gets caught up in trying to find out the source of an 8mm film found by an old woman after her husband's death. After feeling the effects of the horror that has just faced him whilst watching it, he takes on the quest to find out the awful truth. His journey through Cleveland and New York to undercover the awful truth brings him face to face with the mother of the victim played powerfully and emotionally by Jenny Powell and he struggles to confront the pain and the anguish involved. He hooks up with a sleazy musician who works in a sex shop (Joaquin Phoenix) and relies on his inside knowledge to guide him to the people involved in the industry. His naivete on these issues is apparent but he is very rapidly educated as he moves through the scenes going deeper and deeper into the mire. There are several Phoenix quotes that are powerful in their exchanges but the one that remains is `There's things that you see but you cannot see, and they get in your head and they stay there.' and that is such a fact of life.  James Gandolfini is the scumbag who exploits girls who want to be in movies and abuses them for his own financial and sick gain. He's teamed up with `Double Velvet' and together they are the lowest of the low, neither showing any conscience or remorse about their actions. Their association with a masked abuser who appears in the films is something they are proud of, to the disgust of those who come into contact with them. I found the performances very powerful in a film that doesn't revolve so much around the seediness of what goes on in this scene, but more the depraved personalities of the people involved. The dark and sinister atmosphere coupled with a very intriguing Indian musical score adds much to the tension.. The film is essentially a crime drama/thriller and I think the way that it has been depicted was an effort to give the story an original slant and one that would be talked about. Yes it could be said that it is a way to expose what is deemed by many to be totally unacceptable, ie S&amp;M, but in the end there is a far more simple moral to the tale and that is a crime is there to be paid for one way or another.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I wish someone had warned me....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yet another case of a movie that didn't need to be made. I don't think that the movie going public could possibly have benefited from this graphic and physically revolting depiction of the underground hard-core pornography world. I have never felt so affected by a movie in my entire movie watching life. I watched the film last night and never closed my eyes to get a wink of sleep. I was haunted by the fact that this was not just another gory Hollywood slasher film but a glimpse at a sick and twisted way of life that is all too present in large urban cities. I think I would have been quite content having never seen this movie and going through life in my rose-coloured, picket-fenced suburban world. It bothered me to no end that there are actually people out there like the characters depicted in the film, and that is a reality that I can't seem to fathom. This is not to say that it was a bad movie. I am still so affected by it that I can't make an objective judgement about whether it was good or bad. The highlight of the film for me was the outstanding role played by the mother of the missing girl. Her scenes were so emotional and heart wrenching, I found myself in tears on several occasions. You could really feel her pain - a credit to the actress who portrayed her.The movie was well made in the sense that even when they were unable to show you what was happening, your imagination took over and filled in the blanks. I think the movie would have been better received if it had contained less of the unnecessary graphic, brutal content. The storyline seemed to be going in a positive direction when it appeared that they would delve into how Nick Cage's character was affected by the case and how his immersion into the dark underbelly of S&amp;M had taken its toll on him. But the film makers chose to ignore this option instead and turn it into a tired old vendetta/revenge flick with plenty of blood and violence to go along with it. I don't think I can, in good conscience, give this film a recommendation - it is definitely not for the squeamish or faint of heart. It is the type of film that you can live your whole life without having seen it, and be a better person for it - some things are just better left unseen. There are plenty of Action/Thriller movies out there that can give you an adrenaline rush without giving you a lifetime of gruesome nightmares. Consider yourselves warned - I wish I had been so lucky.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Approximately 9 1/2 hours into this excruciatingly pointless film, I found myself wondering if there was a reason behind this movie other than to be another ready-made "disturbing" box-office hit. And sadly, I found no reasons.The trend of each new Hollywood thriller attempting to be more grotesque than the previous one is getting more depressing by the minute. In true pandering fashion, the filmmakers use "The Silence of the Lambs" as their model and attempt to copy everything except the things that are beyond their grasp -- coherent story, pointed dialogue, symbolism. This is not a surprise from either the director ("Batman and Robin" anyone?) or the writer ("Seven", another cog in the wheel of this particular trend). Nor, unfortunately, is it a surprise for this film's talented and engaging leading man.If you think too much about this film, it becomes laughable almost instantly. If you put your brain on hold and attempt to enjoy it that way, you'll simply be bored. To make matters worse, the film ends in a dramatically valid way...then meanders on for a particularly ridiculous and unfounded 20 minutes more!  POSSIBLE SPOILER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!If you must watch, note how Nicolas Cage's character undergoes a rather hilarious shift from the nicest man in the universe to a raging dispenser of vigilante justice in the final quarter of the film. I was left wondering whether this was a result of his exposure to underground pornography or his desire to dispense with all of these cardboard characters!Overall, yet another attempt to dress up sickening subject matter in a glossy, nicely wrapped package with nothing inside of it except the filmmakers' desire to make some quick cash.</fullReview>

Laughably, the filmmakers must have thought that they were covering new ground or "exposing the unspeakably horrific side of pornography to movie audiences everywhere!". I heard of snuff films in JUNIOR HIGH so I was somewhat baffled as to how a man could be a private investigator and be taken totally by surprise by these movies. OLD NEWS-get over it, work through it. The moral crises and transformations Cage supposedly goes through are overwrought and about as intense as you might see on an episode of Dawson's Creek. Joaquin Pheonix had a mildly interesting character but his ominous nitwit profundities weren't half as insightful or deep as the filmmakers must have thought they were. The lady who played the missing girl's mom put in the best performance. Cage's wife was simply annoying. The villains were also underwhelming-A bunch of sleazy pornmeisters and a husky guy in leather and chains-who is he? Who cares? James Gandolfini was memorable as a particularly vicious and foulmouthed porn king, though.My friend actually fell asleep during long stretches of the movie-I wasn't so lucky.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>routine, ugly thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Probably the most unique aspect of this film in this age of videotape and DVDs is its choice of title. No one uses 8MM anymore, do they? Actually, 8MM is an essentially routine thriller given a patina of originality by being set in the sleazy world of hardcore, violent pornography. Unfortunately, like most mainstream commercial productions, this film never really explores this world in any depth, but uses it as window dressing for a tired, by-the-numbers private eye meller. The film stars Nicholas Cage as a Pennsylvania-based private investigator called in by a wealthy widow to determine whether a "snuff" film she's found among her late husband's personal possessions is the genuine article. Cage heads off to Hollywood, the mecca of all things pornographic, hooks up with Joaquin Phoenix as a Capote-reading porn shop clerk and all around nice guy, and stumbles into a den of iniquity that leads him to the mystery's eventual unraveling. Unlike a courageous film like 1984's "Tightrope", in which Clint Eastwood's cop character begins more and more to identify with the sleazy world he's investigating and, in the process, unlocks dark, hidden recesses buried deep within his own psyche, 8MM's main character never seems even momentarily ensnared by the dark visions seeping into his brain. Indeed, Cage's investigator remains morally superior throughout. This allows for the film to settle for a routine, bloodsoaked revenge melodrama resolution and to avoid having to develop and cope with a complex central character. Even though director Joel Schumacher manages to create an initial atmosphere of dark gloominess, it's essentially wasted in a welter of action movie cliches and unconvincing heroics. Too bad that a film that promises to open up a world on film unfamiliar to mainstream audiences manages to make even pornography and all the denizens that toil in it seem hopelessly humdrum.</fullReview>

It showed the worst of pornography and the lowest of society. I only had a vague understanding of what 'snuff movies' were till I saw this!I found the comic-book background scenery and comic-book bad guys particularly annoying. I mean, check out the head honcho's seedy pad. The bad guys also reeked of comic-book evilness ie the slimy acting, the bad dress sense, the guns (and other weaponry), the bad dialogue.It was overlong, slow and the half hour or so before the end, it picked up to the point of flying at jet speed, cliche-style. For example, Nicholas Cage gropes around for a weapon to use on the baddies and its just out of his reach. The badguy runs around the car to get the gun instead of under it (giving Nicholas enough movie time to get himself armed). The baddies shooting each other.I found this movie to be apalling, disgusting and totally evil. I've also seen Se7en, it was heaps better than this.I rate this 3 out of 10.</fullReview>

Instead, this movie crossed the line between atristic decency and pornography unto itself (I feel "Boogie Nights" had more taste).I left the theatre feeling violated. It would have been much more effective if the murders were a little more mysterous -- leaving the gory details up to the imagination. Unfortunately, no blood and guts (or imagery) were spared, so everything was basically face value.But, hey, if blood and guts is your thing, go see "Saving Private Ryan" -- you'll get so much more out of it! Don't waste your money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Nice Performances, Clumsy Script.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nicholas Cage is a professional surveillance guy, rather like Gene Hackman in "Conversation". He has a loving wife, Keener, and a cute kiddy. He's hired in one of those "spare no expense" deals to find out who is behind a real snuff film that an elderly widow just found in her long-dead, filthy rich husband's private safe.We see at once that Cage is a nice, middle-class guy, who cares about people's feelings, and he's going to do the best job as a private investigator that he can.So he takes a good hard look at the snuff film. There are three men involved on the scratchy old print. One of them, wearing a black mask and Goth gear, butchers a pretty young sixteen-year-old girl. The director doesn't show us the slaughter, thank God, but we see Cage's repulsion, slightly overdone.He hasn't much to go on. The film is six years old and nobody is identifiable. But like any good PI he visits porno store after porno store until he finds a guide, Phoenix, working behind the counter, a kind of Cumaean Sibyl who guides him into the underworld of smoky caverns where men and younger girls do things that men and younger girls are not supposed to do.And here the story, written by Andrew Kevin Walker, begins to wobble. All the dens of iniquity look pretty much alike, although they're supposed to be sequentially a deeper peek into perversion. The voyage that follows is accompanied by a very loud Hindi chant full of tablas and wailing, inappropriate and unconscionable. The tale continues as Cage and Phoenix track down the three culprits, who turn out to be Stormare (great in "Fargo"), Gandolfini, and the butcher in the mask, a nobody and something of a Mamma's boy despite his flabby heft.Two thirds of the way through, the film collapses in on itself, piece by piece, with little in the way of redeeming value. I'll give an example of a redeeming incident though. It's a piece of dialog. Peter Stormare, the snuff film's director and photographer, has just been shot through the neck and is doing his dying swan fall to the floor. "Not this way, not this way," he mutters to himself. "It should be something more CINEMATIC." It's not only the funniest line in the film; it's the ONLY funny line.I'll give one example of how to turn a story that begins with some promise into a commercial piece of mindless garbage. A lot of film time is lavished on Catherine Keener as Cage's wife, although they're not often seen together on the screen. However, they're constantly calling one another, each time signing off with, "I love you", followed by the other's "I love you." I figured, okay, Keener -- with that aquiline nose and those alarming zygomatic arches -- is a splendid actress. She really is. So she's going to be kidnapped, along with their baby, right? Wrong. She's never in jeopardy. So why is she so prominently featured. So that after all that lovey-dovey stuff she can torment the already abused Cage by taking the tot and leaving him. (Not to worry, she returns at the end, with no realistic excuse either for leaving in the first place or for returning.) And here's how she tells Cage she's leaving. The poor guy has just had the hell kicked and beaten out of him. He manages to stumble all bloody into his home and Keener begins shrieking at him -- "Look at yourself!" and "How do you think I FEEL not knowing where you are?" It's a typical conflict between cop and wife. (Cf., for instance, "Heat.") But there has been absolutely no hint of the magnitude, or even the existence, of her dissatisfaction before. It comes out of nowhere except the writer's desire to add still more dramatic fluff to a movie about an already sordid subject.I was pretty disgusted by this point. The climax is the usual mud wrestling in a cemetery. When two men fight and one is armed, the gun or knife is generally knocked from the hand and there is an obligatory shot of the weapon skittering along the floor. In this movie -- FOUR TIMES. We're no longer in the realm of imagination but of a ritual shot that is almost religious in its invariability.And yet, despite the terrible let-down, those performances can't be easily dismissed. Not a clinker in the bunch. They sparkle among the rain-drenched, littered, dark streets of the ugly part of New York, the leafless barren hills of Appalachia, and the gloomy cellars of Los Angeles.Want a name of a particularly appealing actress? The dead girl's mother, living alone in a wretched shack somewhere in rural Pennsylvania or West Virginia, dying to get Cage to sit down and join her for dinner or at least a drink. Not for sex but to relieve for a few minutes the social vacuum she seems locked into. Her name is Amy Morton. And her part may be the best-written in the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a generic, kitsch piece of cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I think the critics' reception was quite harsh, '8mm' does indeed miss the mark of being a solidly good film. To begin with there are moments of tension and it's appropriately disturbing, but as it progresses these moments become brief and sparse. So much of it feels rehashed, the film borrows too many elements from films such as 'Se7en' and 'The Silence of the Lambs', it's a kitsch piece of cinema.The film follows Tom Welles (Nicolas Cage), a private investigator who's hired by a wealthy widow to determine whether her late husband's reel of 8mm film apparently showing the murder of a teenage girl is authentic or not.It's similarity to 'Se7en' is so evident because '8mm' comes from the same writer, Andrew Kevin Walker. It seems Walker isn't to blame for what resulted, I think the onus is on Joel Schumacher, who is a hit-and- miss director at best. Walker and Schumacher fell out after the director rewrote parts of the screenplay, angering Walker so much that he said he wanted no credit for the project. If 'Se7en' director David Fincher had helmed the project, I think it's safe to say that it would have been better.Cage gives a good performance, as does the whole cast. The problem lies in the narrative. It begins quite well, however it starts to plod along as Cage's character begins to hone in on the shady suspects. Towards the final stages of the film, there are violent altercations between the characters which often become drawn out through repeated reversals of fortune, it sucks all the energy out of the film; it's all quite run-of- the-mill and unconvincing. The final confrontation and exchange is fatally contrived.It's not as terrible as some have said, it has some good moments, but ultimately it is a generic, forgettable film that's spoilt by a hackneyed ending.www.hawkensian.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Big Downer (Minor Spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The widowed wife of a powerful industrialist finds a snuff film amongst his most private possessions. Is it real or fake? Fearing publicity, she hires a private detective to uncover the source of the film. Written by Andrew Kevin Walker, author of "Se7en", directed by Joel Schumacher, and starring Nicholas Cage, "8MM" has all the hallmarks of being a truly creepy, disturbing (and good) film. Unfortunately, it doesn't take Schumacher and Walker long to loose their way. Cage's character, Tom Welles, doesn't behave as 99.99% of the world's population would, given the same set of circumstances. Instead of just following leads, he also immerses himself in the grotesque world of extreme pornography. Then, as it becomes increasingly apparent that the film is real (i.e., a murder was committed), he doesn't go to the cops, he starts winging it and taking greater risks, both for himself and his friends and family. Finally, when confronted with the murderers he assumes the role of avenging angel. C'mon, give me a break. The unreality of the characters coupled with the unrelentingly depressing appearance of the movie make this movie?.a big downer. I'd give it a pass.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seems a mechanical exercise, with little passion for the material evident...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The whole film feels as if it was designed by committee in the wake of (I would guess) the relatively unexpected success of "Se7en". As if scriptwriter Andrew Kevin Walker and the studio honchos sat down and said: "OK, audiences obviously love the dark stuff, so what is suitably dark and borderline sickening for our next project? I know, a film about the 'snuff movie' culture!" Little attempt has been made to 'energize' the material, on the basis that the premise should be intriguing enough in itself to pull the punters in. By 'energize', I don't mean presenting the characters as 'happy go lucky' and setting events to a poppy soundtrack. This would obviously be inappropriate for the subject matter. What I mean is, this feels like the sort of film you or I would make about 'snuff' movies, one with - I'm speaking for myself and hopefully most other people here - no authentic knowledge of what these things are actually like, instead relying on clichés and probable urban myth to give some substance to an incredibly sketchy idea. Did they speak to any 'experts' on the matter? If they did, then the fault must surely lie with director Schumacher for failing to do anything remotely interesting with the material.(POSSIBLE SPOILERS)The argument that the film is intended to be 'downbeat, hard-hitting and gritty' might have held water were it not for the laughable schism that affects Cage's character towards the end of the film. He goes from jaded and sickened everyman detective to righteous avenging angel, which may have been believable had there been a stage in between! Instead, what we get is Cage lumbering around like a zombie one minute, and indulging in Batfink 'your bullets cannot harm me...' style heroics the next. (NB: 'Batfink' is a cult cartoon character, for those of you too sheltered or culturally deprived to get the reference!) Joaquin Phoenix's character is the only 'bright spot' in the movie.It is vaguely disturbing, but no more disturbing than your own imagination would be if you were to ruminate on the subject. This is seriously disappointing, because it doesn't tell or show us anything we didn't already know or couldn't guess. I get the feeling that this is because this was seen as a commercially viable companion piece to "Se7en" rather than an intriguing exploration in its own right. "Se7en" tackles its own dark themes with much more style, intelligence and insight. There is definite potential for an interesting movie on such a subject to be made. This is not it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why was this film made? I'm sure the filmmakers, including the writer who brought us the equally dark "Seven", would argue that this is a serious film about the nature of an average man's encounter with absolute evil. They would probably argue the film explores the various faces of evil, from evil for it's own sake (Machine - a torturer in s&amp;m films who finds his true thrill is to cross over into murder), to a mad director who sees his evil as art, to a porn producer and rich man's lawyer whose lust for money allows them to justify anything. And, finally, the rich pillar of the community who commissions a snuff film "because he could".  And let's give the filmmakers the nod that the film is powerfully acted by the entire cast, the directing is brooding and ominous. But ultimately the film fails mightily, as it tries to have it both ways. Condemning pornography, the film is pornographic. Condemning misogeny, the film depicts the most gruesome torture and degradation of women I have ever seen in a film. The film can't have it both ways. It could have conveyed the horrors of its subject with reaction shots by the hero, which it does repeatedly and effectively, without always showing the viewer the gratuitous subject matter itself. It chooses not to, and by so doing winds up in the same gutter it says it condemns. Thirty years ago the film "Judgment at Nuremberg" asked the same questions as this film. It answered them in an uplifting, thought provoking way. "8mm" opts to revel in the very exploitation it would want you to believe it condemns. And for that, it fails.</fullReview>

The result is a flawed melodrama that can call itself dark on the posters.The music however is worth talking about. The strange Peruvian(?) melodies that go with views of LA porn are nicely disconcerting. Also good use of silence marks the domestic scenes out from the rest of the investigation.And the masked killer playing Aphex Twins "Come to Daddy" on vinyl shows that someone did at least have a genuinely good ear for Freudian depth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An awful film to endure, let alone recommend to anyone else. Nicholas Cage, playing his usual sullen character is complimented by Peter Stormare who can only be described as ridiculous (if slightly funny), and a woefully sleazy disgusting scumbag in the form of Soprano's over - rated James Gandolfini. His turn from pleading wimp to aggressor by suddenly challenging Cage when he is in a precarious position is ludicrous. Has been mentioned in the same breath as Se7en, but isn't even in the same league. The scene where Cage tries to do right by the victims mother, but instead reduces her into a frenzy of anguish is actually horrible to watch. Some films are disturbing, but in an engrossing sort of a way, such as the great Se7en, Silence of the Lambs or Red Dragon, but this is simply disturbing, period. It does not have the twists of Se7en, nor the characters or plot development of The Lecter films, and always seems like a poor attempt at a psycological thriller. You are left with an abhorance to the film at the end, rather than that itching curiosity to view it again, that comes with the countless other films of this type which are are significantly better than this.</fullReview>

It's a prime example of one dimensionality. The film takes no risks, although the marketing will have you thinking the movie delves deep into the dark side of the human psyche. In reality, it's nothing more than a waste of 2 1/2 hours.The best part for me was during the big climactic scene as Cage is creeping in the big bad evil guy's house, the projector died and the lights came on.

The ground work is laid for a great movie, but thats where it stays never rising past the bad direction and over acting (did i mention that already?). Almost like A Time To Kill, which is such a great script, that Schumacher does all he can to ruin it and turn it into tripe.

		<shortDescription>A total waste of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I go to see a film, I like to be entertained, regardless of the content. The content of 8MM is sordid, depraved &amp; disturbing, but that's not why I loathed this film. Appalling dialogue, weak acting, overly long &amp; worst of all, the constantly monotone voice of the vastly overrated Nicholas Cage made this a really bad film. Some of the lowlights:- We are told that between 800,000 &amp; 1 million people go missing each year in the US. Nicholas Cage finds a picture in a missing persons' file resembling that of the girl he is seeking without any trouble at all. - The woman who played his wife - where did they find her for goodness sake!. She couldn't act her way out of a wet paper bag. Ditto the old woman playing the old man's wife, she couldn't act for toffee. The drippy conversations between Cage &amp; his wife were just cringeful. - When Nicholas Cage has one hand tied to the bed, why doesn't the fat guy who is trying to reach for the gun which has slid underneath the car simply go round the other side &amp; get it? It's an insult to our intelligence that the director thinks that he can get away with such an unrealistic situation. - - At over two hours, 8MM is way too long. It lacks punch &amp; drifts listlessly. Whole scenes could have benefitted from tighter direction. Trite &amp; cliched, this is a load of rubbish. Nicholas Cage is as one-dimensional as usual, he cannot get beyond one facial expression or tone of voice, &amp; when he does raise himself out of his lethargy, he overacts so badly, it's laughable. The scene where he is first viewing the 8mm film in the old lady's house just made me laugh out loud. Don't waste your time with this film, I think it's up there with The Avengers for one of the worst movies ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated thriller with distasteful subject matter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joel Schumacher may have bombed out with the atrociously-received BATMAN AND ROBIN, but his latest thriller is a complex, thrilling movie which gives us a detailed character breakdown of the hero, who himself is partially seduced by the dark side and not altogether good. It's not often we get psychological insights like this in mainstream movies, but Nicolas Cage is able to pull the role off, and still come out on top as a likable figure.The movie starts out well, depicting the classy side of the obscene, before gradually moving into murkier and murkier depths, eventually leading to a conclusion where Cage commits acts just as bad as the people he's after. Cage is fast becoming one of my favourite actors of recent years, and he once again excels himself. A solid cast is built around him, including an intelligent, likable sidekick with Joaquin Phoenix, an up-and-coming star, and also the actress playing his wife, who portrays her mental suffering excellently. In fact, there isn't a bad performance in the whole film, from the grief-stricken good guys to the drugged up bad guys, who simply have no compassion and no regrets about what they do: it doesn't even bother them.The subject matter was enough to put a lot of people off this film, but it really isn't that bad, apart from quite a few sexual situations, this is nothing worse than what you'd see late night on Channel 5. The most disturbing thing of all is the actual snuff film itself, especially the drugged, dozy eyes of the young victim as she gets butchered to death. This is pretty hard to take, especially when we learn how she was just a normal girl, who got seduced by promises of a career in the movie industry. This is pretty close to reality and it could happen, which is why it's all the more disturbing. When we meet the bad guys in the final half of the film, it's not that bad as they're just like you and me, making money.This is perhaps over-emphasised at the end of the film, with the unmasking of the central character Machine, who acts as an executioner in the snuff film. He turns out to be just a normal, overweight man with glasses; there's nothing strange about this man who could be a friend, or neighbour. On the outside he's perfectly normal. On the inside, he's a twisted pervert. Much of the violence is kept off screen, except at the end where Cage goes around bringing much-deserved vengeance to all the scum and sickos involved.8MM turns out to be an intelligent, thoughtful look at one man's obsession and the depths to which the human race will sink. It's got it's fair share of flaws, but these have unfairly meant that it's got something of a bad reputation, probably from cinema goers hoping for the CGI effects or explosions of the latest blockbuster, or for something really profound. It's underrated, and surprisingly good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb film that's kinda ruined by a plot flaw that jumps way past the suspension of disbelief</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>8MM is a well produced, well acted and well executed motion picture. However, it suffers from a major plot flaw that kinda ruins it for the astute viewer. Here's the problem in a nut shell: The movie has a contemporary setting, ie: modern 1999. The millionaire pays for a "Snuff film", the actual filming of a murder. It's done on actual 8mm film stock. 8mm is, well just that, film... If this movie is contemporary to 1999, all the snuff film director would have to do is use a common consumer grade video camcorder. There was no need to use 8mm film. This would take most of the risk out of being caught by eliminating numerous witnesses. ie: It would eliminate the risk of being caught by numerous film processing house employees seeing what happened when the film was processed, and It would give the snuff film owner the chance to erase it in a hurry, if need be. Also, By 1999, 8mm motion picture film is way outdated &amp; a huge unnecessary risk to take. I assume this flaw was caused by production costs. It's much cheaper to produce a contemporary setting than it a period piece. For this movie to have had the fully intended shock and horror, it would need to be set before 1983ish, well before consumer grade video camcorders became commonplace &amp; 8mm film was still pretty common to shoot &amp; develop. Nowhere in the film does it show the snuff film was made a long time ago. All characters associated with making snuff film do not age. It's a completely contemporary setting. the film is a superb effort, but once you realize this flaw, it veers right into pure silliness.</fullReview>

I don't remember the specifics very well, but the atmospheres and plot-lines were, understandably, I suppose, quite similar to this film. I watch a lot of films of this type, but few affect my sub-c in quite this manner.

Basically, the movie meanders and the sequence where the bad guys are beating Cage up isn't particularly convincing or interesting. Oh, and in a strange twist (if you want to call it that), turns out the man who gave Cage this assignment is not a nice man after all.

I watched it about a week after purchasing it and was not disappointed. This movie although very dark is quite worth watching especially if your a Nicolas Cage fan. However if you are easily offended do yourself a favor and do not watch this movie as it is very intense and potentially offensive to some at various times. This movie is a good mix of drama and action and is very thought provoking.

		<fullReview>With successful hits such as "Face/Off" and "Con Air" behind him, Nicolas Cage ventured out in one of the worst films of 1999.

		<shortDescription>Disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This 1999 Nicholas Cage vehicle started out as a decent thriller, but turned out to be just another b-movie. I got a feeling, watching this movie, there actually was a good enough script, but Schumacher couldn't quite handle it as well as he did the much simpler Phone Booth. The subject of snuff movies is as scary as it is a grateful one for any screenplay writer. As for the acting, Cage himself could easily have been replaced by, say, Jon Bon Jovi or John Travolta. That should give you a clue about the effort he put in to portraying his character. This movie, a big disappointment, could have been so much better and more interesting had the script been handed over to someone like Abel Farrara or David Lynch.</fullReview>

Nic Cage is an investigator searching for a missing girl who disappeared from home and was seen in a violent porno film owned by some old bastard. Anyway, being an investigator, you think Nic Cage wouldn't become so attached to people, but he does and blows the whole case out of proportion. Once the movie is over all you can do is think - why??? The movie was too long and the action scenes weren't actiony enough for me. They were more gory than anything else.

		<shortDescription>Average but overly long thriller (with disturbing subject matter)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"8 MM" is, on the whole, a pretty average thriller. Yes, it has a pretty unusual subject matter (porn and "snuff" movies) and is very dark and serious, but is doesn't really do a lot with it. This movie constantly makes you feel like something really great is going to happen, but it never does. There are no dramatic twists, the story just goes on and on and never seems to end. It's not an awfully bad story and it's a lot more plausible than the stories found in some other thrillers, but it is way too long. On top of that, I really hated most of the characters in this movie, even the ones you're supposed to hate. Nicolas Cage acts terribly in this movie, and the constant telephone calls with his overly concerned wife are far too frequent and really get on my nerves. All they do is add tedium to an already fairly boring movie.All in all, "8MM" is a movie that fails to impress on any level. It's too long, a bit boring and the story is unusual but lacking in surprises. I'd say it's watchable but only if you really don't have anything better to do.** out of **** stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>8mm was a very dark and disturbing movie that at times dragged, but overall made you think about the world that goes on when the lights go down.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nicolas Cage plays Tom Welles, a surveillance specialist who gets a call from the widow of a rich tycoon to investigate a "snuff" film the widow found in her late husbands private vault. A snuff film is one in which a woman is raped, beaten and then killed. This film depicts a young girl getting brutally murdered, and the widow wants to know if it's real. Snuff films are generally considered to be urban legends. People talk about them, but they don't really exist. Welles takes the case because he knows that it's a big payday for him and his wife and child. What he doesn't realize it what horrors the film will bring to him, and how it will eventually change his life forever. 8mm was written by Andrew Kevin Walker, the writer of Seven, another dark and disturbing film. I wonder what happened to Walker in his life to make him think of things like this. What I do like about both films is that he doesn't give it the old "Hollywood" makeover. Who would have thought that Gwyenth Paltrow's head would have been in that box at the end of Seven? And the same goes here. There's a scene near the end where the movie could have gone "Hollywood" but instead Walker makes Welles cross the line between what he was and what this case has made him become. And that's what I liked about the movie. It didn't go where a normal movie would take you.What I didn't like was that it dragged at times. There were a lot of scenes that seemed to go on forever, and without reason. I think Schumacher wanted to bring the tension up, but instead he kept the action and drama from building up. What he considered tense moments were, at times, just slow. I also don't think the story took you into the lives of the people that make these films (pornography, not snuff films). I liked that we saw Cage's character go from happy husband to deranged soul, but we never got into the people who made him that way. There was some of that near the end, but I thought it could have gone deeper. There was a line in the movie that said "When you dance with the Devil, the Devil don't change, the Devil changes you." Besides the fact that literally it makes no sense to me (why would you dance with the Devil and if you did, do you really think you could change him?) figuratively, it is the heart of this film. Welles thinks he can just walk into this world and walk right back out without being affected, but without even knowing it, he gets sucked in and almost loses what he treasures most. So overall 8mm was an entertaining movie. It was very dark (both in lighting and in substance) and at times very disturbing. At times it got slow, but Cage makes it worth watching. But I warn you; this is not a film for everyone, so think about it. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>8mm strictly by-the-numbers, mediocore, and often predictable mystery thriller hidden under the guise of a dark, disturbing, deviant setting.Nicholas Cage stars as a private investigator hired by a wealthy woman to find out if an 8mm reel she found in her deceased husband's safe is truly a snuff film. Cage's investigation finds him teaming up with adult store clerk Joaquin Phoenix as the two plunge into the disturbing, graphic world of underground, extreme pornography.Director Joel Shumacher's leaden pacing doesn't with an already lackluster script. Nicholas Cage is wasted, Joaquin Phoenix is under-utilized, and Peter Stormare just isn't given enough room to flex his villainous muscle. In fact, almost everyone in the film seems sub-servient to the often graphic, but not terribly disturbing scenes of death and unusual sex.Shumacher doesn't really pull much out of this. Just about everything in the script is stock-material. Cage shouting violently once in a while, Phoenix's slightly amusing, cardboard role, a decent score, unimaginative, blase cinematography and editing, and a weak ending all come together in this slightly average film. If you think you're in for something along the lines of Se7en, you aren't: Hollywood's censored, constricted view of the twisted is nowhere near as creative as Fincher's work.5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Remember when Nick Cage could act? Me, too, but only vaguely because it's been quite a while. He absolutely sleepwalks through this routine detective story as a private dick who follows a sadomasochistic trail leading to his own moral undoing. The man is literally incapable of conveying any emotion (which is probably why he was so much more effective in roles as burnt-out cases - see "Birdy," "Leaving Las Vegas," even "Raising Arizona") and as a result his character comes off as Mister Spock, P.I.Catherine Keener, as Cage's wife, is wasted. The Phoenix kid and the guy from "The Sopranos" turn in solid performances, but it's hardly enough to save the film from crashing and burning about halfway through. The thing goes on for-freaking-EVER, continually passing up perfect opportunities to wrap up the loose ends and get this stinker behind us. On the one hand, you kind of admire the fact that they don't go for the easy, obvious ending. On the other, you just can't stop thinking, "Man, they really ought to end this now and cut their losses." What kills me is that the flick lasts at least a couple of hours with several seemingly interminable scenes that are prolonged for no discernible cinematic effect, and yet the editors somehow managed to chop out everything between Cage's fruitless tour through the seedy Hollywood underbelly and his SUDDEN discovery of a nun at a boarding house who happens to have a suitcase full of clues to give him.I can't believe I sat through this entire movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe I'm just getting old, but the mere presence of titillating imagery and the repetition of "sexual swearwords" are not enough to make a film either dangerous or probing. To me, ambiguity and equivocation are the centre of shock and confusion - in this movie, there's no room for either, and all we can do is sit stupefied by tedium as the arc is reeled out to its inevitable end.Everything in this movie which should be nuanced is flat, and everything which is allegedly shocking is just dull. Schumacher thinks that having Cage intone "I love you and I miss you" is sufficient to demonstrate a loving marital relationship; he gives us no sense of why those involved in the porn industries have chosen to become so. He leaves plot transitions out whilst filling in each blank of character.Comparisons to "Se7en" are easy but, I think, redundant: that movie was pacy, a surprise at every corner, a genuinely suspensful picture. It also managed to enliven Brad Pitt (in a rare display of acting) just as much as '8mm' flattens Nic Cage, giving him at most two emotions to express (soulful eyes (sympathy) and shouting (fury).Perhaps if the director had not spelled out everything in the setup, the denoument might have had some power. As it is, since he failed to credit the viewer with any ability to fill in the spaces and draw inferences, it's difficult to empathise with Cage's character's need to draw such inferences and probe for the truth. I had the sense throughout that every last thread would be neatly knitted, and quite lost interest in the outcome. Someone should take Joel Schumacher's shooting script and slice out every other scene - it might even teach him not to spoon feed the audience. And at least I would only have wasted an hour of my life...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is what happens when you let "summer blockbuster" directors take a potentially gripping tale and "Big-Time" it. Joel Schumacher takes a talented cast, Nicholas Cage, Jaoquim (?) Phoenix, and (finally getting his due, "The Sopranos") James Gandolfini, and tries to make S. and M. "Lethal Weapon". All of the stars are the types ideally suited to this sort of dark, unsettling tale. The premise is grim, an elite millionaire's widow finds a "Snuff" film among his belongings. She wants to know of whence it came. Creepy stuff. Next thing you know, you're watching Danny and Mel trade jibes while they examine the underbelly of the pornography industry. Then, to make matters worse, the story escalates into the tale of a man driven to the brink. Unfortunately, it comes off less like Travis Bickle than Rambo (II and III). An infuriating quote I read about this movie before I saw it: "Major Studio makes indie-feeling film." Apparently, Schumacher felt he was making Batman, so he added this ridiculous Danny Elfman-ish score "to set the mood" I assume. Try watching this on video and not get annoyed by the background music. In summary, a good idea gone wrong. I just imagine this directed by David Fincher, Bryan Singer, an angry Ridley Scott. Or best yet, a true visual master (the young) Brian DePalma. Hey, wait, I saw "Snake Eyes"? Maybe he wouldn't know what to do with Nicholas Cage.</fullReview>

If the movie did a better job of moving the plot along and making the story more interesting, it would justify the perverse scenes, and coming away you would be thinking of what happened in the movie, not the disturbing views you get here and there in the movie. Instead you can almost predict what's going to happen next at every turn, and you become so bored with the story, that you could care less with what happens to the characters.

		<fullReview>Saw this movie yesterday on tape, and while it had some good things, it fell apart at the end, (as most Hollywood movies seem to do nowadays). It tries to do something different, explore the underground porno/sleaze world, and that´s admirable in a major studio movie. But the directing leaves much to be desired, the long sequences of Cage cruising the streets looking for clues, overlayed with that annoying music, only serves to distance us from what´s happening. As if we´re suddenly transported into a rock video (typically Hollywood). Some of the sets have a constructed, unrealistic look that has STUDIO written all over them. And while Schumacher probably restrained himself, the camera still moves when it´s not needed, drawing attention to itself. I also expected more of my fellow countryman Peter Stormare, but I´m sad to say he overplayed like crazy. There are some tense moments, but they fail to save this movie. The ending is particularly far fetched, I´ll give it 2 out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely the worst film of 1999</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why do I hate "8mm"? Let me count the ways.1) The hypocrisy - how can you make a movie about how terrible it is to titilate an audience with lurid or pornographic images that includes a great many descriptions of said lurid, pornographic things? Making a mainstream movie that sells tickets based on the promise of sex and violence which then turns around and decries sex and violence is just silly.2) Joel Schumacher is the worst filmmaker working in America today. Not only is he responsible for adapting not one but TWO horrible John Grisham novels in two stupid movies, but he also ruined the "Batman" series of films and brought the world "The Lost Boys." Guess what, Hollywood? He's not getting any more talented than this.3) Nicholas Cage has ceased to be an actor. He's now a brand-name. Once upon a time, Cage was a real actor taking on challenging roles and pulling them off with brilliant, off-kilter performances ("Raising Arizona," "Honeymoon in Vegas") Now, he's this weird psycho caricature of something that one time resembled a real actor.4) The script stinks. Andrew Kevin Walker, who gave the world the equally unpleasant but at least well-filmed "Seven," has unloaded a real garbage heap here. There is no plot to speak of - the initial 5 minutes of set-up is merely an excuse to place Cage in the seamy underworld of pornography so the rest of the film can be taken up wallowing in the unpleasantness of it all - and the conclusion is not only unsatisfying, but makes very little to no real sense. Let's hope his script for Tim Burton's "Sleepy Hollow" actually has a believable character or interesting scenario.I could go on, but space is becoming limited. Needless to say, this is not even a passable thriller, and the fact that so many have enjoyed it just proves that more people need to go back and rent some good thrillers, if just to remind them what suspense or intrigue feels like.</fullReview>

Also, the final battle against the murderer is not very interesting, because it is the fourth or fifth in a row, and, when he is forced to take the mask off, there is no surprise! In other words, worth seeing, but not compelling! The issue of the nice guy going through hell for a human mission is also nothing new, although the underworld of porn industry is a pretty unexplored space in Hollywood cinema. The film though doesn't give a different perspective. The porn underworld is simply a subjective hell where all boundaries of taste and value are transgressed, and good guy Cage leads us through this underworld with his bad saint acting that he remembered from his last film with Meg Ryan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Movie, Bad Ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>8mm was surely one of the best movies of 1999 to date, up until the true story of the film (hence the title) is revealed..it builds suspense and the acting by Cage is flawless as usual, never overacting or looking out of place in his scenes. His character is very believable and interesting as self-employed private investigators are quite an upstart industry now in the United States.The only problem I had with the first hour or so of the movie was the scene where the billionairess introduces him to his case (shows him the 8mm home movie and sets the plot in motion). I thought Joel Scumacher would have made this part of the movie the most interesting, yet I think it is grossly overshadowed by Cage discovering the underground porno-lifestyle so accurately depicted in this film which consumes most of Los Angeles.You wont find any B.S. sterotypes in this film, it's gritty and factual and is just what America needs to go see especially if you like Seven, Kiss the Girls, or are interested in movies which show the true side of life most common city people are forced to realize. The idea of having a story unfold of this calibre and nature, covering this material, could only come from Joel Schumacher (see FALLING DOWN). He can show you a side of L.A. most movies just brush under the carpet. It was also interesting to see Joaquin Phoenix - he is a very talented young actor. His lines in 8mm complement the plot and he seems perfect - especially the way he and Cage interact sort of like a big brother/little brother relationship.What I did not like about this film is that there were no major twists like in Seven.. Movie addicts will recognize Chris Bauer (Mr.Gettys) from the Devil's advocate as the The Machine and Dino Velvet (Peter Stormare, Armageddon) the sick for hire snuff film director in 8mm. Bottom Line: This movie is very interesting and worth seeing several times, especially if you are a Nick Cage Fan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a waste of talent! Knowing that I was in for an evening of the seamy side of life, I was willing to accept that for I knew that Cage would not have ventured into this film without good reason. I'm, still trying to figure out what that reason was. The film goes nowhere! I'm not sure why it left the dock in the first place. I suppose there are those who want to know more about the pornographic side of life, but even they will be disappointed. There's not much for anyone. Strike it off as a wasted two hours!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most sickening film of the year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is by far the most sickening film of the year, and that has nothing to do with the subject matter. "8MM" has to be the most limp, one-sided piece of cinematic garbage I have watched in years. The movie's fatal flaws (death by a thousand stupidities) are the pathetic, over-wrought sentimentality, the half-baked storyline and little details that make one realize nobody really thought this film through. (Example: Nicolas Cage's character is supposed to be cleverly inconspicous to the bad guys, yet always seems to be driving a black, police-style car. Is that the way to blend in, or was Schumacher dozing off when he filmed those scenes?) Far worse is Cage's overacting, which would be hilarious, if say, this movie were called "Austin Powers". His grunting and jumpy reactions while watching the snuff film were so forced, I assumed he was sitting in an electric chair. I can't believe I took $8.75 out of my college fund to watch this thing.</fullReview>

Anybody who sees this film will be turned off by many things. It started out good, but went downhill real fast after the first half hour. The acting was so so at best. I would suggest you rent or see Se7en instead of 8 MM.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although this film blatantly aimed to shock the audience, I just found the whole thing to be distasteful. Many times the movie just dragged painfully on- the film could have been edited to be 45 minutes shorter. The ending was then rushed and disappointingly predictable. What were supposed to be some of the most dramatic moments actually made the theater burst into laughter- they were that ludicrous. Nicholas Cage's character was surprising static for all the hell he goes through, and towards the end of the movie it's hard to identify with most of his actions. The only enjoyable part of this movie was Joaquin Phoenix's character, Max California. It adds a bit of much needed levity to this otherwise ponderous film but falls just short of saving it from being an atrocious waste of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>8mm is poor remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>8 MM is a remake of the Spanish film "Thesis" directed by Alejandro Amenavar. This remake includes more explicit violence, which is exactly what the story (in particular the original script) points at. Although the actors, say Nicolas Cage and Joaquin Phoenix, are good at their roles, 8MM does not preserve the philosophy and the most interesting question of the original film, which is, I think: why human nature morbidly enjoys seeing and knowing of the suffering of others, including the present audience which is enjoying the film. I give this film 3/10 because it is not only a remake, but also one that does not honor the original script.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disgusting mess.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of people I know love this film. I guess I understand why. The film explores territory that is not explored in film. However, to me, Nicolas Cage seems out of place in a plot like this, the plot, in question, starts out just okay and then falls apart by the end due to too many twists, ideas, and gross surprises, the script is dreary and lifeless, the tone feels too artificial, the look is too ugly and murky, the tone isn't established well enough, and the camera angles are all practically recycled. That's just the tip of the iceberg for me. The real problem for me with this film is that it feels so mainstream and too much like an action film when the material contained within doesn't fit with it. It makes the whole film so much more uncomfortable and stomach churning than it needs to be, considering that the film is about the snuff film industry. The idea of the film could have worked. A detective is called to a rich woman's house because she has found a video of a teenager getting slaughtered. The detective, while investigating the tape's origin, gets too caught up in the underground world of snuff film making and begins to lose his mind. This sounds interesting, but then the director, Schumachar(who I thought knew much better), throws in all sorts of freaks and gross subplots and makes the whole film into an action/espionage thriller. In doing this, he has wrecked a potentially good idea for a film and instead crafted a grotesque, depressing, grim, and ugly piece of junk. I REALLY didn't like this film. Actually, REALLY is an understatement. There have been few films that have angered me more than this one did. This film not only made me almost barf, but it filled me with so much dislike for the human race and the people around me. I guess I can say that it was an effective film, but I have always regretted watching it. I felt like a pervert for watching, to be honest. I've seen some wonderful and shocking films that were also disturbing. 8MM did nothing for me except want to punch myself for watching it in the first place. It did not entertain me, teach me, interest me, or challenge any part of me except my stomach. Is there anything that works? The soundtrack is pretty cool and fits alright and Nick Cage does the best he can. That's about it. A lot of people I know seem to really dig this film, so I'm not going to recommend that you not see it. You may get something out of it that I didn't. However, I certainly don't want to watch it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well done thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This thoroughly unpleasant thriller from the hands of Joel Schumacher (Batman and Robin) offers very little in its lurid tour of snuff films and the seedy pornographic underworld. A wooden Nicolas Cage stars as a private detective hired by a tycoon's widow, who discovers in her dead husband's safe some 8mm footage of a young girl being sexually abused and slaughtered. Cage's job is to determine the veracity of the film and to find out the girl's identity, whether she be alive or dead. What could have been a taut, nerve-jangling thriller is instead a lumbering, overwrought but underwritten tale of vigilante justice. Screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker also penned the imaginative and compelling Seven, but you wouldn't know it from this tired and monotonous script. Schumacher tries for echoes of both The Silence of the Lambs and Paul Schrader's Hardcore (which stars George C. Scott as a father trying to find his daughter in the seedy porn industry), but despite some slick camera-work, the film fails to draw the audience into either the mystery of the missing girl or Cage's supposed internal conflicts. It's not so much the unsavory subject matter as it is the sloppy and unimaginative film-making that makes the movie unbearable. Of the entire cast only Joaquin Phoenix, as a charismatic goth boy who works at an adult book store, comes away with a memorable performance.Starring: Nicolas Cage, Joaquin Phoenix, James Gandolfini. Director: Joel Schumacher.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing subtext</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While going after sordid snuff flicks (and who would argue with that?), Schumacher manages to communicate a powerful subtext about American attitudes toward sex: that human sexuality is bad. Problem is, Schumacher does nothing to indicate there's any other view. Every character in the movie seems to have either a lousy sex life (the Cage character) or a guilt-ridden and perverse sex life (everyone else). I doubt that Schumacher intended this result, but the overriding feeling in the flick is that all active sexuality inevitably spirals downward into perversity---a distinctly American attitude. If the mass American film audience was more sophisticated---and this is a film geared toward a mass audience, not a critical one--- that would seem less problematical. As it is, I am disappointed when I think of a subtext absorbed by so many unlikely to question it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, I am not someone who is made to feel sick by a lot of films. Even if most of the content is meant to disturb, I can take it and write it off. This one was the exception. "8MM" is one of the most sickening, ugly and disturbing movies that I have ever seen. It stars Nicolas Cage as detective Tom Welles, who has been hired to investigate the authenticity of a snuff film, where a young girl is apparently murdered by a big guy decked out in S&amp;M. His investigation soon leads him to the dark porn underworld and the many people involved in it.In better hands, this might have been okay. They could have worked the movie into a tight story with some surprises and made the whole porno/bondage thing not as nasty. But instead, director Joel Shumacher turns it into one of the ugliest and most disgusting things I have ever seen. From the dingy, smut-filled porn houses to the sight of a skinny, teenage girl being murdered, this film is stocked with things that you won't be able to get out of your head (that's a bad thing.)The only bright spot was Joaquin Phoenix, who is always enjoyable. Writer Andrew Kevin Walker also wrote "Se7en", which disturbed many people as well. But the difference there was that it was a well-done film, and much of the dark material was handled with care. Here, it is simply in your face, waiting for you to become sick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie starts out being very interesting and involving. The scenes where Nicolas Cage is detecting and trying to locate the missing girl are definitely a pleasure to watch. The scenes with the girl's mother are the best in the movie and we see some excellent work by Cage as he shows the emotions of a man torn between wanting to tell the mother what he knows, but not wanting to lead her to the wrong conclusions.Even after he begins to explore the seedier parts of LA, the movie shows promise of being an exploration into how you can't remain detached when you delve into the darker recesses of the human psyche, no matter how hard you try. From this promising beginning, the movie makes a terrible turn into one of the "Deathwish" sequels.Rather than showing the "evil" characters as complex and conflicted, or perhaps even with some level of remorse for what they've become, they are painted in caricature: even the guy who looks like a regular guy ultimately shows his true evil by throwing a knife at the hero.Finally, the relationship between Cage and his wife is the most unbelievable one I think I've ever seen on film. Could he possibly go through all this without ever even saying one word to her and still claim to be in love with her?The beginning of this film reminded me a lot of "Hard Core" starting George C. Scott, but whereas that film give you a more complex view of both what we consider "normal" and what we think is "perverted," "8MM" just leaves you feeling used.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie describes the efforts of a private investigator (Nicolas Cage) to determine whether a private porn film is a snuff film. (Snuff films are rape/murder films which are for real, i.e. people actually get murdered on film.) It quickly becomes obvious to the viewer that the film is real, and the second half of the movie is spent on the PI finding those responsible for it and killing them.The first half of the movie is quite effective and powerful. Without actually showing (almost) any gore, the movie makes you realize what a sleazy, disgusting industry the hard porn industry is. In this respect the movie is successful.However, the second half of the movie is spent, almost entirely, on a savage manhunt in which the PI seeks, finds, and murders the people responsible for producing the snuff film. I use the word 'murder' because there is no other way to describe his acts. He cold-bloodedly tracks down these people, follows them around, waits for an opportunity, ties them up, and beats them to death. I found this shocking even more than the actual porn in the movie, because it was portrayed as the execution of justice. And here I thought everyone was entitled to the rights of a lawyer, a fair trial, and a decent chance to defend themselves. Silly me! Obviously the producers of this movie know better.From a film that's supposed to deal with the issues of semi-legal and illegal porn, I would expect a better understanding of how justice is supposed to be served in a democratic country.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker has a gimmick at least as old as the Hollywood sign: serving up gamy "underground" material for lurid titillation, then assuaging the audience's guilt by puffing up a lot of righteous indignation. In "Seven" he and the director David Fincher nailed the ne plus ultra in serial-killer chic; in "8mm" his motherlode is snuff movies and the (maybe fictive) world of below-the-radar "extreme porn." The detective hero (Nicolas Cage), sent by a Chandleresque old widow to disprove the authenticity of a snuff movie, plunges into an inferno that looks suspiciously like Paul Schrader's "Hardcore." Once inside, the sights and sounds send him reeling back to the Little Woman (a respectably flinty Catherine Keener) and the babe in her arms--but he just can't shake those awful visions! In the movie's nuttiest and most deliriously bogus scene, a roomful of porno-addicted zombies watches a black-and-white loop of a nurse delivering an enema, and Cage shudders and recoils as if watching ethnic cleansing on CNN. Cage is a wonderful actor, but here he's required to exhaust his repertoire of Painfully Disillusioned and Fierily Damning expressions. Walker and the director, Joel Schumacher, want to give us skeezy kicks, but make us appreciate that we're all terribly, terribly upset by the human waste of it all. In "Seven," dishonest as it was, at least Fincher's style, evocative of a Trent Reznor video, seemed effective and apropos. Here, Schumacher seems as always almost poignantly out of touch--his renditions of low dives have the cold gleam of a Warner Brothers theme store. With Joaquin Phoenix, who gives the movie its only lift as Cage's exposition-spouting sidekick, and Peter Stormare and James Gandolfini as the bad guys, who seem painfully embarrassed by their roles. Cinematography by Robert Elswit, who shot "Boogie Nights"--the movie's only sanguine visual moments suggest a Paul Thomas Anderson quotation of John Cassavetes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An attempt to explore the taboo subject of "snuff" movies?. crippled by the wrong director and wrong supporting actors for the job.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The concept of "snuff" movies (e.g. a film in which people are killed for real on camera for the entertainment of others) has been a bit of a taboo subject in mainstream Hollywood movies. "8mm" attempts to deal with the subject matter head-on, but rather like another taboo-busting thriller from a couple of decades earlier - Cruising (1980) - the film fails to capitalise on its potentially eye-opening themes. The real downfall with "8mm" is that the wrong director has been given the job of pulling it all together. Joel Schumacher is more noted for his neon-lit comic-book technique, and his MTV-style editing, but this sort of dark and seedy story is not really his forte. "8mm" cries out for a director like David Fincher ? someone who can stamp a degree of dark, depraved authority over the proceedings.Private eye Tom Welles (Nicholas Cage) makes money by catching cheating husbands and wives. With this money, he supports his wife Amy (Catherine Keener) and their baby. However, Tom is dragged into a rather darker mystery when he is hired by a wealthy widow, Mrs. Christian (Myra Carter), to investigate the affairs of her recently deceased husband. It seems that among the late Mr. Christian's belongings was a gratuitous 8mm reel of pornographic film, showing the sexual abuse and slaying of a young girl. Mrs Christian desperately wants to know if the film is genuine "snuff", or if the killing was realistically faked. Tom eventually finds the victim's mother (Amy Morton), and follows further clues into the sleazy pornographic underworld of Los Angeles. Here, a sex-shop worker named Max (Joaquin Phoenix) helps the bewildered detective find his way around the disturbing and seedy underbelly of the sex culture. Tom gradually homes in on pornographers Eddie Poole (James Gandolfini) and Dino Velvet (Peter Stormare), and their hulking sidekick The Machine (Chris Bauer). It seems that this odious trio hold the nauseating answers as to what really happened in the 8mm reel of snuff film discovered at the start of the movie. As Tom draws closer to the truth, he finds his morality in question and his life in danger?.Cage gives one of his more restrained performances, and is especially believable in a scene where he watches the original 8mm snuff film and is physically repulsed at what he sees. Phoenix is also very good ? indeed, quite the best thing about the film ? as the sex-shop employee who introduces Tom to a sexualised culture that he can barely understand. Alas, the performances of Gandolfini and Stormare are over-the-top almost to pantomime-like levels, and really wreck the plausibility of the film's second half. The film is also extremely overlong, and many viewers will find themselves clock-watching well before the climax. Certain scenes are rather nasty, but there isn't a moment in the film that is truly as ground-breaking or daring as Schumacher thinks it is. In fact, one can almost sense that the director is far too easily pleased with himself for tackling a hitherto taboo topic. "8mm" has its moments for sure, but on the whole is an under-achieving thriller that can be all-but forgotten a few weeks after seeing it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Snuff's enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film starts with an interesting premise: What if the urban myth of the snuff movie was actually true? So we have Nicholas Cage, as a private detective, visiting the home of an affluent elderly lady (and her attorney- more of him later), who has discovered what seems an authentic death of a young girl recorded on video tape. This could have been developed along the lines of say, The Big Sleep, as a hardboiled detective story with unpredictable twists. Unfortunately the writer, having devised this potentially interesting plot, does very little with it except the obvious. We see Cage search through records and befriend a porn shop employee in his quest for the girl. So far, the film, though uninspired and routine, is watchable. However it will subsequently take a turn into first the ludicrous then the disturbed in its attempts to maintain interest. The ludicrous comes when the attorney is revealed to have a hand in the manufacture of the film. There is a scene which could be described as comic-book were it not for the unnecessary murder of the pornshop employee who has helped Cage. No sympathy is shown towards him; he dies simply to tie up a plot strand. Apart from this, the rest of the scene could be from Home Alone or some other kids' film, with the villains unconvincingly turning on each other while Cage resourcefully escapes. None of this is helped by the banal direction. The needless death of a character should of set alarm bells ringing for what subsequently happens. I hope I am giving nothing away, but Cage ruthless beats one of the villains, ties him up and, after phoning the mother of the murdered girl, sadistically kills him. I found this one of the most shocking scenes in a modern Hollywood film, and indicative of the sickness which seems to have overtaken that once great film-making industry of late. It might be argued that this murder is caused by desensitivation of pornography. If that was in the writer's mind, it certain did not make it onto film. All we see is a nasty man getting his just desserts by the American hero. This way of thinking has lead to Guantamo Bay and that Iraqi prison where the inmates were tortured. It seems ironical that a film against snuff should have a snuff scene (ie one served up for the gratification of the audience) in it. The climax of the film is trite and conventional.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Schumacher tries to be Fincher ... and fails</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't really say that I liked "Se7en" (although I think it's a good movie) - but at least it stayed in my head for a long time and Andrew Kevin Walker's script is surely one of the reasons for that. But this will not happen for "8MM" - and this is probably due to Schumacher's way of putting a promising idea on screen. Many people that submitted a comment on this movie found it "disturbing", "dark", "sick" - I think it was mainly a standard Hollywood thriller with a slightly off-Hollywood subject. Just the fact that the movie deals with underground pornography and snuff films doesn't make it disturbing - a better insight into the characters and their demons would have. Cage's transformation from loving family man to angry avenger is quite unmotivated and many scenes are just soo typical Hollywood thriller-like. I would've liked to see a believable descent down into the personal hell of the main character; "Se7en" did that; in a way Friedkin's "Cruising" did that; "8MM" didn't. Next time I will need more than one good reason (like a script by Walker) to watch a Joel Schumacher movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I usually really like Nicolas Cage, but he STUNK in this one. He genuinely "sleep-walked" through this entire performance. I know I was supposed to feel for the victims, but the story was so poorly written, the dialogue so silly (does ANYONE have a marriage like the one portrayed in the movie?), that I just really didn't care. He better get his stuff together because between "Con Air", "Snake Eyes", and "8mm", he's on a pretty steep downward spiral. Sean Penn can be a real jerk, but his criticism of Cage's choice in movies lately is right on.</fullReview>

A baboon could write better characters, plot and dialog than Andrew Kevin Walker. A private detective traces snuff films in the porn industry, and the filth and sleaze ooze from the every corner. Well, porn industry is undoubtedly a sewer, not some pretty-love-making-under-the-bedclothes-fantasy of the soap operas, and Andrew does not shrink under the challenge to show it. Anywho, our hero kills the human filth behind the snuff films (hello, what did you expect!) and when the cleansing is over, the film ends. The hero is apparently lost his soul, but I watched this from TV, so I saved my money, yai! Someone wrote that this is not a proper film to the teenagers, but actually, this is a PERFECT film to the teenagers, and everybody who is young at heart: there's porn and snuff films and everything is sooo gritty (read: sleazy).</fullReview>

From the beginning when I saw a girl get raped by a flabby man I knew it could be none other than the star of Seinfeld. My Venezuelan heart has been torn into pieces. After I saw the movie I went to my pillow and cried. I had to take work off the next morning I was so upset. Luckily this film is fit for all ages, so you can rent it for the kids. Just cover their eyes during raping and violence scenes. Also watch out for the swearing. Other than that they'll love it. After I took work off I called my mom. Also, the beginning felt vaguely familiar. I could swear that I've met an old lady whose husband died recently and she opened up a secret vault and found a video of a girl getting raped. That leads me to a question. What silly old man would have a video of his granddaughter or something getting raped? It's a good thinking question.

		<fullReview>Does life imitate art, or does art imitate life? This is an age-old question that plagues the mind of many. Whatever the case may be, 8mm is a film that is not to be watched. Both scenarios makes one realize just how low the morals of this world have dropped.Condoning activities that are demoralizing to women and the American society as a whole, the film industry pushed the line with this picture. With a rating of R, any child can walk into this movie and get an eye-full of pornography, sexual abuse, physical abuse, and murder in the same amount of time as a four episodes of a Saturday morning cartoon.There are issues in this film that are highly offensive. There are things in this movie that most people are better off not knowing. Seventeen and eighteen year old children will lose what is left of their scanty innocence if they watch 8mm.In short, this film is vile. The plot lacks; the acting is not exceptional. The story line twists and turns, but not in an appealing way like previous films (such as "Seven"). 8mm is disturbing and should have been rated NC-17 for a state of violence unprecedented in Hollywood.Do not take your children to see this. Do not LET your children see this. Not recommended for your grandmother, your dad, your pastor, your next door neighbor, etc... there is no conceivable reason why you should waste your time and money condoning this film and its activities.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little too realistic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Besides Batman Forever (1995) and Batman &amp; Robin (1997), director Joel Schumacher has made some unique films. Adding to that is his distinct taste for also picking topics to cover that really have no need to brought up. Mainly because it's something not many people would have an interest in. This is exactly where Schumacher goes with this particular subject about an 8mm sex film containing a recorded murder. Great....The man for the job who decides to find out who's behind it is Tom Welles (Nicolas Cage), a family man and devoted worker. And as for the whole film, Cage played his character efficiently through each frame. I also enjoyed how he was able to deduct various clues in the case that he was trying to solve. Even a young Joaquin Phoenix playing a character called Max California puts in a unique performance as well. In fact, Phoenix spews out a few lines that practically sum up the entire film - "You dance with the devil, the devil don't change; the devil changes you". Yikes, that's heavy and deep.But here's what makes this film difficult to enjoy. First, Schumacher dives into the darker world of the sex industry where things begin to get strange and unnerving. That whole aspect can make viewers extremely uncomfortable because it's not just sex anymore where it's all pleasure. Schumacher is good at pushing limits, but that doesn't mean pushing limits makes things enjoyable. Also even though, we (as the audience) are supposed to despise the antagonists, I absolutely loathed them. I hated them enough that I wished they weren't written into the script; it was so sickening.Making the experience worse while watching these criminals on screen was the everlasting story that seemed to drag on and on. The music didn't work either. Composer Mychael Danna's soundtrack is minorly effective in some places but majorly ineffective in the rest. Especially the transition or montage scenes - just plain annoying. Surprisingly, I did enjoy the conclusion to the film but it took an awfully long time to get there. And if it hadn't ended the way it did, my score definitely would have been lower.This detective story may have leads who can act well and have excessive tension, but the story is repulsive by nature, which can make the viewing experience quite uncomfortable. It's definitely a dark thriller, perhaps too dark.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Upon finding a supposed snuff-film in her late-husband's safe, Mrs. Christian (Carter) hires private investigator Tom Welles (Cage), recently garnering praise for his work from the prestigious political circle that Mr. Christian was a part of, to investigate the authenticity of the disturbing S8-film. Unlike a lot of Joel Schumacher's unfair criticism of being passed off as a second class director (the guy isn't trying to make "Chinatown" or "Casablanca" people!), the criticism behind this film has more basis than the typical Schumacher putdown. The film begins very promising, with a creepy and twisted tone that you wouldn't expect Schumacher or Cage to be a part of. When the film nears its second plot-point, it starts to spiral down into a revenge film, praising vigilantism, as if to say, "Don't worry. Our protagonist still isn't as bad as the antagonist." The realism?and insight and/or voyeurism, if you will?of the subject matter, while disturbing, can be commended for its bravery to pull no punches. But the heartbeat of any pros about the film is stopped ? of the way through the film by an over-the-top conclusion? and there isn't even a twist in the end! Yes, the ending is that out of place with the rest of the film.** (out of four)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tough and rather foul snuff movie thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This seems like another well-rendered, generic action thriller until the material of the title begins to grip the picture. Then it gets rough. Joel Schumacher decided to bring the torturous films-within-the-film to the surface. I couldn't say why this is, but given the rather more typical arrangement of the rest of the picture I'm afraid it smacks of controversy-stirring opportunism. That's my opinion.Anyway, the point is I, like many, found this an uncomfortable watch when I rather expected to be whiling away an hour and a half in a tick-box flick. To that extent I didn't mind Cage's Tom Welles wearing a very silly wardrobe without irony or rancour. Gandolfini and Stormare are well-cast as despicable underworldlies; Joaquin Phoenix is unmemorable, although one suspects that's because he did a perfectly good routine job. Approach with caution. 4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>8 mm is a film with little to recommend it other than the sensational subject matter. My main problem with this film is that it is dishonest about its motives. It is basically a vigilante film that pretends to be an exploration of the nature of evil and what drives people to it. The hero is given some minor flaws (he lies about smoking to his wife) but is otherwise a wholesome family man. Nicolas Cage's performance has been described by many as "understated", which I suppose is a euphemism these days for dull and lifeless. The villains have no redeeming features and the film seems to suggest that anyone involved in the sex industry must be a vicious pervert. Worst of all there is little genuine suspense, just some nasty scenes of people being brutally murdered.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>s p o i l e r sThis started out quite boring. Cage has to find an unidentified girl, a couple of clips of him on the phone, using a computer and browsing through photos of missing people. The music stops. There she is. Cage calls his wife: I love you. I miss you. Dark music, very much like the silence of the lambs.Now he has to find out what happened to her, but I'm not going to waste more time in the story because it's boring. It's regular detective stuff, but bad. Not much is left for the audience to figure out, and the little there is is predictable and (you guessed it) boring. ("devil's changing me already") The look of this film was kind of cool though. Cool and dark but not very original. The big houses filmed like that was ripped from a music video called "come to daddy" by director Chris Cunningham. But that's ok with me, since Schumacher played the song by Aphex Twin several times in the film (it's on the vinylplayer at the bad guy's house). I guess he's just a fan of that video just like I am :) Also sometimes I thought the director chose to have us looking at the nice pictures and composition instead of focusing on the conversation. But that might also be because the conversations were rather boring.There are more bad things about this movie but there's one thing that really sucks about it. The last scene where Cage checks his mail, his wife smiling in the kitchen window. He receives a letter from the girl's mother who praises him for murdering. Double moral or what? Maybe I got it all wrong, but the way I see it, this movie thinks revenge and things like death penalties are good things. Which is the complete opposite of the message I got from the writer's other gritty film; Seven. Maybe Schumacher got it all wrong. That happy music shouldn't have been there.Oh yeah I just have to mention one more scene. Did you notice how the bad guy's voice changes when he takes his hood of? I couldn't help but start laughing. And then he puts his glasses on which suddenly appear on the ground. HAHAHA. "Overdone" can't describe it.It has some good points. But overall I found this movie boring, stupid, and good looking.

This film received more opening night giggles than "Deconstructing Harry". If you thought Cage was too energetic in "Snake Eyes'(anybody seen Gary Sinise since?) in 8MM Cage shows Zoloft really does work. Nick is as slow and pained as the last man in the unemployment line. Keneer...nice girl,weak role, not her fault. Joaquin Phoenix is the only one with a target who gives it a real shot. The rest the of the cast runs around on the screen with no particular place to go. An heiress who can't be believed, a porn director who isn't evil enough, a smut peddler who isn't much worse than the local deli owner, a lawyer who's a scum bag, and a porn actor, sex fiend, murderer accountant. Five minutes with a camcorder in front of my apartment building and you've got the same thing.What bothers me the most about this film is that the story is so blatantly stolen from the Lawrence Block novel "A Dance at the Slaughter House" and not in a good way.

It is distracting to the point of being goofy for the title of this film to be so obviously wrong.I did not buy the motivations for many of the central characters. For instance, the elderly widow seemed to not even know her deceased husband's nature after countless years of marriage. She acted as though she had lived a very sheltered innocent life free of real world dealings, yet had no trouble sleuthing out her husbands hidden financial transactions. She disdained cash, yet had not trouble coming up with something like $2 million hard cold one in a very short period of time. She relentlessly pressed on in a cause that could yield nothing good for herself or anyone else. After her death, her man servant did not seem the least bit concerned that he along with all his fellow workers were suddenly unemployed.Many of the other characters behaved in equally hollow plot driven ways.

Here, his intention to make a gritty, no-holds-barred film about the porno underworld is laced with tedious TV crime-drama set-ups and clichés aplenty! Andrew Kevin Walker's screenplay should bear at least half the blame, but the sinking feeling one gets from "8MM" relates largely to way it looks and plays out. Nicolas Cage is wasted in role as investigator trying to determine if a bloody snuff flick is real, and, if not, what happened to the young female victim involved. Intentionally seamy, but unintentionally stupid. Worth-watching if only for a terrific supporting performance by Joaquin Phoenix as a clerk, but poor Catherine Keener has an insulting role as Cage's wife. *1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Schumacher takes what could have been a complex journey into darkness and desire and makes it a poor teenage cop thriller dressed up in adult clothes (minor spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tom Welles is a private investigator who is keen to get mixed with a high level clientele. He takes on the case of a wealthy widow who's husband has just died. In his safe she found what appears to be a porno-snuff movie where a young girl is killed by a masked man. He investigates whether the tape is real or not with the help of adult bookshop worker Max California and finds a disturbing underworld as he tries to track down the makers.I greet the words `A Joel Schumacher Film' with dread. Since `Batman &amp; Robin' I have decided not to pay to watch another of his films ever again ? I will not have it on my conscience to keep this man in a job. Here he proves himself to be a director with a skill for visual flair but to be a hollow and vapid as a man can be when it comes to sense. Worse than that, he is a coward.The plot here held my attention for the first hour. The world of porn is always interesting because I'll never know what it is like, I'll never feel what it is like inside and I'll never see this underbelly that exists. However the film does nothing with this early promise. Instead it chickens out and becomes a vigilante thriller ? that makes it easy for Schumacher. The darkness that is hinted at in Walker's script is never really brought out ? all the characters are one-dimensional and poor. Schumacher fails to explore any of them and takes the easy way out.Machine is the only decent character here and he is wasted in a tense, but disappointingly played `good versus evil' style climax. Schumacher was not the man to do this ? he can only direct visuals and even that is starting to look like a thing of the past. Falling Down is probably the closest thing he did to a complex character, but even then he chickened out and the film was less as a result. I blame him for the failure of this movie ? but I thank God that Walker's script for Se7en was given to a director capable enough to handle the darkness. Schumacher should only be allowed to direct children's films.The performances are really average considering the cast. Cage was ONCE a good actor. Here he is let down by bad direction. You can almost hear Schumacher saying `Nick, you know that intense, disturbed look you do? Well can you do that for the whole film please?'. It's that bad, it really is one-dimensional. Cage tries hard but his character is so badly written and the slide into a vigilante is unconvincing. Phoenix is actually good and is the sort of honest guide we needed, but once he is gone then that's that. Gandolfini, a man of immense talent when given good roles is terrible, short scenes and 1D. Stormare is just as bad. Bauer is only given one scene to do a good job and he manages it with a few lines of dialogue to explain himself ? but Schumacher sacrifices him in the name of a traditional climax.Overall this starts well but really never goes near the darkness it hints at. Schumacher cannot do anything other than `good versus evil' simple stories and this is too much for him to handle. His weakness shines through in most of the film despite a few good scenes and a good Phoenix. At one point in the film Max says `you're going to see things you'll wish you could un-see'. He was referring to this film - a traditional cop thriller dressed up as a grownup journey into darkness.</fullReview>

A great idea for a film but just badly executed in a 'Hollywood formula' kind of way. You know what's going to happen next and the big twist near the end where the bad guy is revealed can be seen coming from a mile off. If the concept of this film interests you then I suggest you watch Paul Schrader's "Hardcore" with George C.Scott for a true feeling of what I think this film was trying to achieve</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So, this is supposed to be radical? Just listen to Nick Cage's words: "Please, give me permission to avenge your daughter's death!" Or even worse: "Save me", as he cries in her wife's lap. But, when I think again, what could we expect from a director such as Scumacher? Has he made a decent movie yet? This is kindergarten stuff, NOT a disturbing movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nicolas Cage is an extraordinary actor who deserves all the kudos he should need, but after seeing this film, there was something I would have never said about him: boring. This type of casualty does not leave out that Catherine Keener, a fantastic actresses, was only reduced to the role, very limited role, as Cage's wife.A large problem with "8MM" is that it manipulates us, and turns us into voyeurs then becomes pharisaical about what is in it."8MM" doesn't include anything but cheap sense datum. It feigns to explore ethical equivocalness, then encounters shortcuts so Tom Welles (Nicolas Cage) can be a hero and a vigilance man.The film is also very slow moving, penalizingly gruesome, and most often atrocious to deal.The film's director Joel Schumacher (Batman &amp; Robin, A Time To Kill, Batman Forever), does the usual visual overdraw. The scenery is far too comic book type, as with the porn kings skylark in disordely-churrigueresco sets that appear as borrowed from the film "Dark City.""8MM" turns casual day-to-day evil into a Marvel comic book that we can disregard. It is an exploitation film that is trying to be passed off as art. The score however by Mychael Danna, is probably the only enjoyable experience from "8MM". It does not tell you what it is trying to say and it just drives your face into the dirt.All in all, the most profound thing "8MM" has to say is that, "Nasty people are bad." I can get that from my parents.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film wouldn't be so bad if it weren't trying so hard. Schumacher seems to have aimed at taking a long, hard look at the hardcore porn industry but any depth is lost in a string of "action film" cliches. (The final answer to the question "why this violence?" seems to be "because I felt like it" - which could be interesting if done properly, but not when preceded and followed by scenes of the familiar hero-straining-to-reach-gun-behind-iron fence sequence.) Nicolas Cage is a terrific actor but otherwise, why bother?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't see this movie, especially if you're a girl. Neither I nor my companions had any idea what it was about, and it turned out to be the most disturbing movie I've ever seen in my life. A woman I talked to afterwards said she cried the whole way through it. I, myself, left the theater shaking. This was a horrifying, unnerving movie. It unveiled a world I've always tried to believe did not exist. I've always been too involved with behind-the-scenes stuff to be affected by movies, but this movie scarred me. I wish I had not seen it and I don't think there's any reason anyone SHOULD see it. If anything, it will only promote the industry it (hopefully) was intended to bemoan.

		<shortDescription>Snuffing Out The Past</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Columbia Pictures should have kept "8mm" in the can. If you thought Nicolas Cage's previous movie "Snakes Eyes" was crappy, director Joel Schumacher's second-rate, slipshod, murder-mystery about a runaway girl, a snuff movie, and our pornographic society may alter your opinion. Co-starring Joaquin Phoenix and James Gandolfini, "8mm" lacks originality, kinky intensity, and catharsis. Although the filmmakers take audiences on a tour of the sleazy hindquarters of American society, "8mm" balks at pushing the envelope in its depiction of decadence. Never as disturbing as the Al Pacino movie "Cruising," the George C. Scott film "Hardcore," or the Charles Bronson's thriller "Kinjite: Forbidden Subjects," this darkly lensed pseudo-suspenser simmers far too long before the plot comes to a boil. Fans of "Se7en" scenarist Andrew Kevin Walker may wonder how much Columbia diluted his script to yield such comatose claptrap.When an industrial czar's rich widow, Mrs. Christian (Myra Carter of "The Witches of Salem: The Horror and the Hope"), opens her recently deceased husband's safe, she discovers what she suspects is a snuff movie. In this one-reel film, a young girl appears to die at the hands of a leather-clad sadist. The elderly Mrs. Christian hires clean-cut, buttoned-down Tom Welles, a small potatoes private eye, to determine the authenticity of the snuff film. Welles accepts the assignment without high hopes. He treats it as a missing person's case. Once he has identified the girl as May Anne Matthews (Jenny Powell), he contacts Mary Anne's working class mom (Amy Morton) and snoops around the runaway's room.The trail takes Welles to the West Coast where he hires a smart-aleck porno-store clerk, Max California (Joaquin Phoenix), with an encyclopedic knowledge of kink to guide him through the underworld of hardcore pornography. Max warns Tom before he begins his tour, "There are things you're going to see that you can't unsee." Max is a tough young man who has not let the filth and pornography affect him. When Tom Welles meets him, Max has a clover of a cheap porno novel wrapped around a copy of Truman Capote's bestseller "In Cold Blood." Throughout the case, Tom grapples with the question that bugs him about the dead millionaire: "Why did he want to film a little girl being butchered?" Tom keeps L.A. porno producer Eddie Poole (James Gandolini of "True Romance") under surveillance until Poole leads him to a guy who produced the snuff movie, the infamous Dino Velvet (Peter Stormare of "Armageddon"), who has his headquarters in New York City.Tom and Max fly to the Big Apple, contact the fiendish Dino, and give him the front money for the movie. Tom has one condition: they must allow him to observe them as they film. At this point, Tom sends Max packing out of harm's way, before he confronts the pornographers in an abandoned warehouse at the edge of town. The killers surprise Tom and turn the tables on him. "Satan ex machine," quips the nasty Dino with relish as he shows Tom that they knew about him from the start. Further disclosure would spoil what little suspense Schumacher conjures up."Se7en" scenarist Andrew Kevin Walker has inked a lukewarm murder-mystery yarn shot on surprises but long on clichés. The co-scenarist on "Hideaway" (1995), Walker provides standard set-pieces such as a rain swept graveyard fight, a "Silence of the Lambs" confrontation in a creepy house, an "In Cold Blood" style murder sequence, and a "Death Wish" vigilante hero. The villains epitomize stereotypical predators who pose little threat to the sanitized knight hero. The action plods more often than it pulsates. Obviously, Schumacher deploys atmosphere (i.e., set design) as a smoke screen to cover up the pornographic material that good taste and censorship prevent him from showing. Indeed, as prudish as "8mm" is, the filmmakers had to contrive something more than prurience to attract an audience."8mm" makes the most of Nicolas Cage and shows Joaquin Phoenix at his best. Cage imbues "8mm" with his unique brand of underdog charm and antithetical heroism. Cage plays Welles as a sad-faced Sam Spade with a nagging wife (Catherine Keener) and an infant daughter. Young, ambitious, mobile, and polished, Tom devotes himself to his family. When he isn't on a case, he's raking the front yard. Tom is the heart and soul of "8mm," and the filmmakers make him tough, resourceful, but vulnerable and hen-pecked. Tom Welles serves as the conscience and custodian of morality of "8mm." A great deal of John Wayne's Ethan Edwards from director John Ford's "The Searchers" jostles for prominence in Nicolas Cage's performance. Eventually, Tom begins to obsess over poor Mary Anne Matthews and her plight. Cage struggles to make straight-arrow Tom Welles a flesh and blood fellow, but Schumacher doesn't abet him. Tom Welles doesn't have much of a back-story. "8mm" is another exercise in masculine control, and the film charts his growth from law-abiding private eye to lone vigilante.The bad guys in "8mm" wear their villainy like placards. Four villains menace Tom Welles, but the fourth is not unmasked until the climax. All deserve to die, and as the offal of humanity they earn miserable, ignominious deaths. As a porno-movie producer, Eddie Poole (James Gandolfini) elicits nothing but contempt as the kind of verminous scum who sodomizes women, guzzles liquor, curses blasphemously, and dresses like a lout. He is a repository of politically-incorrect and socially unacceptable traits. As another porno producer, Dino Velvet (Peter Stormare) hams it up with a crossbow and the beard of a vaudeville villain. Chris Bauer creates evil incarnate as 'Machine,' the leather-clad star of S &amp; M videos who kills because he enjoys it. Machine's speech at the end of "8mm" serves as a commentary on the face of evil.Altogether, "8mm" is a dull, clammy, little exercise in voyeurism and perversion. Columbia Pictures and director Joel Schumacher couldn't have contrived a better bedtime story for the Super Court Justices to lull themselves asleep to than "8mm."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Embarrassingly bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching '8 millimeters', I have a question. Why was this film made? I don't know movies, only words, so when I see words so badly used, it makes me sad. And when a good idea and good actors can't find even mediocre talent for the script or direction, my sadness is like a funeral in the rain. For poor Nick Cage, a good actor, getting mixed up in this whirlpool of weary words was a classic mistake. Why don't agents protect their actors from these talent-free zones? Surely any professional reading of this grotesque script must have revealed way in advance how badly things would turn out ... or was the paycheck simply too enormous to knock back? I'd really like to know who backed these two hours of lost time. Perhaps there's something I'm missing - like was it designed to be bad, lose money and reduce studio taxation? Hollywood does this, and it genuinely mystifies me. All I could ask myself as this thing built to its inevitably Gothic climax was ... with loads of fine writing and directing talent available ...why this?</fullReview>

The evil are evil and sick as what, but even the main character isn't good. I suppose the creators wanted to say that everyone, even a good man have a little of bad inside, but then the end of the movie leaves such stupid feeling.. Glad that I didn't pay for going to watch this to cinema. The movie starts with such an interesting setup. But in the middle and towards the end, movie loses it's elements and becomes meaningless revenge and killing. What gives the movie it's final "touch" is stupid and amateurish drama that gives "acceptance" for all that revenge and killing.I rarely see such a poor movie, even in these Hollywood stuff. Goes to the same box with "Pearl Harbor". Yes, definably so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie may be the worst movie I have ever seen. It actually is one of a handful of movies that I have given my minus rating to, in this case a -10. My minus ratings go to a movie who's content is so negative and horrible with the only intent to make a person feel worse for having encountered it. These type of movies just should never have been made, period. Forget the acting quality, the realism, the script, etc that should normally indicate a quality piece of film making. This film was not made for any other reason than to make people feel worse for having watched it....to introduce people to something that is disgusting and disturbing. I've seen plenty of movies with violence and gore in them, but 8mm is not like those movies ...its in a class by itself....the lowest class there is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me preface this by saying I enjoyed this movie up until the last 5-10 minutes. It is a murder mystery with absolutely no mystery at all. The entire movie you find yourself trying to pick up little clues as Cage goes from one locale to the next trying to figure out what it is that Schumacher is going to try and shock you with. The problem lies in that this is completely fruitless in the end. There is no mystery to be solved although it is made to feel that way. Save your money here and read up on snuff films on wikipedia and then just watch the last 10 minutes of this film as that is the only part that has anything to do with the story. The rest is all just fluff. Cage is good as usual but at some point someone has to read the last few pages of his scripts for him. (See wicker man)</fullReview>

Fair to say if he told me beforehand the movie was about a detective trying to uncover a snuff movie making industry, I would have said "sounds great, but I might sit this one out." Basically the movie revolves around a detective (Cage) falling upon a movie that shows someone being for real killed during a sex scene. As he searches he discovers there's a whole industry going on that he must uncover before more people die. Sounds crazy hey? As you can imagine there's some disturbing imagery, most of which my therapist says I'm over now. Not one for the kiddies</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Up to the point where Nicolas Cage -- as an investigator searching for the truth behind a Super 8 "snuff" film found in a dead banker's safe -- flies to New York, I could kind of buy a lot of the plot points in this movie. The pacing was good in the beginning, particularly in the scenes with Cage and the dead girl's mother. There was also some great interplay between Cage and Joaquin Phoenix, playing an employee of an adult bookstore who "guides" Cage through the seamy (and laughably implausible) 'underground world' of L.A. porn. But all of the scenes after this began to stretch the boundaries of credibility. It was as if director Schumacher had watched too many James Bond films or something. It became so over-the-top and unbelievable that my friends and I (and a large part of the audience at the Hollywood Cinerama Dome) started to laugh at the so-called "serious" parts. The part where Cage hugs his wife and implored her to "save me" brought down the house! On one level this is a very funny movie. See it for laughs, or, better yet, if you are interested at all in the subject matter, watch the Paul Schrader directed film, "Hardcore" starring George C. Scott which is far better.</fullReview>

The bad guys have adopted sleeze as a total life style, i.e., they not only have sleezy jobs, they wear sleezy clothes, decorate their offices with junk store discounts, and prefer to live in urban slums. Tom Welles (Nicholas Cage) is a private eye who is able to learn the identity of the snuff film victim with a lot of improbable good luck. He plods through the film with the energy of someone with low blood pressure! The film is neither disturbing or exciting. It is boring and stupid!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's the point ?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I felt physically sick for one whole day after seeing 8MM. This film is about a subject nobody wants to hear about, and it made me feel ashamed of being a human being. How can humans do such things as raping and murdering young teenagers, children, and even babies I do not understand. This film is about all this, and I can only strongly recommend that you don't go and see it, despite the very good performance of Nicolas Cage, excellent as always. After this film I think it is time for everybody to ask themselves if there is any point in showing in films the kind of horrors displayed for two hours in 8MM. What's the point of cinema? If you think it is to raise emotions of shame and disgust, them 8MM is for you. I don't think 8MM should ever have been made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the worst movie I have ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My respect for Nicolas Cage completely deflated after seeing 8MM. I was shocked at the general publics acceptance and interest in the film and the unbelivable remarks of the film having artistic and creative qualities. It repulsed me as a woman and a person; the use of violence is for the sake of violence. I left the theater and almost vomited.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>are you kidding?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although this movie is not disturbingly gory and does not have so much nudity that it will make you vomit, 8mm is just plain DUMB. snooweatinganima was right, there are so many cliches in the damn thing that it's impossible to take it seriously. Although I have to admit that "the machine" was one of the more humorous characters I have ever scene on film. He bore a pleasant resemblance to Bane from Batman &amp; Robin, another noble attempt by the amazing Joel Schummacher. Make sure that when you see this movie that you aren't watching it on a dark stormy night, in a slum, next to a cemetery, on a broken TV, with loud scary techno music blasting in the background, or god forbid, you might be attacked by a group of bloodthirsty hard-core porno makers!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A complete unbelievable story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a piece of crap. First of all, did the producers and the writers ever stopped to ask if such events ever existed. The storyline was boring and the camera took the viewers to practically all the slumps in the United States. The story also puts a biased negative views on people with special interest specifically it portrays the S&amp;M group as a bunch of sadistic killers going around cutting people up for a movie in pretty much the same fashion as how gays and lesbians are portrayed as less than human by some parties. Has there been any high profile FBI cases that depicts a wealthy millionaire contracting sick killers to cut up someone in real life ? Is this a frequent criminal occurrence where people frequently get chopped up for some private films ? Because the film seemed to have portrayed that there is a whole industry specialized in kidnapping and cutting up people for short movies. This is completely inaccurate and the studios should feel ashamed for misleading, bias discrimination of specific groups of people and should be taken off the shelves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Hollywood garbage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like all sorts of movies, but I like foreign films and Independent films the best. Hollywood has a way of sticking big directors and big stars on a film and promoting the hell out of it and making people watch it and therefore it gets popular when in reality it shouldn't be. This is a good case.One might find interest in this if they didn't know that such a world existed, but it is very real and it's old news. If this had been a movie with insight into the minds of people who do this kind of stuff, I would have enjoyed it.It is about a private investigator (played by the very boring Nicolas Cage) who is hired to find out if a snuff film is real and if so who made it. He goes on a search into the dark underground world of porn and looks for his answers and meets many bad characters along the way.This thriller just bored me, it needed to shock the audience and show them violent torture, yet its just the idea and the awareness of it is all you receive. I didn't care about anyone on this film, I did not know the young girl in question, the film gave her no soul or no character and I didn't feel sorry for her. Her mother's tears didn't make me sad, if it had been a loving home this would not have happened anyway, so too late for tears now Mommy dearest. The old woman who hired Cage in the first place was the only person I felt sorry for, she was great, and made me care for her.Shumacher sucks as a director and never does anything outstanding to me, he has no unique style and I can't believe so many people like him. Cage is so over the top and funny to watch, he sucks so bad yet he too has fans. James Gandolfini is a great actor and plays one of the bad guys here, can't ask for anyone better as well as Peter Stormare, he was born to play a villain. Anthony Heald is in here and even if he played Santa Claus in a movie he still comes off with an evil vibe. Joaquin Phoenix plays a punk here and I have no problem with him, I think he done an excellent job here.Thrills, there are few, shocking moments are even less. The movie has disturbing images for those who are bothered by such things, but it has no torture or anything so its okay for the squeamish to watch.I think of it as drama, what I see is a movie about a man obsessed with his job and making his own family suffer because of it, to me his wife is hurting more than the girl in the snuff film, the girl in the snuff film is running away from something and got lost along the way, Cages wife in this movie is running towards something but being pushed away..to me thats sad.I don't know what to say other than if you like boring drama's with a touch of excitement this may be for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>8mm, Makes Battlefield Earth look like Emipire Strikes Back</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this a number of years ago with 2 friends. It only emerged after we had watched this twaddle that we realised we had all had the same feeling as it had started up. GET ME OUT OF HERE! This film should never have been made by whoever made it, let alone should they have been allowed out of the padded cell they so rightly belong in. 1. I now can't watch any Nic Cage film without feeling angry. 2. Titanic now looks like quite a good film. 3. I am still so upset by this mess of a pig sty, that i am writing this!Never ever ever ever go see this film, instead, go and watch the free video you get when you buy your new mobile phone, you know, the 30 second demo of what it can do. Watch it 100 times, then you might appreciate that what you have just done will never make you so angry to have wasted your time on a film that is garbage.Acting - 1/10 Story - 1/10 Directing - 1/10 Satisfaction when it ends - 10/10RUBBISH!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie made me sick.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not one to watch Rated R movies. My husband on the other hand enjoys the Violence in them.I don't mind the violence but the foul language &amp; Partial nudity is what gets me mad.I figured this movie wouldn't be so bad, I was so wrong.This movie has some strong language but an extreme amount of sex/nudity in it.So if you like that stuff, then this movie is for you. If you are like me and don't enjoy it or to save you an embarrassing moment of watching it in front of "Someone who won't approve" then be warned.I wish I ?d come here to check on this movie before renting it.I will know next time.</fullReview>
