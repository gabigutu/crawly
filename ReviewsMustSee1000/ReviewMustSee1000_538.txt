		<shortDescription>The Dardennes score again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Dardenne brothers (L'Enfant, Lorna's Silence) once again demonstrate their mastery for crafting character studies around broken souls trying to get by in France, with their newest film, The Kid With A Bike. The film opens with young Cyril Catoul (Thomas Doret), trying to break free from an orphanage to see his father, while everyone around him is trying to explain that his father has left him there. It's a heartbreaking opening, immediately giving us a taste of the magnificent performance that Doret will continue to demonstrate over the course of the film. Cyril is desperate to escape their clutches and refuses to listen to their pleas for understanding. He's a rebellious young boy, unyielding in his cause and so sure that there must be some explanation; surely his father couldn't be that cruel. Of course the audience knows the revelation he is most likely going to receive.Soon he comes into the care of Samantha (the always great Cecile De France), a hairdresser in the town nearby who runs into him by chance, and this is where the film really starts to succeed. The relationship at the core of the film isn't with Cyril and his father (whom we do eventually meet), but instead with him and Samantha. Cyril spends his time pouting, rebelling and generally being your standard adolescent boy, while Samantha tries to become this mother never had. Cecile De France is an actress I'm always interested to watch, with her expressive face that she's put to great use in many films before this but never so well as she does here. Samantha's resilience towards Cyril's constant attempts to pull away make it clear that she must have come from a situation similar to his, and is fighting so fiercely to make sure he doesn't face the fate that she knows exists. In a town filled with troubled youths, Samantha fought her way out the other side and she wants to bring Cyril there with her. It's a very warming dynamic and the Dardennes really make you feel all of the highs and lows of it. This isn't your standard character study; you feel these characters like very few films can make you do.One of the most sensational aspects of the picture is the performance anchoring it all from Thomas Doret. Watching Doret, I couldn't help but be reminded of the young Jean-Pierre Leaud in The 400 Blows. Cyril is a rebel in the purest form, broke down by the society he's been born into and constantly fighting back against the authority figures in his life. But unlike Leaud's Antoine Doinel, Cyril isn't looking for freedom here; he's looking for acceptance. Throughout the film Cyril is pulled in a multitude of directions, but the only one he wants to get pulled into is the arms of his father; and in the twisted harshness of life, that's the one direction that just pushes him away. Doret completely embodies this character, absent of any tick or fallacy that generally comes with a child actor. It's got to be the finest child performance put on screen in quite some time. The boy isn't some adorable little kid; he's a real person and sometimes he drives you insane, but you always end up rooting for him when it comes down to it. My heart sank in the moments with his father (played well by Dardennes regular Jeremie Renier), warmed in the few bright spots in his life and when he was in danger I almost drew blood from digging my nails into my palm due to the tension.Along with the emotional journey that the Cyril/Samantha dynamic takes you on, the Dardennes also imbue the film with a dark fairy tale metaphor that I found added a great new layer to Cyril's story. Cyril spends the film wearing a variety of red tops, clearly representing our Riding Hood lost in the woods, and at a certain point he encounters our version of the Big Bad Wolf; a troubled youth who didn't have the luxury of a Samantha in his life. This Wolf is the counter to Samantha's mother figure and Cyril is a broken soul caught in a world where he could walk down the dark path of the drug dealers and thieves or into the light that Samantha tries to open up to him. It's a strikingly human story that keeps you on your toes and grasps your heart. I won't reveal the final path that Cyril ends up taking, but it kept me in tears for the final ten or fifteen minutes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Parenting: No License Necessary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. When Guy (Jeremie Renier) states that he can't take care of his son Cyril (Thomas Douret) right now, I felt a rush of anger and disgust. Imagine if you were his 11 year old son hearing those words. Young kids should be able to count on their parents for emotional security above all else. There should be no fear of abandonment ... those are issues no child should be forced to deal with (barring a natural disaster).The Belgium writer/director team of brothers Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne have a history of taking on parenthood and childhood in a head-on manner. Cyril is dumped in an orphanage by his dad, and is convinced that he is just misplaced, not abandoned. So being the fiercely determined kid he is, he re-traces his steps from coffee shops to bars to their old apartment. Cyril is convinced his dad never would have sold his treasured bicycle, no matter how desperate for money he was.Whatever confusion and hostility that you think Cyril might experience, once he confronts his dad, the filmmakers display it in the rawest possible form. Cyril is a symbol of need, hiding behind a wall of rebellion. A chance encounter with Samantha (Cecile de France) leads to weekend visitations and the start of an awkward quasi-family life for both of them. Cyril tests Samantha and all other authority figures in every possible manner, often to the breaking point.As a parent, it's easy to spot the vulnerabilities that a child faces before they have the maturity to handle it. We see how easily Cyril falls in with the wrong crowd and how quickly things can get really bad. Luckily for Cyril, Samantha doesn't abandon him. She answers "I don't know" to his question of why she let him stay with her. Although, the filmmakers never let us in on her deepest thoughts, we suspect she was once not all so different than Cyril, and someone stepped up for her.This film won the Grand Jury Prize at Cannes in 2011 and it's easy to see how. It shows how difficult and messy ordinary life can be, but how often things turn out OK, though rarely perfect. Film lovers will recognize Cecile de France from her many films, including the recent Hereafter and the excellent Mesrine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Miracle Worker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently saw this at the 2012 Palm Springs International Film Festival. This was Belgium's official submission to the Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film and won the Grand Prix as the Jury Prize winner at the Cannes film Festival. Cyril Catoul (Thomas Doret) is living in a state run home and school for children after his single parent father Guy Catoul (Jérémie Renier) abandoned him. Cyril's father promised him that he wouldn't sell his beloved bike and when the father never returns to take him from the state care he sets out in search of his father and his bike. A kind single woman, Samantha, (Cécile De France) takes pity on him and tracks down the bicycle that his father had sold and buys it and returns it to Cyril. Samantha soon takes Cyril in to live with her part-time. Cyril is a very troubled young boy and is longing to belong and have a family. He has a temper and is a candidate for a troubled life. From writers/directors/producers the Dardenne brothers, this is a good story with fine acting. I'm sure for the role of Cyril, the directors instructed first time actor Doret, to act like a brat and be who he isn't. It worked well. De France is great as the strong and sympathetic Samantha. The story moves along well with a good score and nice editing. It's a little implausible at times and kind of far-fetched but it's a crowd pleaser and I would give it an 8.0 and recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Letting Go of Anger</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If "The Kid with a Bike" were an English language film, chances are it would be structured so that the title character wouldn't find his father until the end, at which point there would be some kind of emotional climax and narrative resolution. But this French-speaking drama is directed by Jean-Pierre Dardenne and his brother, Luc, who are known for stark, naturalistic films devoid of sentiment. Through their telling of "The Kid with a Bike," the title character finds his father within the first third, at which point it's made abundantly clear that the latter wants absolutely nothing to do with the former. The kid must therefore navigate the rest of the film in search of an entirely different emotional climax ? assuming that there is one to find. Even if there is, it will not present itself in a moment of sweeping melodrama.The kid's name is Cyril (Thomas Doret), a troubled eleven-year-old boy in foster care. He refuses to believe that his father would simply abandon him, despite the fact that he has never called, visited, or even lived up to his promise of returning for him after only one month. In the opening scene, Cyril repeatedly dials the number to their old apartment with frantic determination. He gets the same answer: A few beeps, and an automated voice telling him the number has been disconnected. Blind to the reality of the situation, Cyril escapes and returns to the apartment. Sure enough, every room is empty. In fact, they have been empty for an entire month. Worse still, Cyril's beloved bicycle has gone missing. He was sure his father would have given it to him.By pure chance, he runs into a hairdresser named Samantha (Cécile de France), who later returns the bike to Cyril. She tells him it was sold to her by someone who bought it from Cyril's father. Cyril dismisses the idea. The bike was obviously stolen. He goes on believing this until he sees a personal ad written by his father taped to the window of a mechanic's garage. Yes, he was looking to sell his son's bike. Despite his growing disillusionment, Cyril has found a place in the life of Samantha, who agrees to be his foster parent on weekends. The two begin a citywide search for his father, Guy (Jérémie Renier), who's eventually found at a restaurant working as a cook. Cyril is eager to pick up where they left off. Guy is anything but. He gives the usual excuses about money, time, and simply being unable. As if any reason would suffice. He tells his son, calmly but firmly, to never try and see him again.Cyril's disillusionment has now devolved into total heartbreak. After successfully fighting off a teen who tried to steal his bike, he soon finds himself in the company of a thug named Wes, known locally as The Dealer (Egon Di Mateo). He takes Cyril under his wing. We get a brief look at Wes' difficult personal life ? a bedridden grandmother who needs constant care, an unseen grandfather who in all likelihood spends his time away from home at a bar ? although that doesn't make the attention he gives to Cyril any less disquieting. Our suspicions are eventually confirmed, although I will not reveal why, as it involves a sequence of events too intertwined with the film's final scenes. Let it suffice to say that Wes is indeed trouble, and that Samantha was absolutely correct in urging Cyril to stay away from him.Cyril is a product of his own rotten luck, a wayward boy who has been conditioned to distrust adults or anyone in a position of authority. He does choose to be with Samantha, but only because she unreservedly returned him his bike; he remains unmindful of the love and support she's so clearly giving him, even after she chooses him over her boyfriend. Her reasons for taking him in are never given, a fact that's sure to divide audiences. I myself remain torn over it. The part of me that responds well to Americanized sentiment and concrete explanations wanted a psychological profile, a dip into the well from which her maternal instincts spring. The other part of me, the one that appreciates enigmatic characters and situations, understands that an explanation isn't necessary. The fact that she's drawn towards Cyril and is driven to help him should be enough.In its own low key, unemotional way, the film sends a rather beautiful message: You can move forward with your life if you learn to let go of anger and resentment. The trick is to hear it without the aid of a cinematic filter. There will be no large orchestral swells, no slow motion shots of Cyril running into Samantha's arms, no tearful admissions of love. There's only the sense that a chapter has ended, and one need only to turn the page. There's also the feeling that a fresh start is indeed possible, sometimes (perhaps even especially) after a traumatic event that could easily have been avoided. If anyone tells you that "The Kid with a Bike" is a father/son story, smile politely and tactfully inform him or her that they either weren't paying attention or lied about having seen it.-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A future classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Not everyone can be an orphan." Andre Gide A kid with only a bike and no mother or active father---now that's a setup for sentiment. Yet the Dardenne brothers have fashioned an unsentimental, realistic drama, The Kid with a Bike, about an 11 year old boy, Cyril (Thomas Doret), who is fortunately taken in by a guardian, town hairdresser Samantha (Cecile De France), but not without serious setbacks that are understandable given his unstable background.The title evokes thoughts of the famous Italian neo-realist Bicycle Thief, in which a young boy is introduced to life's hard knocks through an imperfect father. In Kid, the father is a deadbeat deserter whose brief appearances are depressing because it's clear a reconnection with his son is not going to happen.Cyril is running through most of the film, either by bike or foot, a motif signifying his desperate desire for a parent. However blood does not have to be in the loving equation as Samantha becomes a willing surrogate.No surprise The Boy with the Bike won the Grand Jury Prize at Cannes (2011) and the directors several times before in multiple categories. The humanity rather than the technicality dominates the emotionality; the two principal actors, Doret and De France, are incomparably natural and convincing. Make no mistake, this is a film about a boy, whose character arc the directors fully present. Whether or not he ends up for good through all the turmoil is the pleasure of watching this soon-to-be classic.You may think again about leaving your child with only his bicycle.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cyril, a young boy of about 12, is abandoned by his deadbeat father in the care of some sort of group home. He obsessively tries to reunite with his father, and in the process, falls into the hands of a surrogate mother... and a rather shady surrogate father. The Dardennes aren't straying much from their established style, but there's no reason to. Again, we have a highly effective look at people in emotional crisis and in the grips of moral dilemmas. Throughout the film you're questioning your reactions to things (boy, that Cyril seems like an awful little monster at first) or asking "What would I do?" Again, the camera-work is immediate and unfettered by stylistic flourishes, putting you right inside the lives of these characters. Again, the performances are so natural they feel almost documentary. While I don't think Thomas Doret is as powerful a young actor as Emilie Dequenne in ROSETTA or other Dardenne leads, he does win you over after an unsympathetic start. The movie deals with several parallel themes, the most prominent being one of finding love and acceptance where you can, but it doesn't simply hammer on that one and leaves room for other avenues. I'm not sure yet if I would put this among the best of the Dardennes, but it made a strong first impression.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>100 ways to get messed up in life and yes, love is the answer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If one word can describe the theme of this beautiful cinema, then it is love. I think you can call it a love story. No, not a romantic one, but an obsession to have someone that accept and love you, isn't is universal? And of you are a kid that love comes normally from your parents. If it isn't there, what you're going to do? Well, Cyril knows one thing. He must have it. Even when he cannot find his father, the only person who suppose to give him unconditional love, he keeps searching. Even when his father does not want to see him, he keeps coming and begging for his love. And one time, in one second that he could not go anywhere because people chasing him, he thought he had to cling to something, someone, and fast. In that second that he had to decide who is to be clung to among all people in the room, he clinged to Samantha. And boy, what a cling. That is the first encounter between the boy and the woman who loves him. Unconditionally. Well, I expect a melodrama after this, but it is far from that. The plot and the acting prevent any king of melodrama and kitsch. Anyway, Cyril encounters several paths that would almost ruin his life, or even take his life. This is told convincingly, thanks to excellent performance of this young actor. The final scene touched me the most when Cyril seemingly to decide to choose life because of love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Dardennes show us that they are great film makers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Dardenne brothers have their own style of film making. Just like those other famous brothers, the Coens, their films are instantly recognizable. They are always about people in some kind of trouble. They are always filmed in a cinema vérité-style. They always seem to sympathize with the underdogs in society. And they always focus on the dramatic aspects, not on the plot or the cinematography. 'Le gamin au vélo' is no exception. This time, the story is about a young boy in search for his father, and the hairdresser who takes care of him. The seemingly simple events are filmed in a gripping style, full of intensity. What really stands out in this film is the way the young boy, Cyril, is played by Thomas Doret. His obsessive determination to find his father is completely convincing. Cyril is not a sympathetic child. In fact, his stubborn and strange behaviour is sometimes so irritating that you want to slap him in the face. In the very first scene of the film, the Dardennes show us that they are great filmmakers. We see a boy dialing a telephone number that is disconnected. A man tells him to stop, because it is useless, but he keeps on dialing the same number. It shows us the boy's obsession for his father. Cyril cannot accept the fact that his father has left him, and he clings to the number that was his only connection to him. The same thing goes for the bicycle (the 'vélo' from the title). His father gave it to him, so it has a special meaning. That's why Cyril cherishes the bike. The first part of the film is full of extremely strong dramatic scenes. Take for instance the moment Samantha, the hairdresser, seems to break down in spite of her infinite patience with Cyril. After Cyril has left her house, although she has forbidden him to go out, she starts sobbing. But after a few seconds, she recollects herself, takes the phone and calls the orphanage. That such simple things have such great dramatic meaning, is the power of the Dardenne's film making. Another very intense moment is when Samantha breaks up with her boyfriend because of Cyril. The boyfriend tells her: it's him or me. And she answers: it's him. The second half of the movie is less powerful. The events after Cyril has found his father are not as intense as the first scenes, but still make good cinema. The weak point is the ending. The story just seems to stop, without any final statement or conclusion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love &amp; Affection breaking the (bi)cycle of Violence &amp; Despair</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A beautiful film. One that pulls you in by the honest and genuine storytelling told in the Dardenne brothers' trademark naturalistic and guileless tone that is refreshing and sorely missed in today's too often rambunctious style of movies.The story is simple and organic, the kid initially breaking out of foster care to find his father, and his bike both of which give him some identity and purpose in the world. He befriends several characters along the way (and in the Dardennes films, the characters are few, but all play vital roles) including the benevolent Samantha (whom I thought was very sweet but perhaps too pretty - and talented - to play a working- class hairdresser). Some characters are good (Samantha), some not so (Wes) and some have their own agendas to make a living.In this way, the film is not unlike (and I quote the Dardennes) a fairytale - the boy (hero) on quest in the wide world which various characters and dangers lurking, yet set in this ultra realistic (read social-realist) setting.The style of film-making here is pure and simple in that social-realist style, simply presenting characters who live on the fringe of society; who live in poor social economic conditions or don't have the opportunity of good schooling or the genuine love of a mother or father. As a result it is perhaps a little easier to understand why Cyril acts the way he does, rebelling against society, trying to find his place in the world. As you watch perhaps keep in mind what you might do to make ends meet.The kid is astounding in a first-time performance, he conveys so much frustration, anger, pathos, regret with just glances and looks, most of the screen time without dialogue. Just watch the sequences when he is cycling on his bike, utterly free, chasing (or escaping) his life as the master of his own destiny.This is a very simple &amp; heartfelt tale, it tells the story as it is with no artifice, shot in the gorgeous dappled sunlight of a Belgian summer. It is not as hard-hitting and gritty as other of the Dardennes' films, such as emotional sledgehammers like Rosetta, Le Fils &amp; L'Infant, but, it is still very good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remarkable movie dealing desperation, depression and unfairness of the life.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Le gamin au vélo ? The Kid with a Bike ? CATCH IT (A) Le gamin au vélo is a heartwarming French movie from duo directors Jean-Pierre Dardenne &amp; Luc Dardenne. The movie revolves around a12 year old kid abandoned by his father, giving to orphanage trying hard to first find his father and then dealing with his rejection. During this time he bonds an unusual friendship with his town's hairdresser, who offers to foster him during weekend. The Kid with a Bike deals with the desperation, depression and unfairness of the life. The movie brings out strong emotions out of its lead characters. They are trapped and miserable in front of life, whether it's the young abandoned kid, or insolvent father or a hairdresser who agrees to foster a ragging child in random act of kindness. Thomas Doret as Cyril delivered one of the remarkable performances ever by a child star. There is this rebelliousness, edginess, depression, frustration to his performance which we see rarely in child stars. I don't think anyone has words to describe his performance, it was totally remarkable. Cécile De France, the High Tension Alum for most of the world is great and shows the softer side to her relatively strong structure. The bonding between Thomas Doret and Cécile De France is something completely magnificent to watch. Jérémie Renier as insolvent father is good. On the whole, Le gamin au vélo is one of the most heartwarming and remarkable piece of writing and direction I have seen in recent years. It clearly shows that there is still humanity in the world and there are still people like Samantha who would do anything in random act of kindness. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the kid in red</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>without any introductions, the film gets down to the story. a kid on the phone is all but accepting to hear that the number he dialed is out of service. a precisely fluid social humanist film about a 11 year old kid and his relentless quests to go all the way to, against everybody's wishes, find a parent that wants nothing to do with him. basing his stance on the argument that his father would never leave without leaving him his bike.once retrieved, the bike serves as the catalyst that allows the kid to advance, more in a figurative sense; we see him fight and bite for it. the last relic of a family life to him.the kid in red is a lot of things: determined with rage and astounding obstinacy, always on the move, has nothing to lose so he goes to the limits. at one point, he nervously plays with a faucet as to not lose face in front of such injustice. but in his misfortune, Samantha, an adult portraying a kind stranger and genuine goodness, generosity and warmth, takes care of him. being emotionally distant, the kid rejects her at first and goes on exploring until he finally finds himself in his most despairing moment.. the kid remains a very interesting character to me, he is easy to deceive, capable of violence, but only because he is affectionate at heart and more honest than the people he deals with. which resonates with me as the film is able to kindle bits of memories of the audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Belgian take on a too-universal story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film takes place in Europe (Belgium, apparently) so it has far less of the violence that would accompany the same story set in America. But otherwise the story is particularly painful to watch because the essential elements - a kid without a father, his self-hate and anger, the substitute father figures laying in wait - are directly relevant to the American context. In a lean, tough story, the film takes us through a broad tour of the issues and risks and even reasons for hope in these situations. Young Thomas Doret fiercely embodies the aching and the rage of a boy who wants a father at any price and is a near-force of nature in trying to obtain what should be his by right. Cécile De France's Samantha has numerous real-life counter-parts, credited by more than one survivor of these dilemmas, but not always successful in their roles as passionate rescuers. How this particular story turns out is not so important as the realization that all across the world children live in Cyril's situation; some make it, many don't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Directed by Luc and Jean-Pierre Dardenne, "The Kid With a Bike" stars Thomas Doret as Cyril, a sullen child who has been abandoned by his parents. After repeatedly running away from his orphanage, Cyril is taken in by Samantha (Cecile De France), an angelic woman in possession of tremendous grace, patience and love.Unlike other films by the Dardenne brothers, "Bike" eschews social realism for austere, almost Bressonian minimalism. "It's like a fairytale", the brothers would say in interviews, before describing Samantha as a "fairy godmother" who "sweeps down and saves the precious child". This fairytale quality, coupled to the film's almost sacred minimalism, lends "Bike" a unique tone. Its content may evoke neo-realist classics ("The Bicycle Thief", "The 400 Blows" etc), but formally the Dardenne's film resembles Bresson's "Mouchette" and "Au Hasard Balthazar". This stylistic shift isn't surprising; neo-realism has itself always had a spiritual quality, sanctifying the poor and the downtrodden.The film's second half watches as Cyril falls in with a group of criminals. The Dardenne's then cleverly dodge clichés, until the film climaxes with Cyril rising above his social circumstances to become, like Samantha, something graceful and almost angelic. This aspect of the film has been criticised by many; surely Cyril is on track to becoming a juvenile delinquent, small time criminal or even sociopathic adult. Surely people like Samantha do not exist in real life. Surely most marginalised kids are doomed. Surely the film smooths over and romanticises Samatha's relationship with Cyril, portraying bonds that in real life take ages to forge.This is all somewhat true, but "Bike" is also almost steadfast in its desire to reverse the stance of many other Dardenne films. Cyril's father here, for example, is the young father seen in the Dardennes' "L'Enfant", a film about an irresponsible couple who fall into a life of crime, abandoning their newborn kid along the way. Cyril's red bicycle also recalls the red jacket of the Dardenne's "Rosetta", in which a young woman struggles with poverty and a dysfunctional family. There are countless other allusions to other Dardenne films, but the point is, Cyril is an anomaly, and the film is perhaps interested in asking why this is so.If "Bike's" first three acts, slow and silent, test its audience's patience, its fourth develops into something at times sublime. Here Cyril, who has spent the film looking for love and validation, recognises Samantha's importance in his life. Male impulsiveness, egoism and aggression then becomes something softer, Cyril, almost Christ-like, allowing himself to be tortured and beaten and then picking himself and walking away. He harbour's no ill-will, no blame, and seems to have become an entirely different person.Whilst most Dardenne flicks take place in grim, shadowy locales, "Bike" is all sunshine, whites and bright colours. The film's symbolism is mostly simple, with a red bike, constantly moving and always being stolen, epitomizing Cyril's restlessness, rootlessness and insecurities. Samanatha herself works in a beauty salon, the woman's life dedicated to making everything she touches "more beautiful". "The Kid With a Bike" would win the Grand Prix at the 2011 Cannes film festival.7.9/10 ? Worth one viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A perfect art-house film, loved it to the full. The directors have explored the psychology of a disturbed and rebellious child with ultimate care and love, with so much affection as Samantha had for him. But nowhere they have stooped to cheap sentimentalism. The ultimate realism throughout the film has made it a masterpiece. We have seen the murder of innocence by human indifference and cruelty. But above all what wins is hope. Unconditional kindness of love can heal all wounds of this cruel world. That is the ultimate grace of human existence. Many people will say that it lacks a solid plot. But does this kind of artistic work really need much story??? It says best as it says in fewest words. I loved the last scene where the boy turns and goes away on his bike, he has seen so much of the extremes of man. The ending could not be any better.</fullReview>

Cyril cannot accept that his father seemingly has abandoned him, and in the first part of the movie we see Cyril trying to run away to find out where his dad is. It becomes clear that the dad indeed is no longer wanting to be involved in Cyril's life. By happenstance, Cyril meets Samantha, a hairdresser who agrees to become a foster parent just on the weekends. Cyril also befriends Wes, a no-good older kid who talks Cyril into robbing a newspaper carrier. I don't want to spoil the plot any further, you'll just have to see how it all plays out. But suffice to say that there were a number of scenes during which the theatre audience loudly gasped and moaned.This movie is another outstanding "slice of life" as brought by the bothers Dardenne. No, there are no major "action" scenes or special effects. Just observing ordinary people in not always ordinary situations. Special mention must go to the young Belgian actor Thomas Doret, who is simply outstanding as Cyril, and also to Cecile de France (who, despite her last name, is also Belgian), in the role of Samantha. Incidentally, the movie was filmed in the Walloon city of Seraing (near Liege), where the brothers Dardenne hail from. "Le Gamin au Velo" made a major splash at the 2011 Cannes film festival, where it won the "Grand PRix". I can't help but notice that this is yet another strong movie from Belgium, on the heels of the Oscar-nominated "Bullhead". If you are in the mood for a good foreign movie, I readily recommend "Le Gamin au Velo".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A simple, well-acted, poignant story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story is quite simple: a 12-year-old boy abandoned by his father and the kindly woman who randomly meets him and becomes part of his life. The film is very, very good at exploring all of the sheer emotion involved in the above. You can feel the boy's unspeakable pain as he leaves no stone unturned to reconnect with his father, just to be rejected. You can see the motivations behind his horrible behavior and his despair. You see the whole spectrum here and no one is exactly as he seems. The father is a dead-beat who even briefly considers taking the stolen money from his kid. The drug dealer guy is horrible but also has a very unhappy life living with his grandparent. We see that Cyril's victims of his crime are far from perfect and even malicious. And then we have Samantha who selflessly upends her life and her relationship for this child. But instead of it being this happy-end story about the new family, we see that nothing is magical or perfect. We see a simple scene of Samantha and Cyril having a bike ride. Later he is almost killed by his own victim. The film ends with Cyril riding home broken, perhaps with a concussion. But he has matured to know that he should not fight back.This is definitely one of those "so you think you have problems" type of films. It is a reminder to us all that sometimes we have little control over the tragic turns in life and we have to take the goodness and support where we can get it. No happy end, just a sense that things are the best they could be. Great acting by the young actor and Cecile de France.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Kid with a Bike (2011)A troubled boy finds an informal foster mom who tries her best to keep in line. That's the story and in way that's the whole depth of the story. The details?his rebellion, his responding to love, his being suckered by a drug dealer?are expected and interesting and beautifully told. The story has a slightly polished realism to separate it from its forebear, the great classic "The Bicycle Thief," and there might be a slight gap in motivations to explain, but in general you get sucked into this situation and the awkward relationship between the two. It is a tale appreciated in its siimple telling.I had a foster child for a couple of years at an age close to this boy's, and there is a lot here that makes vivid sense. The woman, perhaps too lovely for normal realism (played by Cecile De France), is nevertheless sincere and quite smart in her mothering skills. She gets the boy to live with her almost by chance, and follows that chance, and learns to give him some rope and to also reign him in by example and through compassion.But even this isn't enough. That's one of the terrifying truths of being a foster parent (or any parent)?you can only do your best. Some of the result is a product of luck, or personality, or some course of outside events that you don't predict (even if later you can say you saw them coming). All of this is included here, well done, with a kind of filmic modesty. The one bit of high drama comes down to the child pushing his limits when he gets into a criminal plan, and the results of that, which leads to a bit of small time revenge that goes wrong. The boy is now beyond his own limits and is literally stunned. By the last scene, you ought to be heartbroken but also really hopeful. The message finally is that kids are really resilient, and you have to keep opening the right doors for them and let them make good choices. This film lets us do that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good performances in an uneven story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see the Kid with a Bike knowing just the basic story, and that it was a film by the famous Dardenne brothers. I haven't seen any of their other work, like La Promesse or L'Infant, but I was hoping to get an idea of their style from this film. The film's narrative starts out very strong, almost relentless: 10-year-old Cyril Catoul has been abandoned by his dad, and he wants him back.Cyril will do anything to find his dad, running away from his state-run orphanage, lie, fight, anything, despite mounting evidence that his father wants nothing to do with him. He meets Samantha, a hairdresser who agrees to take him in on weekends while he searches for his dad.The directors do a good job of showing Cyril's disintegration as he realizes his dad wants no part of him, but this all happens within the first half of the film. I found the latter half where Cyril is seduced into a local gang and then commits a crime to be less engaging, and the ending, though hopeful, seems a bit off. Also, I wish the film had spent more time on why Samantha wants so badly to help Cyril. There's very little background given on her character. All throughout though,Thomas Doret does excellent work as Cyril, but I'd say this is definitely more of a rental, not worth the price of theater admission unless you're a real Dardenne aficionado.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Have the Dardennes fallen off their bike?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Belgian directing duo Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne have built their formidable reputation on stark depictions of modern life and the muddy morals of those living on the fringes of society. The brothers' body of work has an unmatched consistency, both in the quality of their output and in the thematic and geographic areas they dwell upon.Invariably set in their hometown Seraing, their films are post-industrial dramas about the outside forces which mould us, and the choices we make in spite of them, which combine to forge our destiny. Or at least, that's about as much as one can summate from the frayed and fiercely naturalistic work they produce.Their career-long commitment to social realism would seem to sit somewhat uneasily with their latest offering, The Kid with a Bike, winner of the 2011 Grand Jury Prize at Cannes, which the Dardennes have described as their attempt at a fairytale. Cyril (Thomas Doret) takes the role of the lowly, wronged protagonist, trapped in a situation not of his choosing. Left to rot in a children's home by his self-interested father (Jérémie Renier), Cyril is restless, energetic and prone to violent outbursts borne of an unrequited desire for acceptance and belonging. Unable to accept his father's rejection, he constantly ditches school in search of him, but along the way comes across his fairy godmother, Samantha (Cécile de France), who takes an inexplicable shine to the stern-faced 11-year-old.He begins to stay with Samantha on the weekends, but all is still not well for Cyril. His yearning need to belong leads him to fall in with local gang leader Wes (Egon Di Mateo), who fills the father-shaped hole in his life. Torn between Samantha, Wes and his own father, who he still longs to please, Cyril has to decide who really has his best interests at heart.This fairytale's 'happy ending' is somewhat bittersweet, but The Kid with a Bike still takes the Dardennes into far more fluffy territory. While it may have the pared down aesthetics that are characteristic of their work, this film is discernibly less grey, both aesthetically and narratively. For one thing, it is shot entirely in the summer, with a wash of bright, breezy colours replacing the gravelly hues of The Son or Rosetta, and the inclusion of music, albeit a repeated few measures from Beethoven's Fifth Piano Concerto, give proceedings a soft, pleasing flow that is particularly alien to their austere oeuvre.The compulsion to lighten things up and tell a story in which everything more-or-less works out in the end is certainly an admirable change of tack for the Belgian filmmakers, but there is an unavoidable lack of depth here. The plot trudges along rather predictably and the characters are surprisingly one-dimensional. As ever the Dardennes eschew needless back-story to maintain the illusion of naturalism, but in this case it has the effect of making their actions rather inexplicable. They each seem to be merely going through the motions which the fairytale form requires of them: the callous father dispels the boy, the swaggering street-kid leads him astray and the angelic fairy godmother arrives just in time to deliver him from evil. After a while, the fairytale form begins to feel like little more than a justification for the formulaic and uninspiring way in which the narrative unfolds.Doret's performance of Cyril strikes the perfect balance between diffidence and angst, and de France is warm and convincing. But each character nevertheless feels superficial. The Dardennian prolonged, silent takes, which usually draw us to ponder the hidden thoughts of those on screen, is only tedious and annoying here. If anything, these moments tend to confront us with the sorrowful absence of the sort of subtle dynamism and intensity that the Dardennes are so adept at weaving into their scenes.In its attempt to reconcile naturalist portraiture and fairytale storytelling, The Kid with a Bike ends up cleansing either form of its usual pleasures. The result is a predictable and shallow affair, that leaves one longing for the Dardennes' former magic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Recently finding their film Two Days, One Night on Netflix UK,I started looking out for other works from the writer/directing team the Dardenne brothers. Taking a look at what movies have been put on BBC iPlayer,I spotted a Dardenne offering that was going to be removed in an hour!,which led to me getting on my bike.The plot:Left in foster care, Cyril Catoul tries to escape in order to find his dad,and to track down his missing bike. Held by Cyril as care workers try to pull him back to the care home, hairdresser Samantha reveals that she purchased Cyril's bike from someone,and that she is willing to become Cyril's foster mother. Joining Samantha,Cyril gets on his bike,and goes searching for his dad. Looking forward to the reunion,Cyril receives a less than warm reception. View on the film:Riding with Cyril,writer/director Jean-Pierre &amp; Luc Dardenne closely work with cinematographer Alain Marcoen and editor Marie-Hél?ne Dozo to give the film an incredible documentary rawness,via blunt edits and slightly shaky camera moves blur the lines between fiction and documentary cinema. Bringing out the naturalistic background noise in the soundtrack,the Dardenne's give the violence a chillingly stilted mood,as the camera stays on the sidelines,allowing the viewer to make their own mind on the violence being inflicted.Keeping the point of view at Cyril's level,the screenplay by the Dardenne's does not shy away from making Cyril look like a little brat,with the coarsely cut dialogue pulling Cyril's frustrations across the screen. Originally planned as a "fairy tale",the Dardenne's subtle keep this element intact,by brilliantly linking the bike with the relationship between Samantha and Cyril,as Cyril tries to find the right gear in life. Kicking out in anger, Thomas Doret gives a superb performance as Cyril,whose complex frustrations at finding a place to fit in Doret faces with a maturity well beyond his years. Trying to keep Doret on track, Cécile De France gives a great performance as Samantha,whose every attempt to support Cyril France lays bare,as the boy finds his bike.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review: The Kid with a Bike</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the first film I've seen from the Dardenne brothers and after watching this I will surely be checking out their other stuff. One thing that really stood out to me while watching this was that nearly every scene was shot in one continuous take, this combined with great acting created some fantastic moments. The acting felt real, and even the performance from Thomas Doret felt authentic and I'm happy to say the rest of the cast also put a huge amount of dedication towards their character.However the film is let down by a few things. A few characters felt a little underdeveloped especially Samantha and there were a few times where I found their actions to be a little unbelievable (like when Samantha goes and adopts Cyril it felt a little spontaneous). Also another thing worth mentioning is that there is a scene where Cyril attacks a father and son with a baseball bat to steal their cash, and Cyril actually knocks them both out with one hit. I highly doubt a boy could take down a grown man and a teenager with one weak hit but okay. All in all; its a good movie. I loved the music, acting and directing and it's worth seeing. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sensational! Difficult to explain in words, this film truly shows what childhood innocence is all about. It then goes on to show how it can be shattered in a matter of minutes and how fickle is the affections of children. Brilliant performance from the young boy who plays the pivotal character whose father wants to do nothing to him while he yearns for him to return. Samantha, portrayed pitch-perfect by Cecile, is a picture of picture of patience and motherly love. The bond between them weak yet full of hope and promise. Samantha didn't want to give up on him while the little boy accepted that he needs to get serious and accept the only person who cares for him whole-heartedly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cycling to Happiness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cyril Catout (Thomas Doret), a 11 year old boy, dumped into a boys home by his father, who deems him surplus to life, struggles to adapt to being rejected by his own father. Despondent Cyril throws all the longings of love onto a bicycle, which his father brought him and thus embodying proof that the bond still exists. However, he is slowly forced to accept the fact, that his father sold his beloved possession and no longer wants to have lingering connection with his son. This derails Cyril into seeking manly companionship with the wrong crowd. Somewhere beside him lurks the angelic figure of Samantha (Cécile De France), a hairdresser, who selflessly devotes herself to bringing Cyril comfort and a new home.The Dardenne brothers neorealist drama, much reminiscent in tone to movies of era gone, is a slight, lingering tale, which imbues itself into the conscious with its humanist tale full of longing, rejection, but ultimately delivers a oft forgotten positive outlook on the human condition. The story itself has been named trite and simplistic, definitely traits that are well associated to the movie, but then again not all features have to shock the system. "The Kid With a Bike" wins the heart, seeping into the cinephile movie list due to its unabashed charming performances and well-defined minimal ambitions as a story of affection to overthrow the overbearing messages of woe, so predominant in art-house pictures. Despite all its strengths, the keyword remains 'slight', a movie with powerful undertones, but with such restrained impact, that will probably never feature as a cinematic classic, instead noted as a good movie with short-term memory life. The events in the movie happen, then pass by, resonating with an honest and concise crafty picture on the hopeful belief in generosity and warmth still present in every human being.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Small movie about a young kid faced with an adult decision</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When we are introduced to Cyril, the kid with a bike, he is in a foster home, having been placed there by his father, Guy. I say placed, but it's more like abandoned, since Guy has tried his best to divest himself of Cyril, leaving as little trace of himself as possible. Poor Cyril does not understand this and for much of the movie Cyril doggedly tries to track his father down. His determination in this quest borders on obsession. Cyril frustrates everyone who tries to deal with him and it is a testament to Thomas Doret's portrayal of Cyril that I came to be frustrated by him too. This is good in that it involved me in the story, but it often made for difficult viewing. Given an opportunity to establish a bond with a potential foster parent named Samantha, Cyril seems hell bent on destroying the relationship by running away, clamming up, and even becoming physically violent. I had to wonder what was in it for Samantha for her to keep trying to offer Cyril some affection in spite of his antics. We are given no back-story on her, so we have to guess her motives. I think she probably had wanted a child but, for whatever reason, had remained childless. When Cyril came into her life she saw the opportunity to fill that lack in her life. In any case Samantha provides what I think is at the heart of the story, and that is that even a recalcitrant kid who is headed in the wrong direction can be pulled back from the edge if someone will pay attention to him.Riding his bike seems to offer Cyril an emotional release. The many scenes of Cyril's bike riding and running got to be a bit tedious for me, one such scene was enough to convince me of Cyril's intensity and frustrated emotions. In one very long take the Dardennes take a page out of Truffau's "The 400 Blows" by following Cyril on an extended bike ride. Whereas in Truffau's movie Doinel's extended run ends in one of the most powerful scenes in movie history, in this movie Cyril's ride simply ends.There are many poignant scenes, like the one where Cyril finally gains access to his dad's apartment only to find it empty. This is not your warm and fuzzy coming of age story, but rather a story of a boy coming to terms with some harsh realities at a young age and having to decide which direction his life will take. I was engaged enough to come to care for the people in this movie and that made it worthwhile for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those unpretentious pieces of great story-telling that is so often lacking in movies today. It is about the search for parental love and affirmation and the discomforting process of reconciliation with realities which fail to match ideals and desires.It's a simple story: an adolescent boy, Cyril, absconds from a state run care home to search for his father, the good father who bought him his beloved bike and who promised never to sell it. His quest is unsuccessful at first and he is taken in by a hairdresser, Samantha. She finds his bike for sale and buys it for him. He refuses to believe that his father would sell it. At last he does locate his father, but he is in a new relationship and does not want to take on the 'baggage' of his past (the dirty rat!). The father tells the son not to come to see him again. Despite all his efforts to maintain his image of his father as someone who loves him no matter what, Cyril is forced to confront a painful reappraisal of his beliefs.Cut adrift from the one (false) hope in his life, the boy loses direction. He has his bike stolen and then encounters a local drug dealer, Wes, an older youth who uses all his charisma and greater worldliness to mesmerise the boy into becoming his assistant. Samantha warns the boy to stay away from his new 'friend'. Eventually the boy turns his back on the dark future represented by Wes and returns to Samantha, finally accepting the possibility of parental love that she offers.Great acting all round, especially from Thomas Doret, as Cyril, with Egon Di Mateo brilliant as the manipulative Wes. Filmed beautifully without seeking to impress yet succeeding in absorbing us totally in the reality of what we are seeing, we follow Cyril's emotional journey with admiration for his tenacity, sympathy for his plight, and joyfulness at its outcome. This film may not get massive exposure but I think it deserves to be widely seen - Mary and I loved it!.(Viewed at The Cornerhouse, Manchester, UK 31.03.12)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even at their most ebullient, the Dardenne brothers make fantastic socio-realism dramas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sure, the bicycle is an interesting bit of mechanical ingenuity, but it's also a hugely significant artifice of childhood nostalgia. Everyone remembers learning how to ride a bike; falling off, having to pick yourself up from the gutter, and the sense of freedom and exuberance when you finally crack it (E.T., anyone?). A powerful signifier, Belgian filmmaking duo the Dardenne's Brothers spin the wheel and give us this uplifting, yet tragic social drama. Oxymoronic, but downright powerful.The titular child is Cyril (played by acting neophyte Thomas Doret). With no motherly figure in his life, the typically monosyllabic twelve year old idolises his father (played by Dardenne regular Jérémie Renier), even though he is a despicable father figure, selfishly selling Cyril's cherished bicycle and sending him to live in an orphanage. Desperate for his father's affection, Cyril is given the opportunity of a fresh start when local hairdresser Samantha (the ravenous Cecile De France) who agrees to foster him during the weekends. She's so nice, she even buys back his favourite set of wheels! Back in the real world, the impressionable Cyril gets in with the wrong crowd, and it's down to the maternal Samantha to get him back on track.Typical Dardenne, the film's simplistic premise enables the performances to steer the drama, and their unfussy photography technique. With a character that could easily become an annoying little brat, Doret delivers an amazing performance, teetering between the explosive and implosive, we're never sure what path his taciturn character will take, even if he seems to be in control at every turn.If you're knowledgeable of the Dardenne's filmography, it's fascinating to see Jérémie Renier as the reticent father figure. One of Belgium's finest actors, he cut his teeth as a teenager working with the Dardennes on their 1996 masterpiece La Promesse. Hopefully such an amazing career trajectory will come Doret's way too.In the end, The Kid With a Bike is exactly what you'd expect from a film with such a quaint name, by these two darling filmmakers. Full of whimsy, it's the least challenging and, henceforth, most accessible film the brothers have done in a while ? with highest grossing box office sales and a bunch of award nods in the process. It's perfectly executed and glides so gracefully over it's brief 87 minute running time too. Like Ken Loach, the Dardenne's are dealing with bleak societal issues in a way that is alluring, perhaps even optimistic, and totally worth watching.www.366movies.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cyril, 'le gamin' in Le gamin au velo (The Kid with a Bike) has all the reasons to be angry. His father left him, after sending him to a public dormitory school he just disappeared trying to rebuild his life. Cyril (acted as only pre-teen actors can act by Thomas Doret) refuses to acknowledge reality (which is something that so many mature people do daily) and rebels against any institution (like school) or individual (like the woman who hosts and takes care of him during weekends). Anybody who can show some understanding easily gains his trust, including a very bad guy who pushes him to do a very bad deed.This film could have turned easily into melodrama and if it does not it's because the brothers Dardenne wrote and directed the story. They give credibility and human touch to all the characters, they judge none, not even the bad guy, not even the institutions who seem unable to understand or solve the real problems of life. The story develops naturally and when eventually things end by getting back on the right track it's because of the belief of the characters, actors, directors, and eventually cinema viewers that life, simple gestures, the normal doing of good are the right thing to prevail. In a melodrama or in a bad drama you just want things to end well. In a good drama you believe this is the way they should end.If Cyril is the hero, the mystery character of the film is Samantha, the woman who helps him, takes care of him, plays the role of a mother to him. As a viewer maybe I would have liked to understand more about her motivations, her personal sacrifice (at some points she has to chose between her boyfriend and the kid), why she does not have children of her own. I realize that the mystery may be intentional and that it may have been the choice of the script-writers and directors and their way of telling us 'this is how things should be, this is how normal people should behave in unusual circumstances' but I still miss something in understanding the character despite the wonderful acting of Cecile de France. Yet, it's a nice and touching film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Jus' let 'im go"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A troubled young boy Cyril (Thomas Doret) lives in a Children's Home after his father decided he was no longer able to cope with caring for him. Unable to accept this, the boy escapes the Home and goes back to the apartment that he and his father shared. Finding him gone, the boy continues to run from the Home's staff before clattering into a woman in a Doctor's waiting room while yelling about his missing bike. Later, the same woman is able to track down the bike and brings it to the Home and the boy asks if he can stay with her at weekends. The woman, a hairdresser called Samantha (Cecile de France) accepts and the boy spends time with her while she attempts to free him from the anger and rage that keeps getting him into trouble.I first heard about this film last May when it won the Jury Prize at Cannes. I'd wanted to see it at the cinema but being a Belgian film about an angry boy and a bicycle I was unable to find it in the city of 3 million people in which I live. Although I was disappointed not to get to see it at the cinema, now I have seen it I don't feel like I was missing out. While it's an interesting story about two very different relationships, I didn't personally enjoy it as much as the reviews I'd read suggested I would.One of the problems I had with the film was a lack of back story for the Samantha character. I can understand the film makers' idea to make her more enigmatic or to take her previous history out of the equation but I found it difficult to understand why a seemingly normal hairdresser would want to take on a troubled child whom she barely knows just because he asked her to. What's more, I found it very difficult to believe that she would have kept him after some of the things he does during the film. The boy is a right little s**t. At one point when he rides off on his bike after a fight with Samantha my girlfriend belted out "Just let 'im go". I felt like saying the same. Maybe I'm missing the point that the film is about the woman's attempts to help the boy redeem himself but I just thought that he was an annoying kid with a sad back story.The father-son relationship did make me feel sorry for the child and it was horrible to see a father treat his son with such disdain. For that reason I can begin to understand Samantha's reasons for taking the boy on but it still felt a little far fetched to me. One area of the film that felt odd was the depictions of the rough youths on the estate. The teenagers never swore which felt strange but gave the film a fairytale like quality which having read subsequent to watching is something the Directors were aiming for. They also saw the Samantha character as a kind of good fairy character but that isn't something I picked up on. One thing the film did create inside was a feeling of worry for the boy. Every time he crossed a road or approached older kids I thought to myself that this was it and he was about to get into some serious trouble. Considering I didn't like the kid, it was clever of the film to still make me worry about him.I thought that young Thomas Doret's acting was incredible for a boy so young and Cecile de France was infinitely better than in the only other film I've seen her in, the quite frankly very poor Clint Eastwood drama Hereafter. The cinematography was quite beautiful and the two leads appeared to have good chemistry. Overall The Kid with a Bike is a nice film with some nasty moments and a happy ending. It isn't one of my favourite films of the year but it is in no way bad.www.attheback.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>looking beyond everyday reality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen all their films (I think) by now, I can summarize what makes the dardenne brothers unique in cinema history. All their films are tragedies, heartrending tragedies were it not for the everyday feel of all of them. We do not recognize the tragedies in our midst because everyday reality is so overwhelming that it blurs everything. We equally do not recognize the people who are as good as Jesus or maybe even more good, who walk amongst us. They must be stupid or perverts or psychologically screwed or whatnot - that they simply are saintly good could not be since they are here in this everyday reality with us and in that almost total blindness of every-day-ness miracles and saints simply do not exist.Now, that this goodness is at the core of every human being if it is not perverted by this extremely evil society of business and power, is a thought that is so strange to most people that they don't even consider it. It is far easier to believe, for these people, that humans are evil and that it is society that prevents them to live out their evilness and, sure enough, if they are sufficiently poor they cannot but if they are sufficiently rich there are just no limits to the evil done and how could it be otherwise, when a person defends it as being right to have a million times more than another person for surely he can then not look at that other person as his loved brother or sister and instead look at that other person as being a cockroach and who cares what you do to a cockroach, right?Yes, among the poor you may find Jesus or God, if you like, if you look past every-day-ness and films like this one helps you do that. Other films by the Dardenne brothers are however even better at it so this one only receives the vote 6.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>simple yet emotionally involving and very human coming of age story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are a lot of films screening in MIFF this year that seem to deal with children on journeys of self-discovery and learning to make their way through the difficult emotional terrain of adolescence. This new film from Luc and Jean-Pierre Dardenne (Rosetta, The Child, etc) is a deceptively simple yet emotionally involving and very human coming of age story, and it delivers some strong moral messages and explores universal themes. Eleven-year old Cyril (played by Thomas Doret) has been sent by his father to live foster care. When dad leaves home without telling Cyril, he sets out to find him, which sets in place a moving journey of discovery. Cyril is taken in by local hairdresser Samantha (Cecile de France), but she struggles to cope with his angry nature. The film explores the volatile relationship that develops between the angry and troubled Cyril and Samantha, who becomes a surrogate mother. Young Doret is sensational in his role, and delivers a wonderfully mature performance as the damaged but persistent Cyril, who brings plenty of emotional baggage with him. He is looking for an adult he can trust, which leads to some misjudgments. As Cyril rides aimlessly around the estate on his bicycle he is befriended by Wes (Egon Di Mateo), a local thug, who drags the na?ve boy into some criminal activity. The Dardenne brothers direct the material in non-judgemental and sympathetic fashion. They effectively use fluid long shots to follow Cyril's journey, which draws the audience into this beautifully observed world. Interestingly, Jérémie Renier, who appeared in the Dardenne's 2005 drama The Child, plays Cyril's father here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Growing Up Is Hard To Do</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gifted young actor Thomas Doret is Cyril a tormented 12 year old boy who has become a ward of the state since becoming separated from his father. He suspects people of conspiring to keep him away from his father and believes that if he could just locate him they would live happily ever after. Unfortunately reality is more complicated than that and Cyril's dad has moved on and has no desire to resume a relationship with his son. Tough stuff for a 12 year old to swallow. From that foundation directors Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne have fashioned a compelling tale about the forces that help shape us and determine the kind of people we will ultimately turn out to be. For Cyril his father's abandonment leaves a vacuum that must be filled by other people in his life. There is a young hoodlum named Wes who calls Cyril "Pitbull" and enlists him to follow in his footsteps. On the other hand there is Samantha beautifully played by Cecile De France. Samantha is a compassionate soul who agrees to take custody of Cyril for a couple of days a week. She can't do anything about the lousy deal fate has handed him but she is determined to keep him from acting out against society and throwing his life away. There is a wonderful moral ambivalence in this film which enhances the movie's realism and Cyril uses his bike to navigate through this uncertain landscape.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A young boy is rejected by his father. He cannot accept the fact and goes on a relentless hunt for his parent. This brings him into contact with a hairdresser who fosters him, assisting his search and trying to keep him our of the reaches of the local thugs, who keep stealing his bicycle. As usual with the Dardennes, the acting is naturalistic and the narrative is shorn of melodrama. The camera is hand-held and each scene is delivered in one shot. This formula, that works so well in 'L'Enfant,' fails to deliver any emotional punch here. Thomas Doret is exceptional as the fierce Cyril, all action and energy and brooding moodiness. Cécile De France as hairdresser Samantha only hints at the reasons for her altruism. The characters are convincing, but the drama does not excite. The bike gets stolen far too often, and the camera lingers too long on Cyril staring in a window, Cyril riding his bike, Cyril watching a football game. The ending seems to arrive randomly, and in borderline ludicrous fashion. The near universal love for this mundane little film is a mystery in itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When Bad Endings Happen to Good Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is recommended.The bicycle. No longer just a cherished possession or a simple means of transportation used by common folk. No, the bicycle in question has much more at stake. It is an iconic symbol of freedom, a nostalgic metaphor of our lost youth and childhood innocence, a conduit to a simpler life. In cinematic history, the bicycle has served as the main vehicle to the working class life as in the neo-realistic tearjerker, The Bicycle Thief; in more recent times, the bike literally transports us on a fantasy escape against a moonlit sky, as in E.T. Yes, the bicycle is one amazing and powerful piece of equipment.Which leads us to the foreign film, The Kid with the Bike, a film that doesn't quite amaze its movie-going audience, but does still deliver a powerful message. Abandoned by his father, young Cyril ( Thomas Doret ) is full of anger and hostility to anyone who comes near. One courageous and kind soul who approaches this troubled boy is Samantha ( Cecile de France ), a hairdresser who hopes to help Cyril through this emotional upheaval. Now this is certainly an interesting premise that immediately hooks the audience into caring about the rescue of this melancholy young man by his newly appointed mother figure. Belgian filmmakers Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne have fashioned a simple story about a kid whose only direct link to his missing father is his bike. The story is compelling from the start, thanks to the wonderful natural acting of newcomer Doret. This young actor brings with him a brutal honesty and reckless vulnerability to his character. There is also a strong chemistry with deFrance as his guardian, although her character is a bit underwritten and her motives, though saintly, remain unclear. Their acting enhances the thin storyline with a script in need of stronger character development of the supporting characters and their sketchy lives.The screenplay begins to meander somewhat along the way in locating Cyril's dead-beat dad as Cyril becomes duped by a shady teenager that he encounters, leading him to make some unethical decisions. This meeting builds rather nicely to some tense moments, but it is midway into the film that the directors begin to lose some focus and gloss over the seriousness of Cyril's actions, diminishing the real life and legal ramifications of this behavior in favor of an ironic twist of fate to be used later in the story. This plot device is heavy- handed and weakens the fully-realized depiction of the boy's harsh unforgiving world. The actions of the characters become unconvincing in the film's sudden rose-colored approach to what was once an uncompromising and intense story. The time spent on this involving subplot undermines the depth of the relationship between Samantha the Good Samaritan and this Little Boy Lost. Were more time spent on defining their bond and explaining the rationale for Samantha's need to nurture this wayward boy, the film could have been more satisfying and memorable. ( In fact, the film's ending almost seems like an unfinished post-script. The Kid with the Bike lulls the audience to believe wholeheartedly in its characters and their situations, only to disappoint with an abrupt conclusion which defeats everything before it and leaves the moviegoer as disoriented as its main character. )The Dardenne brothers are masterful filmmakers, and their latest film is a well-made venture worthy of your attention. It is a good film that could have easily become a great film with some added scenes of narrative exposition and minor revisions to the script, especially with its unsatisfying climax. But it is what it is, a rare film that tries to take you places emotionally, and for most of the film, it does achieve that commonality. Unfortunately, The Kid with the Bike gets caught in its own nobility, spinning its wheels and ultimately going nowhere, with some purposeful direction, but without much traction.

		<shortDescription>Child's perspective production</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This small town coming-of-age story is well-constructed, filmed and acted. It remains a little troubling though and though it is ultimately a positive story about a neglected lad's fortunes, hope is hard won.The reason for this is in the lack of information about the other characters and their motives. The absent father is getting himself back on his feet but what was the reason he left in the first place. Is there a more sinister story to his crumbled nuclear family past? Why does the hairdresser take him on? We ask these as we see the 'dealer' care for his mother before contriving less pleasant activities. We also see a middle-class businessman shown as a forgiving victim but consequently capable of deceit himself.It is hard to contextualise a sense of moral relativism when the motives of the adults, dictating the turns of the drama, are unknown. However I found the film to have been constructed from the child's perspective - a film of moral absolutism, where the kindness of a hairdresser, a rediscovered father and an older boy go unquestioned. It matters nothing in the moment that one is sincere, one disingenuous and one scheming.Thus the bike, the inanimate object that must be bought back, or fought for after being stolen, or picked up after being knocked over. It's also exchanged in a later scene for another bike in a symbolic show of trust. Like many symbolist-realist French films the face value may seem muddled but the poetry is there to be absorbed and enjoyed in the long run. 6/10</fullReview>

While she does act well in this, the movie stands (mostly) and falls with the boy. A really good casting that they did there.The movie is great in depicting morally dubious decisions by our characters. Even when you know where it is going and against better judgement, you still are intrigued by the characters on screen. It doesn't matter that you can't really understand the reasoning behind some of the decisions (and not all decisions are being reasoned), the movie drives with a steady speed and has one thing in mind: telling its story!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Belgian directors serve up astute portrait of abandoned 10 year old despite contrived climax and sketchy characterizations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Kid with a Bike' was directed by the two French-speaking Dardenne brothers from Belgium. The film was shot in Belgium, in the town of Seraing, where the Dardennes held approximately 100 auditions and settled on an outstanding child actor neophyte, Thomas Doret, who plays the 10 year old protagonist, Cyril.According to Wikipedia, the Dardenne brothers wanted to tell their story much like a fairy tale and chose not to develop many of the adult characters in the film. Hence, the portraits of the adults are quite sketchy. For example, we never find out much about Cyril's father except for the fact that he's broke and emotionally can't cope with the idea of taking care of a child. Similarly, Samantha, the hairdresser who adopts Cyril, doesn't have much of a back story and we mainly learn what she's about, vis-a-vis her relationship with the child.While not without its problems, the film largely succeeds due to the performance of young Mr. Doret, in the role of Cyril. The film's scenarists make it quite clear how devastating it can be for a young child to be rejected by a parent. The first thirty minutes of the film chronicle Cyril's failed attempt to reunite with his father after he runs away from a youth facility which houses rejected children. Cyril won't accept that his father has moved out of the apartment and has abandoned him. Through his tenacity he tracks him down but the father won't be honest with his son that he has no intention of seeing him again. With Samantha's intervention, the father finally tells Cyril the truth. The reaction is predictable: self-destructive, acting out behavior on the part of the rejected child.There's a great scene of a portent of things to come when Cyril begins banging his head inside the car and Samantha must stop him. Later, Cyril runs away from home, not before stabbing Samantha, who is at a loss how to handle the out of control child. Cyril eventually ends up in the hands of a criminal, a local drug addict, who teaches him how to rob people. Cyril actually ends up assaulting a father and son with a baseball bat and knocks them out cold. The criminal tells Cyril to get lost but gives him some proceeds from the robbery which Cyril promptly brings to his father with the plan to help him. The father doesn't want to get in trouble and throws the money away and tells Cyril to get lost.Now having been rejected by his drug addict mentor, and a second time by his father, Cyril returns to Samantha and begs her forgiveness. But first he's forced to apologize to his victims in family court (the father accepts Cyril's apology but the son refuses to meet with the 10 year old). The court hearing is resolved when Samantha agrees to pay restitution to the father and son, for their medical treatment.The main part of the plot that feels contrived is the climax where the younger victim of Cyril's assault chases Cyril into a forested area. The boy throws a rock at Cyril, striking him and causing him to fall to the ground after he climbed up a tree. At first, it appears that Cyril has been killed due to the fall but miraculously regains consciousness, and then stoically pedals away on his bike. My problem with that whole scene is that I couldn't believe that the father (the victim of Cyril's bat attack) wouldn't prevent his son from going after Cyril, especially with the full knowledge that the boy did not accept the younger Cyril's apology (by not showing up at the Family Court hearing) and was so angry at him, that there was the possibility that he might resort to violence.In addition to the aforementioned sketchy characterizations, 'The Kid With a Bike' makes awkward use of a short passage from a Beethoven Piano Concerto whenever the directors seek to highlight an emotional scene. It's always the same, repetitious musical passage, which doesn't feel organically integrated into those particular scenes which require particular emotional emphasis.'The Kid With a Bike' still manages to be fairly absorbing as the Dardenne brothers ably depict the psychology of a young boy, who goes through stages of grief due to the rejection by a parent. In this particular case, Samantha's love turns the boy in a positive direction and after all the angst, it's nice to experience the heart-felt, happy ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are enough other reviews on here that detail the plot of this superb movie about coping with abandonment - I would rather discuss feelings the story evoked for me. I was in foster care for most of my childhood and I could relate to this kid's feelings of looking for love and care. The stark choice this boy has between a caring loving mother figure and a dangerous older brother/father figure is a "dangerous corner" dilemma that young boys (especially if they come from impoverished backgrounds) often face. The love this special woman finds, the compassion and patience, for a difficult boy. The choices she makes to be compassionate and to be her own person (when she breaks up with her boyfriend).This is the Darnennes best movie. Too often in other films (especially Rosetta) the characters are too unlikable and get wearisome. This film is about humane choices; sticking it out even and especially when it is difficult. The kid has a chance by the end of the movie that he doesn't have at the beginning.Jeremie Renier is one of my favorite actors. He plays Guy, the father, who is a coward and abandons his son - mostly I believe out of fear, both economic and emotional.Cecile de France is extraordinary. I've loved her in everything she has ever been in and she's especially poignant here. I don't mind the lack of backstory for her; it's HIS story.Thomas Doret is astonishing as the boy. He lacks a moral compass since that is something that is taught by parents. He starts to develop one and one hopes that he will grow to be a kinder more compassionate man due to the compassion given him by this wonderful woman.A+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>He is named Cyril, and as played here by Thomas Doret, he becomes an indelible portrait of need. We meet him first in an official boys' home, where he was dumped by a father who promised to return but never has. Like a young detective, he methodically tracks him down ? visiting the bar and pastry shop his dad took him to, calling a number that is always disconnected, talking his way into his dad's former apartment, where he is sure he will find his bicycle and perhaps Guy (Jeremie Renier), his father.Winner of the Grand Jury Prize at Cannes 2011, "The Kid with a Bike" is another empathetic film by Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne, the brothers from Belgium who have strong sympathy for alienated children and young people, and who avoid melodrama and sensation in telling their stories so movingly. There are two things that could go seriously wrong in young Cyril's life, but they don't quite happen. The Dardennes don't wring us out like that. They prefer the drama of ordinary life, in which for a boy like Cyril, things don't easily go right. In straightforward, realistic scenes, they show a boy who fears he has been thrown away, but persists in feeling that his father only lost him and will be happy to find him again.He can't stand restraint. He doesn't accept instruction. When he sees another boy ride past on his bike, he chases him. Samantha (Cecile De France), who owns a local beauty shop, tracks down the boy and buys the bike from his father. What anguish Cyril must feel when he learns the other kid didn't steal his bike ? Guy sold it. He sees a notice in a shop window, in his father's own handwriting. Cyril is about 11 and will remind some viewers of the hero of Truffaut's "The 400 Blows." But that boy had a hero, Balzac, and Cyril has only his father, who cannot accept the role.Cyril boldly asks Samantha if he can live at her house. She agrees to take him on weekends. It works out badly. Fearing rejection, he has a way of testing people beyond their endurance. "Why did you let me come here?" he asks. "I don't know," she says, honestly. He keeps running away and eventually is led into big trouble by Wes, a few years older, who slicks back his black hair, smokes, drinks and leads a "gang." The Dardennes are masterful in showing how easily Wes is able to manipulate Cyril to do his will.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More than just a fairytale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most effective thing that the Dardenne brothers do here is annoy the audience. We clench our fists and yell angrily at the screen, because the main character here is behaving most illogically and childishly. Cyril is a confused and abandoned 12 year old boy, and we must loathe him for it. I certainly did. It is heartbreaking how inevitably he falls for the trap of the drug dealer and gang leader Wesker. We scold his foolishness, but also understand and sympathise when his act of stealing for his father is outright rejected. Thomas Doret makes this all work. There is nothing perplexing behind his simple questioning, nothing out of the ordinary in his sulking and disobedience. When he pedals, he pedals with such furiousness that we are also witnessing the gears of his young brain churning like the pedals of that bike. Several long takes of this simple act reinforce this: he is unrelenting and restless. When he runs after those who would take away this single heirloom from his father, there is but one thing on his mind. Observe how ugly the choreography of the fight scenes are. They fight ineffectively and without technique, and this is therefore effective because all the urgency comes from Cyril himself. He bites and stabs and trips because it is all he knows, and the bike is all he has left.There are other characters which are unfortunately less developed. Cécile de France as Samantha, the saviour from above, is perfectly competent. Her motivations for adopting this strange boy is never quite examined, but the subtext doesn't shine quiet strongly through to really enable us to understand. The evil figure of Wesker is quintessentially bad and only bad. He wears black and dons sunglasses, which elicit half a laugh. There is no intricate criminal network here; he is there to seduce Cyril onto the bad path and turn on him viciously, which is clear from the beginning. Samantha's boyfriend is likewise uninspiring. He is a male figure and must be rejected by Cyril of course, who allows no replacement for his neglectful father. This issue is less explored than I would have liked; Gilles is thrust in as a conflict starter who forces a choice between him and Cyril in Sam's life, but her reasoning is unconvincing and the moment and character wasted.The Dardenne's documentary roots are clear; the naturalistic style augments the narrative in its natural lighting, hand-held camera, lack of non-diegetic sound, long takes and so on. They break one of these rules in this film in a rare occasion. A short segment of Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 5 chimes in at key moments of emotional neglect: lying in bed alone in a new home, arguing in the car with Sam, after his father's rejection, and finally during the ending. These moments are touching and emphasise the self soothing nature of Cyril, who struggles with finding comfort without a proper parental figure. There is so much to be gleamed from the simply final act of Cyril, who picks himself up and walks away from another confrontation. It's a culmination of the masculine, the ego-driven impulsiveness and carelessness of the film's actions of Cyril; he rejects physical care, accepts the punishment inflicted by the newsagent's son and understands his responsibility. This film is brighter than most of the Dardenne's work, but the subject matter is just as dark, as sobering, as real. The most poignant and conscious moments are no fairytale, even as they have been constructed as so.</fullReview>

A strong child performance, Cyril's character was someone who was so troubled, yet we understand. Cecile De France isn't my favorite actress for no reason.

		<fullReview>This film is the story of Cyril, a boy abandoned to a foster care system by his father. While the man wants nothing to do with the boy and has shown no signs that he's going to return, Cyril clings on to the hope that the guy will come back for him. Again and again, the man proves he's no good and irresponsible...but the boy won't believe the truth. Eventually, the boy makes an odd friend-- an adult woman who sees him being chased by staff after one of his many escapes. Inexplicably, the lady decides to start seeing the kid and tries to help. Eventually, with her help, they find the deadbeat father....and what happens after this you'll just have to see for yourself.If you are looking for a film with clear, happy endings where everything works out Hollywood perfect, this is NOT the picture for you. However, if you want realism and some darn fine acting, this film is terrific. As someone who has worked extensively with abused and neglected kids, I can tell you that Cyril's character was exceptionally well written and compelling. The story lacks clichés and is well told and worth your time if you are willing to see a film that is unlike the typical feature.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Kid with a Bike</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In one of the latest editions of the 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die book this French language Belgian made film was one of the newest entries, the title made it obvious about something in the story, but otherwise I was looking forward to seeing what it would entail. Basically twelve year old boy Cyril Catoul (Thomas Doret) is in foster care, but he is searching for his father, and he also wants the bicycle that he lost, he follows clues he has, including to a doctor's office, to find where his father lives, but when he finds his old apartment he is told that his father has moved away and abandoned him. Samantha (Cécile De France) from the doctor's office visits Cyril the next morning and has brought him his bike, she says she bought it but he is sure that it was stolen from his father, but he likes this woman and asks her is she would look after him on weekends, and it is from an old personal advertisement he finds that his father was the one who sold the bike. With Samantha's help the boy finally tracks down his dad Guy (Jérémie Renier), who is working in a restaurant kitchen, he allows his son to stay and have a talk and help him a little, but ultimately he is not happy to have been found and tell his son he should never come back. Heartbroken by the rejection of his father Cyril turns from comfort to Samantha, but despite her caring for him he winds up hanging out with local gang leader Wes (Egon Di Mateo) aka 'The Dealer', who takes him under his arm and trains him to rob a shop owner, and he does assault the man and his son with a baseball bat, stealing cash pouch, but feared he was identified The Dealer tells him to keep it. The boy tries to give the money to his father, but he is upset and rejects him again, so he finally accepts that Samantha can care for him, he decides to apologise to the shop owner who finds it in him to forgive the incident, but the shop owner's son is angry and tries to get revenge. Cyril is chased by the son, and he boy climbs a tree to get away from the raging young man, but he is struck by a rock and falls to the ground, he lies unconscious, the shop owner and son discuss the lies that they will tell the police, but soon enough Cyril gets up seemingly uninjured and simple walks away, and it appears he has decided to move on with his life. Also starring Fabrizio Rongione as Bookseller. Young Doret in the title role conveys good child innocence, he may be a little bratty on occasions, but is obviously the big draw, also integral is the good heart of the De France character, the story is simple enough to follow of a tearaway wanting his father and riding his beloved red bicycle but getting into trouble, it is paced well, and has good emotion and complexity to carry you along, a very worthwhile drama. It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's getting to a point where the people who thrive on such things will be willing the Dardenne brothers to come up with a flop if only because they have turned out an albeit small string of fine documentaryesque films in a handful of years and mostly with titles as simple as the plots themselves, The Promise, Rosetta, The Child, and now The Kid With A Bike. Though almost nothing happens in any of their films they nevertheless teem with energy so watching them is not unlike looking through a microscope at a drop of water lifted from a tide-pool. This time around the protagonist is an eleven year old boy who wears a red jumper throughout suggesting (to English viewers at least) Rupert Bear crossed with Little Red Hiding Hood. Reminiscent of Clifford Odets' Rocket To The Moon the movie opens in media res with the boy - played superbly by Thomas Doret - on the telephone attempting to contact the father who has abandoned him to a social facility and sold his bike to boot. Significantly little or nothing is explained in the world of the Dardennes so that, for example, there is no mention of the wife/mother and/or the domestic situation that led the father to what seems a drastic move, nor, when the film takes a new direction, of any logical reason that would prompt a stranger, Cecile de France, to more or less adopt the boy. De France is a beautiful young woman who has supplied both beauty and charm to such films as Fauteuils d'orchestre and Quand j'etais chanteur but here she almost revels in coming across as dowdy and unprepossessing yet clearly compassionate to the degree that she cheerfully undertakes to pay in installments a fine imposed on the boy in the wake of a fracas with a father and son. As if to compound the thumbing of the nose to the 'well-made' screenplay the film ends with the couple both riding bikes into the sunset of the rest of their lives against the odds of this being trouble free. Another fine effort from two brothers light years away from the Coens.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An emotionally gripping experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reaching out to someone with unconditional love is a rare quality, but it is one that makes an enormous difference in that person's life. Educator Leo Buscaglia has said, "Too often we underestimate the power of a touch, a smile, a kind word, a listening ear, an honest compliment, or the smallest act of caring, all of which have the potential to turn a life around." The empathy in this case is that of Samantha (Cécile De France), a hairdresser in Jean and Luc Dardenne's The Kid with a Bike who connects with young Cyril (Thomas Doret), an angry 11-year-old who has been abandoned by his deadbeat father (Jérémie Renier) and placed in an orphanage.Winner of the Grand Jury Prize at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival and set in Seraing, Belgium, on the surface The Kid with a Bike is a simple story, yet, underneath, it is a complex portrayal of real people struggling to find their place in the world. Known for their gritty films of social realism that demand much of the viewer ("The Child," "The Son") the Dardenne brothers' latest film is just as tough-minded as the others but it also has humanity and warmth, and its use of music (the adagio from Beethoven's Emperor Concerto), unusual for the Dardennes, makes it a fuller and richer experience.Cyril lives in an orphanage after being deserted by his father, but refuses to believe that his father will not come for him. In single-minded pursuit of his dad's whereabouts and also trying to recover his lost bike, the boy visits his dad's apartment but finds that he has moved and has sold his bike. Unwilling to believe his dad would do this, Cyril uses his kinetic energy to find the father he hopes will return as he promised. After trying to escape from the boy's home, he runs into a medical clinic in his former apartment building and clings to a local hairdresser, Samantha for protection, as counselors from the orphanage try to pry him loose. "You can hold on to me," she says, "but not so tight." We learn nothing of her background or the circumstances that have led her to this moment, but it hardly matters when she shows up at the home telling Cyril that she has bought back his bike and asks him to stay with her on weekends. They form a bond as Samantha locates Cyril's father working in the back of a restaurant preparing food, but the meeting only intensifies the boy's pain. Becoming more and more alienated despite Samantha's kindness, Wes (Egon Di Mateo), a sleazy drug dealer recruits Cyril to do a "job" for him after affectionately calling him "pitbull" and inviting him to his home to play video games. Unfortunately, the job leads to unanticipated repercussions.Marked by a stunningly natural performance from first-time actor Thomas Doret who convincingly conveys Cyril's innocence as well as his pain, the Dardenne brothers' refusal to give in to manipulation or sentimentality makes The Kid with a Bike an intense and emotionally gripping experience. Though the film appears to be grounded in the mundane, its unfettered grace raises it to a level far surpassing the limitations of the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Kid with a Bike</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Febiofest screening of Dardenne Brothers' latest film, I have miraculously finished it without English subtitles, because as a cinema purist I would not indulge myself into a talkie from which I could not understand a single word, yet, Dardenne brothers prove that some films are beyond languages and shares a universal empathy.I could not self-claim that I belong to the inner circle of hardcore Dardenne fanboys, I have only watched their two other films before, THE CHILD (2005) and LORNA'S SILENCE (2008). But their influences are growing on me. The film grittily follows their principle of consistency, a point- of-view depiction of social margin's dire straits, this time the linchpin is a deserted boy from a foster care house, with a Dardennes' regular Jérémie Renier as the pitiless father, which could be interpreted as a sequel of THE CHILD. There is some reluctance emitting from the hyperactivity of the in-depth characterization of the newcomer Thomas Doret's upfront bluntness, which has even triggered a shade of loathsomeness towards the wayward boy, tellingly Thomas owns an elastic flexibility between cute and annoying, which exacts a real-life impersonation reminds of THE 400 BLOWS (1959) (which I ashamedly have yet completely finished). Leading lady in French cinema Cécile De France, who is actually coming from Belgium, shoulders a brave transformation to befit the film's understated style as an unglamorous hairdresser who harbors the boy with a touching maternal affection. Music score astoundingly being used many times here which defies the usual Dardenne brothers' natural recording gambit (however it is not the first time since in LORNA'S SILENCE, they have broke their rules already, this time they plainly enlarge the amount), and a big plus is from the punchline near the end, masterfully maneuvered in an anti-climax pathos and simply heightens the powerful impact on the atonement windup.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Get a padlock!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was struck by the way the kid seems to be always either running, or cycling at top speed. A great sense of pent-up energy. I'm not entirely sure what the bike represents, perhaps it's somehow an extension of himself, but a lot of the plot centres around this bike. It's the most graphic way in which his father betrayed him (by selling it); the re- acquisition of it is how the hairdresser makes him briefly happy again; and it's the means by which he catches up with her and arranges for her to foster him; it's also the catalyst for some of his battles with other kids on the estate, and the dealer wins his trust by arranging for its repair, leading into the central dramatic event (more on that below).It's frustrating as a watcher to see that in spite of his experience of other kids regularly pinching his bike, he doesn't bother with a padlock and keeps leaving it outside shops inviting people to nick it.It's a good film to start with, but for me it lost interest once the kid is so willing and unquestioning when asked to commit an act of extreme violence for the dealer. Just didn't fit with the way his character had been built up. He's happy to wallop someone with a baseball bat and doesn't even want anything for it. The storyline could have been salvaged if he'd got a better motive. He could have done it for the money that he was offered, so that he could give it to his father. But that was just an afterthought of his when the money was forced onto him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What has settled with me after surviving this movie:</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie left me puzzled, bewildered, touched, and yet it was oddly refreshing, and real. The relationship between the caretaker and the boy was something beyond the tragedy of abandonment and the major downturns of being shunned, used, abused, helpless. It showed a mingling of extremes when, while scarred for life, one is presented with a glimpse of hope and a place and person to come home to. I am thankful that I was able to watch this - a showcase of humanity in its rawness, coldness, and multiplicity, including warmth and love.I have just arrived home straight after watching this, so am still a bit in shock, but here goes: A boy wakes up in a children's home and can think of nothing but finding his father, who has abandoned him and left the area. His only care is reuniting with him, and nothing detains him from his desperate search. In this, he stumbles onto a woman who cares enough to retrieve the bike that had belonged to him, and soon thereafter she kind-heartedly assumes the responsibility for him during the weekends, when he comes to her life, her home, and, despite the serious challenges that this presents, her heart. She helps him to locate and meet with his father and he receives the confirmation that he is not wanted in his life. This, however, does not convince him, and upon willingly intertwining himself in a dangerous and aggressive plot, he gets some money with which he believes he will finally win his father back. When his father rejects him yet again, the message comes home to him that his hope of having an active father in this man will never materialise and as he physically cycles his emotions and thoughts towards his caretaker's home, everything that then happens indicates that he has come to know that she is the person to whom he must ally, unite, and surrender. The film is laden with vivid imagery and some scenes of near-suspense and yet it is quite bare in terms of effects, with the exception of some camera plays and strategically repeated music placements which emphasise the momentous heartbeats of some key scenes. It really makes one thankful for one's luck, and appreciative of all we have received from the people in our lives who have been kind, loving, and, especially, there. It is also an illustration of great stoicism, both in the form of the disbelieving, anguishing boy and that of the present, unwavering caregiver. Chapeau!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this a bit of a contradictory film; on one had there are some really great performances, on the other; I found it hard to see the motivation behind some of the actions taking place on the screen. Maybe I'm not as good at reading characters as I thought; but then again, it's a very long time since I was a twelve(ish) year old boy. As to the performances, well, I thought both Thomas Doret and Cécile De France were truly excellent. I can't say we really got to see the gritty realism of the streets of Belgium because it wasn't all that gritty, or maybe that's as gritty as Belgium gets. It was, however, well made but didn't do anything particularly extraordinary. Worth a look? Definitely, but I don't think I'll be giving it a repeat viewing anytime soon.SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDEDMy score: 7.1/10.You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another mini French masterpiece, this one is all about a young kid in care with a useless father who takes no interest in him (Hmm...), and to all intents and purposes not much of a future. A local beautician befriends him and he starts going round to hers at the weekend, but his new-found happiness is endangered by a gang of toughs lead by a dangerous, manipulative hoodlum, who like the Artful Dodger, is keen to introduce our hero into a life of crime. Can he resist the temptation of this nasty piece of work, or is he doomed to a life of youth custody, satellite TV and free holidays abroad? (Hopefully though, they do things a bit differently over the Chunnel)What I admire about most of the Gallic pictures I've seen is the length of every scene feels natural... no part runs longer or cuts out shorter than it should, and they blend into each other to create a true case of narrative excellence. Of course, it helps when you have a boy as talented as Thomas Doret in the lead role, and his pain at being rejected by the only family he knows and his desire to be accepted by anyone, even the scum of the earth, reaches out beyond the screen. Millions of abandoned children in this position should be able to relate to his tragic tale, and I predict big things for this adept young performer. That is, unless he becomes another Macaulay Culkin...Some may moan at the lack of a clear ending, but you know what? Here it doesn't matter... he's done all he's going to do, so let him ride his bike into the unknown, and we can all speculate what he does next. FIN. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Belgian screenwriters, producers and directors Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne's eight feature film which they wrote and co-produced, premiered In competition at the 64th Cannes International Film Festival in 2011, was screened in the Masters section at the 36th Toronto International Film Festival in 2011, was shot on locations in Belgium and is an Italy-France-Belgium co-production which was produced by producer Denis Freyd. It tells the story about a 12-year-old boy named Cyril Coutet who has been sent to a foster home after being left by his father. One day Cyril escapes from the foster home to find his bike. When he arrives at the apartment where he used to live with his father, he learns that his father has moved out. Cyril is located by social workers and brought back to the foster home where he meets a hairdresser named Samantha whom he takes a liking to. Cyril asks her if he can stay with her, and she tells him that he can be with her in the weekends. Cyril continues to search for his father, but one day he befriends an older boy named Steve who is a member of a gang. Acutely and engagingly directed by Belgian filmmakers Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne, this rhythmic fictional tale which is narrated mostly from the protagonist's point of view, draws a moving and heartrending portrayal of a mother-son relationship between a conflicted adolescent boy who has been abandoned by his father and a hairdresser who opens her heart and home to him. While notable for it's naturalistic and atmospheric milieu depictions, sterling cinematography by Belgian cinematographer and director Alain Marcoen, fine editing by French film editor Francois Gédigier, use of sound and use of colors, this character-driven and narrative-driven story depicts a dense and incisive study of character. This profoundly humane coming-of-age drama which examines essential and humanistic themes, is impelled and reinforced by it's cogent narrative structure, subtle character development and continuity, use of music and the commendable acting performances by Belgian actress Cécile De France and Belgian actor Thomas Doret in his debut feature film role. An empathic and poignant independent film which gained, among several other awards, the European Film Award for Best Screenwriter Jean-Pierre Dardenne and Luc Dardenne at the 24th European Film Awards in 2011 and the Grand Prix shared with Turkish filmmaker Nuri Bilge Ceylan's "Once Upon a Time in Anatolia" (2011) at the 64th Cannes Film Festival in 2011.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A story of betrayal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The latest film from The Dardenne Brothers, "The Kid With A Bike" is once again about lower class life in Belgium, this time focusing on the story of Cyril, an eleven-year-old boy living in a state-run facility after being abandoned by his father. Thomas Doret, who plays Cyril, gives a performance that's distressingly believable. Any parent, who has taken on the onerous task of raising a child single-handedly, will no doubt empathise with the anguish Cyril is going through. Mind you, sometimes Cyril's self-destructive behaviour is enough to try the patience of a saint. The film opens with Cyril trying to call his father on the phone dialing and re-dialing his number, while one of the members of staff tries to wrestle the phone away from Cyril, yelling at him to hang up, as the phone has been disconnected. Tiring of Cyril's tantrums, two of the staff members finally take Cyril around to the apartment where he and his father used to live to prove to Cyril once and for all that his father doesn't live there anymore. Cyril ignores them and keeps ringing the doorbell, but nobody comes to the door. Angry and upset, Cyril manages to elude both men and flees the building, determined to locate his father. When Cyril meets Samantha a childless hairdresser she surprises herself and Cyril by offering to take Cyril into weekly foster care. This doesn't sit too well with Samantha's boyfriend, who suspects, justifiably so, that Cyril poses a threat to his role as the male of the household. When Cyril sees a kid riding what he believes to be is his bike, he immediately gives chase. The kid riding the bike swears he bought from of a man. Cyril doesn't believe him. What father would sell the very bike he had given his son as a present? Samantha agrees to buy the bike back for Cyril. With his bike back, Cyril is free to roam the streets looking for his father. Instead, Samantha offers to drive Cyril around to help locate his father. When she stops for fuel, Cyril happens to notice an advertisement posted in a shop window, offering a car for sale and below that, a push bike; Cyril's push bike. Cyril is devastated. Visibly upset and feeling betrayed Cyril becomes sullen and un-communicative. Samantha, unsure of just how to comfort an eleven-year-old boy trying to grapple with the fact that his father, the one person who he ought to be able to trust the most, has rejected him, holds her tongue and concentrates on driving. When Cyril and Samantha finally do locate his father working in a restaurant, Samantha waits outside while Cyril confronts his father about why he deserted him and put him in the care of a Children's Home. His hapless and immature father is clearly uncomfortable as Cyril follows him around the kitchen, demanding to know why he can't be part of his father's life anymore. His father manages to fob Cyril off, but Cyril won't take no for an answer, and returns later to plead once more for his father to take him back. When Cyril happens to see a youth brazenly steal his bike, Cyril tries to snatch it back, but the youth evades him and proceeds to taunt Cyril by letting Cyril catch up then cycling away at the last moment. The youth is part of a gang led by a local petty criminal named Wes, who watches Cyril get the better of the youth who stole his bike in a fight. Wes instantly recognises in Cyril, a younger version of himself ? tough and fearless. Offered a way of making easy money by committing a robbery, Cyril accepts. The older boy instructs Cyril on what to do. Things though, don't go according to plan. Cyril is recognised by the son of the owner. When Wes pulls up in his car and sees what's happened, he refuses to take the stolen money and demands that Cyril not tell anybody that he was involved, before accelerating away. Cyril panics. Next thing, Cyril finds himself outside the restaurant where his father works. He wants to give the money to his father. The father refuses: it could get him into trouble. Samantha takes Cyril to the police. The matter is settled on the undertaking that Cyril apologises to the victims. The victimised father reluctantly accepts and they shake hands. The victimised son however refuses. Samantha is so angry and upset with Cyril she's at a loss for words. She finally demands Cyril explain himself, but Cyril doesn't have an answer for her. The son catches Cyril by himself and attacks him with the result that the latter falls from a tree. Since it looks serious, the father and son discuss what lies to tell to the police. However, the situation is not so bad as it seems, and Cyril walks away. It's a testament to the skills of filmmakers Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne that they make no attempt to pass judgement on the characters who populate their films and why they act in the way they do. Their camera just observes the events as they unfold before us. It's as if the film makers have just happen to be passing through town, and have stopped to record what's going on. "The Kid With A Bike" is film making at its most rewarding.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A young boy is abandoned by his young father and left to the care of an orphanage. The boy gets some fostering support from a local hairdresser who helps him in trying to find his father, stay out of trouble and work out what is next in his life. This rather general plot summary may not tell you much but it is actually pretty accurate for this film because Le Gamin au Vélo isn't really a place to come for a full complete narrative with a start/middle/end and all questions answered along the way. I have seen many viewers make this a badge of honor and say that to expect more is just to "not get it" but for me I personally would have liked a little bit more meat in there than I got.In terms of what it does well though, the film is really engaging in its honest portrayal of Cyril. He is not a likable child and he is incredibly difficult to like as a character at points. I have seen some asking why Samantha would bother with him and her efforts don't make sense, but in a way the film answers this for us because it puts us in the same boat as her. He is difficult but we see the reasons and we see the roots of his character pretty clearly and at the same time we see what the good in him is and that this just needs to the help to be brought out. Doret gives a great performance and is really convincing in the role while De France works very well with him and within her own skin. The use of music and some shots didn't always work for me but when it was natural and true to the characters I thought it worked very well. This tight focus does limit the film's interest in narrative though and in this regard I thought they could have given the viewer just a little bit more than they did and, without it I did feel a little unsatisfied when the film ended, even if I had enjoyed it for what it did well.Worth seeing it for the natural performances and focus on characters just getting by in life, but be warned the lack of a strong traditional narrative may disappoint some as it did for me.</fullReview>

And a battle begins between forgiveness and rudeness. The boy starts hanging with this gang. His excuse is disappointment, but can that be excused in the long run?

For more than try, I only see a movie with little power, no soul, no spark. It must assess the good performances of Cécile De France and Thomas Doret, and little else. As to the end of the film, it seems no reason abruptly cut. However, the professional critics see a film master, a lesson in cinema, a great exercise in concise narrative True, the Dardenne not fall into sentimentality, are dry, sharp. There is no compromise with the public, do not stop beating around with his camera movements. But the viewer must be content with the history that has witnessed, and that in "Le gamin au vélo." Does not occur.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Kid With a Bike is short but feels much longer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Watching this film was very hard because even though the film was very short it felt so much longer then it was because the film dragged on too long" When films are put on the back of a child actors they can either be great surprises but with this film we get a boring story that moves too slowly for my liking. Cyril Catoul (Thomas Doret) is a young boy who starts the film looking for his bike from his distant father. He then starts to live with Samantha (Cécile De France) who bought back his bike for him. Cyril may have been taken under her care but stays distant from her and meets a gang leader known as "The Dealer" who he helps commit crimes which comes up out of no where to a strange ending to the end of the film.The film moves slowly as we watch this strange child. Some of the things the boy does makes no sense which makes me question the writing of the film. The relationship the film tries to build up between Samantha and Cyril made no sense to me because it seemed to come out of no where that this women would do anything to help this child. Also the fact Cyril cried for his father so much was just annoying because he seemed to act like a baby not listening to what he was told and the boy in this film is old enough to understand what people are saying. When conflict arose between the characters the way it is solved did not make much sense to me especially when Cyril stabbed her which made no sense that she would try to help him again.Thomas Doret plays Cyril and I could not stand his performance. He is playing a badly written character in my mind and he adds nothing in terms of performance to get me to care for the character. He just seems to be looking down all the time and playing the boy not well to me at all. Cécile De France plays Samantha and she like Cyril is given a bad character to play. She plays a women who try's to fall in love with this loveless child and some of the decisions she makes make no sense to me at all. Every other character in the film seems to one dimensional to me and when they try to be dramatic they do not do it well.The film was boring and not worth watching at all. None of the characters were good to me because they did not take any responsibility for the mistakes they made and even when Cyril is looked for by the police at the end he some how gets away with nothing more but to apologize. Also Cyril falling from a tree only to get back up straight away makes no humanly sense to me at all.MOVIE GRADE: F- (MVP: Cécile De France)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film is overrated.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, there is no way THE KID WITH A BIKE is in the same league with THE 400 BLOWS. The later is a masterpiece; the former is not. I don't know where to begin with the problems I had with THE KID WITH A BIKE. Let's just say I found it slow, deliberate and boring. Although the acting was good; the writing and directing were lousy. I think my major problem with the film was lack of character development. Who exactly was the father? And why was his son so obsessed with him especially since he: (1) abandoned him, (2) sold his bike, and (3) told him that he never wanted to see him again. They didn't seem to have a loving relationship so I have no idea where this little boy's obsession came from. Then there was the little boy. (I don't remember his name because the movie was so boring.) Why was he so obsessed with the father? Especially since the father doesn't seem to give him the time of day. Throughout the whole movie, almost everything the little boy does is for his father. You can see how boring this can be. I mean, there really wasn't any conflict or anything. Just a little boy, who doesn't talk all that much, trying to please a father who doesn't give a darn about him. BORING! Finally, there's his foster mother. Why did she care so much for a little boy who treated her (and her very smart boyfriend) like crap. This was never explained either. So I hope you can see why I found this movie so boring. All 3 of the main characters were static. There was no development or change to any of their characters. And what was the movie really about--a little boy's obsession with a father who can care less about him? I can see why the father could care less about him--he seemed a little weird. I just couldn't understand what the foster mother saw in him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The characters could have been more exploited</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie has some thrilling moments but I think that the characters could have been exploited more than what is presented to us. I would have liked to know more about: 1. Cyril childhood, in order to understand why he is so enthusiastic about meeting his father, who obviously never minded about him. 2. Cyril education in the institution where his father left him, to understand why this boy is so much stubborn and has so little skills to think about a fact before acting; for instance, why he doesn't take into account Samantha advice to avoid any relationship with Wes, the drug dealer and thief? Relationship which almost spoiled his life. 3. Samantha's vocation to adopt Cyril, I mean, why did she get interested in adopting a child, and more precisely Cyril? Does Samantha has a huge heart? It looks like, but I don't know. I would have liked to be sure, so I could fall in love with her. This lack of information about the characters turns the history less interesting than it could have been.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here's my own disclosure: my wife and I walked out of this in the middle, so we have no idea how the storytellers resolved all the loose ends. The problem we had was with the main character, the boy. He seems to be a block of granite. Nothing gets in with him. Love and generosity make no impact, while the boy is drawn to those who will do him harm. So the question is: can he be saved by the lady with a heart of gold? I cannot "spoil" the outcome for you because I cannot say what happened. I do know that Dostoyevsky did this kind of thing in "Crime and Punishment" but at the same time invested his main character with a great deal more nuance than this boy had. If you think that nuance cannot be conveyed in a child, then have a look at Truffaut's "The Four Hundred Blows". The kid in this movie is made of such impermeable material, and he dominates the film so completely, that we could not see any good coming from his story. We also didn't want to see other characters harmed by him. So we left. The movie has a basic level of cinematic skill in it--including the ability to depict characters that get under your skin--so I give it four out of ten stars. But for me it was not a satisfying artistic experience.</fullReview>
