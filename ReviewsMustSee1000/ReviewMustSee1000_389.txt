		<fullReview>Believe me RAMBO FIRST BLOOD PART 2 took some swallowing but the opening ten minutes of RAMBO 3 caused me to fall out of my chair in shock . John Rambo does prize fighting to earn his keep in a Buddhist commune ! I mean that`s a bit like having a film where the hero`s an environmentalist who goes around blowing oil rigs to save the Alaskan wilderness . Oh wait a minute didn`t Steven Seagal ....Despite this incredible and vain attempt at character development there follows much dialogue that accurately reflects what is going on in Afghanistan in the mid 1980s . The Soviet - Afghan war actually intensified when Mikhail Gorbachev came to power and by that time over one million Afghans had died in the conflict while as many as five million had been forced over the border into Iran and Pakistan as what analysts at the time called " Migratory genocide " , a euphemism that people nowadays would describe as " Ethnic cleansing " . There`s other parts of the film that points out that screenwriter Sheldon Lettich has done his homework on the conflict with factual things like Soviet conscripts defecting to the Mujahedeen , of the red army planting mines and booby traps disguised as toys to blow off the limbs of children and of the Soviets use of chemical weapons which almost certainly proves that the sloppy script of FIRST BLOOD PART 2 was mainly down to James Cameron than Stallone , but as you`d expect in this type of action adventure movie the script rapidly degenerates into a series of set pieces of an all American superman blowing up a bunch of nasty commies who can`t shoot straight . Ah well at least the main commie isn`t played by a British actor unlike in the last film . Oh and congratulations to Peter McDonald for at least trying to make a Puma helicopter look like a Soviet helicopter gunship . The previous director was under the impression that the Soviets and Viet Cong use American Hueys Setting the record straight : A lot of people prove how ignorant they are of the Soviet - Afghan war by confusing the Mujahedeen with the Taliban . The Mujahedeen ( Translated " The soldiers of God " ) and the Taliban ( Translated " The students of God " ) are entirely seperate things . The Taliban were created in Pakistan in the early 1990s , took over Afghanistan in 1995 and were led by Mullah Omar . The Mujahedeen were split into several different groups and were led by different leaders ( None of them called Bin Laden ) most of them forming a coalition against the Taliban called the Northern Alliance in 1995/96 . Their overall leader was the legendary guerilla leader Ahmad Shah Massoud who was murdered in a suicide bombing by Al Qai`da terrorists in September 2001 . It was the Northern Alliance who fought side by side with the Western coalition during their campaign to overthrow the Taliban government in 2001 to the present day</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't really understand what the disappointment is all about? This movie falls under the genre of action and thats what it delivers from top to bottom. Were people perhaps expecting a drama? And people can also tell me how often do you get to see the Russians and spetsnaz special forces in realistic action? Sure they were vilified, mowed down easily by Rambo, mostly missed him but as the evil villains, they were highly effective in that role. Don't get me wrong, I've nothing but admiration for the Russian military. The main villain (Russian commander) was also a freaking brilliant actor. The movie did'nt use real Russian helicopter gunships, (they used French ones modified instead) but they were still effective. All in all, this is an utterly brilliant and unique film and I give it 10 stars. Best in the Rambo series.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Above average Holywood type action movie that is very under rated because it is very mis-understood.This movie is not to be taken too seriously.If one understands comic book action,that person will dig this movie.The hardware and action sequences here are very top notch.The subject matter is also a good illustration of the Afghan situation at that time.The approach of the movie was on the unrealistic side due to a marketing mainstream "quick cash" decition by the producers of this movie.But compared to other movies of the same genre and category (Holywood Formula Military Action Drama),this one is on a higher level in quality.This one is the worst of all the Rambo movies but still,if you ,like the above mentioned genre,you will enjoy this one........</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Rambo's back ... and it's killin' time ... again! AGAIN!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After 'First Blood', I assumed Stallone would have won an Oscar for his portrayal of troubled Vietnam veteran John 'Break Out The Knives' Rambo, and I supposed the fact he didn't was probably down to an oversight on behalf of the Academy or something.When he again failed to pick up the 'Best Actor' statuette after 'Rambo -First Blood, Part II', my suspicions began to rise ... but still I dismissed it as an unfortunate mistake.So imagine my fury when, after Rambo had not only saved imprisoned Vietnam veterans from years of incarceration at the bloodthirsty hands of the Vietcong, but also liberated the proud Afghans from the yoke of Communist oppression, he STILL did not receive the award that was rightfully his? Is this how America treats its war heroes? Because if it is, it's a bloody outrage. Not only did John Stallone liberate an entire country from the iron grip of the Great Bear, but he also found time to win the title of Heavyweight Champion of the World - not once, but THREE bloody times.If I was Sylvester Balboa, I would blow up planet Earth as punishment for being so damned ungrateful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not terrible, but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the highest budget of the three movies, the movie certainly looks expensive, with an epic scope at times. But you never quite get the feeling that the movie settles into a comfortable groove. Though the action sequences have plenty of gunshots and explosions, the way they are filmed - and edited - doesn't have the right impact or flow, like the action sequences in the second installment. In another comparison to the second installment, the story - while as sparse as this one - certainly kept moving. Here there are a number of segments that move very slowly and/or don't seem to have much purpose. The movie should have gotten down to business. The uneven flow of the movie also suffers near the end, as if the movie all of a sudden decides it needs to wrap things up in a few minutes, making the final battle almost come out of nowhere. (In fairness to the director, it should be pointed out that he was a sudden replacement after original director Russell Mulcahy was fired, and had only ONE DAY to prepare to helm the rest of the movie.)Like the previous installment, there is some dumb dialogue, but this time around it's not delivered in a slight tongue-in-cheek manner. If they had been willing to show this time around that they weren't taking things so seriously, it would have helped. You might say that the actor playing the Russian commander is not playing things seriously, but he goes SO over the top that he's embarrassing.It's watchable, but disappointing - they had the chance to make a kick-ass action movie here.By the way, the Afghans that Rambo helps in this movie are *NOT* the Taliban. People seem to forget that Afghanistan is made up of a number of different tribes. You can tell these particular Afghans are not the Taliban, because (among other things), the women are not completely covered, and the men play the traditional Afghan game with horses and a goat's skin (forbidden by the Taliban.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the Best Action movie of all times; nothing can go beyond that; nothing can come after that! Rambo 3 (Spoilers******) Directed by Peter MacDonald marks the biggest chapter of John J Rambo, the character created by novelist David Morrell. From the acclaimed 1982 original movie 'First Blood' followed with the 1985 sequel 'Rambo II', this current final part really cuts the true face of Rambo.In the path of Salvation it has been a long time Vietnam vet Rambo living a peaceful life in Thailand. But his mentor-best friend Col. Samuel Trautman needs his help for a mission in Afghanistan. John rejects the request making Col. to leave Afghanistan for the military operation. Things went wrong when Russian soldiers capture Colonel.Now Rambo must go to Afghanistan, but the problem is will the One Man Army can win the WAR? Scripted by Sheldon Lettich and Sylvester Stallone himself, tells the most dominant part of Rambo franchise. The story, the screenplay, was really well written and the way it was treated into the cinematic means was just Extreme. All the credit goes to the principal photographic team under John Stanier and the well talented second unit directors Douglas Dean, Jeff Jensen and Nikolas Korda. Together they created such a wide canvas that was over the Top in every means.Plus the soul of Rambo formed by the legendary Jerry Goldsmith makes this movie the most memorable one. His theme and action cues really immerse us in the movie. This is one of his best works, I like the opening club fighting sequence, huh really the score raises my adrenaline; and STALLONE HAS MORE DEFINITION THAN THE FAT PIG ARNOLD.A great action movie with the exotic backdrop of Afghanistan with a cutting edge storyline. Stallone really lived in that character, especially in those smashing action scenes and in emotional parts. I wish to have such body like him one Day. This is extreme! This is the last type of movie with high-quality action spectrums that disappeared with the 1990's. A must see movie for ALL ACTION FILM FANS."I gave this movie 10 thumbs up out of 10 stars !"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Once again John Rambo fights the Russians. Explosive action combined with strong violence on a low intellectual level.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For myself, Rambo - First blood part 3 is one of the best action movies ever. In fact the story is a little bit poor, once again the typical one vs an army-story we know already from Rambo 2. Everyone, who does not think about a stupid story and the "Evil-Russians-topic" gets an explosive and very bloody action movie without long periods of boredom. In his original uncut version the movie is banned in Germany and this has good reasons. The film is absolutely nothing for kids. In my opinion the Littleton-massacre a few weeks ago was a direct consequence of films like Rambo. If you're old enough, watch it ! The final fight starts with the following dialog: "John,what're you thinking ?" Rambo:" F**k'em!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An array of forgettable extras and a glow stick.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter MacDonald's Rambo 3 is far removed from Ted Kotcheff's credible First Blood and follows the Rambo icon established in George P.Cosmatos' First Blood Part II.What's notable from the outset is the real life political and conflict shifts since '88, as the Americans are helping the Afghan rebels achieve freedom from the invading Russians. As the cold war ended over night this appeared to hamper this Rambo's already out of date story line box office success. That said, paradoxically it has made Rambo more significant and highlights how quickly an alliance can shift which may stick in some viewers throats satirically or not.Richard Crenna once again plays Col. Trautman who is captured behind enemy lines and Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) must stage a solo 'unofficial' rescue mission. Again, Stallone is in obscene physical shape for this instalment, and is 100% committed to his role as Rambo. There's a brief appearance by Kurtwood Smith who gives the usual effective performance. Sasson Gabai and Spiros Focás are part of an effective supporting cast. However, the Russians are an array of forgettable extras and Marc de Jonge Colonel Zaysen just can't escape from the stereotype script he's been given.Rambo 3 is very watchable but in retrospect it's fraught at times by diplomatic changes of the time, even more so in today's climate and ironically this takes the fun out this instalment.Jerry Goldsmith's score is once again excellent and MacDonald who was handed the directing reigns last minute does his best. There are a few stand out scenes all of which display Stallones refined abilities, a stick fight and horse game. Nevertheless, Sylvester Stallone and Sheldon Lettich screenplay is all comic book dialogue. The film looses memento in the second act and by the third you don't care who lives or dies. There's gun's, helicopters, bullets, explosions, monks and glow-sticks if that's your thing you'll love Rambo III.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Touching human drama highlighting the futility of war and lessons yet to be learnt!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rambo is searching for inner peace and some sort of resolution of how and why he had to fight battles he was made to believe in. Where is the support for veterans by the Government and public alike? Thailand seems the most appropriate place, having rescued the POW's in the previous outing. Had Co Bao lived, things may have been different and Rambo may have finally settled down and been cured of his inner demons. Rambo keeps busy by helping and working for the Monks in the Monastery where he is living. The opening sequence where Rambo is fighting in a warehouse in Bangkok subverts the genre by playing on movie-goers misconceptions of the flawed character. Having defeated his opponent and showed mercy, despite the crowd baying for blood, Rambo pockets the prize money and limps off... he then gives it to the monks. All is not what it seems. Rambo does not go looking for trouble, but it seems to follow him. Unwittingly, he is drawn into the war in Afghanistan. In what is hardly a fair fight, the might of the Russian army is fighting peasants defending their land and homes. Intellectual snobbery and bad press prevented this film from being the classic action drama it rightly deserved, highlighting the plight of the Afghanistan people. Ironically, two days before the film's release, Russia pulled out of Afghanistan.Rambo III was the most expensive film ever made - $60,000,000. Mr. Stallone's combined salary for Rambo III &amp; Rocky V = ?25,000,000. The closest competitor was Arnold Schwarzeneger with $10,000,000. With so many stars now in the $20,000,000 price bracket it is easy to forget the Stallone phenomenon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A let down when coming from Sylvester Stallone and the Rambo franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Both First Blood and Rambo II are memorable films for their intense story a masterfully woven action. In both respects Rambo III falls short. Where as in the first two there is an underlying theme off a brave, good man repeatedly being let down by his country and the men he tries to protect, in the third movie the theme is dropped and replaced with a plot not only dull and typical but also completely senseless. Meanwhile in the action department the film starts off at a terrible pace and we only get to see the Rambo we know and love busting his moves 40 minutes into the film.The whole film is terribly forced. It takes quite a bit of effort to imagine John Rambo throwing away the life of peace he worked so hard for at the drop of a hat. In my opinion, the Coronel acts completely out of character considering the events of Rambo II. There is no way I could believe that the character would really approach Rambo once again like a total asshole. On a similar note, while Rambo surprised us over and over again with his special ops traps and camouflage tricks, when he's suddenly taken out of a dark jungle and placed in a well lit Russian camp in the middle of a desert it's hard to believe he could pull off the same stunts.The action is generally poorly executed and the climatic final battle is ludicrous. Firstly I can't get over how a Russian army composed of helicopters and tanks lost to some dudes on horses with petrol bombs. Secondly, the surreal showdown between Rambo and Zayzen where Mr. baddie decides to charge against a tank with a helicopter 5 feet off the ground directly in line with the cannon, as opposed to flying up and launching the laser guided anti tank missiles it has from a safe distance. It's obvious at this point they weren't even trying. Suffice it to say that these last 20 minutes are cringe worthy.The ending scene was pointless and showed no signs of effort to give some sort of closure to the film. Also, we were continuously introduced to a bunch of lackluster, useless characters who do nothing but slow down the action. I also had an issue with the bullet wounds in several instances. At one point Rambo is shot by a helicopter round in the leg. 99% of the time that happens your leg is blown off into little bits. I understand Rambo is the main character so at first I thought it would just break his leg and so he would continue his carnage like a bad ass while limping. To my disbelief a few seconds later he's OK again running like a bloodhound and the giant hole going through the middle of his leg is never mentioned again.In conclusion, unlike the other 3 Rambo films (yes, even John Rambo is better than this film) this one left behind nothing of value that you could take home. The story is really forced and unoriginal, the script is inferior, the action is scarce and usually makes no sense and the majority of the cast is boring and bring nothing to the table.I'm not going to say this film is of the worst action movies of all time, but if they do make a list of them, Rambo III deserves an honorable mention for ruining a franchise in the laziest way possible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A comparatively well-written opening 30 minutes gives way to the usual overblown one-man-army stuff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Living in a Buddhist monastery, making his living off illegal fights when he is approached by Colonel Trautman and Robert Griggs for help in a mission into Afghanistan to help fight the Soviet invasion. Rambo refuses and Trautman goes in alone but is immediately ambushed and captured. When Rambo hears this he throws off his peaceful ways and joins forces with the Mujahedeen rebels to launch a daring rescue mission deep behind enemy lines in Afghanistan.Having seen Rambo's I-III in the last three weeks thanks to BBC3 I feel I have seen the series in the way I would like to have ? all at once and as quickly as possible. I didn't think much of part 2 and was prepared for an even more overblown part 3 however credit where credit is due, it is better than part 2 even if that is not saying a great deal. The film opens surprisingly well apart from a silly opening fight scene (he's a Buddhist right?) that is made even funnier by the fact that it has been spoofed by Hot Shots 2 really well. However after this nonsense we get a lot of dialogue that is actually quite good: funny ('it's blue'), interesting, sharp ('where is the glory here?') and quite a balanced look at the situation. Sadly, after 30 minutes of this the film starts to realize that people who have come to the cinema to see Rambo 3 have probably not come for the dialogue and hence we get down to a series of big action set pieces where Rambo takes on the world single handed.Needless to say the film becomes a by-the-numbers affair from here on in ? baddies who can't hit a barn door, indestructible Rambo, young Afghan orphans in peril, cruel Russians, big explosions, OTT death scenes and so on. If this is all you want then you'll pretty much get what you're after; for my money the action was all a bit silly and overblown to be really involving ? zero tension and only the spectacle value of the action to keep you watching. As such I found it to be an average film at best but one that I quite enjoyed watching as a dumb action movie. To it's credit it does manage some funny lines during the rest of the movie ('surrounding them is out') but it is apparent to all that the script writer hats were taken off halfway through and replaced by the 'lets blow it all up' hats ? when Rambo faces down an entire Soviet army unit you pretty much know that this is not designed to tax your brain or be taken seriously!The cast pretty much match their material. Stallone manages to have completely robbed Rambo of the interesting elements he had in First Blood and the attempts to give him depth by sticking him in a monastery for 10 minutes is just laughably inept! Crenna seems to enjoy himself in an undemanding role that allows him to do more shooting that the other films but that's about his lot. De Jonge is a better Soviet than the ham that was Berkov but he is still a pantomime villain most of the way through. Smith is a well known face but that's amount the limit of his value in this film although local support from Focás (there's a carry-on joke in there somewhere), Gabai and particularly Shoua as well as others are OK considering they are really just background or fodder.Overall this is better than Rambo 2 simply because the writing is better in the first 30 minutes and it has some funny lines during the action, however this isn't saying much. The majority of the film is a big dumb action movie of the 'one-man-takes-on-the-world' ilk, if that's your thing then you'll love it, personally I prefer to be involved in the film and be tense and excited. Despite this I still enjoyed it a bit but only for what it was ? lots of things blowing up in stupid and OTT ways. Good for teenage boys (of all ages) but really not much worth for anyone else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Acceptable and spectacular following in which Rambo goes to rescue his former colonel in Afghanistan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Third entry directed by Peter MacDonald with lots of frenetic action and plenty of blood and violence . Thrilling and moving Rambo episode in which he goes to Afghanistan to rescue his former Vietnam superior commandant , Colonel Samuel Trautman , Richard Crenna . The famous trilogy was subsequently completed by the recent ¨ John Rambo¨ , a definitive improvement and directed by the same Stallone in which Rambo fights enemies in Thailand ; nevertheless the best considered is the original . Violent movie with Rambo character who started in ¨First Blood¨ and launched Stallone career going on his successful Rambo episodes . Sylvester Stallone as brawny hero Rambo is top-notch , he was a previous Green Beret , now retired and living a pacific existence in a Buddist temple (itself was a real temple in Thailand undergoing renovation at the time of filming , also many of the Monk extras were in fact real Monks from that very temple who were paid to appear as extras) . We see Rambo's scars from First Blood (the scar on his right arm, caused by the fall through the trees) and Rambo: First Blood Part II (the small scar right above his left cheek, caused by the heated knife scraped by his eye). He has retreated to a easy life in a rural Thai location , taking part a stick fighting match , and in construction site of a Buddhist temple . Here Rambo again has his usual enemies , the Russians , who control a particular sector of Afghanistan battling Afghan rebels , the Mujahideen, who are fighting the Soviets in the Soviet-Afghan War . Rambo goes behind Russian-dominated enemy lines too rescue his former colonel from jail , he had been taken while delivering Stingers ; the problems that the Russian forces faced with American Stinger missiles, as described in this movie, were very real, and accounted for hundreds of Russian helicopters during the real war . As John Rambo joins a warrior named Masoud (Sasson Gabai , whose character is a reference to a real-life leader of the Afghani resistance against the Russian occupation) and a kid to venture behind enemy lines where Trautman (Richard Crenna) was abducted by the ruthless Russian general (Marc De Jonge) . He then frees the prisoner but the cruel General and his soldiers set off in pursuit and carry out a brutal massacre and Rambo leads his pursuers into all kinds of booby snares , puts dangerous traps in the desert and mountains . Rambo appears threatening , lurking and harassing to his enemies pursuers escaping the innumerable risks and dangers .From the beginning to the end the comic-book action-packed and extreme violence is continued and it's fast movement ; for that reason the picture is pretty amusing ; furthermore contains lots of explosions and some of the best action scenes ever made , including an impressive machine-gun attack , spectacular scenes with helicopters and impressive ending battle between a tank driven by Rambo and a Mi-24 Hind-A helicopter . Stallone is enormous as the tough and rebel one army man , however here is no female role in the main cast, and few women appear in the film . With its $63m budget, this was the most expensive film ever made at the time of its release . The outdoors are spectaculars , the landscapes have been filmed on location in Bangkok ,Chiang Mai , Buddhist Monestary, Thailand , Tel Aviv , Eilat, Israel ,Fort Yuma Indian Reservation, Yuma, Arizona, USA . Awesome and exceptional cinematography by the cameraman John Stanier . Splendid and rousing musical score by Jerry Goldsmith , series' usual , though composed by means of synthesizer . This nail-biting film was well played and produced by the great Silvester Stallone along with Carolco : Mario Kassar and Andrew G Vajna ; being professionally realized by Peter Donald who subsequently directed another vehicle for Jean Claude Van Damme , Soldier of fortune . Original director Russell Mulcahy was replaced after two weeks of filming due to creative differences and three cinematographers also succeeded .The motion picture was preceded by the original ¨First blood¨ by Ted Kotcheff with Richard Crenna , David Caruso and Brian Dennehy, in which Rambo is falsely accused as vagrant and wrongfully imprisoned and he pulls off the break-out ; Rambo II by George Pan Cosmatos with Martin Kove, Steven Berkoff and Julia Nickson, in which he's forced to go Cambodia in search of American POWs , and this ¨Rambo III¨ with Kurtwood Smith and Spiros Focas , and the ultimate ¨John Rambo¨ directed and starred by Stallone with Julie Benz and Matthew Mardsen . The film will appeal to action enthusiast and Stallone fans . It's a movie for adrenaline lovers and frantic thrillers buffs . Rating : Good, entertaining but violent , two thumbs up . Although the movie has some aspects a little tough to take , this exciting film still has its magnificent moments . This large-scale and lavishly produced pic attempts a peculiar atmosphere with acceptable results . well worth seeing .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Take an awful idea. Cast a really bad actor who can't talk. And you have Rambo III. Even the title is wrong. We had 1st Blood and 1st Blood Part 2. So this is First Blood Part 3. NOT Rambo 3. Unless they changed the titles of the previous 2 films and never told anyone.Anyway, now that rant is over lets talk about sex. Well, I wish I could but I've got to review this pile of rubbish 1st.We start by catching up with Rambo in Thailand and he's earning some money taking part in Mu Tai Stick Fighting. So he's a hustler. But he never keeps his winnings, he gives it to the monks because he's living and helping out at a Buddist temple as an odd job man.He's approached by Colonel Trautman and Curtwood Smith to go on a mission to Afghanistan to help some local rebels fight the Russians. He refuses and Trautman goes alone and gets captured which means Rambo decides to go and rescue him all on his own.The Afghan village is attacked by the Russians in helicopters (for seemingly no reason) and they decide to leave and one man decides to help Rambo. Also an annoying young boy who is told in no uncertain terms NOT to come with them.Of course he disobeys and gets them (and himself) injured and Rambo sends his guide and the boy away. Of course he rescues Trautman and some locals also held in the same prison. Steals a helicopter and we're suddenly stealing wholesale from First Blood Part 2. Escaping in a helicopter. Destroying an enemy helicopter and crashing.Then Rambo kills what seems like hundreds of Russian commando's and he and Trautman only have to walk across an empty plain to freedom until half the Russian Army turn up AND an attack helicopter taken again from First Blood Part 2.Of course the Afghans turn up and help Rambo who finally kills the Russian Commander in his helicopter using a tank he captured.Weak film and even weaker ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A further kick up the ass to the original film. Here Rambo continues to be an indestructible God of war. This time he's off to Afghanistan to save his commander and help out the locals. The Russians are out and about being all shady and weird and the dialogue is just as painful as always. In fact, the film has become more of a buddy comedy, with quick one-liners and bad puns littered throughout. At least there's no painful love story, but there is an annoying child character. The level of propaganda reaches satirical levels and the final horses vs. tanks is laughable. This certainly seemed like a case of runaway egos and misinformed celebrities trying to use a popular genre of film to make an uneducated message. Another miss.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>They had to make another one so this one is it! The 3rd installment in the Rambo series! Lots of action, lots of Sly-Physique, lots of stalwart performance pieces by Stallone himself but the most "over-the-top" performance piece is when he cauterizes his side after being shot. He ends up with a huge black 'hole' in his side but keeps plugging along throughout the film anyway! And let's remember - This IS only a film! Who could possibly have ever done anything like that in real life?? No, only in REEL life!Here we have John Rambo quietly trying to piece back together his life after what we all saw in RAMBO 2. He's now living in Thailand helping Buddist monks build a temple. It's peaceful, it's quiet, he has time to 'reflect'. BUT here comes Col. Trautman again with another assignment for him! This time, it's the Russians in Afghanistan slaughtering thousands of common people for political gain. (Ain't politics the worst?!?) Well, Rambo doesn't want to get involved anymore but when the Col. goes in &amp; gets captured, he's gotta get his buddy out. With the help of some 'bedouins' &amp; a young boy, he gains his victory. (And who IS that young boy anyway? What a cutie! What has he been in since this film? I'd like to know.)I have to admit, the tank scene was amazing! When you need a survivor to come thru all the gunfire, blow-ups &amp; sweat, who ya gonna call? RAMBO! No one else can get the job done 'cuz he works it!I don't like the stick-fight in the beginning of the film. It looks too 'laughable'. And when Charlie Sheen made a mockery of Rambo in "Hot Shots - Part Deux", it made it all the more laughable. (Sorry, Sly!)BUT the most memorable 'stare', the most memorable line that hits you like you know Rambo means business is when he goes inside that tent to get the 'ammunition' he needs to go on this 'tour of duty'. The guy in the tent thinks Rambo's no soldier. He chides him, asking if he's a tourist. Rambo moves in closer to the guy (&amp; the camera), stares that big-eyed stare &amp; says, "I'm no tourist!" That scene gets me everytime! You just KNOW he means it! He is capable of just about ANYTHING &amp; EVERYTHING &amp; this film proves it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>About the only thing this installment has going for it is the action. Unfortunately, even the action is poorly done. A shirtless Rambo cuts through the Soviet war machine like a hot knife through butter. At no point does one get the sense that Rambo is in any real jeopardy even when the Russians fire everything short of an atomic bomb at him. The players are cartoonish caricatures. With an A-Team like endless amount of ammunition, absurdly huge knife, and compound bow Rambo is an American killing machine. A Stallone vanity piece that doesn't really even tie in to the original First Blood in any way. It takes a brutal war in Afganistan that ended up spawning the Taliban and simplifies it to the level of parody.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stallone's best action movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>sure, this movie does not challenge one's intellect. But that is not what it was made for neither. This is an action rollercoaster at its best. Stallone has never looked better than in Rambo III. Although I'm a big Sly and Rambo fan I don't hope to see Rambo IV. I think the main reason for the big success of the Rambo flicks was the political situation. In part one there was the dilemma of the soldiers returning from Vietnam, in the second installment the cold war between US and USSR, such as in the third one. Rambo III did less well at the box office because of the political detention between East and West, the cold war headed towards the end. So I don't think Rambo IV should be made. Furthermore Stallone might still be in good shape considering his age (54), but I think meanwhile he has become far too old to portray a fighting machine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everyone prefers Rambo 3,and it's right,'cause the third one is really the greatest action movie of all the times (and not only a "simple" action movie,it shows an "heart" feeling ) . It's so clear this one is the coolest entry in the coolest action saga of all the times. So,forget Lethal Weapon,man ! Rambo is a legend.Rambo is an icon.We can say RAmbo is history,and no one bad critic can destroy this truth.The first one defined the Action-hero-with-a-soul concept. Then,the sequels defined an inner "spiritual" force not understandable foe everyone.The bad critics sew only "action movies",but Rambo is more than a pair of explosion. An amazing trilogy ! " FIrst Blood " is the character's damnation phase. I don't wanna explain you the story of this incredible movie.The legend of John Rambo begins in this flick,then it develops in "Rambo :Fb part 2" (Redemption),finally it arrives to the glorious climax in "RAmbo 3" (Ascension). All the three movies were hits. Both "First Blood" and "Rambo 3 " grossed about 55 millions ( "Rambo 3" was a real huge success in America thanks to the rental and video charts; however 54 millions is a real good gross reported to 1988),so they were cleary hits. "Rambo :Fb part 2 " grossed 150 at the domestical box-office,it can be considered the headlight of the series. But we have to not forget,RAMBO 3 grossed 135/145 millions overseas !!! It was the action hit of the late 1988. Togheter the three movies have grossed over 600 millions in the late eighties. (Now,OVER a BILLION) . People loves Rambo.Critics hates Rambo.But nothing can refuse the fact Johnny made history.And not only the movie history. Long life to Johnny from his own greatest fan !!!!!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ludicrous.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nowadays the chief claim to fame of this little bit of macho 80s tripe is, of course, the events in and regarding Afghanistan since it came out. Even the fact that this was the most expensive movie of all time when it came out--as well as one of the larger financial failures of Stallone's career--has faded from memory.The script must have been written on a cocktail napkin: Rambo gets offered assignment; Rambo turns down assignment; Rambo's friend gets captured by bad guys; Rambo takes the assignment to rescue his friend. Standard issue action movie plot, but in this offering it's fleshed out even less than normal. For instance it's never exactly clear what the assignment IS that's offered by Rambo's former commander and his sniveling CIA sidekick (played with aplomb by Kurtwood Smith, who looks very anxious to get his paycheck and get the haole off this movie) except that it has something to do with Stinger missiles, which are never mentioned again in the picture, violating Anton Checkov's plot rule that a gun seen on the wall of the set in act one must be fired in act three. Every time the talented Richard Crenna is on the screen, another opportunity is blown for even minimal character development--the scriptwriters give him a hackneyed rant to the Russians about "you underestimated your enemy" (sounds like he's talking about Iraq circa 2003) and he spends most of the rest of the film cowering in a cell, waiting to be tortured and/or for Rambo to show up. As Troutman, Crenna never even gets a single line to say how much he misses his wife, or how he'd really like a beer, or how the sniveling CIA man let him down, or something. Yawn.The most shocking thing is that at $63 million this is still very much a B-movie. You'd think at that price, and with exotic shooting locales like Thailand and Israel, at the very least it would look like "David Lean Meets Rambo." In fact it looks like it was filmed on the same dusty Burbank back lot where innumerable Westerns were made in the 1940s. Even the genuine Thailand locations might as well have been EPCOT Center at Disney World.For my money my favorite part of the film is the ludicrous song played over the end credits, which is pure cocktail lounge cornball spiced up with that classic 80s My First Casio synth sound. I hoped against hope when the music credits went by I would see the title of it was "Love Theme from Rambo III," but alas, even this opportunity for a little tongue-in-cheek humor slipped the minds of the filmmakers. But then again, it's Stallone, who didn't learn to take himself with a grain of salt until the Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot era. Perhaps the addition of Estelle Getty with her .357 Magnum might have saved Rambo III from the utter waste of 102 minutes that it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To be honest, this film just didn't do it for me. Sure there was a change of location and all, but this film didn't really bring anything new to the franchise. The only real plus is the story which has its rewarding bits, but amongst the one-man army of Rambo crap it is buried deep within it all. The action is pretty phenomenal, but when a man looks at a whole legion of Russians armed with machine guns, tanks, and a gunship and only responds "F*ck'em", it's bound to be laughable at times. And naturally Trautman and Rambo manage to avoid all those hundreds of bullets by hopping into a convenient crevice. If only a man such as Rambo terrorized the terrorist, what a different world we would live in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rambo to the rescue again! Not as good this time around</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have no idea how some people think this film is better than the second one. In fact this feels like a worse version compared to the first one. Rambo feels like some supernatural character in this, instead of being human. Yeah sure the first two was a bit of a stretch, but it's passable. In this one, Rocky is basically a one man army, almost untouchable since no bullets can touch him. Yeah this is the most fit Sylvester Stallone has ever been and even admitted in a interview, that he was in the best physical shape of his career in this. Which is good for him, but everything in this seemed to drag and the annoying kid character doesn't add to the film at all, but just annoying. He doesn't seem like a character that is torn up cause of the wars he been through anymore, but a cliché hero that is untouchable. The whole thing is basically a rescue mission for Rambo to save an old friend and some others if need be. Most of the first part of this film is just boring and the plot isn't engaging at all and I just wanted it to get to the action scenes as quick as possible. Nothing about the beginning parts of Rambo's new life and how he gets dragged back into wielding guns and arrows was interesting. Yeah Rambo has corny one liners once again that is silly and yet memorable, but that is all that stands out for Rambo in this one. This isn't a bad action movie, but nothing special either. The way Rambo uses stealth to his advantage like in the other Rambo movies was cool to watch though. The worst in the series though and the beginning part of the film was tedious to watch.5.3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>just crazy enough o get by, but there are some flaws with this movie....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At one time (1988) Rambo III was the most expensive movie ever made. After watching it, I can see in some part why. It's really a big epic comic-book movie set in the geo-political firestorm of Ruskies vs. Afghanistan. With Rambo. And that means enough explosions, kills, land-mines, enemies exploding in caves, even bigger explosions, enemies fighting like ground-troops, tanks, large-ass helicopters, and uh, Tibetan monks to make Michael Bay go WOW. And sure, there's a lot of heavy fire here, so there should be some smoke. But despite some, like Rambo First Blood Part II, preachy moments and some sermonizing about helping out the Afghanies to rid Communism, and a kind of ironic feeling at the end as Rambo (i.e. America) doesn't stick around to help out a little more- and look how that turned out- this movie has little on its mind except kicking lots of ass. And at times it does. Other times, it feels weak and without a shred of anything interesting except for Stallone's Raging Torso.I'm reminded of the line from Predator: If it bleeds, we can kill it. They might've wanted to take another look at good old John boy. He's even more like a He-Man action figure, this time helping out his not-so-much friend Colonel Troutman (Richard Crenna, looking every bit tired and wondering how he got from Wait Until Dark to here) after he's been kidnapped by those pesky Russians with their super-military forces. Of course no *American* army can go in there, heavens no, it's the Cold War after all (or, rather, the tail end of it, kind of like the last erectile gasp of it). So Rambo goes in, gets a little help from some (ANNOYING) Afhani characters, including a little kid, and gets the Colonel out. Yeah, simple, straight to the point, about as sharp as a sack of wet mice.But hey, who needs story, or convincing character motivation, when you got, uh, Rambo fighting the Commies (almost) singlehandedly? Why not? Just three years prior Stallone got his America vs Russia on with Rocky IV (and in that case, ironically, Rocky won the Cold War all by himself, while Rambo ultimately needs back-up), so this is a logical extension of that via the Regan-era ethos of America F***-YEAH without the parody... well, maybe some. It should be telling that in the trivia on IMDb the director thinks that his movie might have had something to do with the Afghans taking back their country from Russia. Hey, if Rambo, who can pull a slug out from his colon (ah, who needs it) and keep on fighting without barely a flinch, why not the brave Afghanis? It seems as if it could be anyone really fighting the Russians though, and the one distinguishing, quasi-barbaric way of making the Afghani-people stand out is through a brief game that Rambo takes part in that is, uh, you know, kind of like football, only with a dead dog or something. Yeah.But hey, EXPLOSIONS! That's what you come for to Rambo once the first (good) installment is out of the way. However, while First Blood Part 2 had a relentless stream of action, which Rambo III tries to replicate, the only upside Rambo III has is some more basic (and less showy and shiny) cinematography. By this point in the series I wanted to see it just get really crazy, just no-frills holy-s***-what-just-happened action, and it only really started getting that way by the last twenty minutes, when it was relentless, WTF action and deaths and lots of hail-fire from the sky and Rambo defeating Russia with a tank and a gun. All it needed was for Rambo to cut off his arm and make his arm a gun ala Army of Darkness and it would've been an improvement.Instead, Rambo III becomes lackluster due to lack of imagination in the script (well, duh, perhaps), and only scatter-shot moments of fun with our burly man of war. Those who love watching a walking beefcake of death tear apart the red-menace won't mind. Those hoping for competent and soulful action- or, tee-hee, anything relating to the heart of the 1982 film- will be disappointed. I both didn't mind and was disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Technically that's Rambo II: First Blood Part III</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Rambo, Vietnam vet first appeared in the film "First Blood," based on the novel of the same name. He was a decent guy who, when pushed, became dangerously unstable. He'd have combat flashbacks and generally be a menace to society. He spent an entire movie antagonizing the uppity police force of a Northwestern US town before being led off in handcuffs to serve time in hard labor (as we learn in the second film).Time has been kind to Rambo; not only has he gotten far, far buffer and hairier, but he's been completely cured of his flashbacks and mental illnesses. Or at least, the fact that neither sequel even MENTIONS the trouble seems to indicate that it went away. Then again, blowing guys up while you hang them will tend to soothe the ache in one's soul.Rambo III, technically an incorrect title, is a hilariously over-the-top action film, that is right at home with the rest of Sylvester Stallone's finest work from the 1980s. After winning the Vietnam War single-handedly in the last sequel, we find our hero in the far east, finding peace with monks who allow him to participate in barbaric stick fighting contests in between his quests for spiritual enlightenment. It would seem that one would cancel out the other, but these monks aren't picky.Rambo's mentor, former commander, and occassional jailer, Colonel Trautment (Richard Crenna) finds Rambo and invites him on a special secret mission into Afghanistan to provide military aid to rebels fighting a war against the Soviet Union.Of course, the irony of the United States providing aid and fighting along side Afghanis called "freedom fighters" throughout gives this silly trifle of a movie yet another dimension of goofy thrills. Nevermind that these rebels are clearly not the Taliban, and indeed are portrayed in a generally positive light, it still makes some of Rambo and Trautman's rhetoric-filled speeches downright spooky.You know from scene one that even though Rambo is reluctant to fight (His war's over, after all), he'll eventually join the battle against the evil Soviet Empire, and indeed he does, in the fashion of the best macho eighties super action heroes. Stallone, sweating profusely throughout (No doubt because he chose a wardrobe of black in the desert), pulls off some truly momentous stunts. You'll laugh at the lunacy of Rambo versus an entire army then find yourself getting dragged into the excitment just because, despite its lack of believability, it's plain fun.Director Peter MacDonald throws in some juicy continuity gaffs (Rambo is facing someone in one shot, then spins to talk to him in the next) to keep the early, non-gunshot filled parts interesting, and as soon as the characters stop spouting philosophical gibberish and get down to the mindless violence, you're laughing so hard you don't want this movie to end. Rambo III is one of the dumbest action movies of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A lot of times I have been asked, what Rambo movie did you like the best? but i just cant answer that question, because they all are unique and different each one has its own style but yet bound together and create one long movie, because they all take place right where the last one ended. Example in the 1st one U know that Rambo is being brought to prison and the 2nd starts a few years after where he is in prison, and ends with Rambo making his way to Thyland where the 3rd movie begins a few years later. One of the cool things i like about the Rambo movies is their "On location filming" with no movie studios or sets, nothing but the real thing, if he is in Thailand then the crew goes and shots in Thailand, if its Pakistan then they go their or to a similar looking location. but the fact stays they shot outside of Hollywood's film studios which ads to the feel of realism in the movies. I know a lot of people out there don't like the Rambo flicks and calling them dump action, well it ain't no citizen cane i can tell U that, you cant compare a thriller film with a comedy or action flick with a drama. Rambo is a highly explosive blood and guts action movie and is great at it, entertaining its viewers with every minute. (**** out of ****)</fullReview>

There are tonnes of gunfights and explosions that make it a lot of fun. The dialog in RAMBO III pretty (unintentionally) funny, not that thats bad or anything. My opinions of the RAMBO films has changed quite a bit recently. I used to think that RAMBO: FIRST BLOOD PART II was the best, but then I realized that FIRST BLOOD is. I'd have to say that RAMBO III is the second best in the series, followed by the second, though they are all very good film's, not oscar worthy, but still good.Overall, a highly entertaining no-brainer action film that will not disappoint fans of the first two films in the series. 3.5/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rambo III is one of my favorite movies of all time. After Rambo rescues the American POWs in Vietnam he moves to Thailand and works in a Buddhist monastary. He keeps in shape by stick fighting and doing construction work around the monastary. Sam Trautman and Eric's father from "That '70's Show." Ask Rambo for his help because Trautman is on a mission to deliver Stinger Missiles to the rebels fighting the Soviets. Trautman later gets caught by the Soviets, and Eric's father tells Rambo at the monastary about Trautman getting captured. To make a long story short Rambo gets his equipment ready, (detonators and of course BLUE LIGHTS)and heads off to Afghanistan. It takes awhile for the Afghan Tribes to accept Rambo (they think he's a lost tourist.) The fighting and gun fights are so far-fetched that you gotta love it. The climax of the film is awesome. Rambo and Truatman get conered by the Soviets, and Rambo says his famous one liner "F_ck Them!" and starts shoot'n gernades at the soviet army. With the help of the Afghan Tribesmen, Rambo jumps into a burning Soviet tank and squares off against a evil soviet commander in a attack helicopter. Rambo kills the soviet commander by shooting the tanks machine gun into the helicopter's cockpit and rams the tank into the helicopter blowing it into millions of pieces! and of course Rambo survives. I give this movie 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sylvester Stallone returns once again to one of his most iconic roles, playing Vietnam Veteran John Rambo, who this time goes to Afghanistan amidst the Soviet Invasion to rescue his Vietnam commander officer, Col. Trautman (Richard Crenna), from being held hostage by the evil Colonel Zaysen (Marc de Jonge).Stallone as Rambo continues to prove he is a force to be reckoned with, wiping away enemy combatants left and right as he displays his very formidable set of fighting and survival skills. It was satisfying seeing him deal with the arrogant and sinister Marc de Jonge and his merciless army, especially when you see the Afghan citizens in peril. Him teaming up with the Afghan rebels and the determined Afghan boy served as a good plot element to the story.Filmed in a fast pace with plenty of action and tension, it is one of Stallone's most intense performances, showing him the will to fight for good and to protect those he trusts and the innocent that are in peril. Despite some of the cheesy acting, it's a very good action sequel for some edge-of-your-seat excitement.Grade B</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rambo III Raises The Action And Violence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rambo III is the third film of the Rambo movie franchise.In it,John Rambo being sent to Afghanistan to help them in their resistance against the Soviet Union. It stars Sylvester Stallone and Richard Crenna.The third entry in the ultra-macho Rambo action movie series finds muscle-bound warrior John Rambo,portrayed by co-writer and director Sylvester Stallone,refusing a request from his former Vietnam superior, Green Beret Colonel Trautman,played by Richard Crenna. Trautman is to lead a mission to aid the mujahedeen rebels fighting the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, but the Buddhist Rambo turns his friend down. When the mission goes awry and Trautman is subsequently captured and tortured within a prison fortress, Rambo launches a rescue effort of his own, armed with his trademark bow and exploding arrows. Along the way, he allies himself with the freedom fighters and runs afoul of the villainous Russian commander Zaysen. This film proved to be the most action packed and violent of the first series.It has an interesting plot involving the Cold War between the United States and Soviet Union.But overall,the third installment raised the standard of murder,brutality,goriness and violence compared to the first two films,First Blood and Rambo II offered.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What I can't stand in Hollywood movies is the doctrine called black&amp;white qualification and generalization ? or simply "good and bad guys" and "good and bad nations". Those are worst logical mistakes that are always used by government and its media when they want to prepare public for some new war. But the irony is that GOOD nations after a couple of years suddenly become BAD nations and vice versa. So, Americans first helped Afghans against evil Russians (they also trained Osama Bin Laden), they helped and practically created Viet Cong against the Japanese invaders, they helped Saddam Hussein and encouraged him in war against Iran? AND THEN? Now they are helping Albanians separatist in Kosovo and I wouldn't be surprised if the situation changes in that case, too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rambo III is a below-average 80's action film that deserves to be forgotten by everyone, except by those disgusted by the present American government's hypocrisy and by the average, run-of-the-mill America-hater. In other words, about 3/4 of the globe's population should watch this film.John Rambo, the invincible killing machine, fights the stupid and cruel Soviets in Afganistan. Soviet soldiers fire fully automatic Kalashnikov assault rifles at him from a distance of 5 metres, but of course they cant hit him. Then Rambo joins forces with the Taleban, who in the 80's were considered good guys by the Reagan administration. The rest in history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great for what it is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD)This movie is an action film. Trying to look at it as anything else will most certainly bring the viewer a great disappointment, but it shouldn't be viewed as anything else. True, it does not contain the same moral messages as First Blood or First Blood part II, but the sheer ferocity of the violence and Rambo's character more than make up for it. Stallone is in, arguably, the best physical shape of his life in this film and the wonderfully choreographed stick fighting scene in the beginning more than shows off his ridiculous physique. Rambo is bigger (including his knife which, designed by Gil Hibben, beats out the Part II blade by two inches), stronger, and more determined than ever, sealing the character's place as a hero icon.The true essence of a hero is one that faces incredible odds and fights bravely for the right reasons. Rambo is there to save his friend, pure and simple. He does, in a way, adopt the cause of the Afghans who aid him. And all Afghans are not evil terrorists, some are just people who WERE subject to extreme brutality during the attempted Soviet invasion. The story may seem comical now, but in the midst of the Cold War, it made audiences cheer.Many of the action scenes are a bit over the top and there are the classic action downfalls of the "never-ending-clip" and Rambo never seems to miss a shot whereas the Soviets can't hit anything accept Afghanis and prisoners. Rambo is injured however by a piece of debris sent flying by a grenade blast and has to performed some self-surgery echoing back to the arm-stitching of First Blood.Also, this movie lets us see Rambo working with people that aren't soldiers of his caliber. Musa and the boy are loyal fighters, but not trained soldiers, and Rambo's first rescue attempt is botched because of this, whereas in the second film, he was rescued by his Vietnamese aid, Co. The film rounds off the series well and should be considered a darn good action movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Beginning!!!!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rambo III probably has one of the best action packed beginnings out of many films that I have seen. When Rambo steps out of the boat and into the warehouse then tension and anticipation begins to build in the viewer of the film. I loved the part when Rambo smacks his sticks on the ground to begin the fight! From that point on until the fight is over the action is awesome. I also like how the character of John Rambo is true to form with him not killing the man he fights and then handing over the money he won to the Buddhists. What a great beginning to a film! I have watched it over and over again. The rest of the film is good but unfortunately does not follow suit with the beginning. Still a descent movie overall but it could have been better but I won't get into that. Anyways rent, buy, or just watch the film for the opening fight scene. It ranks a 10 out of 10 for fight scenes in a movie in my opinion!!!!!!! Way to go Rambo!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ahhh, Rambo, the most popular action hero of the 80's is back with a vengeance in the most underrated film in the franchise.After the events of Rambo: First Blood Part II, Rambo relocates to Thailand living a peaceful life in a monastery. Col. Sam Trautman (Richard Crena, playing the character for the final time) offers Rambo a mission in Afganistan to help freedom fighters battle the Russians. Rambo declines and Trautman goes it alone. He is captured by the Russians, and Rambo goes to rescue his only friend.I mean it when I say it's the most underrated entry in the Rambo series, Rambo does help the Taliban, but we were friends at that time. But, besides that, the action is wall to wall in this one. And the final battle, tank vs. helicopter was cool. I think it's safe to say, Rambo III is my favorite of the franchise.

		<fullReview>Great comic book action. I've been on a Stallone kick since watching "Rocky Balboa" and I just finished re-watching the Rambo trilogy, which I have not viewed since the '80s! All three films hold up very well in my opinion. Definitely a lot of goofy dialogue, but all of that seemed to enhance my enjoyment. And they just don't make action movies like they used to. To my surprise, I found Rambo III to be more entertaining than the previous two. Plain and simple, the action is bigger and better. Not to mention totally unbelievable, but that just added to the fun. It was like a first person shooter game but all I had to do was sit back and enjoy.The irony inherent in this film considering today's world is thick. I feel like they should add a title at the beginning stating the year the story takes place because as we all know, everything has flipped completely upside down. It undoubtedly dates the film but does not lessen the quality. If you enjoy action movies, Rambo III is a classic. And wow! Did his knife mutate in this one or what? It was practically a mini sword.Finally, just to comment on a previous poster's comment, not all Afghans (and Iraqis for that matter) are our enemy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best of the Three No Matter What Others Say</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, there cannot really be a "Rambo III" since there was not a Rambo I and II... the movies were called "First Blood" and "First Blood Part II"... but that is really beside the point.This film is more of the same, and I would rank it my favorite of the three. The action actually gets too intense later on in the movie, but overall I found the plot to be better and the scenes to have been shot better. It was a more enjoyable viewing experience. On a personal note, the fact they moved from Vietnam to Afghanistan really made a difference for me. Vietnam movies are alright but do not really "connect" with me. Movies about the mujihadeen in Afghanistan are a little more relevant to my life...The movie also had Richard Crenna as Colonel Trautman for the third (and final) time. His inclusion really made the difference - again. Russian: "Who do you think this man is? God?" Trautman: "No, God would have mercy." Recommended, especially if you want to see Osama bin Laden's friends starring in a movie. Bring on Rambo IV!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best in the trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't care much for First Blood because it portrayed police officers as cold-hearted and abusive human beings (there have been enough films in which the police were portrayed that way). Part II was OK, but there were a lot of movies being released in 1984-85 about American soldiers going back into Vietnam to rescue imprisoned POWs. Rambo III is totally different. It's a typical 80s action movie with lots of explosions, hilarious dialogue (mostly from Stallone), stereotyped Russian bad guys and a high body count.Marc DeJonge makes for a good villain. I wonder whatever happened to him? Also, most of the Russian soldiers were played by American and Israeli soldiers who learned Russian to star in the movie.How times have changed. Back in 1988, the Soviets were still in Afghanistan and the U.S. was helping the Mujahideen to drive them out. Then Osama ben Laden and Al Qaeda came along, and soon Afghanistan became an enemy of the U.S. because of the Taliban's refusal to hand ben Laden over. After September 11, the U.S. invaded Afghanistan to catch ben Laden and drive out the Taliban. That was accomplished, but ben Laden and his cronies are still at large.Although Afghanistan has a new government and is hoping to achieve democracy someday, that might take a long time to accomplish. But like the movie, Afghanistan now needs the United States's help more than ever, but this time...it's for rebuilding the country.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ENJOYABLY stupid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At this point in his life, John Rambo (Stallone, of course) just wants to be left alone. He lives and works at a monastery in Thailand, and he'd rather practice Buddhism than war. Though he does do some stickfighting on the side so he can win some extra cash from the locals. When his old buddy from 'Nam, Col. Trautman (Crenna) finds him and wants him to fight in Afghanistan against the evil Russian baddies, Rambo initially declines the offer. But when the head evil Russian, Col. Zaysen (de Jonge), kidnaps and tortures Trautman, Rambo snaps in to action. He goes from Buddhist monk to one-man wrecking crew at the drop of a hat, annihilating everything in his path as he helps the Afghanis - who, we must remember, were the good guys during this particular conflict. Will Rambo live to blow things up another day? John Rambo returns - again - for this third and not-quite-final installment. In 1988, the world was still in the grip of Rambo Fever, which necessitated this second sequel, and later the cartoon series, Rambo and the Forces of Freedom, and finally the toy line based on the cartoon. And speaking of one-dimensional animated characters, here Stallone looks like a human cartoon. Much like how the original Rocky (1976) was a sensitive, downbeat drama for the most part which then got distorted into something unrecognizable by the time of the countless sequels, here it's easy to forget the original First Blood (1982) and its sensitive, troubled John Rambo character. Now he's a 'roided up superhero who can essentially leap tall buildings in a single bound and if he breathes on a helicopter it blows up.Now, if you overlook the history of the Rambo series (hey, shouldn't this movie be called "First Blood III"? No movies in the series before this were called "Rambo"...but we digress) there is plenty of stupid fun to be had. There is action and adventure aplenty, and first-time director (though he'd been in the film industry for many years prior) Peter MacDonald pours it on with aplomb. Near-constant blow-ups, machine-gun shooting, knife-throws, horse chases, neck snaps, and tank and helicopter battles ensue. As exploding helicopter enthusiasts know, this has one of the best of all time. The explosions are classic 1988 explosions, and with a very big budget behind it, everything looks top-notch and they clearly didn't skimp.Of course, there is also the Prerequisite Torture - this time of Trautman - and we also get the classic "yelling while shooting a machine gun", the exploding guard tower, and the evil Russkies, among many other clichés, but they're the FUN clichés we all love and enjoy. You wouldn't even think this movie would be necessary after Rocky single-handedly conquered Russia in Rocky IV (1985), but here Stallone goes again, basically winning the Cold War single-handedly - well, with Reagan of course. Clearly the Italian film industry was paying attention, as there are countless...er...TRIBUTES to this particular Rambo outing, too many to name here. But as much as we enjoyed Rom Kristoff, Brent Huff, and Reb Brown, among others, following in his footsteps, there is without a doubt only one John Rambo.Sure, Stallone doesn't clearly delineate his words, and his excessive slurring causes you to need to put the subtitles on, but not to worry. Most of the second half of the movie is without dialogue, and is essentially 45 minutes of crud blowing up. Its nearest rival in that department is our beloved Commander (1988) - and, truth be told, Commander is probably more enjoyable and a better movie all around, and it was all done on a far lower budget. But who needs words when Stallone's mullet and almost 100-percent-of-the-running-time shirtlessness do the talking? Seeing as how he co-wrote the movie, and was juicing to a ridiculous degree, we felt it was pretty 'vein' of him. But it's all part of the fun, we suppose. Because it was the wonderful 80's, things were just bigger back then - bigger hair, bigger cell phones, bigger houses, etc. In the ever-escalating world of Rambo sequels, it means bigger knives, bigger machine guns, and far more lethal bows-and-arrows.Of course it's stupid, but it's ENJOYABLY stupid. You root for Rambo to blow the bad guys to smithereens, and you have a good time doing it. As we've mentioned before, characters like Rambo - and, by extension, movies like this - stand as a bulwark against our wussy, overly-PC society. If we stop watching them, we'll all slide even further down the PC slope into oblivion. For that reason alone, Rambo III is worth seeing, if not owning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Fine Entry In The Rambo Film Series!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The third instalment in the Rambo film franchise, Rambo III has the raw energy &amp; unflinching brutality of its predecessors and is a typical example of 1980s action cinema but unlike the last two chapters, it's also grated with lots of cheese which turns it campy at times but then again, it makes up for that drawback with its impressive action set pieces.Rambo III finds the Vietnam-war veteran residing in Thailand when he's approached by his former commanding officer who asks for his assistance in delivering supplies to anti-Soviet fighters in Afghanistan. Tired of fighting, Rambo refuses the offer but when he's captured by the Soviet forces, Rambo goes on a solo mission to rescue him from his captors.Directed by Peter MacDonald &amp; co-written by Sylvester Stallone, Rambo III lies very much on the same scale as First Blood Part II for it puts Rambo against the same enemy, only in a different setting. Once again, it's the action elements that keeps the momentum going even if those sequences can be predicted from afar, plus the character of Rambo remains inert to vulnerability.The film ups the ante on body counts &amp; explosions, a welcome aspect, but its violence isn't affecting on an emotional scale. The desert locations &amp; set pieces provide a little authentic feel to its setting, its 101 minutes of runtime is felt at times, and as far as performances go, Stallone dons the Rambo suit as per expectations but it's also good to see Richard Crenna getting more screen time than before.On an overall scale, Rambo III is another fine entry in the Rambo saga that further solidifies the legacy of its titular character, features a few cool moments of action over the course of its runtime but just like the last one, it's no match to First Blood. Surfacing at the time when Cold War themed action was becoming a thing of the past, Rambo III somehow manages to be an enjoyable ride, thanks to Stallone's screen persona &amp; good dose of warfare.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sexagenarian Colonel Trautman (Richard Crenna) leads a mission into Afghanistan to help rebels fighting the Russians. He's captured and, naturally, Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) must come to the rescue. The least of the Rambo movies by a wide margin. It doesn't even feel like a natural progression from the first two movies. John Rambo's character is especially 'off' in this one. He's more talkative and sociable than in the last two movies. He even makes jokes. The dynamic with Trautman is also off. In the other movies, Trautman was a father figure. Here he's more of a buddy. Despite my problems with how the parts are written, both actors do fine with what they're given.The pacing is poor and the script seems entirely too invested in getting us to care about the Afghan rebels and their fight against the evil Soviets. Aside from making the whole thing feel dated (even more so than the second Rambo movie in my opinion), it's like they forgot what people watch a Rambo movie for. If they had trimmed a lot of this stuff in the first half, the movie would have flowed better and that could have made for a more effective actioner. A lot of the dialogue is pretty corny, too. The best part of the movie is the cinematography from John Stanier, which is far better than you would expect for a movie such as this. Watchable for fans of the first two movies but nothing special.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Rambo III" is the part of the franchise where Stallone has given up on giving these movies an actual meaning, the social comments are out of the window. Even the title has gotten as simple as possible (considering it follows "Rambo First Blood Part Two"), a subtle change to indicate that this is just there to up our hero's body count. The story is bare-bones as well: Trautman gets captured and Rambo kills just about everyone on the planet to free him, that's pretty much it. But then I wonder: is there anything wrong with that? It's a pretty entertaining movie, and it benefits from the fact that Afghanistan hasn't been done to death yet as an action movie location. Rambo gets to have fun hiding in the mountains and ambushing hapless Russian commandos, and for once even the addition of locals is not a complete waste of time. The child soldier is a surprisingly well-rounded character even that gives you a very bitter-sweet feeling, sadly it's the only example of clever writing you find in this movie. If only they spend as much time developing the villain, because Marc De Jonge has absolutely nothing to work with. "Rambo III" is very much a mixed bag, whether you enjoy it depends on what you want from this franchise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An action packed film that attempts to shed light on the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I say in the review title that this film "attempts" to shed light on the plight of the Afghan people, don't take that the wrong way. If your willing to feel the emotion in this movie and your willing to pay attention, much like the other installments in this series there are clear messages in this film. All of the movies in the Rambo series have conveyed messages about the horrors of war and this one is no different.First Blood Part III takes Rambo into Afghanistan to rescue his mentor and friend Colonel Trautmen. On an ill fated mission, Trautmen is taken hostage by Soviet forces and Rambo simply refuses to allow his friend to die. While in Afghanistan, the journey of self discovery that the character of Rambo is always on leads him to learn of the plight of the Afghan people. Surrounded by religious extremists who would wipe them all out and facing down a massive Soviet invasion, these people simply refuse to quit. They refuse to lay down and die, because of this Rambo instantly feels a connection with them and it seems Rambo has found a new war to fight, I won't go any further because it will spoil the ending of the film for you but i will say this, ignore the films detractors. First Blood Part III is as much Rambo as either of its predecessors and is a very very well made film.Excellent acting, top notch writing and direction and an excellent story help the viewer see and understand the points being made in this movie. There is some added humor that perhaps the two previous films didn't have, but those few moments of humor have a purpose and they are not at all misplaced. There's plenty of action and plenty of Rambo doing what he does best. Refusing to back down no matter the odds and refusing to quit in situations that would leave most people curled up in a ball and crying.If your a pure action movie fan or perhaps more like myself, you can see and feel more in these movies than just gunfights and explosions, either way you'll enjoy this one. For those who might not have an understanding of just how most of the Middle East became a war zone, believe it or not there are plenty of scenes in this film that can give you some insight. Even though Rambo is going in long after the battles have begun, his journey leads him to understanding the plight of the people living there and can help just about anyone else start asking questions and looking for answers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can be watched as a comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not saying Rambo 3 is a bad movie. From the action movie standards, it can be above average. Those looking for entertainment will not be disappointed. However, to me, Rambo 3 looks rather a comedy movie. There are many scenes that is plain funny. The accent of Moussa makes me laugh throughout the movie. "You arrre not soldier you arrre not scientist! Who arr you? Arr you a tourist?" And Rambo replied snarling in anger "I am not Tourist"... It's a classic.The Russian accent of the lead villain is also very humorous: "Drop yorr wepon! We are not gonna hurt you!"Well, apart from silly dialogs, the action scenes are also at par with Hot Shots! Rambo and his sidekick fight an entire battalion of Russian armored vehicles, tanks, howitzers, helicopters and get away with no scratch!I think the US is wasting its money by making nukes and war planes. All he needs to do is just send Rambo and his ole buddy crenna to take care of the matter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stallone's best movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here we are introduced to Rambo, mullet'd, staring intently at the camera, before stick-fighting in Bangkok. Pointless, you say? Of course not. There is a convenient explanatory scene, immediately following, as Colonel Trautman shows up to persuade Rambo to join him on a mission in Afghanistan. Laughably pompous philosophising about a "special stone" in a Buddhist monastery, where Rambo has been working, trying to find himself. Rambo declines to take the assignment, Trautman goes without him, and the mission lasts for about 10 seconds, before he is outnumbered and captured. (Great plan that you have there. It was very well planned out) So, Rambo drapes himself in the American flag and decides to head to Afghanistan, taking on hundreds of Russian troops, to rescue his superior.Laugh as Rambo melodramatically glares at the camera and says "I'm no tourist!" Wonder how Soviets understand the meaning of American slang and phrases like "wiping out".Marvel at the (surprisingly) well done action setpieces. Plenty of explosions to keep the audience awake, between bouts of comically inane dialogue. (Trautman asks "Rambo, can you fly that helicopter?" Rambo's response: "Let's find out!") Rambo, now the "man in black" in Afghanistan, even takes part in a game of Buzkashi, with a lamb's body which looks like a stuffed animal wrapped in a bushy black shag rug, before yet another explosive gunfight, a supremely painful looking cauterization scene.I can't decide if the film's climactic, villain's death scene was supposed to be funny or not, but, really, a joust between a tank and a low flying helicopter? I couldn't stop chuckling.First Blood was awful; a depressing, violent, pointless mess of a movie, with no one to root for or care who wins. Part II was (from what little I can recall about it) a generic action/ war movie. But this film was a laugh riot. Whether or not it was intended to be funny..... ?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Systems exist so we never meet each other." - Mr. Lif This is a review of "Rambo 3", "The Living Daylights" and "The Beast", three action movies from the late 1980s, now interesting for the way in which they toe the Pentagon line regarding Afghanistan's Mujahideen.The best of the three films, "Rambo 3" stars Sylvester Stallone as a Vietnam veteran who lives in a monastery, looks depressed, pumps iron and wears a mullet. Though now a pacifist, Rambo nevertheless returns for "one last job". His old Colonel has been kidnapped by evil Soviets forces and is being imprisoned in a super cool looking military base deep within the heart of Afghanistan. Rambo's mission? Get in, kick ass, get out. As he's essentially a giant walking penis, Rambo severely overcompensates. Not only does he rescue his buddy, but he kicks Russia out of Afghanistan, rallies a band of friendly Mujahideen freedom fighters, teaches locals to love Westerners and schools us all in the evils of communism. The film ends with a title card praising the brave heroes of the Mujahideen."The Living Daylights" tells the same tale, though here our hero is British Secret Agent James Bond (Timothy Dalton). Less homo-erotic than Stallone's film, but equally patriotic, "Daylights" opens with various totems of Britannia - the Rock of Gibraltar, Union Jacks, Harrier jets - before nosediving into a plot about defecting Russians, Afghan opium and evil commies. Once again the film ends with Mujahideen on horseback charging valiantly toward Soviet Forces. The Empires of the West ? and their lovable henchmen, Bond and Rambo - love underdog freedom fighters, see.Less cartoonish but more fascist, "The Beast" revolves around a Soviet tank crew. They rape and pillage Afghan villages, blow up mosques, their racist, tyrannical leader is shown to hate even pro-communist Afghan allies, and our hero is an enlightened Russian who defects and joins forces with the Mujahideen to once again, like Rambo, charge headlong into Soviet tanks and helicopters.In all these films, the Mujahideen are portrayed as civilised, well educated freedom fighters pitted against remorseless, uncouth Soviet monsters. What's hilarious is that as soon as the Soviet Union collapses, cinema immediately starts portraying the Mujahideen as villains; they're now of no use. They're US public enemy number 1.In 1893 Russia recognised British "ownership" of Afghanistan. When Britain exited India and its Empire collapsed, Russia moved tentatively in. A communist party was set up and the country's old kings and monarchs kicked out. Major reforms then began taking place - modernisation, a secular government, women's rights, large scale land reforms, public education etc ? which were all initially accepted. Some thought communism wouldn't work in a country as conservative and traditional as Afghanistan, but of course Soviet styled communism turned out to be but a form of industrial feudalism with elements of Russian nationalistic tribalism. Afghans supported these changes. Problems quickly began occurring, though. Afghanistan's filled with diverse tribal groups, and cracks began to appear, both inside the communist party ? different factions vying for control ? and outside, religious and tribal leaders opposing the rapid social changes. As extreme reforms were being carried out in VERY short periods of time with NO concern for Afghan culture, small protests began. Islamist rebels who wanted to restore an older, more traditional Islamic order, were the most vocal. Aided, armed, funded and led by the West, they staged bloody clashes with the pro communist government. This went on for a number of months. Eventually Western backing for these rebels escalated to such an extent that the local government was forced to call for Russian support. Soviet troops arrive, which the West spins as an "invasion". Cue Western propaganda: here was an evil Soviet invasion being held back by lovable rebels. The truth was almost the complete opposite. Afghanistan was a Soviet ally dealing with CIA-backed Islamist radicals trying to topple the capital of Kabul. Later, US defence secretary Robert Gates would say: "We mean to suck the Soviets into a Vietnamese-styled quagmire." And Zbigniew Brzezinski: "We knowingly increased the probability of their intervention with the aim of drawing the Soviets into the Afghan trap. The day that the Soviets officially crossed the border, I wrote to President Carter, 'We now have the opportunity of giving to the Soviet Union its Vietnam War.'"For several years the West arms the Mujahideen and uses them to fight a proxy war against the Soviets. Recognising this all as a giant waste of time, the Soviets eventually pull out. The West, meanwhile, continues arming rebels and jihadists. The Mujahideen, essentially religious fanatics, violent gangs and conservative psychos, then begin fighting for control of the country, echoing, of course, the current "engineered destabilisation" of places like Somalia, Iraq, Syria and Libya. The Taliban/Mujahideen then take over Afgahnistan and rule from roughly 1995 to 2001. When they refuse oil and mineral rights to the US in the late 90s, a campaign begins in the West to turn them into "our enemies". From here on the Taliban are blamed for 9/11, linked with al-Qaeda, women's rights abuses and "crazy Islamic Laws", none of which were previously deemed a problem until the Taliban began courting Argentinian gas companies over the Unocal-CentGas consortium (ie Bush and Cheney). In response, Unocal appears before the US Congress and demands the removal of the Taliban regime. Days later the Taliban are issued an ultimatum: take our offer or we drop the bombs. Months later all US-held Taliban assets are seized, embargoes and bans are put in place and the country is invaded by a Western Alliance. In other words, it was only when absolute control of local resources was challenged that the Taliban regime, played like a puppet for over half a century, was openly discredited.7.9/10 - One of the last big budget, R rated muscle movies. Worth one viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rambo saves Afghanistan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rambo III is an incredibly dumb piece of Reganite rubbish and the worst of the Rambo films. It shows that at the time the Rambo series was running out of stream and ended the series for 20 years.After the events in Rambo: First Blood Part II John Rambo was living and working with Buddhist monks in Thailand, helping them build their temple and rise money by fighting in stick fights. His old Colonel (Richard Crenna), tries to get recruit Rambo to work with him once more. This time he was going into Afghanistan were the Soviet Union had invade. Colonel Trautman obviously wants the best man he can. However Rambo refuses, saying his war was over i.e. Vietnam. Rambo quickly changes his mind when he finds out that Colonel Trautman was captured by the Soviet forces and being torture. Rambo sets off from Pakistan into Afghanistan, meeting up with the Mujahideen and becoming a part of their community. He finds out the Soviet Command (Marc de Jonge) was brutal, setting up landmines and attacking villages at will with helicopters. He sets out orders to kill men, rape women, take away women and kill babies to prevent the new generation of Afghans (that bit reminded me of Come and See). With the help of the Mujahideen, Rambo set out to go into the Soviet fortress, rescue Colonel Trautman and the Afghan hostiles, and hunt down the Soviet leadership.The film is just a live-action cartoon with the level of violence and the way some people die, such as Rambo use of explosive arrows, to him driving a tank into a helicopter, to the large number of deaths that Rambo was responsible for. This film was a product of its time. Some of the action scenes were fun, like the night raid and the stick fighting, but some was over the top and lack any style. The director of the film was Peter MacDonald and this was his first feature. His experience was as a Camera Operator and in the 2nd Unit, and has worked in films such as Rambo II, Batman, the Bourne Ultimatum and X-Men Origins Wolverine. It was obvious he was just a gun-for-hire to do what he was told. I don't put much blame on him, he should just stick to what he is good at. The major problem of the film was the writing. The film's plot is weak at best and had nothing new to say or do for the action genre. It was nothing different to it to Rambo II. Politically the film was wrong; it made out that the Soviet Union was pure evil, especially considering that by the time American and Soviet relations were warming up. As well the American could do nothing wrong. As well history has proved that the Mujahideen were not all goodness and light, with them becoming the Taliban and biting the hand that fed them. It funny that the Americans ignore their past about them hating America and just focused on the anti-Soviet element, not realising they will be trouble. Rambo III was ridiculous and dated really quickly.Its pure pantomime.At least Rambo finds his soul in the new film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ha, ha,Post 9/11, Rambo III is pretty symptomatic of the shortsightedness of Hollywood - as well as the cultural/political spectrum which Hollywood undoubtedly influences.Oh yeah, Rambo III is a stupid action film too. Who would guess that the bow-propelled grenade would be the downfall of a military superpower...Yes, Rambo is general idiocy, yet it leaves a worse taste in your mouth than almost any propaganda (official or not) that I have seen. For example, in North Korea they may televise martial songs about turning their bodies into bombs to destroy the USA (don't know if they still do that), yet this film actually depicts such blatant hatred in action. To those who say that the people Rambo helps aren't 'Taliban' or anything to do with 'Al Qaeda', real world events prove that by the time the film was made America had already sponsored the Mujahedeen's first Pakistani training camp - so it's no use trying to divorce the fantasy of Rambo with the REAL help which was given to Bin Laden.Dated concept nowadays to believe that killing lots of people means doing the right thing... or is it?The difference between Rambo and 'general' action films is that Rambo tries to relate to real world events and is even more embarrassing for that. Perhaps its time for Rambo to help some more POWs (even if they're not called that) and to set the next film in Guantanamo Bay.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The essence of 80's action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rambo III stands as a prime example of the sentiment behind the action films that became so successful in the 80's. It has NO pretensions of being anything more than mainstream action fare. Whether it's deliberate or not, the writers have made the character of John Rambo nothing more than a cartoon action hero - he embodies everything that is 'American macho'. This completely over the top (no Stallone pun intended) superhero is thrown into a wonderfully over the top story, where there's never any doubt he'll win and little chance that he'll have too much trouble in his task (a leg wound and a hole through his stomach are just an opportunity to show how incredibly tough and resistant he is). The action scenes unashamedly adhere to the 'Hollywood guide to entertaining violence' (probably in existence somewhere) and the viewer is exposed to endless guns, bullet hits, tanks, guns, sweat, helicopters, guns, dead extras, muscles, guns, explosions, blood and guns. Which is, of course, incredibly good fun to watch.The story is fantastic in it's simplicity - nasty bad guy in charge of evil communist army is cruel to local rebels so good old Sly has to penetrate converted mountain base, rescue his friend and destroy the entire opposing army. Marvellous. The ultimate action-adventure that could be written by an excited 5 year-old.This could have been incredibly boring given the horrendous script and there are times when it is in danger of becoming like one of the billions of B-movie action films that grace the bottom shelf of video shops these days, but Stallone's hyper-macho performance and Peter MacDonald's direction keep things lively. To be fair it's probably Vic Armstrong who is most worthy of praise for coordinating what are undeniably some of the most amazing battle scenes ever, combining helicopters, horses and an unbelievable amount of explosions. I doubt in the modern days of CG that we'll ever see this many pyrotechnics in one film again. So, well done Mr Armstrong for keeping the film firmly in the A-movie category.Obviously, just given the film's title, people should know what kind of film to expect and anyone, like me, who is capable of ignoring a bad script and disengaging the brain, should relish the visuals and have a fun hour and 40 minutes.8/10 for being so completely over the top.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Giving Up When The Chips Are Down</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think Rambo III is one of the best movies ever made about how not to give up, no matter how bad the odds are against you. In Rambo III, John Rambo doesn't know the meaning of the word "quit". One really good scene in Rambo III is when Rambo is sitting in a cave and he gives himself quick "field surgery" by removing a huge chunk of splinter from his side that he received after invading the Russian fort to save a good friend. After removing the splinter by hand, he then pours the powder of a bullet into his wound and sets it on fire to seal up his wound from the inside and stop its internal bleeding. What can I say? Rambo is tough! he doesn't know the meaning of the word "quit"! Because of this, I give Rambo III a 10 star rating!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the best installment but still keeps Rambo the best Action series of its time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By the time Rambo III was released the message was pretty clear...you don't ever mess with John Rambo. He was an infamous part of cinema history and had created drama, intense action, explosions unlike action movies had never seen, gory kills, war, vengeance and most importantly...a one man destruction crew. Stallone returned in the third installment keeping very true to the John Rambo character. It isn't the best in the original trilogy...in fact it might even be the least impressive although I still loved it on its own merit but it loses a lot of true grit behind the original two films. I think quite honestly the film makers, cast and everyone involved just got really excited about making this third one and in the process overlooked some key elements. The first two films had been so phenomenally successful that they had a huge budget...the biggest in history at the time it was made....and it does show. Rambo III is shot throughout Thailand, Pakistan, Israel and the U.S. to double as Afghanistan. The war they deal with is a very real one...culminating around the time this was shot. So they keep the war real and the message vitally important. The problem is that they let some of the really strong story go to wayside, much like they did with the most recent Rambo film (2008) See my review. The story lacks the same heart although you do see some remnant of it. However, we also get treated to FINALLY seeing Col. Trautman actually partake in the action and we get to see them fight side by side for presumably the first time since Vietnam.Sylvester Stallone returns to one of his most infamous character, and also helms the screenplay too which is excellent at usually. Rambo hasn't changed. He's disillusioned with the world, hiding from himself and his country and he still has his steely determination. The only difference is that he has more punch lines to deal out. This being a major epic blockbuster action flick they made Rambo a little more personable by giving something a sidekick as well as some one liners which work pretty well (I'm your worst nightmare, its a blue light...it lights up blue....and so forth.) Richard Crenna also returns to the series as Trautman and for the first time in three films we actually get to see him put his acting chops to work and also partake in some action. In some ways I still see him as something of a robot but far less in Rambo III than in the other films. Him and Stallone have forged something of a bond that works for the series. I sincerely hope I am getting this right but I believe its Marc de Jonge, that plays Rambo's pseudo-partner who helps him get into the Russian fort. He does a good job of sidekick status but never really does any stand out moments. Unfortunately I can't decipher the name of the actor who portrayed the evil Russian Commander but in all honestly he was pretty awful and very campy. Definitely not one of the better Rambo villains.So with a less than great story, a sub par supporting cast, and dialog that goes a little more comedic, why is Rambo III the classic that it is? Simple...action. Considered by some to be one of the most violent movie ever, the explosions, the gun fights, the prison escape, the cave battle, the helicopter chase (again---far superior one in First Blood II), makes it a red blooded male favorite. There is a story there...however light it may be...and Stallone still kicks some serious butt!! It felt like at times they were trying to recycle some of the incredible action sequences from First Blood II but fortunately for them that film had such incredible action sequences that it works again. Regardless of how you feel about this third installment compared to the other two...you have to see it...its a natural progression and its worth of the series especially the original trilogy. I happen to think Rambo, including this one is the patriarch of action films and you don't see anything like it anymore sadly. 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great well done action sequences and an refreshing sense of humour highlight this one.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Several years has passed, John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) is living the quiet life in Thailand. While Rambo is living with the monks. His former superior Colonel Samuel Trautman (The late Richard Crenna) asked Rambo to join to a top secret mission to help the freedom fighters in Afghanistan to fight against the Russians. When Rambo says no to his former superior and friend. Trautman decides to go to the mission without Rambo and the mission failed, while Trautman is captured in a large Russian camp. Now Rambo goes on the mission unofficially to rescue his former friend. Rambo finds help from a guide (Spiros Focas) to bring him to the enemy base. His guide is actually a freedom fighter and he gets to meet other Mujahedeen rebels, who are desperately need help to fight the ever-growing war. Russian Colonel Zaysen (The late Marc de Jonge) is trying to make Trautman talk about the freedom fighters plan and if they Mujahedeen rebels have any missiles. Now Rambo will try to find an way to enter the Russian camp to find his friend before they killed him.Directed by Peter MacDonald (Legionnaire, Mo'Money) made an lively, entertaining action film with plenty of explosions and humour. I felt this third film was certainly an improvement over Part 2. I felt the action scenes were well staged this one and there's some cleverness as well. The actor, who plays the villain Zaysen is a entertaining villain and he has some of the funniest dialogue as well. Although this third film was an box office disappointment in the U.S. while it was an international success in other countries. Stallone returned to play the John Rambo character in the fourth film, which it will be released in early 2008.This review is for the Ultimate Edition for "Rambo 3". DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an strong Digitally Remastered-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has an running commentary track by the director, which he's informative at times but the track is pretty quiet as well. DVD also has Deleted Scenes with Alternative Opening and Ending. DVD also has the "Groundbreaking Military Special Operations" opinion, which it's fun for die-hard fans of the movie. Original director:Russell Mulcahy left the production early during filming with creative differences with the filmmakers. The original screenplay was actually more serious in tone before many re-writes of the script. It was one of the most expansive films of the 1980's. While the movie is occasionally funny, you wonder if most of it was "unintentionally ?" hilarious dialogue. It's a must for action fans and it should keep Rambo fans happy until "John Rambo" comes out in early winter 2008. Written by Stallone (The Rocky Series) and Sheldon Lettich (Bloodsport, Double Impact, Lionheart). Joe Dunton Camera Widescreen (J-D-C Scope). (****/*****).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>caught the beginning channel surfing and considered whether i might watch it. It wasn't what I was planning to do but in the end I'd never got round to seeing any of the Rambo's and I thought this was my era and I'm getting into the 80's things I missed. Lets give it a go I liked the way it began with a decent fight then moved on to the tranquility of a Buddhist monastary. A transition reminiscent of a Bond film. Its set in Russian occupied Afghanistan so soon you can be sure Rambo will be blowing up stuff and yes the action is pure all the way through the way it is when one man takes on an entire armySome of the parts I thought reflected cold war propaganda which makes interesting viewing today. The main focus is on Rambo's stirring up the people to help overthrow the puppet government. We really see the suffering of the people as they are attacked by helicopters and this brought a realism that added depth to the supreme onslaught of action. Rambo's appearance raises a dilemma since he indirectly is the cause of massive suffering. One brief scene in particular awed me. A woman and her kids run screaming from a missile, another one slams into them and after the explosion just nothing, silence. Now that is serious portrayal of war As a pure action flick Rambo 3 goes to extreme lengths but its still enjoyable and the unusual introduction of realism goes to show what I love about what many people see as b-movies or gore movies. They can do things and go places no other genre can When I was a kid this was controversial and another funny thing - there's even a kid for all those under 18's to identify with! But I wouldn't hestitate to recommend it for anyone old enough to understand the news And what an inspired choice for someone to put on TV at the moment. This is the perfect time to watch Rambo!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rambo III......my absolute FAVORITE Rambo movie!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a HUGE Sylvester Stallone fan, from rocky to Rambo and everything in between, he is my favorite actor and inspiration for working out and changing my body and my life in that way. as of this review, I've seen the rocky and Rambo films SO many times, and i still watch them very often. I've seen all 4 of the Rambo films, and i can clearly say, Rambo III has everything i want in a Rambo film. first blood gets a lot of credit, i guess because its the first film and its got more humanity and Rambo is more of a normal guy in it with some serious psychological issues, but i still don't get the fuss over it. in fact, to me it was somewhat disturbing and depressing to watch. then came Rambo: first blood part 2. AWSOMENESS INCARNATE. the explosions! Stallone's bad ass ripped bod! explosive tipped arrows! fighting those communist bastards! it was amazing, one of the coolest action films I've ever seen, and the first film that made Rambo a total one man army war machine. BUT, Rambo III did the same stuff...but better! not that i didn't enjoy Rambo 2 any less, but i gotta say, of the 2, Rambo III got my engines roving. one of the best things is that colonel Troutman, played once again by the great late Richard crenna (can you believe this guy was on an episode of "I love Lucy"?) got a starring role this, not just a background guy who sits in a warehouse while the action takes place. the plot of the film is simple: Troutman goes to Afghanistan, gets captured (rather quickly), and Rambo goes to rescue him. thats it. BUT, its the greatest rescue of all time! i loved the desert setting in Afghanistan, and the friends Rambo meets along the way are perfect for this kind of action/adventure. he meets mousa, who is like a kind of comic relief element at times, and helps him infiltrate the Russian base. some of the aghan actors are great, especially the one who gives the speech in the tent about whats going on in Afghanistan with the Russians. he had a very Omar sheriff gentleness to him, great scene. Stallone himself looks HUGE. and i mean GIANT. this was probably where sly reached his peak of physical prowess, he got VERY big and VERY ripped for this film, even enough to rival Arnold. all that working out payed off, cuz he looked amazing. basically, if you take Rambo 2 and infuse it with lots of steroids, you get Rambo 3, because this movie is ACTION PACKED. even MORE explosions. MORE insane kills (espcially one including a big burly Russian grunt who nearly squeezes Rambo to death). and of course Rambo's handy blue light that he finds creative ways to use to take down enemies. its truly the iconic Rambo film, with lots of slow motion action and running while fire explodes all around Rambo, and some of the stunts are quite insane, like Rambo grabbing a sheep from the side of the horse, its quite amazing how he did these. the iconic and bad ass imagery is there, like Rambo and Troutman having a western style face off against the Russians near the end, and the final battle is something to behold. TANKS! HORSES! HELICOPTERS! PLANES! GUNS BAZOOKAS! RAMBO RUNNING AROUND SHIRTLESS SHOOTING BAD GUYS! its just a lot to take in, but its amazing. i thoroughly enjoyed this one, and so far out of the 4 Rambo films, this one is my absolute favorite. and of course, i cant write this review without mentioning Jerry Goldsmiths AMAZING score for this film. the Rambo films first introduced me to Goldsmith, and he certainly creates a wonderful action score, big bold and exciting, like the film itself, but also some very beautiful, majestic themes like his music complimenting Afghanistan which is wonderful and thoughtful. his score and music makes the movie about 1000 times more awesome, and i doubt it would be if it weren't for his big, heroic score, with touches of the beautiful "first blood" theme.overall, if your into big over the top action, this will do it. i don't care what the critics or silly "first blood" fans say, this is Rambo as he should be seen and while the movie suffered at the time of filming because the Russians decided to pull out of Afghanistan, the movie itself doesn't lose anything from that. sly is at his awsomest here, and if your any kind of sly/Rambo fan, you cant pass this up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>admittedly dumb action movie pulls the right punches</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I admit that I was very unimpressed as a teenager when I rented the poor quality pan and scan version of this film which was available on video for so many years. It didn't quite live up to the second films RAMBO: FIRST BLOOD PART II but I still thought it was miles better than the first one (he didn't even kill anybody in that one!).Anyway, this film is all about big explosions and stunts which the small-screen just can't deliver on. This film is actually quite well-shot and excitingly paced when seen in its full widescreen glory, such as on DVD. The stunt where a burning T-62 tank drives straight into an oncoming helicopter has to be one of the best-filmed and edited action sequences of the 80's, right up there with the helicopter explosion in DIE HARD and the oil refinery blowing up in MAD MAX 2: THE ROAD WARRIOR.The film, if looked at seriously, it remarkable stupid. There's a kinda-comic relief-type Arab guy who keeps calling Stallone a "tourist" and a grating little kid too. However, this film doesn't fall into the same trap that MAD MAX 3: BEYOND THUNDERDOME fell in and it gets the kid out of the way pretty quick and just gets down to business. Stallone is pretty minimalistic this time around and only delivers about 7 lines in the whole film... mostly along the lines of "It's my war now" and "[I'm] your worst nightmare". This is about the polar opposite of the first film, in which he was all talk and no killin'. I'd say that this film falls into DAY OF THE DEAD syndrome, the second sequel that gets much-maligned, but is actually really good. It just doesn't compare to the second in the trilogy, but its better than 90% of other similar action movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Aside from 'driving miss daisy' this has to be Stallone's greatest hour! A truly moving and harrowing journey both through the troubled mind of Don Rambo and the badly criticised Taliban. For once the people of Afghanistan are shown in their true light. At the first scene we realise Rambo has become a coward, stick-fighting a blind man to con money for his new order of monks. But that is not too last, when his lover and once great teacher Colonel Trouthead is held to ransom he soon remembers his true calling and dons the red headband that gives him is super powers. If you are thinking this is merely another over hyped action flick, then i assure you, you are truly mistaken. Rambo 3 is a deeply moving drama concerned with the misunderstood sexual relationships of todays gays in wartime (think broke-back mountain meets platoon). Of course the action is also of a high standard and Stallone's muscly sweating body holds the cameras attention throughout much of this, providing a highly sexual and provocative (yet subtle) twist to the film. my thanks also go to the producers of this fantastic epic for finally giving trout head and Rambo a decent of amount of screen time together and allowing the sexual undertones of the first two movies ( where their previous relationship was often merely hinted at ) to finally explode into full on man love. the scene where trout head asks Rambo " does it hurt john " and Rambo tenderly replies "no sir " made me stand and cheer and I'm not afraid to admit i cried. all in all a must see for any young gays out there ( possibly in the armed services themselves) who aren't afraid to stand up and be counted</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What am I going to get? That's what I was thinking before seeing Rambo III. I honestly didn't know what to expect. I realize now how stupid I was. First Blood was a good movie even with it's imperfections. It was Rambo First Blood Part II however that took whatever humanity and emotion to be found in the original and threw it aside in favor of a hackneyed POW plot and gonzo action. So what of Rambo 3? Was it going to be more reminiscent of the broken human story of First Blood or the orgy of gonzo over-the-top action a la Rambo II? Take a guess.I think I'll take "orgy of gonzo action" for $200, Alex. Sure I turn the movie on and it starts out real serious, but then soon enough it's like I'm watching Rambo II all over again with a minor change in scenery and the nationality of the bad guys changed. If you liked Rambo II and thought it was movie making at it's greatest then I rest assured you'll love this one too.For anyone who by chance hasn't seen Rambo III after all this time, walk away. Spare yourself from the huge climatic battle scene in the finale that ends with one-man army Rambo walking out barely untouched to live another day after killing half the world as "He Ain't Heavy... He's My Brother" sung by Bill Medley plays over the end credits. Are you kidding me? Somehow I'm unmoved. Patriotic action slosh doesn't come any lower than this baby and as plain 'ol entertainment has something never came off so dated and pedestrian.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know this movie received criticism from many critics and its understandable why to a certain extent and I'll admit its not very realistic or makes a great date flick but its great fun and for those who are looking for a war drama such as Platoon or Full Metal Jacket your not really gonna find that in this film.Now that I've got that cleared up I would like to state that this movie is a terrific Non-Stop Action flick that kept me on my feet routing for Stallone as Rambo: First Blood Part 2 did so terrifically. Enormously entertaining.Rambo sends himself on an unofficial mission to save his general (Richard Crenna) from an Afghani POW camp basically. The story is easily laid out and I know I wasn't to expect something to original but being a huge fan of loud blistering non stop action flicks I didn't have a problem with it. Once the story unfolds the action and fun dosen't let up once and Stallone unleashes the great display of the one man killing machine he so terrifically did in Rambo 2. What I loved about this movie is it contained more of everything more bombs, more bullets more rockets more explosions more war vehicles and more of an army (especially the ending) means more men for Stallone to kill and that equals an awesome action extravaganza.Is this movie for everyone? of course not Ones who love high voltage violence and entertainment or if you're not an action fan and want to try out an action movie I would without questioning suggest this, ranking it right up there with Die Hard and Under Siege.Without doubt the best of the 3 (least thats me) 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Rambo's former Vietnam Colonel, Samuel Trautman, has been assigned to lead a mission to help the Mujahedeen rebels who are fighting the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.When the mission goes belly up and Trautman is kidnapped and tortured by Russian Colonel Zaysen, Rambo launches a rescue effort and allies himself with the Mujahedeen rebels and gets their help in trying to rescue Trautman.......The third Rambo film was a notorious flop at the time of its release, and for a short while, was the most expensive film ever made. It's not a bad film by any means. Silly, but certainly not bad.The real reason I believe as to why the film failed, was because audiences were becoming a little tired of the muscle bound one man armies against the world. After all, Die Hard showed that an action star can be an everyday, vulnerable person, as did Lethal Weapon.So the days of the greased up, muscular soldier with the magical gun that hold infinite bullets, were numbered.Schwarzenegger had the right idea, and branched out into other genres (but still kept his trademark puns), and it appeared that Stallone was always one step behind him (his foray into comedy, Judge Dredd etc). So Rambo III was the start of a downward spiral in Stallone's career (box office wise) that would last for five years.So Rambo III is pretty much the same as part II, but this time everything is bigger, from Stallones muscles, the knife, and the set pieces. The makers must have thought that this was a license to print money, hence it being the most expensive film produced at the time.There is a lot of humour, Schwarzenegger type one liners that are scattered across the script, but it falls flat, not just by Stallone's delivery, but for the fact that the makers have now turned a tortured character into a comic book character.Still, there's action aplenty, the film looks beautiful, and Stallone's hair is beyond wonderful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:Let's get the problems out of the way first. In a twist of historical irony, the people who blew up the WTC are our heroes that Rambo is fighting with against the Soviets, try not to notice. Yes, it is the mujaheddin fighting with weapons the CIA gave them to help Bin Laden kill Breznev's boys. There are many things about this, most maligned of the Rambo trilogy, that are worth watching it. First, Rambo fails the first rescue attempt and gets a nasty wound that he has to repair (Gross Out). This is not the part 2 Rambo taking out like fifty guys, he has to come back a second time. After all the critics mocked Part 2 for the Commando like invincibility, this one is far more realistic and intense. Troutman is captured in Afghanistan and Rambo has to go rescue him from this serious creep and his muscle headed assistant. Troutman gets tortured, though, he does hold up well, watch where he tells the Soviet where the missiles are (very close by). The movie did not do as well as the first two because it is a bit slow at the beginning. It really is much more intense and realistic than the second movie. Besides getting wounded and failing, Rambo gets his butt saved by Troutman in one realistic scene. After the slow beginning, where Troutman and the CIA big shot find Rambo stick fighting in Thailand, and living in a monastery, once he goes to rescue Troutman it never slows down at all.Yes, detractors, there are Rambo moments like my above Troutman quote but eclipsed by the famous reply to the Soviet creep when he asks Rambo who he is on a walkie talkie,"Your worst nightmare." For all the acid poured on this movie, it towers over the reboot gore festival of Rambo. Stallone doesn't look all burned out, as in the new movie, plus the violence serves the story, it isn't just there to gross us out. Stallone and Crenna are good together and the rescue gives this one more emotional depth than part two. First Blood will always tower over both sequels but that movie is a drama more than an action movie. Until the rampage at the end, it is more a look at the crappy way the Vietnam vets were treated returning home to America. These two are pure action movies, I own this one because it is the more serious and realistic of the two. Rambo is not a demigod in this one, he screws up and almost gets killed many times. Like First Blood, he gets a nasty wound he has to repair. If you are buying these movies, start with First Blood, then get this one and last number two. The movie has dropped precipitously since our former allies are now our enemies but, please, like anyone is watching Rambo for politics? The rescue is two separate assaults on the head jerk's compound high up on a mountain. There is great action and many close calls and pop outs. It made plenty of money in 88, when it came out, but the years have dated it. While the movie never gives us the very human Rambo of First Blood, it is just as far from Mr. Invincible of Part 2. It also failed because, unlike number two, there is not one trace of romance in the entire movie. In fact, there is not even a lead actress, the only woman is a prisoner who gestures Rambo in the right direction towards Troutman's cell. Ergo, this is a guy movie, ladies are guaranteed to fall asleep. The romance of the second one broadened the audience from this purely man's movie. For those of us not thrilled with romance, it was a welcome positive. Sly may be a few years older here but he is much more believable then his Mesozoic appearance in Rambo. There are a few requisite scenes about the horrors of the Soviet occupation, with the required 'good' Soviet defector (who gets shot of course), but, on the whole, it is an enjoyable action movie. If you get bored, at the beginning, skip forward about fifteen minutes, you won't miss anything terribly relevant. Not As Bad As They Say. Q.E.D.</fullReview>

Also the whole war between Afghanistan and the Soviets it tries to bring some drama into the story also and with the ending it kinda succeeds on it Rambo 3 even if you like it or not is not a 5.7 kind of film especially with that opening fight. This movie is just entertaining from beginning to end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First Blood Part III</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this second sequel to 'First Blood', Sylvester Stallone returns as cynical Vietnam War veteran (and trained killer machine) John Rambo. This time Rambo becomes mixed up with warfare in the Middle East after his longtime mentor is kidnapped. The film gets off to a strong start with Rambo more world-weary than ever, saying things like "sounds familiar" when told that the government will deny that his mission exists if he accepts it. Things soon take a turn to repetitive and mindless violence though with lots of explosions and gore galore, and unlike in the first two 'First Blood' films, there are no running themes of Vietnam War resentment to intellectualise the experience; the closest we have is Richard Crenna likening what the Soviets are doing in the Middle East to Vietnam. The film is further brought down by the inclusion of a surrogate son of sorts as Rambo befriends a local Afghani boy. He is not cute, funny or adorable at all as he selfishly keeps asking for things that Rambo has and his main plot function seems to be suspense as Rambo at one point has to run around with the boy in one hand and a gun in the other! Things improve towards the end though as Rambo and the Colonel reunite. The pair share excellent repartee together and watching them talk about how to take on the Soviets together, the long-lasting nature of their pupil/teacher bond really shines through. The action sequences near the end are extremely well crafted too - though it is not quite enough to distract from the fact that this is not as solid a film as the two movies that preceded it.</fullReview>

I actually didn't think it was as terrible as the critics made out, granted its not as good as the first two but the stunts are awesome and taking Rambo to Afghanistan, putting him on a horse and having him rescue Colonel Trautman was a decent enough story.Stallone spouts some serious muscles with this instalment, he also rides a horse like a pro, stick fights like a champion, cauterizes his shrapnel wound with gunpowder (awesome), gets dragged under a tank, climbs a rock face, turns one of the Russians into a human pinwheel with his exploding arrows, pilots a helicopter, crashes the helicopter, breaks necks and blows a lot of sh!t up. Come to think of it Rambo does it all in this movie. He is a war machine with great hair and an amazing body. 12/29/15</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Continuing my plan to watch every Sly Stallone movie in order, I come to another sequel, 1988's Rambo 3.What does Stallone do after two movies under perform at the Box Office?? He usual go to response, was to go into his comfort zone and do another Rocky movie. This time however he opted for another sequel to his second most popular franchise, that starting Vietnam Vet and War Hero John Rambo. With the 'First Blood' part dropped from the title all together and the movie just being called Rambo 3, even though there were was never a Rambo or Rambo 2. Plot In A Paragraph: Col. Trautman (Richard Crenna) goes on a mission to aid the Afghanistan freedom fighters against the invading Russain army. He seeks out Rambo (Stallone) for help, he refuses saying his "war is over". When Trautman is captured by the Russains, the one man army goes to save his former Colonel. The one man army routine is now old, as is the mullet!! The dialogue is poor, the villains incredibly dull and it's boring to watch Rambo single handedly take out an entire army yet again.Stallones ego was apparently again out of control, and he had the original director Russell Mulchahey fired, along with members of the cast that he didn't approve of. The most ridiculously over the top movie in the franchise, had the Misfortune of awful timing (Russia left Afghanistan a few weeks before the movie's release) and despite some impressive action set pieces, it just isn't a very good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rambo Has No Mercy for the Soviets!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Legendary second unit director Peter MacDonald took over directing "Rambo III" after Stallone fired "Highlander" helmer Russell Mulcahy over creative differences. Although it didn't coin the bucks that "Rambo II" earned, "Rambo III" is a spectacular, action-packed adventure saga that deploys Stallone to great effect. Stallone was in top shape with opposing pectoral scares and looking like an Apache on the war path with his headband and long hair. The exciting but outlandish screenplay credited to Stallone and Sheldon Lettich breaks down into six essential sections: (1) Rambo's savage stick fight in Thailand and his meeting at the monastery with Colonel Trautman, (2) Trautman's capture by the Soviets, (3) Rambo's horseback ride into Afghanistan and his reception by the Mujahedeen, (4) Rambo's nocturnal raid on the Soviet fortress, (5) Rambo's tense rescue of Trautman against overwhelming odds, and (6) Rambo's fight battle with the Soviet commander flying a heavily armed helicopter. MacDonald doesn't let the pace slacken for a moment after Rambo leads his raid on the Soviet fortress. As usual, the camaraderie between Stallone and co-star Richard Crenna is flavorful. The gorgeous scenic beauty of Israel and Arizona is an added asset as is Jerry Goldsmith's atmospheric orchestral score.Disillusioned Vietnam veteran John Jay Rambo's close friend and former commanding officer Colonel Samuel Trautman (Richard Crenna of "Wait Until Dark") fails to convince Rambo to accompany him into Afghanistan on a secret mission to aid Mujahedeen freedom fighters battling invading Soviet troops. Trautman's mission involves finding a way to smuggle Stinger missiles into a remote province of Afghanistan that the Soviets have sealed shut. Predictably, no sooner has Trautman embarked on his mission than the Soviets not only surprise him but also take him prisoner. Unofficially, Embassy Field Officer Robert Griggs (Kurtwood Smith of "RoboCop") promises to arm Rambo with weapons, but our pugnacious hero must effect Trautman's rescue without U.S. manpower. Meantime, Soviet Colonel Zaysen (Marc de Jonge) has no luck interrogating Trautman about the weapons that he believes Trautman has smuggled into the country. Initially, when Rambo shows up in Afghanistan, the local fighters dismiss him with contempt as a 'tourist' with little combat experience. Rambo remains mum about his skills, and he is taken into the interior on horseback Afghani resistance leader Masoud (Spiros Focás of "Rocco and His Brothers") to see Mousa Gani. Eventually, he links up with Gani, but the Mujahedeen refuse to aid him for his night-time incursion into the prison to rescue Trautman."Rambo III" ranks as a slam-bang, action-oriented, shoot'em up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's good to see Sylvester Stallone return as John Rambo for Rambo III</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rambo III may not be the most popular in the Rambo series due to many people criticising the ordinary and derivative plot. Then again, apart from First Blood (1982) nobody is taking any of the Rambo movies seriously. First Blood (1982) saw a tormented John Rambo symbolically wage war on society following his mistreatment. Rambo: First Blood Part II (1985) sees Rambo redeem himself saving the forgotten POW's left behind enemy lines in Vietnam. Rambo III sees Rambo back in action to save his friend. I thought Rambo III was enjoyable for it's quality action and Sylvester Stallone in his element.Rambo III starts off with John Rambo now living in Thailand helping out the locals build a Buddhist monastery while dabbling in stick fighting contests on the side. When his friend and former commander Colonel Sam Trautman (Richard Crenna) and Embassy official Robert Griggs (Kurtwood Smith) approach Rambo to join him to help the Mujahedeen rebels who are fighting the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, Rambo declines, stating he is tired of fighting and wants to live the rest of his life in peace. Trautman reluctantly leaves and continues to proceed with the mission. The mission goes awry and Colonel Trautman is captured and taken prisoner by the brutal Soviet Colonel Zaysen (Marc de Jonge). Griggs later informs Rambo of Trautman's capture and upon hearing the news, Rambo launches a rescue operation to save Trautman with the rebels. When asked why Rambo is doing this, he simply replies "Cause he'd do it for me." Sylvester Stallone returns in his now famous role as John Rambo along with Richard Crenna as Colonel Sam Trautman. Kurtwood Smith, well known as his role as Clarence Boddicker in Robocop, has a small role as embassy official Robert Griggs but as a good guy. Marc de Jonge was a quality villain as Colonel Zaysen although he was rarely sighted in Hollywood but instead well known for his roles in France before his untimely death in 1996.The best way to enjoy Rambo III is to ignore the negative reviews and criticisms about its plot. It is what it is. Enjoy Rambo III for its explosive action and Sylvester Stallone in his titular role.7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Third underrated trilogy of Rambo which is solid action flick!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rambo III (1988) is very underrated solid action flick. Even tough my feelings for this flick are mixed after watching it again I must say it is a very decent action flick. I think I like it much more than Rambo: First Blood Part II. The third entry in to the trilogy was my first movie I saw as a kid in the 90's was the only Rambo movie I ever saw. It is my childhood movie and I grew up with it. I would be crazy not liking this movie, I always liked more this movie than part II. With III, the kid may be a bad actor but he's really not in it much. Credit the short prep time for getting III a far more kinetic feel. Edits are tighter, the action more frantic. I think contemporary feelings toward Afghanistan cause people to judge the film negatively. As you say, in 20 years that feeling will likely shift. I love Rambo III and it is my third favorite after Rambo 2. It cost about $60 million in the US but made only around $50 million in the US, so it didn't do too well.I really enjoy the action sequences, some of the one liners, and I always have a lot of fun with Rambo III. What I like about this movie is that the characters in this movie has more things to do including telling the history of Afghanistan. I even read about this movie that an Afghanistan supervisor for this movie. Peter MacDonald did a great job as a director and he made Rambo more vulnerable human been who just cared about his only friend and people, he was just much different than he was in the first two movies. Finally Colonel Sam Trautman (Richard Crenna) has more to do in this movie unlike he did and the first two movies. The character has more action in here than in the last two movies he ever had. I love this movie and if you don't agree that's fine with me. The only reason is negatively and ranted poor is because it is set in Afghanistan and with 9/11 terrorist attack with what happened. Look people back than were different times! The US had the Russians for bad people. They tried to be friends with Taliban's and they wrong. Just because of the politics you don't need to judge this film with different view on the movie. It is not a perfect film, but is not bad at all, it is good, it is actually good. It is not classic movie like the first two movies were, but it is still a decent so it doesn't deserve to be hated! The problems I have with Rambo III: The third sequel of the series is too over long, too boring, uninterested slow paced and very unrealistic movie! I just finished watching Rambo III and every time I am watching it I kept getting bored by this movie. I am giving 5/10 because the story in Afghanistan is very uninteresting and very unrealistic. He was climbing a wall without a climbing equipment is impossible. He was shot in the knee by helicopter and he still could walking without feeling any pain? He was shot in the leg and he still could jump in front the tank and how could he make that flip-over with a wounded leg? He crashed in to a helicopter with a tank and didn't head any headings? He wasn't wounded or hurt, that's just impossible. Like Col. Zaysen said "Are you insane? One man against trained commandos... Who do you think this man is? God?" They were in the valley and whole army was shooting on them and they didn't even hit them or kill them. That's in my opinion just impossible cause if that would be for real I don't think Rambo and Colonel Trautman would had a chance to survive. Tough Rambo III is still a decent good movie to watch just like I said before it is to over long and boring and not interesting. I did enjoyed the first two movies they were very fast paced over joy not boring awesome action movies ever. I even enjoyed Rambo aka Rambo IV much, much better than III. I am glad Sylvester Stallone directed the fourth movie which it redeems it self. Rambo III is still decent tough. Stallone wants to make one more Rambo. I think he still talks straight, the only difference is his voice is deeper. This was my first film in Rambo series and I still like this film as an Underrated Action film. I still like this film because it is Rambo, he is in Thailand fighting with stickers and his martial arts. Climbing the walls going to Afghanistan against Russians explosions and action sequences are great and stunning and so on. Rambo using bow and arrow with plastic explosions on the end of the arrow.

		<shortDescription>Wants record for most movie deaths</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rating-5/10Rambo III see's the return of John Rambo in his all action, all thrilling and all propaganda third instalment. The movie is to put it lightly, insane action, lot's of death, big guns and of course more of the style of fighting Rambo has previously showed us. Yes this movie is all out and not ashamed either, a movie I felt to be below par but yet felt surprised looking back how I actually didn't mind this much, well not too much.Now the plot is pretty thin and lacks enough depth to be well thought about at all, yet Stallone navigates us through this well and as mentioned not afraid to show us things we have seen before. He fights his way out of a complete mess, quite literally but in terms of the movie it avoids being an action catastrophe mostly from the crazy fighting and big explosions, because they make this so distinctly Rambo.The film is written badly by Stallone and Sheldon Lettich and directed much the same by Peter MacDonald and yet somehow that doesn't matter, well SO much anyway. The film relies on action, action, a little more action, oh and little bit of Richard Crenna to get by even though for me it doesn't necessarily get by a lot. It is I must stress not a good movie, just in my eyes not the worst ever, hard to connect with though in my opinion. Now the film definitely should please those who are already Rambo fans or those who just like action movies, it's over use of over the top action will work for some. It also never loses it touch and doesn't try to be something it isn't, doesn't try emotion, doesn't try love, it remains typically Rambo and makes this even more action movie that beforehand. I think also credit to Stallone for not giving in maybe to some other action films of the day which needed that romance, Rambo has had it before but in this he is on a mission and no person will stop him on his way.I also think this is the kind of movie that makes you think about what makes a truly great action movie, because this isn't it. It just feels too over crazy but not just that, kind of boring too for me, now although I liked it more than others who maybe disliked it, I didn't like it and I want to say that. It is under average at best and one movie that truly couldn't have been helped much, it is just what it is.So overall an action bowl of death everywhere, should please some but disgust others as well, and on that some pretty violent scenes are had so not for the kids. Also it is not well timed in two ways, the movie rushes itself along which isn't the worst thing but still it can seem Rambo doesn't think at all, he just does it without caution(or maybe that is the whole point of John Rambo). The second way is that the Soviet Union was becoming much more open at this time of the 80's and was starting to become more western friendly, this counters that in only a movie like this can, fighting and more fighting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Colonel Samuel Trautman (Richard Crenna) goes to Thailand to find John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) stick fighting and living with Buddhist monks. Bob Griggs (Kurtwood Smith) has a mission to help the Mujahedeen fight the Soviets in Afghanistan. Trautman is going in to investigate the cruel Russian Colonel Zaysen but Rambo turns them down. Trautman is captured and Rambo goes into Afghanistan to rescue his mentor.It is all mindless action. It is bigger with more explosions. The foreign policy depth is as good as necessary. The Soviets are evil and that's all that is necessary. This is as deep as a shallow pond. It has its moments of bombastic delights. The simplistic overselling of the Mujahedeen is less and less appealing over the years. Rambo is just a cartoon now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's A Decent Movie But It Brought No Closure To The Series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd say right off the top that I enjoyed this third instrument in the Rambo series more than I did the second. I thought the action was better, and I thought the story was a little bit deeper. It's certainly not without its weaknesses, mind you - one of which has its origins early in the movie. Col. Trautman (again played by Richard Crenna) tries to recruit Rambo (of course, played by Sylvester Stallone) by telling him that he had to come full circle. For me, that set up an expectation of some sort of "full circle" ending, but I didn't see one. Full circle, in the context of the movies might have been Rambo back as a drifter in the US, or as a soldier, or as a (presumably) happy civilian just like before he got caught up in any of this. But the ending let me down a little bit to be honest. I saw no real closure in this; certainly no "full circle" experience for Rambo.This movie is set in Afghanistan, during the Soviet war in that country. Trautman wants Rambo to go in with him, but Rambo doesn't want to. He's actually established a comfortable life in Thailand, living in a monastery, apparently happy and peaceful (apart from occasional stick fighting that he engages in to make money for the monastery.) But when Trautman goes in on his own and gets captured, Rambo, of course, goes after him.Once Rambo's in Afghanistan, this becomes a pretty standard (and well done and exciting) action movie. Looked at in 2014, though, it's also a little tired. Another 80's Cold War movie with the Americans out to get the evil empire. And the Soviets were definitely evil in this one - and, yes, the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan was brutal. It's just that the format became a bit tired after a while in my opinion. They do use the Cold War theme to good photographic value, though. There's a scene in which we're shown a picture of the stark and very grey Afghan landscape around the Soviet military base, with the only colour on the screen being the bright red Soviet flag standing out so dramatically as it waved in the breeze. That scene stayed with me for the entire movie for some reason. It was just so well shot.There's a bit of an interesting look at Afghan culture - and especially the Afghan national sport that revolves around a group of men, one of whom has to pick up a sheep carcass and drop it in a circle while everyone else is trying to stop him. Tough people, these Afghans! But the biggest problem with this movie was the "full circle" comment - and, indeed, this should have come full circle in a way, at least to bring closure to the series. It didn't really manage to do that. (6/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My name is Davorin Lonac, and you're about to read about my thoughts on Rambo III, the conclusion to one of the most epic, action packed and over- exaggerated film trilogy, well anthology if you can even count part 4! This film is jam packed with action like its predecessors but don't take this too seriously when I say: Its so racist! You should understand why I say this when you view it once again or for the first time. Anyway this film is rumored... Or shall we say known to be pretty awful. I really don't think that a 5.4 was the right score for this and that is why I rated it a 6.0 out of 10. The distraught reviews for this film were poor and its box office earnings pretty much flopped to other films in the time. I'd say this film is entertaining but stupid. Once again I shall now leave you in peace and don't forget... There will be no review for part IV because I just hate it so dearly.Kind Regards, Davorin Lonac.

Soon, he must ally himself with the Afghan rebels to enable him to complete his mission, and defeat the Russians.Unfortunately, this film was poorly timed, since in real life the Russians were leaving Afghanistan after eight years, and considering the real-life developments of the rebels that Rambo is helping(they would eventually become the Taliban, and America's enemy) watching this now is strangely uncomfortable, while at the time of release, it was merely an uninspired action piece without the heart or impact of the first two. Not bad, and Stallone and Crenna are capable, but ultimately this sequel falls short.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Agony in Afghanistan.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rambo III is directed by Peter MacDonald and written by Sylvester Stallone and Sheldon Lettich. It stars Stallone, Richard Crenna, Marc de Jong, Kurtwood Smith, Sasson Gabai and Spiros Focas. Music is scored by Jerry Goldsmith and cinematography by John Stanier. Plot finds John Rambo (Stallone) trying to lead something resembling a normal life in Thailand. But when his only friend in the world, Colonel Sam Trautman (Crenna), is captured and imprisoned by Soviet forces in Afghanistan, Rambo is thrust in to a deadly mission to break his friend out whilst simultaneously helping mujahideen rebels fight Soviet oppression.Lets cut to the chase, Rambo III is an irritant to anyone bothered by its politics and portents, but to the action film fan the rewards are many, very much so. Struggling to break even at the American box office back in 88, clearly the Rambo brand in his own country was wearing thin, but globally? It coined it in. Evidently there were enough action film fans out there lapping it up, and rightly so because Rambo III is a fierce and highly octane piece of cinema.Plot is simplicity, but what stunts, what outrageousness of action construction. Helicopter attacks stir the blood, underground stalk and kills are tense and laced with drama, self surgery is hold your breath time and machismo? Here by the bucket load as Stallone, in magnificent shape, defines once again the Rambo one man army persona. While the wonderful Crenna also gets to kick ass as the finale plays out in a whirl of pyrotechnics and punch the air bravado. It's also a beautifully shot film out of Thailand and Israel, and scored with the usual atomic bluster by Goldsmith.As usual there's not much depth of characterisation on show, though Rambo does come with a bit more humanity this time, and the insertion of a kid side-kick is as pointless as it is twee. Yet as unsubtle as it is, as true to the Rambo formula as you expect, this is one mighty action film and very much recommended to those looking for high energy thrills and much murder death kill. 7/10</fullReview>

In beginning it tends to confuse me, that Rambo is from Vietnam or USA, maybe because I haven't seen its prequels. It bored me until Rambo didn't get into the prison to save the colonel, from where, yes, I enjoyed fighting scenes :-). Btw, the way Rambo climbed on the trails, was kind of funny. That's not possible. An average movie and not so entertaining, unless you want to see just fight scenes, which are nice, keeping in view that movie was made in 1988.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As daft and disturbed as its hero - 48%</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having had my fill of culture for the day by watching the silent movie masterpiece "Metropolis" for the first time, I needed something brainless and stupidly violent to get me back down to Earth. As always, Sylvester Stallone provides just such an outing with this tired third outing as the monotone killing machine John Rambo. Like the second film, it is a balls-out, no-holds-barred action blast that couldn't be any more masculine if it tried. But for those of you wishing the character would go back to his first appearance in the superior "First Blood", this is a depressing, remorseless excuse for our 'hero' to gun down anyone who gets vaguely in his way without showing a hint of personality, charisma or charm.Now living a more peaceful existence helping Buddhist monks rebuild their temple, Rambo (Stallone) is contacted once again by his old commanding officer, Col. Trautman (Richard Crenna) who wants Rambo's assistance with a dangerous mission against the Soviets in Afghanistan. Rambo refuses so Trautman goes instead but the mission goes horribly wrong and Trautman finds himself help captive by Russian Colonel Zaysen (Marc de Jonge). Rambo is then told of this by shady Government-type Griggs (Kurtwood Smith), who then agrees to go and rescue him. Teaming up with the Mujahideen rebels led by Masoud (Spiros Focás), Rambo is accompanied by Mousa (Sasson Gabai) as he heads towards the heavily-guarded Soviet base on his seemingly impossible quest to rescue his one true friend.Given that the Soviet Union was already starting to crumble when it was released, "Rambo III" was out-of-touch before it even hit the big screen. Nowadays it embarrasses with its staunchly pro-American themes and almost na?ve attitude to the Afghan people and the Mujahideen (who now, ironically, seem to spend their time fighting the US forces currently based in Afghanistan). Although it wasn't the first film to depict Rambo as an unstoppable force of nature, it underlined that characterisation here as Rambo pulls off numerous acts of violence and barely suffers a wound. And when he is injured, he's so tough that he cauterises the wound using gunpowder that goes straight through him! But of course! If anything, Rambo's almost robotic personality suits Stallone's performance which is as wooden as you'd expect although I'd like someone to tell me why Stallone waits until Rambo &amp; Trautman team up before the one-liners start coming - where have they been hiding for two and a half films? Like most Sly outings, "Rambo III" is the perfect movie to download for free when you've got the guys coming over with a load of beers. It's stupid, brutal, illogical (why did Trautman think that a traumatised Vietnam veteran would be any good in the deserts of Afghanistan?) and ultimately not worth your time. These films always seem to have a personal agenda for Rambo instead of some threat to world peace and the American people - after all, is Zaysen doing anything other than following his orders like a good colonel should? Yes, he's especially mean against the native Afghan population but why should that bother Rambo once he's finally discovered his personal peace? I enjoyed "First Blood" but these sequels (and the recent, blood-soaked sequel in 2008) have left a nasty taste in my mouth as they are little more than exercises in violence and pyrotechnics. Looking at the estimated budget of $63 million dollars, I'm stumped to suggest where the money went other than on a vast array of military vehicles for Rambo to shoot at and Stallone's own salary. Please, stick with the original or if you want a decent action blast then watch the original "Die Hard" which had genuine laughs, a charismatic hero you could get behind, a memorable villain and tension throughout. "Rambo III" can only dream of such things.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So First Blood 2 was a segue? Start with the Vietnamese and end up with the Soviets? Sigh. Well, the truth of the matter is this third film of the franchise is no less exciting than the first two, although in the first film we were dealing with a man who felt disconnected from his country. In this film, Rambo has found a sort of peace in his life with the monks, a simple life without the hustle and distraction of modern living. While I doubt Stallone's character has achieved a state of Zen, there is a calmer, more focused individual who is working on the temple buildings. Even in his communication with his Afghan guide, John is calmer, more easy going, yet still guarded in his person. He lets go only what is needed. Technically, the film is superb. The photography and stunts are nothing short of amazing, and the quality of the plot is par for the Rambo action genre. Rated R for violence and language, this film is collectible with the set and viewable once if you have seen the others. Not my favorite of the series, but certainly not the worst.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Easily the worst of the Rambo movies. And yes, I include the 2008 movie in that list.It's 1987/8 and our hero, John Rambo (played by Sylvester Stallone, of course), is retired and living the quiet life in Thailand. The US government want him to do another mission, in Afghanistan, but he declines. Soon thereafter, however, his friend and former CO, Colonel Trautman (played by Richard Crenna, as always) is captured by the Russians in Afghanistan. Rambo sets out to rescue him...This is the movie where Rambo lived up to the stereotype of him as an impossibly invincible, gung ho, solo killing machine. In the previous two Rambo movies the plots had some degree of plausibility, and Rambo wasn't totally invincible. Now we have the image of him single- handedly destroying Russian armies, tanks and helicopters. It's just too one-dimensional, and silly.Add in the jingoism of him fighting the Russians, in Afghanistan, and the movie is just blatant Cold War propaganda.Even the action scenes can't save it this time. They're of the Michael Bay-type variety: explosions for the sake of explosions, and the bigger the better. It becomes very monotonous, very fast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having single-handedly defeated the Vietcong in First Blood Part II, there was no going back for John Rambo: once a tortured soul, he was now a larger-than-life comic-book hero righting the world's wrongs through extreme violence and that was how he would have to stay in order to keep his fans happy. Rambo's next mission would have to be bigger, the villains more evil, and the body count higher. With the US in the midst of a cold war with Russia, the answer was obvious: send Rambo to kick Russian butt in Afghanistan.Armed with a knife that would shame Crocodile Dundee, several big guns, and his trusty bow with explosive-tipped arrows, Rambo frees his ex-commanding officer Col. Trautman (Richard Crenna) from a Soviet fort and liberates the Mujahadin, laying waste to hundreds of the enemy in the process.But while the film's numerous battle scenes certainly deliver on the promise of much carnage, with some of the biggest on-screen explosions of the 80s, the film offers little in the way of genuine excitement or tension thanks to Rambo being virtually indestructible. The spectacular action also has the effect of making proceedings seem rather dull whenever Stallone eases off the trigger, resulting in this film being a marginally less enjoyable affair overall than the previous movies.Ironically, for all of Rambo III's glorification of violence in the name of a noble cause, the closing message, dedicating the film to 'the gallant people of Afghanistan', unintentionally but effectively illustrates the futility of war.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have yet to see the fourth entry into the First Blood/Rambo series, but of the three I have seen this is by far the weakest. I had to watch this movie in two sittings cause for me it was just hard to sit through. I do not know why this one kind of bores me, it has action and a cool scene involving gunpowder, it just sort of still disappoints to a high degree. Rambo is once again approached by Trautman to accompany him on a mission to I think Afghanistan. Rambo declines probably tired after the strange fight he has that would later be spoofed in the rather humorous film "Hot Shots part Deus". Well Trautman is caught by those mean, evil Russians while trying to help the poor, good natured Afghans (of course, I think if we knew then what we know now we would have been pulling for the Russians). So off Rambo goes, to save his buddy from the clutches of the Russians. Along the way he plays a stupid game and rides a horse which for some reason strikes me as very unRambolike. You have the fight aboard a helicopter which along with the gunpowder scene are probably the best in the film. I also liked it when he was crawling on his belly and using his knife to find mines. Besides that though this movie is almost unwatchable as the set up is familiar, but then it is not. I just think this movie was not well thought out and executed a bit more poorly than the other two Rambo's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rambo III is not as bad as people make it out to be.... but neither is it a great cinematic experience. Stallone tries manfully in the first 30 minutes to generate some sort of backstory for John Rambo and where his life is at since we last saw him rescuing POWs in Vietnam. He is in a monastery helping Buddist monks with various odd-jobs and also stick-fighting to raise extra cash. (Somewhere in all that there is a massive contradiction but I'll let it slide.) He seems content with his spartan life but then his old mentor Col. Trautman asks for help. Rambo refuses as "his war is over" but when Trautman is captured - that sparks the one-man rescue mission. Even then Stallone tries to educate an audience in Afghan ways: telling us a little about the Russian invasion, the proud history of the Afghans, some of their customs and a little background on the tactics used by the Russkie soldiers in trying to wipe out a civilisation. However, once over the 30 minute mark - all hell breaks loose.Don't get me wrong here - I loved Rambo III when I first saw it in 1988 (I was 18 at the time) but from an older person's perspective now - I can see it's limitations. But I suppose Stallone was on a high back then, where the world wanted action, action, action - and he duly delivered.The production qualities of the film are second to none, the attention to detail and overall look and feel is good. There are some excellent set-pieces too. The stand-out ones for me are when Rambo uses gunpowder to cauterize his side wound, and when the big bad russkie is hung and blown up by a grenade in the caves. And there are some reasonable throwaway lines here too. Rambo is called a "lost tourist" as he explains that he perviosuly "fired a few shots" in combat battle. Stallone tries hard to lighten the tone here and there but with Rambo - it is hard. He is not exactly a humorous guy is he?Unfortunately, Rambo has become a distant character from his first outing in First Blood. Gone is the inner turmoil, gone are the sneak peeks where we see what causes him to be the way he is. By part III, he is almost a super-human killing machine with no other aspect to him. A pity - but I still enjoyed the flick. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Rambo III" is the last of the Rambo trilogy and the most expensive. Director Peter MacDonald gives us wall to wall non-stop action with our favorite super soldier destroying half of the Russian army occupying Afghanistan in the 1980s. As in the previous two installments in the series, the viewer must be willing to suspend reality and accept the film for what it is...an action film.As the story begins, we find John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) living in a monastery in Thailand where he went to live at the close of Rambo II. His old commanding officer, Colonel Trautman (Richard Crenna) again seeks him out to accompany him on a mission to aid the rebels in Russian occupied Afghanistan. Rambo at first refuses but when he learns that Trautman has been captured he relents.Trautman under goes torture at the hands of the villainous Russian Colonel Zaysen (Marc de Jonge) who is trying to find out what weapons are to be supplied to the rebels. Trautman tells him that the Afghan people cannot be defeated as the Viet Cong could not a generation earlier and that Afghanistan is the Russian Viet Nam. As it turned out he was right.Anyway Rambo manages to get into the camp where Trautman is being held and rescues him. Their escape forms the crux of the remainder of the film. Rambo manages to take out a battalion of Russian soldiers, a couple of helicopters and a couple of tanks before he is through. As fantastic as the premise is, the film is nonetheless very entertaining with plenty of shooting, explosions and battles throughout. It's visually exciting and director MacDonald, a second unit action director who was made the main director when the original director was fired, knows how to handle this type of action.Stallone once again gets to run around bare chested and to his credit performs many of his stunts himself. Crenna gets more to do this time around. He gets to stand side by side with Stallone for many of the film's action sequences rather than be merely the father figure suggested in the earlier films.Apparently the Russians withdrew from Afghanistan shortly before the film opened in 1988 thus lessening their value as the villains of the piece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Only 16 years since the West was patriotically making movies in which our heroes ARE SENT TO HELP (BY THEIR GOVERNMENT) the Taliban, a fundamental Islamic movement strongly influenced at that time by one Osama bin Laden. And we won, of course. There is always a problem when you politically (and sometimes literally) attack your perceived enemies because of what they did in history -e.g. Saddam and the Kurds - forgetting that you too have a history. Personally I think this film should be put in cold storage until the whole present Afghan and Iraq episode of history is forgotten. I notice the reviews for the film mention only the Mujahadeen, as if they were branch of the Boy Scouts. NO! They are the Taliban, and the Russians no doubt called them "insurgents".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Beginning!!!!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rambo III probably has one of the best action packed biginnings out of many films that I have seen. When Rambo steps out of the boat and into the warehouse then tension and anticipation begins to build in the viewer of the film. I loved the part when Rambo smacks his sticks on the ground to begin the fight! From that point on until the fight is over the action is awesome. I also like how the character of John Rambo is true to form with him not killing the man he fights and then handing over the money he won to the Buddhists. What a great beginning to a film! I have watched it over and over again. The rest of the film is good but unfortunately does not follow suit with the beginning. Still a descent movie overall but it could have been better but I won't get into that. Anyways rent, buy, or just watch the film for the opening fight scene. It ranks a 10 out of 10 for fight scenes in a movclasn my opinion!!!!!!! Way to go Rambo!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's still Rambo, but rather boring, and definitely the weakest of the four.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This films rating on IMDb is what it should be. It just isn't very good. The first film was clever, the second was a great action film, and the fourth was a dark conclusion. This film just doesn't bring anything to the table. Rambo is still Rambo, but there are vague traces of 80s' cheesiness in him, and doesn't help.But my biggest problem with this film was that it was boring. The first half is a boring introduction to situation in Afghanistan circa 1988, and the second half is one huge action scene that never seems to let up. The action itself is simply not that good. The force of emotion I felt with the first film and especially the fourth film just doesn't exist. This movie is so plain.Overall, not really worth it. I saw it anyway just because I wanted to complete the series, so maybe you are like me in that sense. Otherwise, avoid.4/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The return of Rambo, the one man army! In this movie he takes on a couple of Soviets, with the help of an Afghan tribe, to save his old pal Colonel Trautman.This is a great enjoyable, very simplistic, straightforward, brutal action-flick. I mean basically all there is to this story is Rambo kicking some Soviet butt. Yes, the movie tries to be more emotional with some of its themes and plot lines but none of this really works out however.When you're bit familiar with the action genre, especially from the '80's than there is no way that you can rate this movie any lower than an 6. This movie is better constructed than, lets say, 80% of any other action movies, especially those made in the '80's, when silly simple, brutal action-flicks were at their prime. And of course this movie also has got something no other action movie has; John J. Rambo. Argualiby the best and most famous action-hero out of cinematic history, portrayed by '80's superstar Sylvester Stallone. For an action movie this is a perfectly constructed, though simple picture, that totally entertains.The movie doesn't begin that good but once it's on steam there is no holding back. Rambo is on fire, from the moment on when he fires his first shot. At first the movie doesn't seem like high-budget stuff but as the movie progresses it becomes obvious that the saved the money for its ending. With its 63 million dollar budget, it actually was the most expensive movie of its time. The second halve of the movie is filled with some spectacular and explosive action. Rambo taking on a helicopter with his bow &amp; arrow and Rambo taking on with a tank the main villain in a helicopter are great action moments, no matter how ridicules it all works for the story and credibility. This movie leaves no question about it; Rambo is an one man army.Granted that of course the movie is only watchable and enjoyable for the action movie fans. Everyone else, who has some common sense, will probably find this movie utterly ridicules.The movie features some beautiful scenery and its obvious that they spared no expenses on the locations. The musical score by Jerry Goldsmith also adds to the mood and level of profession of the movie, even though it's mostly recycled work from "Rambo: First Blood Part II".The movie doesn't always flow well and it times it makes the movie feel a bit clumsy. Nevertheless, the movie remains a great genre piece, with all of the typical ingredients, including a great stereotypical mean villain and tough dialog that is surprisingly well written by Sheldon Lettich and Sylvester Stallone himself.An underrated, great simple (like it should be) action movie.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ultra-violent, ham-fisted propaganda</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1988 the world was starting to look a very different place from the one we had known since 1945. The old Cold War certainties were breaking down. "Glasnost" and "perestroika" had joined "vodka" and "sputnik" as Russian words known to even the most monoglot of English speakers. Ronald Reagan, the man who had once denounced the Soviet Union as an "evil empire" and Margaret Thatcher, the woman who once been demonised by the Russians as the "iron lady", were sitting down with their new friend Mikhail Gorbachev to discuss how the Cold War could be brought to an end. The Polish dictator Jaruzelski had been forced to hold talks with his bitter enemies in the Solidarity movement. The fall of the Berlin Wall was only a year away; the end of Communism in Russia itself, three years away.There was, however, one small corner of the world which seemed oblivious to the historic changes taking place elsewhere- Hollywood. "Rambo: First Blood Part II" might not have impressed the critics, but it had been a big financial success when it had come out three years earlier, so a sequel was always on the cards. After John Rambo had re-fought the Vietnam War and given Charlie Cong a good kicking, the challenge was to find another part of the world to liberate from the commies.The film starts with Rambo, rather incongruously, living in a Buddhist monastery in Thailand. He is contacted by his old friend and mentor, Colonel Samuel Trautman, who tries to recruit him for a secret mission to supply American weapons to the anti-Soviet resistance in Afghanistan. Rambo refuses on the grounds that violence and warfare are contrary to the ideals of his new-found Buddhist faith (although that faith seemingly does not forbid him from earning his living by taking part in stick-fighting bouts). When, however, Trautman is captured by the Soviets in Afghanistan, Rambo sets off to rescue him, evidently reasoning that friendship is not only more important than patriotism but also more important than the precepts of his religion.The opening scenes (which contain no killings and no violence other than stick-fighting) are in fact quite well done, and are the reason why this film gets one star more than its predecessor. They give promise that the film might explore some interesting themes, such as a potential conflict between the demands of friendship and those of religious faith, or the Forsterian premise that one owes more loyalty to one's friends than to one's country. Of course, the film does not explore those themes, but instead turns into yet another violent action flick in which Rambo, aided by the Afghan mujahideen, takes on the Red Army and proceeds to machine-gun as many of them as possible. When he gets tired of using a machine-gun, he switches, for the sake of variety, to a knife or bow and arrow. The death toll in this film is even higher than in Part II, and that was quite bloody enough.Like its predecessor, "Rambo III" is ultra-violent, ham-fisted propaganda. Parts II and III of the Rambo saga are sometimes quoted as evidence that, under Reagan's presidency, the America of the eighties was recovering its self-confidence after Vietnam and Watergate, those twin disasters of the seventies. It is certainly true that Reagan seemed more confident and assertive than his two immediate predecessors, Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter, but he was always a more subtle political operator than either his opponents or many of his supporters gave him credit for. For all his anti-Communist rhetoric he was (unlike Bush, Clinton or Bush junior) reluctant to commit American troops to overseas adventures (the liberation of Grenada being one of the few exceptions), and was quick to realise during his second term that genuinely historic changes were taking place in the Soviet Union. The Rambo films, by contrast, may have been made using the cinematic techniques of the eighties, but in spirit they are still stuck in the McCarthy era of the fifties. 4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Something the producers of this movie didn't count on ahead of time was that it's too dumb for it's own good. Rambo III concerns John Rambo, yet again, having to save someone's roasted rear and fight off hordes of Commies. This movie has aged worse than Rambo: First Blood Part II and lacks the energy that made Part II popular, amazing when you consider that this was the most expensive movie at the time.In truth, as someone said somewhere else, this movie is a live action GI Joe cartoon complete with massive amounts of maiming, bloodshed, and gung-ho hijinks to satisfy the kiddies. All that was missing was Stallone waving the American flag and singing "Born in the USA". Speaking of which, Stallone proves that the bigger the knife and hairdo, the worse of an actor he becomes. The rest of the cast lacks any semblance of mood, something Steven Berkoff had fairly good in Part II. While First Blood tries to be a 'message movie', it got lost in Rambo being a guerilla fighter and the ineptness of his antagonists. Thus I label Part II the best in the series for it's honesty. Read my review of it for more understanding. As for III, it winds up being a time-waster with some of the worst prop master work I've seen in a film. Stick with Die Hard for a better 80s action movie from the same year. Funny isn't it? The Rambo series terminates as Die Hard begins.Overall, absurdly stupid and lacking in even decent conversations, Rambo II goes overboard in its action scenes to the point of embarrassment. I denounce it permanently. 1.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With the release of the fourth film in 2008, simply titled "Rambo" ("John Rambo" in America) it was right they should show all three of the original films, and this is the third (duh!). Basically John Rambo (Razzie winning Sylvester Stallone, also nominated for Worst Screenplay) is living in Thailand helping to build a monastery temple (this scene by the way is spoofed in Hot Shots! Part Deux), and also having fights for extra money. His former Vietnam superior Colonel Samuel Trautman (Razzie nominated Richard Crenna) has been assigned to lead a mission to help the Mujahedeen rebels who are fighting the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, and Rambo refuses his request to help, he's had enough of wars. Of course, when the mission goes wrong and Trautman is kidnapped and held captive for torture by Russian Colonel Zaysen (Marc De Jonge), Rambo launches a rescue effort and gets help from some of the Mujahedeen rebels to help invade the Afghan base, and get his friend and some other prisoners out. Also starring Broken Arrow's Kurtwood Smith as Griggs, Spiros Focás as Masoud, Sasson Gabai as Mousa, Doudi Shoua as Hamid, Randy Raney as General Kourov and Marcus Gilbert as Tomask. The film is filled with quite a few inventive deaths, and my favourite is the guy with rope round his neck, Rambo takes out his grenade pin, pushes him down a hole, he's hung, and then he explodes (and you can see some of the entrails). I suppose, compared to the other two films, this is pretty lame, and only the death sequences, gun play and explosions kept me interested. It was nominated the Razzies for Worst Director for Peter MacDonald and Worst Picture. Adequate!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rambo III has a reputation of being a flop, mainly because it underperformed in the USA for some reason ( it took about a third of what Rambo First Blood Part II made at the box office there). However it was a massive success everywhere else in the world, I remember going to see it in the cinema in 1988 and it was a packed house. It was also well known that at the time Rambo III was the most expensive movie ever made and of course Sly Stallone was taking home his usual huge pay cheque. Looking at Rambo III now though makes me nostalgic for the time when films like this were getting made. This movie is absolutely huge in scope, it looks amazing with some of the most impressive action sequences ever put on film and Stallone is at his peak here, maybe not acting wise but certainly in the muscle side of things, he is absolutely huge giving arch rival Schwarzenegger a real run for his money. Also respect is due to the man because that really is him riding horses feet away from explosions and getting dragged beneath a tank. What lets the film down slightly is the villain, who is so over the top it just looks silly. Richard Crenna returns and is as reliable as ever as Col Trautman, also returning to do the score is Jerry Goldsmith who delivers another superb soundtrack to all the mayhem. Goldsmith and Crenna will be missed if and when Rambo IV gets off the ground, fingers crossed it does and it gives us some much needed old school action! Despite the fact I really like Rambo III I would probably still rate it third in the series... just behind First Blood and the untouchable Rambo First Blood Part II. They just don't make action films on this scale anymore so bring on Rambo IV!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I was kind of disappointed with the third Rambo. To be honest, I just wasn't interested in it and I did watch it in a very good mood. I was excited because I love these action flicks, they're very exciting and fun to watch. But Rambo just didn't have his edge any more in my opinion. Yes, he's supposed to be emotionless, but it seemed like Sylvester didn't get into the actual role of Rambo this time. With a change of events when in the first Rambo movie the Colernal saves Rambo from himself, Rambo now must save the Colernal from getting killed by Russian terrorists. Good idea, right? Well, it seemed so, but it just flopped. I know this is also a little off subject, but it also didn't seem politically correct by today's standards, I know! I know! This was an 80's movie, how could they possibly know what Afghanastan is today? But still, I kind of snickered at the end when they had a dedicated to message.I mean over all, this wasn't the worst movie I had ever seen. But it's just not that good either, like I said, Rambo completely lost his edge and doesn't seem that cool any more. Sylvester needs to relax and get off the ego trip, we already know how tough he is, he doesn't need to try so hard. So, I'd recommend this film if you want to finish the Rambo trilogy, otherwise it's not really worth your time.3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rambo III starts as U.S. army Colonel Trautman (Richard Crena) tracks the one man army that is John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) down to Bankok in Thailand where he is living with Buddhist monks! Trautman &amp; special ops man Griggs (Kurtwood Smith) ask Rombo to go into Afghanistan &amp; help them take out an evil Russian named Zaysen (Marc De Jonge), Rambo refuses their request. Trautman goes in alone but is captured by Zaysen &amp; tortured, Griggs again turns to Rambo &amp; informs him his friend Trautman has been captured. Rambo decides to go into Afghanistan himself, single handedly rescue Trautman as well as blow lots of things up &amp; kill a few Russians...The third Rambo film this had a few behind the scenes production problems including the original director Russell Mulcahy being fired &amp; replaced by the original 2nd unit director Peter MacDonald, personally I think it's a terrific late 80's testosterone filled overblown big budget Hollywood action flick the likes of which we don't really see anymore. The script by star Sylvetser Stallone &amp; Sheldon Lettich moves like an absolute rocket, it's action packed, it's incredibly violent &amp; brutal, there's plenty of cheesy dialogue &amp; a few amusing one liners, it's just so over-the-top &amp; it even tries to say something poignant about war! Hell, what more do you want? I'm amazed at how low the score for this is on the IMDb as I think it provides fantastic no-brainer entertainment, it's the perfect film for a group of blokes to stick in the DVD player, gets some drinks &amp; crisps &amp; just sit back &amp; enjoy, enjoy &amp; enjoy on a Neanderthal level! The character's are alright, Rambo is totally indestructible while Zaysen is an OK villain. Those who like deep meaningful stories with complex character's &amp; go queasy at the thought of any violent act then this is obviously not the film for you but for sheer fast moving, gun fighting, explosion destroying, helicopter crashing, tank driving, fist fighting mindless action entertainment they don't come come much better than Rambo III &amp; it's as simple &amp; straight forward as that.It's impossible to know just what was shot by who here but the film looks nice enough, the landscapes are a bit barren &amp; bare at times but that's what the desert is like I suppose. The action is top notch, there's loads of explosions, things blowing up, fights, gun battles, all sorts of military weaponry &amp; vehicles as well as a whole army of extras being killed in a variety of violent ways. Apparently the 1990 edition of the Guiness Book of Records had Rambo III listed as the most violent film ever made with 221 acts of violence &amp; at least 108 deaths, amazing eh? To be honest it's hard to disagree as it is one very violent film &amp; it's quite brutal as well, there's lots of gory gunshot wounds &amp; some torture scenes as well. I must admit I didn't like the young boy being involved as much as he was or when he twirled Rambo's huge knife around in a cool almost glamorous way &amp; at the end when he 'became' a fighter &amp; the film almost seemed to condone this young boy fighting in a war, considering the way the world is at this moment in time it just sat uneasily with me that's all.With a budget of around the $65,000,000 mark Rambo III was the most expensive filmed ever made up to the point when it came out, it's well made with high production values &amp; some spectacular action scenes although try to watch the DVD version as it's presented in full 2:35:1 widescreen &amp; believe me that's the way it should be seen so you can see all of the on screen destruction. This won Stallone a Razzie award for worst actor &amp; it was nominated for another four including worst director &amp; worst film which is pure crap as this is a throughly entertaining flick although one must admit Stallone's performance isn't anything to shout about. I thought Kurtwood Smith was underused though.Rambo III may have a unfairly low IMDb rating but I think it's a fantastic big budget popcorn flick that moves like a rocket, has plenty of violent action &amp; I've seen it numerous times with each time being just as enjoyable as the last. Definitely worth a watch for 80's action fans &amp; it hands down beats any of the straight-to-video action crap the likes of Jean-Claude Van Damme &amp; Steven Seagal are churning out these days. I for one am looking forward to the fourth film in the Rambo series John Rambo (2008) which is currently in production with Stallone himself as director.</fullReview>

He's a very misunderstood character, finally able to redeem himself somewhat by saving the man who saved him so many times. Though there is much bloodshed, it sends a hidden message: America stands for freedom, in this case freedom for the Afghan people. How ironic that a little over a decade later some of these people would turn against us. Even if you feel like this is too much, if you're looking for a good action movie, pick this up. It may be violent, but it's a good time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the third Rambo film, Rambo is called back into action when his longtime friend Col. Trautman is captured by the Soviets while fighting against them in Afghanistan. This is a somewhat tired plot like other action films from the '80s: a muscular renegade soldier going back to rescue his friend and kill many bad guys in the process. Like the second Rambo film, this is incredibly fake to the point where it is similar to a video game and is no longer entertaining. Early in the film Rambo breaks into the heavily-guarded Soviet base alone with a single machine gun and rescues Col. Trautman. He then shoots his way out (without getting shot even once) and gets away in a stolen helicopter. The final scene comes quickly, where Rambo and Trautman take up arms side by side with Afghan rebels and kill many heavily-armed Russians. Unless you are a die-hard action fan, you should not waste your time on this. Feel free to email me with any questions or comments.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rambo III, not a horrible movie, not great but somewhere between. This film is very average. The biggest complaint is the plot. It is extremely outdated, but thats why it doesn't bother me, the movie came out in 1988. So due to the release year it is overshadowed by how awesome Die Hard was, on top of that the story wasn't that great, just another rescue story. Also its filled with one-liners, Rambo has a one-liner to drop for everything. Example "Who are you" and Rambo replies "Your worst nightmare". Who didn't see that coming. Like the previous film (Rambo: The First Blood part II) it has loads of unnecessary violence, very simple story, and not so good acting.6.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Success is a powerful thing, especially in the business of making movies. Your film makes a lot of money, which brings on the demand for more. Handled right, this can be a good thing. Otherwise you can letdown those who payed their hard earned money and enjoyed what you gave them before. The first two Rambo films were a big hit at the box office and with moviegoers and so it was no surprise that the studio and star Sylvester Stallone wanted to make another go at it. Stallone had proved himself a great talent and his character John Rambo became an action icon, but there is such a thing as too much of a good thing and unfortunately this applies here. Though not dreadful and unwatchable, this third installment is wildly uneven and greatly pales in comparison with the first two films and other great action flicks.Pros: Cast does a fine job. Another good action score by Jerry Goldsmith. Moves at an alright pace. As in the first two films the cinematography is excellent. Some good action sequences. The bad guys are a strong opposing force.Cons: Lacks the energy and edge of your seat thrills of it's predecessors. Not terrible, but bland direction by Peter MacDonald. Sure the first two had politics, but here it's spread on thick and bogs the film down a bit. Unlike the first film, here the balance between drama and action isn't very strong. Again you have to be forgiving of the implausibility of it all.Final thoughts: After two very well done and exciting action pictures we get a dud. It has it's moments and the cast gives it their all, but unlike the previous two it won't stand up to repeat viewings. Good thing they waited a couple decades to do another one. But that's another story.My rating: 2.5/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"This Film Is Dedicated to the Gallant People of Afghanistan" - 'Rambo III' Review...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In preparing to watch the latest installment of the Rambo series, I've gone back and re- watched all of the original three films, which I hadn't seen in probably 15 years. Unfortunately, they are so uniformly bad that it has taken me now over a year to get through the three of them. I finished watching part III today and, like the two films before it, it was a notably underwhelming cinematic experience.By this point in the series, the Rambo formula is worked out in every detail. Rambo just wants to be left alone but then gets sucked into some brutally violent situation which, again, he has to take care of all on his own. He doesn't really play well with others, you see.Just as we found him languishing in a prison labor camp at the beginning of the second movie, Rambo is now living the dubious life of a monk in Thailand who takes breaks from the monastery to head into Bangkok and make some extra money in the stick-fighting competitions, which he promptly turns over to the monks to help build the monastery. He likes the feeling of belonging that he gets from living among the monks and doesn't want to be a soldier anymore. Needless to say, when the guys with the stripes on their shoulders approach and ask for his help, he's uninterested until a mission goes forward in Afghanistan and results in the good guy from the second movie getting taken prisoner, the first American ever taken prisoner in Afghanistan.And here, just like the last movie, is where everything starts to fall apart. The first American ever captured in Afghanistan is not an enviable position, to be sure, so it's easy to understand why Rambo would make such a sudden change of heart. What is unfortunately missing is the entire rest of the American military. I'm curious about how the real members of the United States military responded to the movie, which portrays them as either helpless or completely absent.It may be, perhaps, that the mission is thought to be a lost cause or not worth the risk, so sending Rambo in must, of course, be done "unofficially." If Rambo is caught, he is told prior to embarking on the mission, the military will deny all knowledge of his existence, which prompts Rambo to sneer and say he's used to such treatment, and then do that thing where he ties his headband on all dramatically.At any rate, it's no surprise when Rambo insists that he has to do everything on his own. If you saw the level of sheer camp that the second movie reached then you know something of what to expect here, although it should be said that Rambo III is certainly better than First Blood Part II, which is undeniably the worst film of the already unimpressive series.It is definitely interesting, however, to watch the way the Afghani people are portrayed in the movie.Rambo enters Afghanistan alone and has to make his way to where the prisoner is being kept with only a single in-country contact, who tells him all about the cultural realities on the ground for the Afghani people. Alexander the Great tried and failed to conquer the Afghans, then the British, then the Americans, and they all failed. He explains to Rambo and ancient battle prayer written by a long-since defeated enemy - "May God deliver us from the venom of the cobra, the teeth of the tiger, and the vengeance of the Afghan."The relationship between America and Afghanistan has changed drastically over the years, and not in a good way. In fact, given that we're at war in Afghanistan right now, this movie appears strangely prophetic. If George W. Bush had re-watched Rambo III somewhere around early 2003, it would not be a stretch to think that the situation in the middle east might be drastically different right now."Every day your war machines lose ground to a bunch of poorly armed, poorly equipped freedom fighters. The fact is you underestimated your competition. If you'd studied your history you would know that these people have never given up to anyone. They'd rather die than be slaves to an invading army. You can't defeat a people like that!"Believe it or not, this is not a scathing criticism of America's current war in Afghanistan, it's a scathing criticism by the American prisoner of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in the movie. It is one of the movie's strangest qualities that it pitts the Americans and the Afghans as allies against the cartoonishly villainous Soviets, who come in the form of wild-eyed lunatics at the controls of attack helicopters that buzz small villages laying waste unprovoked to whole populations of peaceful civilians. They are not just an invading force, they are airborne murderers that bombs women and children and disguise bombs as toys to trick unsuspecting children.With such enemies, it is understandable when one character ominously says, "God would have mercy, Rambo won't..." as Rambo sets off on his preposterous one-man mission of vengeance against the invading Soviets. It's interesting that the movie makes so much of how the Afghans have never given in to any invading force in their long history, and yet now they need Rambo to come in and save them from the Russians, but no matter. The movie was made to give the world another dose of outlandish Rambo-style retribution directed at the evil forces that be, and that's what it delivers. It's just too bad that Rambo-style retribution is generally so head-smackingly dumb.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No more Mr. First Blood guy. Perhaps taking that out of the title was a signal to any potential viewers that they were going away from what this series started out as(not that they didn't at least start to with the second one). They didn't even keep entirely to the guerrilla war-fare in this. They add a kid who, whilst not ranking all that high on the "obnoxious" scale, is featured there nonetheless. They do let the foreigners speak their respective language, about half the time. On that, there seems to be less harsh words than in the other two, if not quite as few as the Parents Guide might make one think. The action isn't bad, it's just not that memorable. There's enough of it and it's entertaining to watch, though. I suppose this is as good a point as any to say... obviously, to enjoy this, you must temporarily be of the mindset that fit at the period in which this was made, or you will find trouble sympathizing with whom you are meant to in this. Those who cannot aren't likely to get into this. The plot is about what one'd expect from the genre. This takes the rest of the step into pure macho-ism. There's no dialog or one-liners particularly worth quoting. The ending is arguably a deus ex machina(the writer winds up with the characters in a situation they can't get out of in a satisfying way, and has a solution come out of nowhere to save the day). The DVD holds three featurettes(one long and two shorter, apparently edited from the former), a teaser, a trailer and a photo gallery. I recommend this to those who want to see Rambo again something fierce. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rambo III, isn't as good as the first and second films, but still has great action moments. Again, this film reunites John Rambo (played by Sylvester Stallone) and Col. Samuel Trautman (played by the late Richard Crenna) - and this time Rambo must rescue Col. Trautman (this makes this movie interesting since I've always enjoyed the character interaction between these two throughout the movies - I worry/wonder how Rambo IV will be entertaining considering Richard Crenna has unfortunately passed way, the same goes for the late Jerry Goldsmith, who composed the memorable scores for all 3 films so far). You should see this film just because it is one of the Rambo movies. And I am curious about how Rambo IV will fare. A 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More or less what you'd expect; keep in mind it was made 14 years ago</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**minor spoilers**As a "Rambo" film, the third entry is a satisfactory conclusion to the trilogy. It's no better or worse than the previous films, and certainly as action-packed as the second, if not more so. However, when it was released, the Cold War was beginning to thaw out, and people no longer felt as much interest in seeing Russian villains bite the dust. Today, "Rambo III" seems even more dated in light of recent events, though the filmmakers could hardly have been expected to anticipate the events of September 11. It evens ends with a dedication to "the gallant people of Afghanistan," which certainly seems naive today. To be fair, most people of that country do not share the views of a small groups of extremists such as those who would declare war on all Western cultures. This movie is not pro-Taliban. Anti-Communist, yes, but it has nothing to do with a fascist regime that was not even prominent at the time. By now it's impossible to look at it in a totally objective light, but let's not act as if Rambo is knowingly helping the bad guys. Taken at face value, it's a diverting if not particularly memorable action outing. Some people might have thought it was slow to start, but never fear, once our hero attacks the enemy fort to rescue his mentor, the gunfire and explosions pile up in droves. It's pretty dumb, but at least it lives up to its billing. By now, I stopped looking for plausibility in these movies; just turn off your brain and enjoy. The finale, involving numerous tanks, helicopters, and horse-ridden desert warriors, must be seen to be believed, but it's compelling on a no-brainer level. There's even a child involved in some of the action, but for some reason it didn't really bother me. Who cares about logic in a "Rambo" flick? Stallone does what he does best; he looks buff and beats up the bad guys. There are even some scenes that made me suspect he's a closet masochist. He can actually act given the proper material, but all too often he takes on mindless action and panders to the lowest common denominator. In the long run, he will be remembered more for his action movies than for his few dramas. I've always felt that Richard Crenna's role in "Rambo: First Blood, Part II" was too superficial, but this time he has a much more substantial part than he did last time, and even joins Sly in action. Marc de Jonge plays an utterly generic Commie villain, over-the-top but forgettable. Kurtwood Smith appears briefly as a U.S. embassy officer, but to my disappointment, disappears before the end of the first act. Haven't the producers seen what he can do in action movies like "Robocop?"There's been talk of a fourth film. Quite frankly, I don't know if that's a good idea. Rambo is a distinctly 1980's icon who embodied a decade of gung-ho patriotism and feel-good, macho action movies. That decade has come and gone, leave it be. A new entry would probably not be well-received in this much less innocent time. In a more complex world, the simplistic politics of the 1980's will not suffice. **1/2 (out of ****)Released by Carolco Pictures (thru TriStar)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another brainless action movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At a time when action was king at the cinema, audiences were becoming weiry and tired of the one-man army syndrome that took over the camera. Stars such as Stallone and Schwarznegger had to outdo each other in excitement, action sequences and explosions. Unfortuently plot, credibility and characterisation soon got thrown out of the window. This is what makes characters such as Bruce Willis' John McClane so admired and watchable - they are good characters, and not super-human soldiers who can take on entire armies.Rambo 3 has John Rambo (Stallone) going into Afganistan to rescue his buddy / boss whilst kicking Soviet butt in the process. Earlier, Stallone had already taken out the Russian boxer Ivan Drago, in Rocky 4 - but now Stallone was taking on an entire regiment of the Soviet forces. Believability was never Stallone's strong point, and that seriously ways down on Rambo 3. In Die Hard, you actually felt that McClane had a slim chance at best, you felt for the character - in Rambo 3, you don't really care about Rambo - or what happens, all you care about is where the next action sequence is coming, and it doesn't disappoint.The action is crisp, exciting and on a grand scale. But most of the action relies on explosions and gun battles. Action isn't just explosions and gun battles between one man and a state of the art Russian Military Helicopter - its about stunts, danger - actually feeling the bullets - or the punches or the danger as one stunt goes to the next.But in Rambo 3 there isn't any feeling of danger, just of bewilderment as you try to justify how a Russian Helicopter fails to shoot down Rambo as he runs in empty desert between big bolders - or how explosions don't seem to leave a huge burn on his skin - or how he take out an entire army with just an assault rifle, a knife and a lucky charm.Another problem with Rambo 3 is that the viewer has to cast his or her mind back to when the Cold War was almost a hot one, one that nearly cost the world in mutal automated nuclear destruction - it was a scary time - and political prisoners were barganed at astonomical prices. So when Rambo's friend is captured by Soviet forces - why isn't there political forces trying to negotiate his release, rather than sending in one man who might spark a hot war?Earlier in the film, Rambo is helping out Buddist's in Thailand - and then leaves to Afganistan to help the indigious people out. It is an unpallatable situation, when you take into account of the recent incidents where Afganistan is controlled by the Taliban blowing up sacred reglious Buddist statues and temples, you have to ask yourself: Did Rambo save a country from communist aggression and totalitarisim only to give it to religious totaliratism where human rights is an abondomation?In terms of action movies, this isn't bad, the action is good and the set-pieces fine - its a no brainer, its a film to satisfy those who wanted Stallone to be above a par of Schwarznegger's 1985 hit, Commando - but give it a Rocky treatment.The problem with Rambo 3 is that it's still stuck with the idea of an undestructable, unrealistic one man army mission against an enemy. Audiences were becoming bored of it. I was bored of it. There was no character, no heart. And yet, it took a one man army film, Die Hard, to reignite the action film scene and this proved to be the final nail in the coffin for the "characters" that were John Rambo.Overall: 4/10</fullReview>

After all the mayhem in Vietnam, he manages to have credibility to continue the franchise. So, we are entitlesd to see him sharing "peace of spirit" with buddhist monks. "My war is over", he says, and we yawn even before the movie has begun. Of course, he will kill again, and, conveniently, his war will begin again. So it does: he goes into the battle, and takes part of the most laughable combats ever: with just a machine gun, he destroys the whole russian army. And the movie has its summary right here.

		<fullReview>Better than First Blood part2 but still a horrid picture. Okay, the action is excellent, a lot of money seemed to be pumped into this one.The first Rambo film was quite good, it had a strong message. Rambo2 was horrid, instead of carrying the strong message of the first film, we go into stupid, stupid action set pieces and nothing more. Now, Rambo 3 continues the stupidity trend but it's not all horrid. The action scenes are fun to watch from a technical point of view. The director (did some 2nd unit shooting on Superman The Movie) handles the action stuff very well and makes full use of the widescreen frame. But, the director did not see through the horrible screenplay, how can he direct the actors when they have to speak such drivel. Hang on, Stallone co-wrote it, UGH!The screenplay is horrible, every line is your worst nightmare. The villain is so underwritten, it's a damn disgrace, how dare they write such bad dialogue.The performances are average, even Stallone isn't great. Stallone can make worthy action films but seems to be stuck with lacklustre directors and screenplays.The photography is actually very good and the stunts are excellent. The film score is very good, but a few cues didn't appear in the film, the director reused Rambo2 music in the final 20 minutes.The story is so predictable, so dumb, so pathetic. I didn't care. This film is bad, but a tiny bit better than Rambo2.See it only in widescreen just to see the action sequences. Don't switch on your brain otherwise you'll be offended.Great action films with decent a screenplay do exist.</fullReview>

There is little variety and imagination in the action scenes, and maybe that's why they become monotonous so quickly.

But enter the evil, evil Russians with inhuman faces, bear-like physique and complete military incompetence (letting themselves being defeated by one, relatively unintellegent human being) and this turns into a propaganda film worthy of Nazi Germany. I don't want to discuss this piece of garbage any further, except for asking one question: If the Russians could so easily be defeated by one John Rambo (the entire blasted army, all of them, right down to private Pupkin, leutenant Popkin and major Ivanenko), why did Jimmy Carter boycott the Olympics?</fullReview>

This movie is full of great action and a bombastic soundtrack by the great Jerry Goldsmith. I do find it funny that Rambo is nearly invincible, but that is what most audiences like.This is about Rambo heading to Afganistan to rescue his friend who was his superior in Vietnam and to fight the Russians alongside the Afghan rebels.Once again, the acting is pretty good. Stallone is not the best actor in the world but he make action movies like this work.Overall, this is a nice film that ends the Rambo era of the 80's. Now it's on to the fourth one.

		<shortDescription>An Explosive Sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rambo 3 is a very explosive sequel. There are a lot of explosions, a ton, and a dust and debris fly through the air and stuff. There were a lot of explosions in Rambo 2 and the the recent one, but in the third one, there are explosions all over the place, and destruction. I guess the story is pretty good in the third one, but not great. I like how it is based off of real history when the Russians/Soviets invaded Afghanistan and killed a lot of people and took prisoners and all that. It is a little different seeing Rambo help Arabs. There is a lot of things in the movie where people are being interrogated and tortured. And that goes for Trautman when he gets captured by the Soviets. And then Rambo finally goes in that base to get Trautman out of there. The action is pretty cool. A lot of people get killed, bloody gunshot wounds, blood spurting when people get shot. I think this one is a little more bloodier than the second one, but not too bad. And the good old bow and arrows get shot at people. And of course Rambo fights a big Russian guy, which is a good fight, and Rambo blows him up with a grenade. And i like the ending battle, and a cool showdown between Rambo and the ruthless Soviet General, the tank and helicopter crashing into each other was cool. Pretty much the only thing i did not like too much. Was it took a little too long for Rambo to get into the action, it took about 40 minutes to start blowing things up and kill people. Although the stick fight at the beginning was alright, i liked seeing Rambo getting himself ready to fight, very 80's. I did not mind the first 40 minutes of the movie, but it was a little dragging, with all that stuff when Rambo and his Arab friend are traveling to the village and all that. One thing that was kind of weird, is the English subtitle stuff when the Russians talk. They just randomly pop up on the screen, when there are Russians talking in the background, just a bunch of random jibber jabber. Rambo 3 is a good, and entertaining sequel. And The Rambo franchise is one of the best action franchise's. Iv'e seen the recent Rambo movie, it was pretty good.</fullReview>

Because these types of movies cannot afford to take themselves too seriously.The fifty million dollars worth of production is impressive only on the big screen, so video viewers will miss this.

Rambo refuses saying his war is over but when Trautman is captured, Rambo decides to suit up for one more mission as a one man army to save Trautman. Now Rambo III is the worst Rambo film so far! Stallone gives an utterly embarrassing performance as Rambo and Crenna is tasteless. The plot is weak with Tratuman being captured and the idea of Rambo as a one man army which has already been used in part 2. There are a lot of explosions and killing but that's about it. It may catch a few eyes of excitement but really falls short. This film is just slapped together with big explosions and lousy acting you loose your thought of focus on the movie and start to fall asleep. The fighting is okay and the explosions are nice but it's only the real core of excitement in the movie, the meat in a lame sandwich. Then there are the villains, horrible! This film looked like it was made in under a month with a budget of one hundred bucks. Rambo III the weakest link gets a 4, totally lame and lousy.

		<fullReview>John Rambo has become a type of screen legend. Whereas Arnie had multiple famous characters - The Terminator, Douglas Quaid, Dutch Schaeffer, etc. - Sly only really had two: Rocky Balboa and, of course, Rambo. But by this point in the film's series, John Rambo has become more than a man. More than a hero. John Rambo has become a movie franchise.In this film, Rambo is practicing to be a Buddhist monk out in the middle of the Middle East - by kicking butt and raising money for the local Buddhist chapel. When an old comrade of John's asks for his assistance in some matter of war in Afghanistan, Rambo, being a strong, peace-loving, butt-kicking, machine-gun-toting, greased-up Italian Stallion, says no. But when he finds out his comrade has been held captive by those nasty Afghies, he rushes out farther into the Middle East to serve up some fresh Afghanistan carcasses! Yee-haw!Sylvester Stallone has claimed he is returning to this film franchise as soon as he's done milking - er, filming - "Rocky VI." When I heard this, I thought back to the image of a younger John Rambo. I wondered what a near-sixty-year-old Rambo would look like. And then, after torturous mental anguish and personal pain, I finally got a mental picture of an older John Rambo. And Reader, when I did finally picture this, I also realized that I didn't really care to see another Rambo action flick after "Rambo III." At all. In fact, I think I'd rather die.I've never seen "First Blood," a.k.a. "Rambo," nor "Rambo: First Blood Part II." All I know is what I have heard, and that is that the films are action classics. Do people look for actual quality in "Rambo" movies? I think anyone that does has a serious hole in their head. No, people look for action. Does "Rambo III" have lots of action in it? Sure does. Big explosions? Yep. Mountains of muscle? You betcha. But it isn't entertaining. WHAT? You heard me. It isn't entertaining. WHAT? Please, once was enough. Anyway, yes, it wasn't, isn't and never will be as entertaining as it could and should have been. And though there were tons of explosions, they became a bore after a while. Smart action films with explosions are fun to watch because (a) the explosions and shoot-'em-up action and (b) the plot. "Rambo III" has no plot - it is a wondering spectacle there for a simple purpose: To show lotsa explosions. And show lotsa explosions it does. But they just get tiring. So does watching Sly prancing around like an overfed, overbred, over-steroided ninni in a loin cloth with long, flowing locks of black, greasy hair. Can someone say, "Tarzan"?This isn't quality action spectacular like "Die Hard," this isn't a smart, mean, vicious tale with a sharp focus such as "The Terminator" - it's just an action flick, and a pretty mind-numbing one at that. I felt like I wanted to fall asleep during this movie, and if that isn't a bad sign, nothing is.The film is there for no reason. The plot, what little of it there is, is just an excuse for explosions, as I said before. We are led to believe that Rambo has been brought back to the battlefield to save an old comrade. But as I watched the film, I gained a sneaky feeling that the only reason Rambo was really returning was because he was getting paid 20 million for this flick. And that ain't a bad racket. No wonder Sly wants to do another.1.5/5 stars -John Ulmer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cold war curiosity, with a few good action scenes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie script is just a very poor excuse for a few good action scenes (most of them however downright boring). There are a few political curiosities: the really eerie comments regarding the "gallant Afghans," and one of the most explicit military confrontations between Americans (two, with the help of Afghan friends) and Soviets (lots of them). Bonus: provides excellent catharsis for anyone that, by any chance, despises everything that the Soviet ideology represented.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mujahideen chief Masoud: Go home this is not your war. John Rambo: It is now.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(There are Spoilers) Having had his fill of killing former Green Beret Medal of Honor winner John Rambo, Sylvester Stallone, has gone heavily into the Buddhist way of life. Living in Bangkock Thiland Rambo helps to build a Buddhist Temple outside the city. Rambo also uses his talents as a combat commando in getting into organized stick fight matches in the city to make a little spear change which of course he turns over to his Buddists friends who give him free room and board, as well as food, at the temple that he's helping to build.It's when Rambo's good friend and former commanding officer Col. Trautman, Richard Crenna, comes to see him about a mission, which Rambo turns down, that he's soon to be going on into battle-torn Afghanistan that later turns the now peace loving and pacifist Rambo back into his old fighting self again. Trautman is later captured together with his band of Afghan, or Mujahideen,fighters by the Red Army and is then brutally tortured to tell them where the next shipment of stinger missiles is to be brought into Soviet occupied Afghanistan.Rambo entering Afghanistan from the Pakistan border town of Peshawar with his Mujahideen guide Mousa, Sasson Gabi, is at first only interested in saving his friend Col.Trautman and his men from the Soviet torture chambers. It's when he sees in how the Red Army lead by the sadistic General Zysen, Marc De Jonge, is treating the Afghan people the war becomes very personal with him It's then that he becomes so enraged and determined to drive Gen. Zysen and his troops out of the country even if it kills him doing it.The best of the Rambo/First Blood movies "Rambo III" starts off a bit sluggish with Rambo taking a while to get an Mujahadeen rescue squad together that includes an orphaned 13 year-old holy warrior named Hamid, Doudi Shoua, who's parents were murdered by the Red's. Getting caught flatfooted by the Soviets, with the help of an Afghan informer, the attempt to rescue Col. Trautman turns out to be a bitter failure. It looked at first as if the Red's had already murdered his fellow captured commandos's with Rambo together with young Hamid &amp; Mousa barley escaping with their lives. Thus leaving Trautman behind to again be tortured by the brutal Zysen and his henchmen.It's the next day against orders of the local Mujahideen commander Masoud, Spiro Focas, that Rambo single handedly goes back to the impregnable Soviet fortress and snatches Trautman away from his Russian captors. In an amazing shoot-out with hundreds of Red Army troops and their Afghan commie stooges Rambo commandeers a giant Red Army MI-24 combat helicopter to make good his, and Col. Trautman's, escape.Trying to make their way back to the safety of the Mujahideen camp-site Rambo &amp; Col. Trautman are constantly attacked by Red Army commando units and the the arrogant General Zysen himself, who feels humiliated by Rambo's heroic actions at his expense, leading a fleet of MI-24 helicopters. Cornered by hundreds of Russian troops in the Afghan desert both Rambo &amp; Trautman are just about to be mowed down and finished off. It's just then, like in a Western, out of nowhere the calvary comes to their rescue in the from of hundreds of fierce Mujahideen horsemen which results in one the most unbelievable battle sequences, without the help of computer enhancement, ever put into a movie.Incredible final battle scene between the Afghan rebels and Soviet forces that leaves you almost out of breath. Rambo, after taking out something like a entire battalion of Red Army troops, commandeers a Russian battle tank and stands toe to toe as he battles it out with General Zysen, in his combat helicopter, at high noon in the broiling Afghan desert.One of the most exciting action war movies ever to come out of Hollywood 'Rambo III" was made when we, the USA through the Ronald Reagan Administration, were supplying the Mujahideen with arms to combat the invading Soviets and before that same group of Afghan freedom fighters, later to become known as the Taliban, became our bitter enemy after the September 11, 2001 attacks on America. The movie ironically ends with, considering what the Taliban did later in curtailing the Afghan peoples freedoms, the screen having splashed on it this stirring statement "This film is dedicated to the gallant people of Afghanistan".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rambo is my all-time favorite character and with heavy heart I gave it a 2 out of 10, close to awful. I don't think changing directors in the sequel is such a great idea. Ted Kotcheff made "First Blood" a masterpiece. Then George P. Cosmatos comes in and that's when the quality is traded for loud explosions and inevitable decline of plot and acting. But Peter McDonald absolutely killed it.The Russian colonel reminds of cartoonish villains from Scooby Doo. I hate to say it but, once again, this film would have been so much better if it had remained true to the novel. For those of you who haven't read it here's some spoilers. Not exactly, because this is a movie review site and I'm writing about a book.In the novel, Rambo speaks Russian and there's a Russian soldier helping him, and a doubting high-ranking officer who doesn't shoot them when he can. There's also a French woman named Michelle working in the camp, providing medical services to the Afghans. Trautman lost a lot of blood and desperately needed a transfusion. Rambo agreed to be the donor. There's many interesting facts about the history and culture of Afghanistan. All those things were left out. Now, close your eyes and, in your imagination, put them in the movie. Wouldn't it be swell?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've noticed that big budget action movies have frequently become the whipping boys of wannabe film critics. They may not score too well in the department of sophistication and accuracy but the amount of people they entertain or have entertained tells how much they are appreciated by the common man. Rambo-III is non stop action under massive gunfire and explosions from authentic war machines. It is without doubt one of the best action movies, if not the best, ever made. And it was an 80s effort which makes it commendable, yet it is better than most action flicks today. I don't know what people have against action flicks but they should try making one themselves if they are so sophisticated that this is'nt good enough for them?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rambo want peace. But muscles like war...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pattern ingrained: Rambo want peace? Trautman want Rambo for war? Rambo reluctant? But muscles like war? This time Rambo only enters the fray when Trautman fails, so initially Ramby 3 is a rescue mission in Afghanistan, with the invading Russian army being the bad guys. Thank god the Russians made it PC to shoot some white people for a change.Rambo is again out-gunned, out-manned and out-equipped. Which makes what ensues all the more out-landish.Pausing only to hurl a sheep's carcass Rambo is once again forced to unleash his fury upon and entire army of trained soldiers replete with massive helicopters and barricaded forts. I wouldn't have dared count just how many he takes out in the space of thirty minutes or so but it is at last triple digits.This time around Stallone educates the same boys who thought hiding under sticks was cool about treating a gunshot wound ? the first boys who told us that it was called 'cauterising' the wound in my town were looked upon as Gods. Whatever it is actually called and whether it is realistic or not is irrelevant. It looked cool and painful at once.Again there was a certain repetitiveness to the proceedings: after being drawn in against his well things get personal between Rambo and the lead bad guy, for the third film in a row he manages to find a radio with a direct line to his attacker which enables him to pass on his monosyllabic threats before carrying them out a few moments later. The battle scenes with Rambo and Trautman are destructive to say the least, with running from explosions a theme and some inane battle chatter between the pair perhaps the oddest in a series of films not renowned for its dialogue.Apparently at the time of release Rambo 3 was the most expensive film ever made, I can only imagine that the bulk of the budget went in explosions and steroids. But the end result is typically serviceable, and the box-office return of nearly 200 M would've covered some of the costs.Final Rating ? 6.5 / 10. Totally unnecessary and practically the same film as its predecessor. But for what it is it works well.If you liked Rambo 2 you'll like this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something is missing in Rambo III</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Rambo is someone that is not willing to back down on anything. Why is that? Well, the reason is that he is just an ordinary action hero. In the first movie, First Blood, Sylvester Stallone plays the Vietnam veteran, who was still haunted by the memories of the Vietnam War. He then went against an small-town sheriff and the National Guard. In the end, he turn himself in. In Rambo: First Blood Part II, Stallone return to play the action hero, again. This time, however, his mission was to rescue American POW's that were left behind in Southeast Asia and also, goes against the person who betrayed him by leaving him behind in Vietnam. Now, in 1988, Stallone returns again in Rambo III, the third entry in the Rambo series. In this sequel, Stallone is trying to forget his troubles by hiding out in Thailand. When his old friend and former Colonel, played by Richard Crenna, comes to visit him, he tells Rambo that he is going on a mission to transports weapons in Afghanistan. But, Crenna is captured by the Soviets, and when Rambo finds out about this, he thinks twice about living in harmony. You know that Rambo is an complicated action hero, partly because, he doesn't seem to come in full circle about his past. So, Stallone suits up once again and goes out to rescue his commanding officer. Soon enough, like the first two movies, Rambo must fight against his enemies with his special forces tactics. The action sequences are very thrilling and has a lot of energy put into those sequences. One of them involves Rambo going head-to-head with a tank while he operates a helicopter. Those scenes do work. But, the problem that I had with Rambo III is that it lacks the quality and premise of the other two previous films. In the first movie, we really sympathizes about Stallone's character because he was hurt from his memories. But, even with his personal experiences making the movie work, the first one did have a lot of energy going for it. In the second movie, it was not as good as First Blood, but it did work for a lot of reasons. The first is that it was effective, with Rambo's statements about America respecting our country and how we have to treat our soldiers just like how we treat our nation Another thing that I'll add is that the second one was basically a shoot-em-up movie. It didn't necessarily take itself seriously, but it work as a summer action flick. But, Rambo III doesn't have those qualities. Instead, the movie tells about how Rambo is going to rescue his former CO. Sequels tend to be good if they can tell a story and can take the characters on a different location than the original. Rambo III does take its characters to a different place, just like in Rambo: First Blood Part II, but the movie isn't as good. All in all, all I can say is that the action sequences are good and are very thrilling, indeed. I will also mention the fact that Sylvester Stallone is appealing as John Rambo, and is good as the title character. To me, Stallone can carry movies around without having someone ruined it for him. It is almost in the same field in the Rocky movies. In those movies, Stallone can handle the Rocky character very well and the movie's supporting characters as well. Here, he does carry the movie, but the missing parts makes me not recommend Rambo III although for the action fans, this movie is for you. For me, being an action fan as well, it didn't do it for me. An 50/50 reaction. &#x2605;&#x2605; 1/2 2 1/2 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rambo goes into Afghanistan to rescue his friend and former Superior from a Russian fortress.The first one is a classic, with a good story and a well meaning message that does have some impact. The second one was a mini classic with some outstanding action sequences. Although the story in First Blood Part II was slim, it certainly had more meat than the story here. What's more, Rambo III takes it's sweet time to really get going.The action scenes are good, though. While Part II did them better they're certainly entertaining here and that's the film's only real merit. Stallone looks incredible and delivers his role well enough but I'll be damned if he doesn't look a bit bored at times. Crenna does his usual thing, speaks some gibberish on occasion with some boring stories thrown in the mix. I don't know who plays the Russian villain but he's really something else (and not in a good way).The action scenes, occasional good one-liners and expert scope photography ensure Rambo III entertains, but just barely.</fullReview>

The movie starts off as rambo fighting for a Buddhist monastary, then he goes off to Afghanistan and kills a bunch of Ivans. There is no moral message or political/social commentary in this film that existed in First Blood, except for the Truatman "we had our vietnam" speech." The best part of the film is the Climactic battle between Rambo and the Stalinesque Russian Officer Duke it out in the most impossible situation, It was so implausible i almost cried it was so funny, Theres also some irony in the fact that at the end of the movie there is a printed message that says "This film is dedicated to the gallant people of Afghanistan"This movie is nothing like First Blood, Its like an afganistan version of Commando</fullReview>

Word reaches him that his mentor, Colonel Trautman is being held hostage at a prison somewhere in Afghanistan that is run by a sadistic Russian officer. He eventually accepts the mission to rescue the good Colonel only to find himself facing a much larger and better equipped Soviet army. This is no problem for our hero, and he battles it out with them (with the assistance of Afghan "freedom fighters(?). He eventually finds Crenna and continues to fight side by side with him against overwhelming odds. If you put the unrealistic plot aside, this is what it is supposed to be: a good action film.

		<shortDescription>The worst of the first three Rambo films.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first Rambo film is a true action classic and the second film is a true disappointment. Even though a disappointment, Rambo II wasn't a terrible film and it was a truly enjoyable film still giving us Rambo-like moments. However, Rambo III is what completely destroys everything about the series and we are treated with an extremely slow and overly emotionalized story that doesn't need to be. New characters aren't interesting and even the action sequences aren't that entertaining. Sylvester Stallone is definitely a joy to watch in these films. His physical talent and his endurance and strength are so clearly evident when watching a Rambo film. Not only is he a physical guy but he is a truly underrated actor. He gives yet another great performance in the film but possibly, not as great as the first two. Reason being is that in this film Rambo seems to talk more often, especially delivering corny dialogue towards the end of the film with Richard Crenna's, Trautman. These two are the only good thing in the film but surprisingly enough, when you put them together in an action scene in this film, it turns out pretty bad. Trautman returns to John Rambo with a mission to go to Afghanistan but John refuses and Trautman decides to continue with the mission as planned but Trautman is captured by Afghan terrorists as John must venture where he had no intention of going to save his only friend. When the word 'Rambo' pops into one's mind, they immediately think of a jungle and Rambo being in one. The reason that Rambo III should never be called a Rambo film is that, not once in the film are we shown a jungle. Instead, Rambo is shown in the open even more than he was in the previous film. The jungle is easily the best location that a Rambo film could have an action scene, and the fact that most occurs in sandy wastelands truly doesn't make it phenomenal. Most of the action scenes are uninteresting, the characters are annoying and forgettable and the story attempts to humanize itself too much by providing emotional sequences involving civilians explaining to Rambo about their life. Whilst this isn't terrible, it gets worse and worse as this is done again differently. The reason that 'First Blood' worked amazingly well is how little emotional scenes were shown yet how effective it was. Rambo III is the exact opposite of 'First Blood' and indicates that sticking to original source material works best, especially when trying to make sequels to action classics. 'Rambo III' is definitely the worst of the first three Rambo films, full of uninteresting characters and action sequences, not a single scene in a jungle making this a Rambo film an invalid statement and attempts to humanize itself too much making it that much more frustrating. Rambo III, most definitely isn't a great example of how to make an action sequel. Not only is it nothing like its original, but it is also a very slow paced film that had me checking my watch a few too many times, something which the previous two films didn't.</fullReview>

About the content I don't think anyone needs introductions or detailed reviews of this movie.

		<fullReview>Rambo 3 is an almost non stop action movie and it still has the magic, but the weakest one in the series and this comes from mostly poor direction and secondly poor script that make it a poor movie. I used to be impressed and used to like it as I did the other Rambo movies, when I was a child, but now it looks cheap to me. At the beginnings, visually, the movie looks well and stylish, but it gets worse. Action scenes are not mild, big and each time entertaining, even if slightly. There is everything that the previous movies had in this Rambo movie such as Richard Crenna, another mission or Stallone himself, but except flawless direction and very well written script in comparison with the second and the first movies. As for political messages by critics, they are stuck in messages, subtexts. It is said that Rambo 3 is an one sided movie, it shows Russians as evil. If you see it in that way, then almost many action movies and war movies are wasted. Returning to the movie, despite Peter MacDonald seems one of the best choices to direct this movie, he disappoints. However, as said, the movie is still entertaining, an action covered with dust and dirt, I still watch it when see on TV, but a poor Rambo movie in comparison with First Blood and Rambo 2.</fullReview>

Well, Mr. O'Leary, I suggest you check your history books (try to get proper ones), and read up on what the NKVD and Beria did, read what the Soviets did in the lands they 'liberated', read what they did to Afghans, namely invaded and occupied their country. And I suggest you watch the movie again, and note that the ones Rambo aided were not the Taliban, nor is the entire population of Afghanistan part of the Al-Qaeda. Writing a review based on that astute assumption is not only deeply bigoted, but shows that you possess the mental capacity of an invertebrate. The US (and the fictional Rambo) were doing the right thing when they helped the Afghani fight against Soviet invaders (who used young men from previously invaded countries as cannon fodder). The mistake was leaving that war-torn country alone after the Soviets retreated, no doubt supported by lefties like you, who are very much against nation-building. If the memory and comprehension of history by people like you keep deteriorating as they have, in 10 years you'll be commenting on Schindler's List, saying it's awful zionist propaganda, and that in defeating the germans, we allowed those horrible jews to persecute those poor, poor palestinians. 'The enemy of my enemy is my friend' is not a sound philosophy, as someone already pointed out, but neither is 'Now that I have a new enemy, my old one's crimes are forgiven and forgotten'. Regardless of what you think, the Soviet Union was exactly the Evil Empire that this movie says it was. Trust me, I was born under their rule.Rambo III was, and is, a pretty entertaining action movie, nothing to rave about, but good, solid, entertainment. And the underlying message was undoubtedly a correct one - invading and occupying a country is wrong, and those who can should help the invaded. If that's propaganda, then I'm a moon shuttle conductor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First Blood was an amazing film. Rambo was just as good and although Rambo III is not quite on par with those two fantastic films, I have to say that this installment is quite good. People critisize it because it is the thing to do. It is easy to critisize everything that Stallone does. But look closer at what this film is, listen more to what it has to say and it may not be the silly farce that people say it is.There is one particular scene where one of the Afghans is talking about how war is considered great if you have honour. It is an honour to be a martyr, it is an honour to die for Jesus Chirst or Allah or Buddha or The Easter Bunny. Now a days, people declare war in everyone's name. He then goes on to tell a story about how the Russians dropped toys into the villages and when little children picked them up, they exploded and took off an arm or scarred them for life or killed them."Where is the honour in that?" he wonders out loud. ]That is a good question. Maybe Rambo got carried away and the character became larger than life but the one thing that his character has always done in every film is have an anti war attitude. He never wants to fight, he just happens to be good at it. Rambo III is no different. This is a good film when it preaches to us. But let's face it. We don't want to watch Rambo films for it's politics, we want to watch it so we can see some ass kicking. We want to watch it so we can see some great stunts and lots of action and Stallone performing things that one man should not be able to do. And this film has lots of that. One scene in particular is so much fun that you almost forget how silly it is.Rambo has just been wounded in his obliques but he has to escape the Russian fortress. He does so by going through the sewers. He then gets to a safe haven in the mountains somewhere and he pushes the stick out of his side. He then dumps gun powder into his wound and lights it. A huge flame bursts out of both sides of his stomach and he yells in agony. It is a well done scene but it is so over the top that you have to laugh. Rambo III is fun, there is no doubt that. It's just that it is not quite as good as the other two and it is about this time in Stallone's career that he started to lose some of his popularity. I don't think he had a hit after this one until five years later when he did Cliffhanger. But, if you do like Rambo, then this should at least entertain you. I do like Rambo and like I said, I have to admit that I liked this film for all that it was.7 out of 10 Action and politics go well with this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as Rambo 2 but still a good action movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rated R for Violence and Language.Rambo III is the last movie in the Rambo trilogy(well until John Rambo comes out next year).It wasn't as good as Rambo 2,the plot isn't too great but it is an entertaining action movie that is worth watching for action fans.In this one Rambo goes to Afghanistan to save his friend Trautman from Russians.This one didn't make that much money at the box office because at the time the USA and Russia were friends.When Rambo 2 and Rocky 4 came out in 1985 the US and Russia were enemies so they both did well at the box office.Filled with action, Rambo III does not disappoint but it could have been better.John Rambo comes out in 2008.From the looks of it its going to have both lots of action and lots of drama.Cant wait! 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pleasantly Surprised!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a fan of the Rambo movies I always avoided the third installment(usually they are pretty bad cash-ins). However I decided to watch this one afternoon. At the start it was a bit shaky. But towards the middle portion of the movie where the action heated up complete 180!! The action was intense old school and violent. From that point forward it became very watchable. The story is your basic Rambo movie, a person gets kidnapped and Rambo has to go in and save them. He kills a bunch of guys in ridiculously cool ways and then they escape. I got all that in spades here. Anyway I highly recommend this give it a watch. Any action guy will love it great 80's entertainment!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this is a great third movie sequel, forget all the modern day commotion and just think of it as a cool war movie like it is... Sure its not a jungle blood and guts film but its amazing. I gave a 10 for its perfect acting, amazing action, pure coolness and well character developation.You just couldn't ask for a better 3rd movie sequel, this is better than terminator 3 and alien 3 any day! I also found Rambo 3 a little better and more action packed than Rambo 2.So if you ask me if you haven't seen this film yet make sure you do as soon as possible! You will not regret it!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Who do you think this man is, God?' asks the bad guy in 'Rambo III'. 'God would have mercy,' comes the reply. 'He won't.' He sure won't, not for his enemies and not for the saddle-sore audiences lumbered with another gung-ho adventure for our indestructible hero. Even more untroubled by believability than the previous two movies, this one sees Rambo wading into Russian troops practically single-handed, gunning everybody down, blowing up helicopters, knocking down planes with his fists, shooting laser beams from his eyes and tearing up huge segments of the ground with his bare hands like The Incredible Hulk. It's all the Russians can do to stare boggle-eyed as he cuts a swathe through their forces, stopping only to buddy up with a group of Afghan rebels and join in a charming game where they ride around on horses swinging a dead sheep about. If explosions were interesting in and of themselves this would be quite something.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than Part II, but that ain't saying much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rambo III is the continuation of the adventures of war hero John Rambo, Sylvester Stallone's signature role (along with Rocky Balboa). After saving American POWs from a jungle hell in Rambo: First Blood Part II, he defies the U.S. Army's attempts to get him back and moves to Thailand. He settles with a group of Buddhist monks, whom he helps construct a monastry. But he cannot hide forever. Soon his friend Col. Trautman (Richard Crenna) shows up, asking for his aid in a mission to help supply Afghan rebels with missles to help defend against arial attacks by the Soviet Army. Rambo declines, choosing the quiet life instead of more war. Trautman goes in alone, and he is captured by the chillingly efficient Soviet mastermind Col. Zaysen (Marc de Jonge). When Trautman's assistant Griggs (Kurtwood Smith) tells Rambo the news, he comes out of "retirement" and decides to rescue his friend. He travels into Afghanistan and meets up with the rebels, whom he helps defend against a Soviet attack on their villiage. He then continues to push towards the fortress where Trautman is being held and Zaysen becomes his chief enemy. The war is on, as Soviet forces persue Rambo across the country to a climactic showdown with Zaysen and his lethal helicopter gunship.The film is really quite poor. Stallone plays his charcater perfectly, but Rambo is so badly written, the performance is percieved as terrible. Stallone is also to blame for the script, which he co-wrote with Sheldon Lettich. Rambo has minimal dialogue, except to utter catchphrases that will appear on Rambo III merchandise. Crenna looks tired and bored as Rambo's long suffering friend. de Jonge does a terrible job of over-acting, but he is also the victim of the poor script. The only decent acting can be attributed to the local cast members who play the Afghan rebels. They are not particularly good, but they at least seem to be trying to do their best in a big-budget production.The direction by Peter MacDonald (who led the ariel unit in Rambo: First Blood Part II) is as expected for the action piece. The battle scenes (and there are many, more than any in recent memory) are well filmed, but they become so tiresome and unoriginal. The action is intended to please fans of high-intensity violence and action, but it simply becomes redundant and unsuspenseful, pure overkill.The reason Rambo III is better than Rambo: First Blood Part II is because it does not venture into the realm of American conspiracy that what supposed to develop the plot of Rambo: First Blood Part II. The whole subplot of conspiracy opened the floodgates for plot holes galore. Stallone is at least intelligible in this one, and once or twice I though I saw him about to crack a smile.Still, don't be fooled. Why not just avoid the Rambo series all together? Viewers craving high action heroes should check out the Indiana Jones series. The superb direction of Spielberg, the class of Harrison Ford, and the bits of humor sprinkled over high doses of action should make Rambo III seem like a puppet show.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rambo III is the thrid Rambo film and like the second film this film is full of mindless action. This time Rambo is out to save his mentor Trautman. The film's two best scenes are fight sequences with a bit of martial arts flair. In the first fight sequence Stallone fights an oppoent with sticks and the second fight is a David and Golitah type against an oppoent after Statllone rescsues Trautman All in all fun that will please it's core auidence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>MAJOR improvement from II but still sucks!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directed by Batman's Camera Operator, Peter MacDonald, this is a major improvement from Rambo II. However, while this movie has it's moments it still suffers from a bad plot and weak character development. Action films don't necessarily need a good plot but character development is extremely important. Mostly because you want the audience to want to be Rambo. Which is one of the reasons the first Rambo movie worked so well. In the first movie you see Rambo as a troubled Vietnam vet who's taking the law into his own hands. In Rambo II and III he's just an exaggerated action character in silly action sequences. I honestly must admit that if done right, Rambo II and III would have been great movies.2(**)out of 4(****)stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now try to make a movie like this after the year 2001</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't care what anyone says. Rambo is Awesome. Sly's still in his character over the course of nearly 3 decades and is still rocking with him. But Rambo 3? Now i must say, if you watched this after September 11th, 2001 for the first time, you might be quite confused.So the year's 1988. Rambo is trying to find a sense of inner peace after many years of hell. his solution is a monastery in Thailand, where he does work on the buildings, and stick fights for a little extra cash on the side. one day, his old commander, Colonel Trautman comes and offers Rambo to come with him to Afghanistan to help supply the Afghani rebels in their struggle against the Soviets. Rambo refuses, but trautman goes anyway and is captured. Rambo then decides to go in alone to rescue his best friend in all the world.This movie had the honor of being many things. for one it was the most violent film in the world according to the Guinness world record books, and it was also considered the worst Rambo film in the trilogy. Some people enjoy watching soviet Russian getting owned by an American hero, others were really disappointed to see a hero who never dies, never gets captured or even has a chance of losing. while in First blood, and Rambo: first Blood part 2, Rambo was captured and put in a bad situation, here, Rambo is practically immortal.Now why would this movie confuse people who see the movie for the first time after September 11th of 2001? Well, in the end, the movie is dedicated to the 'gallant' people of Afghanistan. While it might confuse some people, I just laughed when i first read the dedication screen.But, the bottom line is, Rambo III is a pretty good action film. but i recommend the new one, Rambo 4 (or just Rambo) because thanks to modern technology, it is truly what you can call, a Rambo movie.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost a watchable movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Rambo 3" is rather unnecessary sequel that could have been at least a good conclusion to the John Rambo story . First movie introduced the hero to the audience. Second gave Rambo a chance to fight his worst fear and a opportunity to start a new life . The third movie should give Rambo either a tragic ending or find a way for him to exist in the world that doesn't need him anymore. Unfortunately this movie doesn't want to end his story here , but rather is just another installment in the franchise. There's an interesting idea at the beginning of the movie that maybe Rambo is destined to be who he is ( the story about the rock). Unfortunately the movie doesn't follow that idea and we don't reach any conclusion. Only a lot of action .The movie is basically "Rambo 2 " with small changes . Instead of Vietnam we have Afghanistan and Trautman is the hostage. The movie is predictable , but that's not the biggest problem . The movie suffers from too many action and too little story. Peter MacDonald's direction has a bubble gum quality compared to Ted Kotcheff and George Cosmatos. The movie doesn't always flow well and it times it makes the movie feel a bit clumsy. It is very simplistic, straightforward, brutal , comic-book action-packed with extreme violence. Still there's a lot of memorable dialogues I really liked that helps to lighten up the movie a bit.First movie was very realistic . Second had some unrealistic moments (Vietnam hostages in 1985 , Rambo unaffected too much by the torture) , but still was a believable action movie. This movie leaves no question about it; Rambo is an one man army. We have such ridiculous moments as Rambo taking on a helicopter with his bow &amp; arrow and Rambo taking on with a tank the main villain in a helicopter. Also John Rambo does prize fighting to earn his keep in a Buddhist commune and plays goat football .For the first time in three films we actually get to see Trautman partake in some action. We can also see Kurtwood Smith (unforgettable Clarence Bodicker from "Robocop") in a small role. Too bad such a good actor is wasted here . Why couldn't he have a bigger part ? Rambo hasn't change much. He's disillusioned with the world, hiding from himself and his country and he still has his steely determination. With its $63m budget, this was the most expensive film ever made at the time of its release. The movie features some beautiful scenery and its obvious that they spared no expenses on the locations. The musical score by Jerry Goldsmith also adds to the mood even though it's mostly recycled work from "Rambo: First Blood Part II".The movie accurately reflects what was going on in Afghanistan in the mid 1980s. The red army planting mines and booby traps disguised as toys to blow off the limbs of children and the Soviets use of chemical weapons is true.Rambo III did less well at the box office because of the political detention between East and West. The cold war headed towards the end. At the time this movie was being filmed, the Russians were in fact invading Afghanistan just as depicted in this movie, however about 4 weeks prior to this movie's premiere, the Russians had in fact withdrawn from Afghanistan and were no longer at war with that country. This turn of events had hurt the movie's box office returns, since the idea of the Russians being the primary villains in this movie was no longer really believable.After September 11th of 2001 this movie might be confusing for some people. They are confusing the Mujahedeen with the Taliban . The Mujahedeen ("The soldiers of God ") and the Taliban ("The students of God ") are entirely separate things .Overall , its not that bad . I give it 3/10.</fullReview>
