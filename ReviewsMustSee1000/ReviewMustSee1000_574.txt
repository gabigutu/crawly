		<shortDescription>A truly spectacular movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, I'll try to tell you a bit of what I thought about "Water for Elephants", without spoiling anything. I have not read the novel (even though I plan to do it now) so I'm only offering my views on the movie.First of all: It's amazingly beautiful. The costumes and sets are gorgeous, the cinematography is exquisite, the animals are cute (especially Rosie the elephant) and the three leads are very easy on the eyes as well. Robert Pattinson was actually quite good. This was a surprise to me, since I didn't really think he was anything special in any of the Twilight movies or "Remember Me". He looked very appropriate for the time the movie was set in, and even though I love Emile Hirsch (who auditioned for Jacob too) I'm confident that Robert was the best choice there was for this role, it was perfect for him. Hal Holbrook was also very fitting for the role of older Jacob. The two actors really made me believe that they were the same person in different stages of his life.Reese Witherspoon was okay. She looked beautiful, was charming and cute but it felt like something was missing - however, I can't think of any other actress I would have liked better in the role, so I came to the conclusion that it was probably the character Marlena that was a little bland, not Reese. But the true star of this movie was Christoph Waltz. I may be a bit biased since I loved him in "Inglorious Basterds", but he was even more perfect in this movie. His portrayal of August was amazing, he made him likable and interesting and I was always compelled by his scenes. The character reminded me a lot of Miles in "King Kong" (played by Jack Black), a character that also wanted fame and success more than anything and used questionable and even cruel methods to get it. He was terrifying in some scenes too, but always believable. Also, in the beginning of the movie i really felt the chemistry between August and Marlena, which made the character even more interesting; however, I did feel like Jacob and Marlena had chemistry too, and in my opinion this way it was more realistic (both men loved her and she also cared about both of them). I loved the movie, and I really recommend it to everyone. I would sincerely give it 10/10 stars. Of course there was some parts of the movie I didn't like (particularly towards the end of it), but overall it was a magical, spectacular and epic period movie, and I can't wait to see it again!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Old Hollywood Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Water For Elephants takes us back in time, not just because it is set in the 30's but also because the movie is filmed with such quality and attention to detail, it is very much like movies used to be made. No reliance on CGI or profanity to make up for lack of imagination either. The dialog is crisp and the film adheres very much to the spirit of the book, even if things were consolidated or omitted for the film.The cinematography is lush and if the film doesn't win an award for it, it will be a travesty.And the performances are wonderful. Christoph Waltz is captivating as a complex character and Reese Witherspoon walks a fine line (no pun intended) between the role of a dutiful wife and that of a survivor. But it is Robert Pattinson who delivers a range of emotion not seen from him before. He is understated and again reminds me of actors of old - Gary Cooper specifically. He plays a gentleman and a scholar but also shows passion and intensity. Any doubt viewers might have had on his abilities as an actor are wiped away, as he more than holds his own in scenes with two Oscar winners.This is a must-see movie for anyone wanting to see more quality films and less action-packed/violence ridden/computer enhanced drivel at the theaters. Bravo!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a spectacular film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I read Water for Elephants the book, I knew the film would be difficult to make and I was ready to be disappointed. Surprisingly, they managed to capture most of it in picture. Some things were lost on the way, of course, the most unfortunate one being old Jacob's struggles as an old man who refuses to retire from life before his time actually comes. Other details that made the book a masterpiece seemed more suitable for a book so they were not missed, mainly because the core story was there to its finest details.The reenactment of America in Great Depression was good, and the circus was everything you would expect it to be. Such chaos and life and acts and performers and runes and animals all mashed up in a beautiful lively atmosphere. Scenes flowed one after the other smoothly and nothing seemed out of place. This is a hard thing to accomplish when it comes to adaptations. Most of them end up looking like a slide show of pictures or events taken from the book (see Hardwicke's Twilight for a perfect example). This film was a success.The acting was another noteworthy aspect. People will have to acknowledge Robert Pattinson as a first class actor after watching this; and Waltz will be the go-to person for the upcoming psycho roles. He just digs it, I think and he creates the most intimidating gentleman on screen. Witherspoon looked average to me as Marlena, but I may be biased so I won't go into it much. All in all, it would be bizarre if at least one out of the three did not get an Oscar nod.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>very fine drama; old style and that's why it is so appealing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Water For Elephants got released here a full week ahead of the US and first let me indulge in the joy of being able to review such a highly anticipated film before my fellow American film-loving counterparts.The film completely fulfilled my expectations. It is a well scripted, meticulously shot and finely acted period drama, the likes of which are increasingly less to come by at the movies these days. A big congratulations to all those involved with the production for having the confidence to delve into this venture. Actually I am very curious about its box-office. Last year was a surprisingly profitable year for adult dramas and if that is any indication, this fine film should continue the same trend.Water For Elephants really impresses with the production design, atmosphere, costumes and stunts. Most of the time I felt like I was watching a classic film made during the studio era; it looked that authentic and faultless. The three main actors all seem satisfied for having such meaty parts and deliver more than satisfactory performances. Robert Pattinson shines and proves that he is capable as a serious actor. Reese Witherspoon has always been a true professional and here with her stunts demonstrates that again. She also fits surprisingly well to the 1930s platinum blonde beauty type. Christopher Waltz is a wonderful actor and here it becomes very clear that his success in Inglorious Basterds was not a one-off. The story is very emotional and while it touches the heart romantically, it also manages to lay down a heretofore unseen dark aspect of old era circus entertainment in particular and also crowd entertainment as a whole. I almost wished for a three hour epic after it ended; it left me wanting more. The whole thing was really interesting.All in all a wonderful and deeply satisfying experience at the movies, well worth every dime. Go see it so that adult dramas of this caliber (in terms of star power, production budget and subsequent attention to detail) could continue to be made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An amazing and magical movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How to summarize this movie? How does one write about the magic you experienced? I do not know where to begin. The movie took me by storm, it was so fantastically well-made, colors, scenes, it captured one and brought one back to 1930 century magical, but oh so dark circus life. Robert impressed in his role and enchanted me once again. By his side was Reese as spectacular as she always is, beautiful, seductive and fragile. Their forbidden love and passion was captivating. But the movies big star in my opinion was Rosie, the stunning elephant. Could not help but to wish for my own Rosie.The movie was wonderful in every way, romance, passion, action, tragedy, joy, yes, everything you can imagine. A different story (although it starts as the Titanic and has a similar feel) that enchanted me. I still can't stop thinking about the movie.Must be seen!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very pleasantly surprised by Pattinson!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, firstly as I guy I did not think this movie was going to be all that great and interesting for me. I was wrong. The cinematography, costumes, score and acting all added up to an interesting and quite lovely spectacle. I suggest everyone should give it a go. You might be as surprised as I was. I'm going to try to avoid any major spoilers so I'll keep it very vague on the story. The movie kind of keeps you guessing which was its going to go for the characters. Be it happy ever after or big disaster. I could genuinely feel the admiration and respect between Jacob (Pattinson) and Tai (the elephant) which is essential and central to the story. Which brings me to Pattinson. He was absolutely very good in this movie. He was different to previous characters he has played. He was warm and caring yet a strong character which is a difficult balance. I mentioned the connection with Tai was believable and the same is true with Marlena (Witherspoon). She also did a fine job. Her circus tricks should be commended at the very least. Waltz was very good as the "bad guy". He just delivers that kind of role brilliantly. When Pattinson and Waltz are on screen together you do not feel that one is less impressive than the other. That is why I was pleasantly surprised by Pattinson. He has shown in this movie that he is a fine actor with a lot more potential and I question anyone who says differently's motivations. (Yes, he is Edward Cullen..but its time to let that go people and give the guy some major credit for his acting) All in all. I thought it was a charming movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loved the book and very happy with the movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Water for Elephants was a WONDERFUL book. I was afraid that no movie could compare to the delicious tale spun by Sara Gruen. I was particularly worried about Robert Pattinson being able to bring life to Jacob on screen (given that he's really only excelled at being a dead vampire). Also, the critics weren't too nice to this film.I have to say though, I was pleasantly surprised at how easily I fell back into the story with the cast of characters. As everyone else has said, the film itself was beautiful and will probably win an award for cinematography. Of course having read the book, much of the descriptive detail of the circus life and circus characters was left out of the movie. Also, the book is extremely heart-wrenching in it's description of old Jacob in the nursing home and some of that feeling was left out along the way (though the opening scene brought me to tears!). Also, some of the scenes with Rosie brought me to tears. They picked a GREAT elephant for the part!! A screenwriter has a time limit to work with when paring down a book and overall it was done very well! If you've read the book, you won't be disappointed...the meat of the story and the characters makes it to the screen. My husband had not read the book and didn't know what he was missing and liked it as much as I did (and even laughed and shuddered along the way with me).I have to say that I thought the one weak link was Reese Witherspoon. I thought her film portrayal of Marlena came across as weaker than the book version, but she was physically perfect for the part-beautiful! I loved it, it's definitely worth seeing!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pleasantly surprised by it. For a movie set in the 1900s circus world, it does hold and show the magic of circus on screen as it is beautifully shot and told.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. Without being trite and redundant, it explores timeless and universal themes such as finding one's destiny and freedom, life choices, love, and jealousy, put in an interesting setting, that is the circus world -- the early 1900s when the US prohibition and depression were taking place -- which is nicely recreated on screen (by production designer Jack Fisk who's mostly known for his work with Terence Malick and David Lynch). Based on Sara Gruen's novel, this very original story is beautifully told, uses classical film-making techniques -- its camera moves, staging, lighting, pacing, usage of 'live' animals, stunts and special effects -- and well acted -- Robert Pattison comes across as a decent lead actor and not just a pretty face; Reese Witherspoon, very convincing as the star circus girl, doing some of her own stunts; however Christoph Waltz's performance stands out the most as he maintains the dynamic among all the main characters and fuels the drama. It's nice and refreshing to see a classically-made-and-looking film coming out of Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although the title of this review pretty much sums it up, in order to post a review i must include 10 lines of text. So here goes. This movie starts out with a similar feel to Titanic like many have said. It takes you back 70+ years and takes you through and incredible journey of passion, adventure, and just life in general. For every up there is a down, for every laugh a cry. You find yourself full of emotion at so many points in this movie it's hard to not get chills at times. The ending is well written well acted out and well, like the rest of the movie is just perfect. How this is only @ a 6.3 rating currently is beyond me, hopefully more people will take the time to post this movie was a solid 8.5 in my opinion and is a must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful film, less depressing than the book I believe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having read a few reviews of this depression era set novel by Sara Gruen, I was apprehensive to see the film. The readers and critics had said it was too depressing and didn't end well. I'm happy to say the film is not bad at all. It captures the mood of the 1930s, and we the audience really get a sense of what it must have been like to live in that time in history. (Yes we went through our own depression but it was quite different and much more difficult back then.) The film centers around Jacob (Robert Pattinson) a student of veterinary science at Cornell, who gives up his education and runs away after his parents die in a car accident. He stumbles upon a traveling circus, where he is taken in by riff raffs and other stowaways. They have all become a part of the circus ensemble in order to make ends meet. Jacob eventually meets their ringleader August, played by Christolph Waltz (Inglorious Basterds) and his beautiful wife Marlena (Reese Witherspoon). August takes Jacob under his wing initially, but later Jacob learns his true colors. I do not wish to give away too much of the storyline but something tells me people will like this movie as much as the book if not more. I think the film makers have managed to make a film about the depression era without it being depressing. The film has an epic feel to it. It's, emotional, inspiring, romantic, and overall it makes for a very good drama. Even the ending is uplifting. The cast is wonderful as well. Robert Pattinson holds his own against two Oscar winners. It's great to see Reese Witherspoon back in action and in top form. There aren't enough great things I can say about Christoph Waltz. He balances the line between being dangerous and comedic with razor sharp precision, and is very intimidating?his performance is brilliant. It's great to see a film with real sets, and gritty and flawed characters, rather than imaginative CG rendered places and creatures. Even the train, (where a large part of the film takes place) feels alive with all its moving parts?it has a personality of its own. It's a surprising film from director Francis Lawrence whose previous films include "Constantine" and "I am Legend." It's clear that the team he works with has a great sense of capturing a story's mood, time, and place. "Water for Elephants" is a beautiful, moving, and entertaining film. Go see it! http://tickingticket.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Spectacular Show</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Readers, fear not. This is one adaption that lives up to the book.Water for Elephants is pure beauty. Despite the fact that it takes place during the Depression, it makes you almost wish you lived during the '30s.One reason is the costumes. They are wonderfully done, as well as the makeup. Another is the eye candy. No, I'm not talking about Robert Pattinson(though he looks as gorgeous as ever). I'm talking about the breathtaking cinematography, courtesy of Rodrigo Prieto.While the leads(Robert Pattinson, Reese Witherspoon, Christoph Waltz) all turn in GREAT performances, the real star here is Tai the elephant. She plays Rosie, the newest addition to The Benzini Bros. Most Spectacular Show on Earth, who is brought in in hopes of taking The Benzini Bros. circus to a new level(particularly to the level of Ringling Bros.).As per usual, there are quite a few changes that may or may not irritate the readers. It all depends on the person. One that I felt was an improvement upon the book, however, was the combining of August and Uncle Al. I honestly didn't miss Al one bit.Water for Elephants is a beautiful, enchanting, mesmerizing must-see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Give water to the elephants!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The director behind I Am Legend and Constantine has made a traditional romantic drama of the old school, with Twilight idol Robert Pattinson in the lead role, and it's certainly nothing wrong with it. Water for Elephants are the type of film that is rarely made anymore, with a story that is so timeless that it could have been filmed at any time in the last seventies. Based on the award winning novel by Sara Gruen, who signed in the name of truth have not read. It seems that a couple of the characters are merged, and part of the frame story is cut out, but it's insignificant changes that are the film to slide off more efficiently.This is the story of Jacob Jankowski, a young man in the depression of the future United States that loses everything when her parents die in a car accident. He leaves veterinary studies at Cornell University and go like so many unemployed men in the 1930s on the road. Jacob jumps at the first freight trains chug by, and ends up as stowaways, on one of the cars to the circus Benzini Brothers. Circus Director August recognizes that a veterinary education can be useful in a circus where the animals are dying of hunger and diseases. August is proving to be a charming, capricious sadist who not afraid to kill people who disappoint him. So when Jacob falls in love with Malena, he does things that goes very wrong.Water for Elephants paints an authentic picture of circus life of thirty centuries, a merciless nomadic existence that operates in its own closed universe. Particularly fascinating are descriptions of the practice called redlighting where employees were fired by being thrown out of the circus train at full speed, with little chance for survival. Thank you and goodbye. It is quite possible that Robert Pattinsons idol status as a burden on his ambitions, is to be taken seriously as an actor, but the role of elections suggests that he is serious, and has good taste when it comes to picking out projects. Robert does his best ever performance in Water for Elephants, which ought to be Easter major film for all romantics. No reason to be embarrassed to let the movement of such a solid, well made Hollywood film like this.Overall rating: 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do not believe the high rating for this show..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is just that awful. The only reason i watched the whole show was because of the high rating here. There wasn't any chemistry between Reese Witherspoon and Robert Pattison. Although it wasn't Reese Witherspoon's fault. Why some of the reviewers think Robert Pattison gave a marvelous performance is really a wonder. He's not acting, he was just being himself. Just search for his interviews on youtube if you don't believe. The storyline is bland (if there was any), other than Christoph Waltz and Jim Norton, i don't feel any of the other characters believable. Film dragged on for too long. How i hope the animals at the end would just kill them all. And like some others said, the elephant was (or still is) definitely tortured to perform tricks like that. Shame on the stars who performed in this film. If you enjoy being tortured by a slow and pointless story, then this is the film for you. Otherwise, there are better films out there. I wish i could take back that 2 hours of my life or at the very least not trusting the high rating from reviewers here. Oh, another thing, what cinematography were people talking about? Everything were closeups. I didn't see a single spectacular view.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jacob Jankowski (Robert Pattinson) has a bright future ahead of him: with the Great Depression ravaging through America he has the chance at a good job as a veterinarian and a stable life. This all changes when he discovers that his parents have been in a car accident and that he is illegible to own their house. He tries to renew his life's purpose and by chance comes across the circus troupe of the Bezeni Brothers where he meets the cruel owner August (Christoph Waltz) and dazzling Marlene (Reese Witherspoon).Titanic on a train: you would be forgiven if this was your estimation of the film based on previews and for the most part you would be right. Based on the award-winning novel of the same name, Water for Elephants tells the story of a man who has to redirect his life after it is derailed from some unfortunate events. The story is told in a linear fashion and it is a pity that not more is made of the idea of reality vs. illusion which is a noticeable subject in the odd dialogue interchange. While this concept has more in liking with who a character really is and what information they know but do not let on, the concept is nevertheless never fully developed and ultimately explained by the characters themselves. Nevertheless, other themes present themselves in more subtle and interesting ways such as the images of railroads and water allowing the experience to not be all dictated. In the end, the film feels like a reworking of James Cameron's Titanic with a new setting and a new cast, but it most likely will not have the same cultural impact.Romance becomes pivotal to the development of characters and the respective actors prove capable. Robert Pattinson will obviously be the centre of talk for the film and he does well for himself here. If you did not feel that Remember Me was a step in the right direction from a Twilight-esque future, then this film will surely give you the impression that Pattinson at least has the potential to mature his acting in a commendable manner. Witherspoon does an adequate job in her portrayal of Marlene and wriggles in workable chemistry between herself and Pattinson, but ultimately she does little to truly shine beyond her male counterparts. But experience is what steals the show with Waltz exemplifying a character who can pull you in with his charisma and idealistic hopes but who can also repulse you with his cruelty. Waltz is indeed the strongest link in the acting department but do not let his performance undermine the rest of the cast, especially the supporting roles who help create a holistically believable set of characters.All of this is strengthened by some decent costume design and film direction which brings every scene to life gracefully. There is some questionable CGI use for animals towards the end and the environment does not get quite the showing it could but the film feels balanced and admirable in portrayal of one man's journey of self-discovery.Sex and nudity are, at most, hinted at and language is mild at best. There is some violence mostly in the regard of fist fighting but also the rare off-screen violence towards an animal.As mentioned earlier, Titanic on a train could very well be an apt explanation of the film. There is thankfully enough substance to allow the story to craft its own image but only just. This coupled with some slight CGI mishap and a narrative that does not always allow one to ponder on certain ideas, are not enough to truly hurt the overall quality. The story is lovely; the acting is strong; and the filming is delicate in what it offers. It may not be the Titanic of the time, but it is hardly a bumpy ride either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Water for Elephants is the Most Spectacular Show on Earth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the New York Times best-selling novel penned by Sara Gruen, Water for Elephants is set during the Great Depression of the 1930s. The movie plunges you into an era where travelling circuses and big tops were all the rage. Jacob Jankowski (Pattinson,) a veterinary student at Cornell, learns rapidly how life can change with the blink of an eye when his parents die in an accident. Alone with nowhere to go and no money Jacob jumps on a train, which turns out to be owned by the Benzini Brothers, a travelling circus. First seen as an intruder by the owner of the circus, August (cleverly played by Christoph Waltz,) his veterinary skills quickly come in handy and help him find his own place in the circus. When Jacob meets August's wife Marlena (played by Reese Witherspoon,) he falls under her charm and soon has to deal with the furious temper of a crazed husband. Ladies and gentleman prepare to be wooed; this is Robert Pattinson like you've never seen him before. From laughter to extreme frustration, Pattinson displays a wide array of emotions, showing his worth as an actor. Witherspoon and Waltz also show their amazing Oscar winning capabilities in this movie. As a secondary character, Hal Holbrook plays the part of an older Jacob Jankowski marvellously well. In the fashion of great Hollywood love stories, the transition between "old Jacob" and "young Jacob" is cleverly played. Water for Elephants is beautifully shot. Francis Lawrence manages to bring an entire era to life on the silver screen. You'll go through a roller-coaster of emotions, from laughter to tears. For fans of the book, you will definitely not be disappointed, the screenplay written by Richard LaGravenese, stays true to the book. Definitely a must see! Water for Elephants is simply the most spectacular show on earth?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Melodrama: Waltz Rages Through The Magic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Critically acclaimed novel "Water for Elephants" written by Sara Gruen was a New York Times #1 Best Seller in 2007 and now has taken a turn towards cinema with the help of Director Francis Lawrence ("I Am Legend"). The film's biggest draw comes from Robert Pattinson ("Twilight") after his tween vampire film following success, however, the real star of the show is Academy Award Winner Christoph Waltz (Inglourious Bastards"). Reese Witherspoon ("Walk the Line") stars as the film's leading lady hitting her stride late in the film. Hal Holbrook ("All The President's Men") opens up the film with the portrayal of present day Jacob Janowski found in a parking lot outside of the circus who begins telling the story of his early years connecting to one of the biggest circus disasters in history. Pattinson plays the younger Jacob, a veterinary student at Cornell whose his life is turned upside down. He drops out of school deciding to go jump a train. He realizes that he has joined the ranks of the Benzini Brothers Circus changing his life forever. He is thrown into the harsh reality of the Big Top meeting a man named August (Waltz) who reluctantly gives him a job working with the animals. Jacob becomes infatuated with August's wife Marlena (Witherspoon) who is a part of the lead act in the show that develops into a friendship between man, woman and a majestic elephant. However, life is a battle and the story is extremely dramatic leaving everyone's life at risk with August's alcoholic greedy rage on their doorstep.Cristoph Waltz does what he does best with his most recent interpretation of a complicated ill-willed bad guy that audiences grow to hate, however, the depth of his performances make him memorable. He is able to give life to the cold soul of August making the viewer root for his demise along with his change of heart. Pattinson shows that he is more than just a tween king vampire, however, his full potential is not unleashed. The real star of the show is the majestic elephant herself (Rosie) and the character's journey to protect her hitting the right notes in the second half.The magic and magnificence of the film is lost within the overly dramatic, lengthy exposition. The melodramatic backdrop of the film is omnipresent leaving little room for comic relief and the growth of the beautiful creatures to coexist. The most disappointing part of the film is Witherspoon's odd character development making her very plain until halfway through the film. At the same time it seems like an eternity once the elephant finally enters the film showing an inkling of hope, while the love triangle becomes childish, cliché and eventually annoying.Overall, the film has an average script that is aided by the performances of its actors. It is hard to overlook the melodrama as Waltz controls the show, which is actually more about life and relationships than the circus.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The book was better.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a standalone feature the movie may have been successful, but as most movies these days go, the screenplay was adapted from the source material, and inevitably left out some key elements.The largest of these omissions was combining Uncle Al and August into one character. I didn't understand the reasoning behind it, and a lot of drama is lost. Christoph Waltz is a capable actor, but's it's hard to convincingly play the man who's greed and desperation runs the circus into the ground, and the tortured, schizophrenic man who's rage and cruelty drives his wife and friends away.Also I think that the entire theme of living during the late depression is largely glamorized and you never really sense how desperate the men are, and thus have a hard time believing the finale.I was also saddened by what happened to Walter and Camel in the book, but unmoved in the movie... the friendship had no build-up... they disliked one another then they were BFF's.The last omission was an understandable deviation from the book, but in it was so critical to the theme of the story that I missed it in the movie. I'm talking about the scenes in the nursing home where we see the shell of a man that Jacob became, and we're left feeling almost as helpless and depressed as him until he finally makes it to the circus in the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I can see this being one of the best movies this year.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all: WowSecond: WowI saw the movie today at a pre screening and let me just say, this movie simply just took my breathe away. I was already in tears by the first scene! This is an emotional, warm movie and I loved every second of it of course there are some really funny scenes in it too but since I don't wanna post spoilers I will add a few under the cut but one of the best scenes has to do with cats ;). It is so beautiful, they have really captured the era and the feeling of a circus.This movie seem to be all Robert Pattinson (Jacob), I mean come on!! The footage of Rob is to die for. If i could picture frame every scene he is in i would. He is simply amazingly beautiful in this movie, like we didn't already know that?!How about Robs acting then. The big question ;) I could see so much change in his acting and so much progress. It made me sort of proud in a weird way. I hope this movie will finally be the one that makes the movie business see him as something more than Edward Cullen. In the beginning of the movie i could see some Edward acting in certain face expressions and further in I could draw parallels with Tyler in Remember Me and sometimes I couldn't tell if he was acting or if he was simply being Rob. In some scenes I could see him charming fans at official events or just being laid back as he always is. Like if he shined through..you know what I mean? I think all of you will see his amazing change, he have learned so much on the way.He has developed so much!To make this a fair review I think I would have to mention the rest of the cast.Hal Holbrook (Old Jacob) is the sweetest little man ever. Totally awesome for the short time we see him on screen. I had a really hard time not crying when he was on. The opening scene is so emotional.Reese Witherspoon (Marlena) I didn't expect anything besides good acting. She is so very sweet and on film she and Rob has an awesome connection and chemistry. Almost felt as if I could see the playfulness in the movie that they shared during their WFE press junket interviews.Christoph Waltz (August) have to admit i haven't seen any movie from him before but he plays his part gracefully. Scary man with great ambitions for his circus.Tai (Rose) the elephant. I LOVED HER!! I loved how adorable the scenes between her and Rob are. You can see the love Rob has for that elephant. Their scenes are the best!!As for the other cast...they have made a great casting for this movie. Everyone plays their part so good.Found a lack of depth in the movie like the book has, but i guess it is impossible to add all features from the book in to 2 hours of film. Overall nothing that really is bothering.About the music.. I must admit that i didn't notice the score at all so i suppose it really worked in the movie. A lot of time typical music in many scenes. Many have asked me on twitter if i think this movie is Oscars material. To be honest, I would love it to get an Oscar nod cause the scenography and costumes are so beautiful (!!) but, my answer will be no, at least in the bigger categories. It's not that i don't think the movie is extremely good but because i don't think the movie has the depth or the complexity that the Oscar winning movies normally have. But if i am wrong i will be so happy of course.I wish all would see this movie. I don't think it will disappoint many.SPOILERSThe sex scene is something i have been asked about. Well, it's short and pretty much non existent. As far as anything naked in this movie, you will not find it.Funniest scenes: When August tells Jacob to feed the cats. I laughed so much when Rob gets scared and falls. Also the scene after Robs party with Barbra and the crew and he wakes up in full clown gear. I am telling you nippelgate Rob all the way hahhahaha!!!When Rob gets tears in his eyes when Rose is being hit my heart broke. *tears*We also get to hear Rob speak polish in the movie which is really cool. And for me as a non polish person i think it sounds genuine :DI will not write the ending even if this is spoilers cause I don't want to ruin it for those who haven't read the book.The ONLY thing in the movie that didn't have the high quality as the rest of the movie was the scene when the animals are let loose among the circus audience. Looked to much as computer work than the real thing</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Old Story, Old Fashioned Look, I Did Not Really Like It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was one of the oldest stories in the book -- a new man gets in between the relationship of a husband and a wife. But for "Water for Elephants," this story was transported to the era of the Great Depression in the US where a young vet student joins a traditional big top circus, led by its perfectionist ringleader and his star performer wife.I guess period set pieces like this would only appeal to certain people. I did not find the time or the setting particularly interesting. The presence of the the titular elephant Rosie was engaging though, as the beast actually seemed to emote. Christoph Waltz does another one of his charming sadist roles as August, the ringleader. Reese Witherspoon impressed me with some of her gymnastic skills as Marlena, but overall her performance was rather bland. Most of the audience attention was on Robert Pattinson to see if he can step out of Edward's shadow in the Twilight movies. Interestingly, he plays a character named Jacob in this film. He has very distinct facial features which makes it hard for him to disappear into a role. He was able to show more variety here, and he looked right for the time period. It is still very much in the love story genre though, so his acting style is generally the same. So the final verdict is: If you like love stories, you might like this movie. If you like the circus, you might like this movie. Despite all the rave reviews I have been reading about it, I found this film rather average because of the very familiar and therefore predictable storyline.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Beautiful Romance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When an old man is found wandering in the parking area of the Circus Vargas, his owner invites him to come to his office to call the Green Haven nursing home to take him back home. The old man tells his name, Jacob Jankowski, and explains that he worked in the Benzini Bros. Circus in 1931. The owner is curious about it since in 1931 there was the most famous disaster in history of circuses in the Benzini Circus and asks Jacob to tell what happened.In 1931, during the Great Depression, the Polish American Jacob (Robert Pattinson) lives with his beloved parents in a small ranch and studies veterinary in the Cornell University. During his final exams, his parents die in a car accident. Jacob learns that he is homeless and without any money since his parents used their house to get a loan for his studies. Jacob leaves his town and jumps in a train in movement without destination to seek a job. Soon he finds that this is the Benzini Brothers Circus train and he finds a job cleaning the animals' excrement from the wagons. When the unstable and violent owner of the traveling circus, August (Christoph Waltz), learns that Jacob is a veterinary, he hires him to train his attraction, the elephant Rosie. August and his bodyguard Blackie (Scott MacDonald), throw workers that complain off the train in movement to get rid of them. Meanwhile Jacob meets August's wife and lead attraction Marlena (Reese Witherspoon), he immediately falls in love with her. Jacob gets closer to Marlena and soon he discovers that she is also in love with him, but she fears August. "Water for Elephants" is a beautiful romance developed in the Great Depression with the story of a youngster that loses his beloved parents and joins a circus by chance. He finds love, but also the illusion of the circus and the violence of an unstable man. The lead cast is composed by the excellent Christoph Waltz, Reese Witherspoon and a surprisingly good Robert Pattinson besides the lovely elephant Rosie. The art direction is also very beautiful in the recreation of 1931 costumes and sets. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Água Para Elefantes" ("Water for Elephants")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good visuals, acting; familiar story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Apparently 'Water for Elephants' was a very popular book when it was published. It is also apparent that the more popular a book is, the quicker its screen adaptation gets produced. All we as viewers and fans can hope for is a script, production, and acting body that gives the book the attention it deserves. Now I haven't read the book but for what it's worth, I think Francis Lawrence and company gave it their best shot.Since I didn't read the book, I can't attest to its congruency with the film. However, the screenplay seemed well-written though quite straightforward. If the book was nuanced with symbolism, such nuances were lost on me during the film. The love triangle mixed with animal rights/humanitarianism makes for a fine story but it is one with a vast and well-trodden history and wears thin on a cinemaphile such as myself.The good news is, for fans of the book, there was definitely adequate attention paid to the production value and acting. The cinematography was deliciously crisp and the lighting fantastic. Overall, this allowed me to forget the few scenes that seemed oddly cut. As for the acting, I came into the theater expecting to have fuel added to my hate-fire for that pale, glistening vampire from Twilight. To my glorious surprise, Robert Pattinson shows that he has skills when not covered in white powder. I look forward to seeing what he can do in the future. Reese Witherspoon is maturing into a beautiful, seasoned actress and her experience shows. Unfortunately, I haven't enjoyed Christoph Waltz since Inglorious Basterds and this movie is no exception. I don't know whether he fit the physical profile of August to a tee or not, but I think I could have introduced a circus better than his bearded self.All in all, whether you are a fan of the book or want an interesting perspective on a certain lifestyle of the depression era, Water for Elephants is worth seeing once. Though, you may want to wait for it to come out on video.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They DO "make em like they used to"!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remember when movies were glamorous (and not in 3-D)... when the stars were beautiful, and no one had to fornicate on screen for you to know they were walking on clouds or heart-achingly in love? Remember when quiet, wordless scenes could make tears well up in your eyes? Well, whoever may say "They don't make em like they used to" hasn't seen "The Painted Veil" or this beautiful film, "Water for Elephants". This is old-style adventure and romance --Hollywood film-making at its finest!I didn't read the novel, but I am an avid fan of classic films, and an animal lover, and I highly recommend "Water for Elephants" for most anyone (who is at least in their teens.) The only critique I have of this movie is that it was too short! It was so beautiful and it carried me away so completely, I think I could have enjoyed it for another hour."Water for Elephants" sweeps you into circus life of the 1930's, during the hungry and desperate times of the Great Depression. It's a nomadic, hard-working, and very sparse life. This 2nd class circus is a defined "family" though, and they live isolated on the sullied fringes of regular society.All three leads were truly luminous. Jacob and Marlena were both lovely and believable in their restrained, refined roles.Christoph Waltz, as August, proved again he can be an "enigma absolute." He is charismatic and likable; his enthusiasm and joy is literally tangible, but somewhere beneath, there seems to lurk something so horrific, there simply aren't words to name it.I have so much admiration for the magic of this Christoph Waltz after "Inglourious Basterds" and now, this new film. It is my great hope that he will choose his roles wisely and with delicacy, so that we can continue to relish in his talents for many years to come.My virtual hat is off! Off to the writer, cinematographer, set director, art director, director, editors, costume designer, and everyone involved. "Water for Elephants" is a can't-help-but-watch-it-again movie masterpiece with music by talented James Newton Howard that will make you tap your feet one minute and then want to cry the next.Hal Holbrook, Paul Schneider, James Frain, Mark Povinelli, and more! Wow. What outstanding work by supporting actors, and what fine casting! Hal Holbrook EASILY was old Jacob to Robert Pattinson's young Jacob. That's so hard to do, and yet, it was so easily done here.The animal actors were first-class, too; Silver Star, Rosie, and Queenie were all achingly touchable and sweet.Romantic, sweeping, frightening and sometimes violent --this film is TRUE-to-life while still being BIGGER-than-life.Its tag line is "Life is the most spectacular show on earth", and once you've seen the film, it's the perfect statement.So yes, go ahead and compare it to any of the old-style Hollywood grand classics. It deserves the acclaim and the adoration. I'll go see it again while it's still on the big screen!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stunning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off I bought this book the day it came out because of the author's previous too books she had written. This is by far my favorite book and was excited and apprehensive to see the movie. The movie does move parts of the book around and it does leave things out. From my stand point everything about it was stunning. Pleasantly surprised by Robert Pattinson's performance, he made an impressive Jacob. Reese was gorgeous as usual and captivating as Marlena, but Christopher Waltz was by far my favorite. He was the perfect August. This movie is just absolutely stunning and I agree with some of the previous posters, how is this movie only reaching a 6.3 rating? I suppose people just need more motivation to see it on their own! :-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Take you on a ride back in depression era</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First reading the book i was bit hesitate to watch the movie because i thought it will never measure up to the book but i finally made my mind and watch it. The pace of the book and movie is little different but apart from that it was beyond what i expected. the whole setting of that era from costumes to background it looks like everything was real. Hats off to the team who made it possible.Now talking about performances i think the winner here is Christoph waltz, he amazed me by his portrayal of Augustus because by the end of each scene you don't know whether to be frightened by him or love him. Reese Witherspoon is good here like always but some of the characteristics of the book Marlena are missing. The supporting cast are all very good. Hal Holbrook, Scott MacDonald, Mark Povinelli and Donna Scott were really good. Also the standout was Rosie the elephant, she will win everyone's heart by her performance. As for the Robert Pattinson, he really surprised me with his acting here because i didn't see twilight films at all and frankly i didn't see any of his work except in harry potter 4 and the bad mother's handbook in both of which he was good but because of all the negative criticism he is getting lately i wasn't sure about his performance but after watching the movie i must say he has potential because it is not easy to hold your own in front of two Oscar winning actors but he did amazing job. so i got that believing in critics words was very wrong sometime.I am going to watch it again coming weekend and i recommend everyone to at least watch it once. It will worth your every penny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Subtly enchanting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is about a young man who has to drop out of vet school after his parents' sudden death. He joins a circus by chance, and his life is never the same again.Circuses have become increasingly ignored and irrelevant in modern day lives, as the number of options for entertainment exponentially increases. A romance set in a circus setting may not exactly appeal to the public, and hence I had doubts about "Water for Elephants". It turns out to be a good film, it is quiet and subtle, and yet enchanting throughout. I particularly like the ending black and white shots, they remind me so much of the feel in "The Notebook". These every day snapshot scenes are simple, and yet effective and touching. The only one complaint I have is that the plot is predictable. Robert and Reese are hugging on the poster, which already gives the whole plot away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spare Your Netflix Queue the Misery and Cancel This Film Now</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know what film these people saw, but the average rating for this film is far too generous. The novel was engaging, so for those who read it and hoped for something similar from this film, the movie is bound to radically disappoint. For starters, the director has no filmic resume, his experience being primarily limited to music videos, and it shows. The film feels almost entirely 2-dimensional; i.e., it feels like watching a play, the action taking place almost exclusively on the x-y axis, and making little to no use of the z axis. What should have been a palpable, visceral story feels flat and forced. I don't know who the cinematographer was, but he either stinks or was under the duress of poor directing; or quite possibly both. And it's no wonder the script didn't receive any Oscar nods at all, not least of all a nod for adapted screenplay. The author of the book should not have sold whatever rights she sold to the production company; they did her no favors. Reese Witherspoon stinks; she should have quite acting after her role as June Carter. The main character was the elephant--a rather larger than life character at that--and yet somehow even she felt small. I don't how they managed to pull that off, but somehow they did. I can't find anything more redeeming to say about the film, so I suppose that does it for this one folks. Believe me, spare your Netflix queue the trouble and cancel this one now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly Decent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some people might be wondering whether the events follow the book well.I have not read the book but I am told the movie did a decent job of following it. Some of the events were hard to believe. For example when the animals are released they wouldn't attack the crowd. They've been tamed for years and are used to people. The lion would most likely not stand and prowl menacingly over the crowd. This scene did accomplish its goal of creating a sense of chaos though.Another concern could be if it is too much of a "chick flick." I went in expecting the movie to be a "chick flick." As soon as I saw Robert Pattinson from the Twilight series I was worried my fears were true. Yet, the movie surprised me and was actually quite good.The characters were portrayed well. Christoph Waltz plays an excellent greedy, jealous husband. He does an excellent job of making you feel for him at times. You want to help him when he opens his heart to Robert Pattinson. You feel he really can't control his emotions. His rage seems fueled by his love of Marlena. As the story progresses you realize how cruel he is. Robert Pattinson portrays the handsome farm boy superbly. He provides the action for the gentlemen and the flair for the ladies. Water for Elephants pleases all audiences.</fullReview>

The book was lacking emotion for me and some of the characters weren't defined and clearly developed. In the novel there were a few parts that were just unnecessarily sexual and totally out of context, I'm glad they didn't make it to the movie. The film shows the art of casting for the role. Christopher Waltz was cast perfect for the role of August! Of course Pattinson and Whitterspoon are a sweet pair but what makes this movie grand is the setting, the era it all plays in and the true art of film making?the book I found bland, was turned over into something amazingly beautiful and definitely worth seeing. I hope Water for Elephants will cash in a few Oscars, it is that great of a movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Film of 2011 So Far === By a Wide Margin</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was engrossing, charming and just plain wonderful from the first second and never let up. Taking us to another time and place, one we've never seen before, inside a second rate circus during the Depression Era.I usually score 2000 thru 2011 films very low, because all but a very few are overblown, stupid and silly. Thus when we find a gem like this one I'd like to tell everyone, but caution is necessary lest my positive feedback be mistaken for either paid-for input from a studio or drivel from a student who scored a free ticket to an advanced screening. Both these kinds of reviews spoil this site.There's nothing more to say without spoiling the story. We saw this fine movie just the right way, in a real theater, Washington DC's Avalon; not an annoying multiplex. Wherever you go, you ought love it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful surprise of a movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Such a wonderful surprise that the screenplay was able to be translated so beautifully. I expected to be disappointed and saw early reviews that the chemistry between Reese and Robert was serious lacking. Maybe my low expectations helped my experience, but regardless, I was transported back in time and fell in love with all of it.WHile some of the movie deviated from the book, I was most surprised that the story behind the title "Water for Elephants" was not at all addressed. The character in the retirement home who claimed to work for a circus by bringing water for elephants was what infuriated Jacob and sent him into his final depression. Jacob really knew that you don't bring an elephant water in buckets. He knew this and yet no one believed him and combined with his children abandoning him sent him across the street to the circus. I would have liked to have seen this part in the movie.Otherwise, if you want a romance, drama, action and comedy and most of all a peek into a different world altogether, I highly suggest anyone put all expectations aside and go for a beautiful ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pleasant surprise.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The title was Water for Elephants. The film starred Reese Witherspoon and the hunky vampire guy from the Twilight movies. My expectations were of a tepid date-movie with all characters acting stupidly until a sappy conclusion freed me. It is always nice to be pleasantly surprised. Robert Pattinson plays a young man whose Polish immigrant parents are killed leaving him with no relatives or possessions during the Great Depression. The young lad had been just about to graduate from Cornell with a degree in veterinary science. His whole future looked great, but now he finds himself hopping a circus train with nothing more than the clothes on his back, desperate for any kind of job. As luck would have it, this circus is in need of someone with knowledge of treating animals. And rival circus Ringling Bros. doesn't even have a guy with such credentials! What a coincidence that he should jump onto this train! Once we get past this contrivance, the film settles into a nice spot. We get a surprisingly interesting look at a traveling circus from decades past. And this one is run by an angry possessive tyrant played by Christoph Waltz. As I recently had the misfortune of watching Inglourious Basterds, his performance was still fresh in my mind. And it was the only good thing about that disaster. Here he again steals every scene as he brings the young drifter in first as a vet, and later a trainer for an elephant that the troupe acquires from another failed circus. And this circus master has a beautiful wife (Witherspoon) who headlines the big animal acts. Of course she and Pattinson begin to fall for each other setting up a dangerous love triangle. The conclusion isn't difficult to see coming, but you won't mind getting there.The film has its faults, of course. Way too many shots of Pattinson giving doe eyes to the camera. He doesn't give a bad performance, but the production is understandably too concerned about making him look handsome. Too handsome to be believed. But you know his presence alone brought in legions of "Twi-hards" and made this movie somewhat profitable. Also we as the audience are unable to be convinced that the circus owner would take the young drifter so quickly and closely under his wing. Witherspoon is her typical self. Serviceable, but nothing special. The film belongs to Waltz from an acting perspective. He is just scum. His mistreating of the animals is particularly off-putting. He also has his thugs throw anyone the troupe no longer needs off the train. Literally! Much of this is filmed on or near trains, which helps give it a romantic and properly nostalgic feel. Honestly, my wife has made me sit through a lot worse on Sunday nights lately. The Good Wife, Real Housewives of New Jersey... I'll take a film like this any day if she has the remote. 7 of 10 stars.The Hound.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was okay</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Jacob Janikowski (Pattinson) learns his parents' death provided no money within the estate, he leaves and hops a train. What he doesn't know is that it is a circus train. Later he gets hired as the vet to care for the animals and gets involved with August's (Waltz) wife, Marlena (Witherspoon).This starts out much like LITTLE BIG MAN in that 90-yrs old Jacob (Holbrook) tells his story to the owner of another circus and we go back in time to 1931 when Jacob joined the Benzini Circus. Hey, boys and girls, we are going to see a circus movie. Well, almost. We see very few acts from a distance and then briefly. However, everything else is also superficial. We get to see the love triangle, and the Bull Elephant Rosie, the star of the circus. Now, do we care about the love triangle? No. Both Witherspoon and Pattinson are good actors but the chemistry just isn't there as far as I was concerned. I didn't care who got who. This part of the story was most unconvincing. But, one thing for sure: we didn't like the August who abused his animals. Now, did we care about Rosie? Absolutely. Rosie and Christoph Waltz were the winners in here. We just can't wait for Waltz to get into a good guy role, but his reputation may not allow it. He is terrific as a bad guy, and not just a bad guy, but a very calculating bad guy. In here Waltz made you like him and hate him almost at his will. Wow! And, keep this in mind: Waltz was the only one who had any dynamic dialogue throughout. Getting back to Rosie??.if there were more scenes with her, this would have made everything else better. Later we discover that Rosie only understands commands when given in Polish and it is then her star power emerges big time under the big tent (you waited a long time for that line, didn't you?).Oh, we do see a lot of Rosie, but we wanted more. Also, seeing more circus acts would have gone a long way to a better movie, but we got bogged down with sit-down dinners with the three main characters. One would have sufficed. Now, where did the title come from? When Jacob meets the owner who is considering hiring him, one of the roustabouts mentions that he (Jacob) can be used to carry water for the elephants and he finishes his thought with, "??but we don't have any elephants " and they all laugh around the card table. Now, align that with the story you will see. To help you out: circuses are commonly known for having elephants. All in all not bad, the acting was good all around, and there are some good lines throughout, but it could have used more scenes with circus acts, more scenes with Rosie, and the love triangle was most unconvincing as shown. However, at the end, when 90-yr old Jacob talks about Marlena, it is then when you feel the deep love between both. Only then. Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: Yes Some pictures in a book with a Shakespeare cover. Language: No.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't read the book but this makes little difference to me as I always try to judge a film/adaptation on its own terms. Coming from someone who is somewhat indifferent to Robert Pattinson and the Twilight Saga and reading the controversy surrounding it I was really pleasantly surprised by this movie. It may move slowly at times and I think more could've been done with the ending. However, it is a visually spectacular film, the scenery and costumes are gorgeous and the cinematography exquisite. The music sparkles too, the story and script are both believable, the circus scenes are vivid and the animals(I agree 100% about Rosie) are very cute. The direction is assured as well, while the performances are excellent. This is the best I've seen Robert Pattinson act, Reese Witherspoon is quite touching and her chemistry with Pattinson is to be commended while Christolph Waltz is brilliant as the antagonist. All in all, a surprisingly good film. 8/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Probably a good book made into a good movie! "Water for Elephants" is a solid movie. The movie has a strong story about an abusive Circus owner, both to the animals and staff, and a love story. The character development creates a strong story of a woman who must choose between a evil husband and a caring man. The movie is splendidly performed, with Waltz being another evil character, and Pattinson as the decent man. Pattinson is becoming a better actor with each movie. His role is about being a caring, decent character like most of his movies. Is he starting to be type-casted in this type of role? The directing is excellent with a fast paced movie with a strong conclusion. I would give Water for elephants a eight out of ten.</fullReview>

The film does not rely on this, it is intertwined with so many other issues, it truly is moving.Brilliant acted, Robert Pattinson's performance is incredibly understated. I think it's a true shame he is followed by the Twilight fame because his acting choices are bold and original.Reese Witherspoon proving herself to be truly adaptable to any role she plays shines in this also.As well as Christopher Waltz being terrifyingly believable as the ring master of the circus.The film is rich in story, beautifully filmed with stunning costumes and vivid colours.It's been a while since I've been truly moved by a film and would highly recommend this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Water For Elephants" is Hollywood at the top of its game. I haven't read the novel by Sara Gruen, but after watching this two hour long spectacle, I will take time to read it soon.There is not one fault that I can find with the film. From the opening scenes to the closing credits, it had me hooked with its tale of loss, hardship, camaraderie, greed, hope, tragedy and ultimately love.The acting by all concerned, particularly the leads, is exceptional with some Oscar worthy performances here. For any doubters, Robert Pattinson proves his worth admirably and Christoph Waltz will have truly established himself as A-list. Reese Witherspoon is very graceful as the centre of the attention of the two men.The costumes and the sets are appropriate for the period and the cinematography is beautiful, making you feel like you are there amongst the magic and chaos of the circus in 1931.The array of performers, and the animals too, take centre stage from time to time, bringing light relief in some scenes and stirring more heart rending emotions in others.The film does not shy away from the problems of the Great Depression and the suffering of the many so that the few can profit.Overall, "Water For Elephants" harks back to a Golden Age of Hollywood when films stayed in your thoughts and emotions long after you left the cinema. This is a very worthwhile effort indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>August is at once compelling and repulsive and Waltz captivates in every one of his scenes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An elderly man named Jacob (Hal Holbrook) stands in the rain, outside a modern day circus. When he's brought inside the office of Charlie (Paul Schneider) he recalls how he was once part of the Benzini Brothers circus company. Charlie urges him to talk about his experiences, remembering the magnitude of the company's disaster. As a younger man (Robert Pattinson), Jacob attends college during The Great Depression. However, just as he is about to take his final exam he is told that both his parents have been killed in a car accident. He loses his house too and with nothing to his name he follows a train line and boards a carriage. The crew belongs to the Benzini Brothers circus. They're initially hostile but they offer him a job shovelling horse manure. Walking into a tent one day, Jacob witnesses the beauty of Marlena (Reese Witherspoon), a horse tamer. He learns that she is also the wife of the head of the circus, August (Christoph Waltz). When he finally meets August his gift for animals is recognised and he's given the task of working with Marlena on a new act involving an elephant. This handsome adaptation of Sara Gruen's bestselling novel is somewhat of a relic. It has the look and feel of a classic Hollywood studio picture. And that's a compliment because it's lavishly photographed by director Francis Lawrence and his cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto (a regular collaborator of Alejandro González I?árritu). They've striven not for effects of realism or authenticity but to create beautiful painterly-like images of a forgone era. The set pieces here are constructed and orchestrated with specified, controlled movements, like a moving artwork. The alignment of the men as they haul back the ropes of the tent poles, the night sky on top of the moving train and the grace of Marlena as she gestures for her horse to fall slowly to the ground, are images of a dream-like quality. This is of course in correspondence with August's belief that life is an illusion. We're mesmerised by the visuals but beneath the gloss are intentionally dark undertones, drawn from the film's intriguing context. Setting the film in the 1930s, just prior to the rise of fascism, is significant as it contextualises a number of ominous Darwinian references. August treats his workers and his animals as one: with contempt. Rumours circulate the circus that he's thrown workers off trains so that he won't have to pay them. It forces Jacob to hide a wounded worker so that he won't be murdered. August is equally barbaric to the animals too, jabbing an elephant to make it walk, asserting his master role. August is at once compelling and repulsive and Waltz captivates in every one of his scenes. He's as charismatic, charming and sinister as he was in Inglourious Basterds. He's so precise in shifting between welcoming and dangerous that he could have invented the phrase 'keep your friends close and your enemies closer'. But the efforts to soften his character are also intriguing and rounding. Moments of impulsive violence and rage are contrasted with regret, as he remembers how conditional his relationship with Marlena is. He's a deeply flawed being but even she admits that he does provide her with a life of some kind. They need each other and thus it adds some needed complexity to their relationship. Witherspoon is just radiant in this film, with the look of a classic Hollywood starlet. The way she smiles when performing reminds us of the facade, the illusion of show business. By contrast, Pattinson brings little to his performance. He seems to have a lot less dialogue than Waltz and as such is given less to emotionally work with. He can't muster the same levels of charisma but its less significant here because there is already such a strong male performance. It's a shame that the film also ends in a more conventional, melodramatic and surprisingly violent fashion than what the rest of the film sets up for. And the bookends veer on corny, merely framing the narrative structure rather than contributing substantially to the plot. A fairly minor complaint though because it's a surprisingly rich film, as much as a spectacle. As with the film's deliberately sinister edges, there's a lot more happening underneath the curtain, thoroughly compensates for any missteps.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Its missing a HUGE piece of authenticity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had to go online to look at the reviews about this film as I wanted to know the end as I couldn't sit through it to the final act. Robert Patterson cannot act, couldn't in Twilight and his is as wooden in this film. His acting is support by Chris Waltz who is good and Reese Witherspoon. This film could have been good, so much better. There is a HUGE lack of authenticity, I mean Robert's character Jacob was supposed to have been a vet and you hardly saw any hint of it, he spends a lot of the time looking downwards, pensive and brooding, just like Twilight?!?! When he says "your a beautiful women and deserve a beautiful life" he looks like he's gotten a couple of gobstoppers in his pouting mouth! I cant comment on the ending as I got so bored and frustrated with the lack of believing in the story although I knew somewhere in there there was one! Its funny reading other reviews and my conclusion is..you either love it or hate it and I am afraid I am with the latter. With another 'Jacob' I think it would have been better</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>disappointing, depressing, unbelievable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved Reese Witherspoon in the Legal, movies but when she delivered her first line in this movie I almost burst out laughing.We are supposed to believe that this is a fourth or fifth rate circus which does not even have one elephant let alone enough to have a single employee to water them. A circus that has such hard times that they have to throw roust-abouts off the moving train at regular intervals because they can not afford to pay them yet they have 30 or 40 "show girls" whose function and acts are never really quite explained.However people are thrown off the train if they irritate in some way the circus owner (who by the way was the best thing about this movie.) Reese and Robert were really pathetic in comparison. He is quite good looking though.Oh, I forgot. This is the height of prohibition and all the other characters have I guess the equivalent of bath tub gin, but August and Mariana have an endless supply of bottles of champagne. Unbelievable. Also why at the beginning could the authorities not wait an hour or two to inform Jacob of the death of his parents? Would they be any more dead then? They effectively ruined whatever chance at a life he had at that point.Why did no one tell the new owner that Rosie understood only Polish? Why did the renegade roust abouts release all the animals from the cages? Wouldn't that do a lot more harm to the innocent circus attendees than August? True it would ruin the circus, which they all were dependent on but the impact on the town could have been much greater. Why couldn't they just wait for the right moment and toss August from the train?I have been hearing about this book for years and will definitely not read it now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i loved the book &amp; i loved the movie, &amp; will go see it a few more times, taking many friends with me. YES, it's that good!!! When one goes to the movie made from the book one loves, it's always with a bit of trepidation, knowing how things can turn out. KUDOS to Richard LaGravenese for writing an excellent screenplay from Sara Gruen's excellent novel! We were pleasantly surprised how well they included all of the most important points of Depression Era Circus life (and the story line), and happy that it was PG-13, and not the R of the book (which means we can take a larger variety of folks to the movie.) Each of the actors was excellent, capturing the true feeling of the characters in the book.Loved the animals, tho we missed the Yak at the end of the story..... and Tai was a FABULOUS Rosie!!! i am POSITIVE that the reviewers who have been giving this excellent movie bad reviews have NOT read the book in it's entirety, or are just Bah-Humbugs when it comes to giving a terrific movie a look-see with OPEN EYES. i was so very anxious to see it for myself so i would know the TRUTH about the movie!!! Anyone who has read and loved the book will love this movie. Anyone who has been to a circus, or knows the history of the circus life over the generations, will greatly appreciate Water For Elephants.WELL DONE, ALL of the cast and crew!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Elephants Never Forget</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although his last "Twilight" movie hasn't even been released yet, Robert Pattinson is already struggling to forge a new screen persona for himself. Last year's "Remember Me" emerged as an abysmal failure for Pattinson, not to mention a shamelessly exploitative account of the 9/11 tragedy. Now, Pattinson is pairing up with Reese Witherspoon in "I Am Legend" director Francis Lawrence's "Water for Elephants" and it fares no better than "Remember Me." This glum, gritty 1930s' melodrama unfolds within the confines of a threadbare Depression-era traveling circus during Prohibition. The unsavory plot concerns animal cruelty, marital infidelity, and cold-blooded murder. The soiled romance between Pattinson and Witherspoon as illicit lovers generates minimal sizzle. Despite its evocative production values and historically-laden atmosphere, "Water for Elephants" qualifies as a creative misfire and this sour saga will leave a bad taste in your mouth.Disaster couldn't occur at a worse time for a Cornell University veterinary student, Jacob Jankowski (Robert Pattinson of "Vanity Fair"), as he is poised to take his final exam, graduate, and embark on a new life. Jacob has enjoyed a carefree, poverty-free life and his parents love him dearly. Without warning, the authorities inform our hero that his folks have died in an automobile accident. Worse, Jacob's parents were up to their eyeballs in debt. Actually, Jacob's father had taken out a loan to put him through college. Further, he had been a compassionate veterinarian who accepted food in lieu of cash as payment for bills from his clients. An incredulous Jacob emerges badly shaken by these revelations with little more than a suitcase that he disposes of almost immediately when he launches himself on his travels. He climbs aboard a train one evening and finds himself stowing away with a circus. Jacob winds up sweating and shoveling manure for his keep.Later, he meets Marlena (Oscar-winning actress Reese Witherspoon of "Vanity Fair") who is the resident platinum-blond equestrian beauty with her celebrated white stallion. Not only is she the star attraction under the big top, but she is also married to the man who runs the circus. August Rosenbluth (Christoph Waltz of "The Green Hornet") is the ringmaster and middle-aged owner of the Benzini Brothers Circus. He has spent his entire life in sawdust and knows all the tricks of the trade. When Marlena's horse goes lame, August shows an interest in Jacob for his obviously useful background in veterinary medicine. He invites Jacob to inspect Marlena's injured horse. She believes that her horse will recover, and August quietly convinces Jacob to agree with her. Reluctantly, behind Marlena's back, Jacob confides in August that the horse should be euthanized.The economically minded August doesn't want to shoot the horse that has made him a fortune. Instead, he wants to string the poor animal along until it can do nothing else than die. Later, Jacob intercedes on behalf of the steed and puts it out of its misery with a bullet to the head. Naturally, August is not happy. August's muscle-bound thugs tackle Jacob in a moving railroad box-car and threaten to hurl him off the speeding train. August explains that this practice is known as 'red lighting' and the victim usually dies a horrible death. Later, a couple of sympathetic characters meet their ill-fated fortune this way. August has second thoughts about Jacob and grants our protagonist clemency. Befriending Jacob, August takes him into his close circle of friends, eventually narrowing it down to his wife and himself.Meanwhile, August has bought an elephant named Rosie from a rival outfit. He gives Jacob custody of the beast. Now, rather than straddle a horse, Marlena will ride atop a 9,000-pound pachyderm. Of course, nothing goes well from the beginning. Rosie becomes hysterical and nearly stomps on the spectators before she rampages out of the tent. Jacob and his roustabout friend, Camel (Jim Norton of "Straw Dogs"), find the elephant in town feeding at a outdoor market. August goes berserk and beats the animal with an iron prod. Miraculously, the beast recovers and becomes a profitable part of the circus, attracting crowds. Inevitably, through no design of their own, Marlena and Jacob are drawn together, and they fall in love. Mind you, Camel has warned Jacob to keep his eyes off the boss' wife. The incident occurs at a nightclub that the police raid for selling contraband alcohol when August steps out. Marlena and Jacob elude the authorities, but arouse August's suspicions. Later, they run away from the circus, but August tracks them down. His thugs beat Jacob within an inch of his life. Jacob sneaks back to the circus with revenge on his mind. He slips into August's tent and poises a knife against the nape of an unconscious ringmaster's neck but he cannot summon the courage to kill him.You know a movie is in trouble when the most interesting character is a thoroughly loathsome villain who is justified in some of his actions. Oscar-winning actor Christoph Waltz marvelously portrays August Rosenbluth as a such sadistic dastard that you will cheer when he receives his comeuppance. Meanwhile, Pattinson and Witherspoon try to enliven characters who are not only wimps but also lack charisma. It is difficult to root for both the hero and heroine when they are such losers from the start. Adding to the woes of this terrible movie is the fact that it is wrapped around a tedious flashback so you know that nothing disastrous can occur to the protagonist since he has survived all the perils. Mercifully, "Bridges of Madison County" scribe Richard LaGravenese has synthesized various characters and incidents from Sara Gruen's New York Times best seller. Nevertheless, humorously lumbering along like a elephant for two hours, "Water for Elephants" wears out its welcome quickly. This is truly a 3-ring snore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Water for elephants</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have no intention of seeing this film at any time, as I have seen the footage reported in the UK of the cruelty used by the trainers with electric shock probes and bull-hooks to train the elephant used in this film,(and others, including a baby). Training them to do feats which are not natural for an elephant to perform by shocking them. The elephants can be heard screaming in pain when they are shocked, even though the under-cover film is interspersed with comments from the studio that, 'no cruelty was used - they are not abused animals - only rewards and kindness are used to train them'. The baby has a bull-hook used against the roof of its mouth just to teach it to stand up straight, it also cries out with pain when it is done. Disgusting people, including the stars who agree to make money from such a thing.I am also informing as many people as I can of the access available to the undercover film, so that they too can watch it and come to their own conclusion as to whether to watch this film or not. The 'stars' in this film should be requested to donate their massive fees to animal cruelty or elephant welfare charities. I will assume that this will not be posted on here, if the site is not interested in animal welfare. I await your verdict.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**** May contain strong spoilers ****This is a review made by StoneDraim... and that means that if you want to read a probably different kind of review, keep reading....This is my personal experience, my personal point of view/perspective and my personal opinion... and my opinion is just one of like 7 billions in this world.Just the innocent music and harmony of the beginning shows that this will have something to tell in a good way. Getting a little feeling of both Titanic and Big Fish, and that in a good way. An old man telling his lifes story, and that lifes story is really something else, as of in Big Fish. The novel by Sara Gruen that gives this motion picture its story has been treated in a noble way, indeed.Fascinated in seeing how the circus went on long time ago. Just seeing how those men with those sledgehammers made magic by hitting the poles into the ground quickly were entertaining, so as raising the tent. And; "First time I've seen so much manure!" Seeing all those wild animals raises the social topic about animals as entertainment at circuses; it is probably very good that the circuses is changing and that the animals keeps on being animals in the wild.To get a higher rate, the whole production and the story should have been worked on harder and been more tweaked. Now it "only" stops as a warm and cozy little flick amongst others. It could have been great, if the actors had been pushed a lot further. An "easy- going" emotion runs through "Water for elephants", and the real "feel-good" thing is sadly missed. And still; a little cozy circus spectacle.Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Amazing camera work and lighting. Just the production and timing to get that long one take inside the train is magnificent! (watch about 23 minutes into the movie). The sound gives entertaining and the music keeps this little palatable picture the framework it deserves. Special effects has gotten good attention, so that they fit both the story and the feeling of the whole film. - The actors : Christoph Waltz winning prize for best supporting actor; he is nailing this one! Just hearing his voice deliver the lines with his articulate charisma is... oh, I love that! I could listen and see him for hours! All the rest is below his special talent. Robert Pattinson is, sadly, giving this motion picture a bad feeling. I want somebody to squeeze the acting out of him, if he got acting within him... I doubt that myself. Same smile every time, same behaviour everywhere. His "youthanized" humility seems... highly overrated. With a more hefty ensemble of actors and director, this one could have scored big time. - Entertainment : Circus. Love. A story telling old man. Can that be anything? Yes, it can. - Age : 116,1 out of 10. (The final rate is based most on my own entertainment of the movie. Short elucidation of the rating: 7 Well made movie. Proper entertainment. 6 Nice production. Good movie.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Water for Elephants</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love Christoph Waltz, I mean, I truly love him doing his craft. I loved him through all his German television shows that I used to endure, I loved him through the broken subtitled movies I used to watch in seven-minute increments on YouTube, I loved him through the horrible campy bit parts he used to get; the ones where I'd have to watch a whole movie to see him for 6 minutes. What I'm getting at, is: I loved him before he made it big in America in Quentin Tarantino's 2009 WWII re-imagination, Inglourious Basterds. That 2009 breakthrough was especially fun for me because I also love Quentin Tarantino, so the powers that be in cinema land really smiled upon me with that pairing. The moral of the story is that I see everything Christoph Waltz acts in, as frustratingly underwhelming as that may be, sometimes. In 2011, my love for all things Christoph brought me to Francis Lawrence's feature also starring Reese Witherspoon and Robert Pattinson, Water for Elephants. In a prominent role for Christoph, playing the ringmaster in a traveling circus in 1931, Water for Elephants exposes the struggles of a young man who lost his parents in the midst of the Great Depression. Exposing how important a sense of belonging is to those who wonder the world alone, Water for Elephants is an expose in the aspects of the human psyche we often avoid. Jacob Jankowski (Robert Pattinson) has his life planned out. He is one final exam away from finishing his veterinary science degree at Cornell University, he is the object of affection from a beautifully smitten girl in his class, and he has dreams of grandeur to become a veterinarian like his father who immigrated to the United States and instilled in his son that your dreams can come true if you have enough sense to see them through. All of Jacob's perfectly thought out plans disintegrate when he finds himself homeless after a car accident claims the lives of both of his parents. Lost, with nowhere to go, Jacob hops on board a train traveling in the night. Unbeknownst to him, Jacob has climbed aboard a traveling circus train of the Benzini Bros. After meeting a few circus hands who help get him temporary work, Jacob is introduced to August (Christoph Waltz), the circus ringleader, to see if he can stay on employ permanently with the circus. After a tense meeting with August, when he realizes Jacob has an ivy league veterinary education, August names Jacob the circus vet. While checking in on the animals, Jacob meets Marlena (Reese Witherspoon) the beautiful horse-riding main attraction, and wife of August. Instantly smitten by her beauty, Marlena and Jacob find ways to spend more and more time together, which does not fly under August's radar. Marlena takes several beatings at the hands of August, which do not diminish when he sees she and Jacob spending so much time together. Jacob attempts to persuade Marlena to run away from the circus with him and start a life together, but can she leave the man that took her from the shop corner and brought her under the lights of the big top?I love a film told in flashback. Water for Elephants opens with a seasoned man visiting circus grounds disappointed to learn that he missed the show. The man then goes into the office while circus hands work to find a number for his caretaker and alert them that he is on the grounds. Meanwhile, the man goes on to describe his experiences of circus life, captivating the circus owner. I found this a great way to tell the story for this movie. There were loads of wonderful Christoph Waltz moments, but nothing tops that entrance! Seeing him in shadow only while his voice booms to the audience under the big top was a brilliant way to show how commanding and domineering he was in the film. You can see in Water for Elephants, however, his first film after Inglourious Basterds, his second American film, that he is already being type-casted, which is a true shame for the amazing versatile actor. Pattinson was much better than expected; having never seen him in any films, I wasn't sure what to expect. Witherspoon was alright, I never really care for her acting style, and it didn't help that I didn't buy her relationship with August; something about their pairing came off incredibly fake. Water for Elephants was a beautifully shot film with great images of animals all throughout, filled with a fantastic score and an Austrian actor that completely stole the show.</fullReview>

Instead I got a soppy adulterous "romance" and a sadistic husband and cruelty to animals. If you enjoy any of these... go for it. For me ... give me what is now thought of as corny "The Greatest Show on Earth" or even "Trapeze". The non-English Speaking elephant was one of the most interesting characters .. the actors tried but they were not appealing at all. It's not that the actors gave poor performances, it was that the characters were just not for me. Will not watch this one again and I am a big re-viewer !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Water for Elephants (2011): Dir: Francis Lawrence / Cast: Robert Pattinson, Reese Witherspoon, Christoph Waltz, Hal Holbrook, James Frain: The title is a reference to the calm after the storm. Taking us back to 1931 with narration by the aged hero with regards the the tragedy that unfolds. Hal Holbrook appears at the end of a circus performance. He left a home and tells of his life at the circus that brought romance, adventure and ultimately tragedy. His younger self is played by Robert Pattinson, whose parents die in a car accident while he was in college. With the bank seizing his home, he ends up aboard a train which is the circus travelling to another location. The ringmaster is a foul tempered man who abuses the animals and people alike. His wife is Marlena, the star attraction with a white horse is cut short when it suffers a bad hoof. Pattinson puts it down and nearly gets thrown from the train until the ringmaster brings in a new star attraction, an elephant. Directed by Francis Lawrence who previously made Constantine and I Am Legend. Pattinson holds strong in his willingness to protect others from the abuse of the ringmaster. Reese Witherspoon as Marlena is the star attraction whose act with a horse is replaced with Rosie the elephant. Christoph Waltz plays off the rage of the ringmaster who desires riches at any extent, but can see, as can we, Marlena's interest in Pattinson. Holbrook is the narrator who puts it in perspective. James Frain plays the elephant's caretaker, which is a step down for him in terms of career goals. Stunning production of the illusion and wonderment of the circus life. Score: 8 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw this movie, and while the costumes and environment is really nice, the movie is horrible.The acting is satisfactory, and the costumes, so how can i say its horrible. The fault in this movie or what i have particular problems with is the plot: Young handsome highly educated man nestles in and marries the acrobatic prostitute of the circus boss, because the boss is this evil man. Also to prove that he is really evil he batters a poor non-English-speaking elephant almost to death and also went on a killing spree on his employees. The boss runs amok defending his prostitute but dies by his own karmic actions. The young handsome highly educated man and his prostitute live happy forever after with kids, elephants dogs an all the other animals that survived from the circus.I have seen this plot before and it is boring. Its fake, like a Chinese Gucci bag, or better yet the Chinese Paris ghost town with their own eifeltower, it screams of fake. This could have been a wonderful movie in 1980ies when i was a child, but 2011? No.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Directed by Francis Lawrence, and adapted from a Sara Gruen novel of the same name, "Water for Elephants" stars Robert Pattinson as Jacob, a young man who joins a travelling circus at the height of the Great Depression. This circus is run by August Rosenbluth, played by the magnificent Christoph Waltz. Along the way our hero falls in love with Marlena (Reese Witherspoon), the circus' star attraction.Go in with low expectations, and "Elephants" is a fine film. Lawrence captures well the camaraderie of circus life, the cruelty of the times, and the giddy mix of magic and awe which such travelling road-shows oft imparted upon wide-eyed patrons. "Elephants" may collapse into clichés, and it may be bookended by overly saccharine sequences, but considering its genre, it does well. Outside of Fellini (who repeatedly used the "circus" as a metaphor for "life"), Tod Browning's "Freaks", Chaplin's "The Circus", the Marx brothers' "At the Circus" and Lynch's sappy "Elephant Man", there aren't many good films about life under the tents. With fine production design by Jack Fisk.8/10 ? Worth one viewing. See "Elmer Gantry".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fresh new take on the concept yet it lacks a bit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is in overall just another cliché of a hero's tale, saving the girl in distress and vanquishing the evil man. But the touch of inserting the animals and circus elements are very nice. Those give the old classic story concept a fresh new take to see. The background story elaboration feels nice yet it takes a bit too long for me. One problem for me is that the elephant, which is specifically mentioned in the title, appears quite late in the movie. Also the movie feels like it lacks a bit in depicting the connection to the actual title. It's because there's only one elephant seen on the entire movie, and there's just a few scenes really involving the elephant and water. The elephant and water don't even get mentioned in the same sentence anywhere in the dialog. The acting looks decently okay for me. Robert Pattinson can really handle the age and experience gap in his performance here. I remember when he was only Cedric Diggory while Reese Witherspoon had already done Legally Blonde. Reese Witherspoon did quite okay here providing the romance angle for the story. Christoph Waltz performed just like how we would expect from him, although I'd say that this here is not his best acting job.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Water For Elephants is a throwback to the 1930s era</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I was watching this last night on TV and well here is my review on it.Water For Elephants is a 2011 Romantic Drama starring Robert Pattinson and Reese Witherspoon. It tells the tale of this young man named Jacob(Twilight's Robert Pattinson) who's parents die and he is a young vet at the Circus where he helps animals that are sick or injured. But he later meets the beautiful Marlene(played by Walk The Line's Reese Witherspoon) and falls in love with her. But there is a problem as she is married to an evil brute (played by Inglorious Bastards Christoph Waltz)who is so rough with his animals he even attacks an elephant called Rosie and even a horse had to be put down. But as Marlene and Jacob's relationship grows closer and closer will Marlene ever leave her brute of a husband for Jacob?? The story to this was great and the setting was really nice as its a throwback to the 1930s era. The costumes were nice and the acting was great. I was a fan of Reese Witherspoon for a very long time and Robert Pattinson surprisingly very good in this movie as Jacob the handsome young vet who falls for Witherspoon's character. The relationship between the two was great too and you feel sorry for them especially Witherspoon's charcther marrying an evil brute who owns the circus.Overall its a 7/10 and if its on TV again i'll definitely be watching it again or if I find the DVD of it I will buy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Water for Elephants was a great movie, better than the book in my opinion. It had much less sexual contact and portrayed the relationship between Jacob and Marlena very well. Having Jacob talk to the circus director and telling the story that way was very creative and a great change to the movie. It also focused on Rosie, which I believe the book didn't cover very much. It was in general a great movie with good changes from the book; however I believe the ending scenes were much better in the book. Jacob and Marlena jumping off the train together to attempt to live a better life, then Jacob sneaking back on the train was romantic, but strange in the story line. As Jacob and Marlena were not expressed deeply to be very romantic to each other as much as the book, a more romantic scene is out of place. Walter is also a more of a major character in the book, and is barely scene in the movie. Walter somehow turns from a disgruntled dwarf to Jacob's friend in less than a night with nothing to show for it. Other than those few complaints, Water for Elephants was a great movie and I recommend everyone to see it at least once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life in the circus during the 30s...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...that's a good way of summing-up 2011's "Water for Elephants" in less than a sentence. Robert Pattinson (the vampire dude from the Twilight films) stars as college kid who is forced to drop out when his parents unexpectedly perish. It's the depression and there aren't many job opportunities so he joins a traveling circus and ends up being their vet, which is what he was studying in school. He slowly develops a friendship with the main showgirl, played by Reese Witherspoon, who's the wife of the circus owner and ringmaster, played by Christoph Waltz.I love films that involve circuses and carnivals, but -- surprisingly -- there aren't that many and, when there are, the circus is usually just a fairly minor side plot. This isn't the case with "Water for Elephants" as the circus IS the environment throughout.One thing that prevented me from seeing "Water for Elephants" sooner is that it was advertised as a romance (look at the DVD cover), but it's so much more. The best movies mix genres and this is the case with this film. It's really an adventure-drama with elements of romance.The film reminded me of DC's The Shadow comics from the 70s. Issue number 2 from 1973 dealt with a depression-era circus and was drawn by the outstanding Mike Kaluta. This comic had an impact on me growing up; the other Shadow comics did too, but this one in particular. "Water for Elephants" captures the awesome feel of this comic, despite the absence of The Shadow.This is a great film and now ranks with my all-time favorites. It puts you into the world of the depression-era circus. Don't let the fact that it was pigeonholed as a romance keep you from seeing it. It's way more than that.The film was shot in Eastern Tennessee and runs about 2 hours.GRADE: A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Water For Elephants Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Water For Elephants is the story of an elder man reflecting on his life during the Great Depression, and how he joined the most famous, yet disastrous carnival ever. Sounds like an awesome movie, right? Not quite.Francis Lawrence has made two major films, one being Constantine and the other I Am Legend. So I thought Water for Elephants would be out of Lawrence's league, but I was wrong. Francis Lawrence did a great job, nothing special, but he was able to keep things moving and entertaining. The problem is Robert Pattinson. No offense to him, but every film I have seen him in he has shown that is range of emotion is the same in every movie. When he gets sad, he squints his face really hard, when he gets angry he widens his eyes and bits his teeth. Finally, when he delivers his dialogue its in the same soft whisper tone every time. I wish there would have been more for Hal Holbrook to do, who plays the older version of Pattinson, but all of his scenes fall short, due to actors around him, and the way his scenes were edited together. I have no problem with Reese Witherspoon, she is stunningly beautiful, and she can act. But in this film all of her lines came out with the same melodramatic, soap operaish feel that Robert Pattinson has. Thank God for Christoph Waltz, who's acting single-handedly stole the film. Waltz, listens to the actors saying their dialogue, and then reacts, he does not force, he lets things come natural. Another great add to the cast was Rosie, the genius elephant. Every time she was on screen, I was mesmerized.The film was shot beautifully, and has moments that I genuinely enjoyed. But the two leads just seemed to bored with the script to care. I give Water For Elephants 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No chemistry with Witherspoon and Pattinson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An old Jacob Jankowski (Robert Pattinson) recounts his life in the Benzini Circus and remembers the infamous disaster in 1931. Jacob was studying veterinary medicine when his parents die in a car accident and he loses everything. He literally runs away to the circus, and becomes entangled in a love triangle with the volatile owner August (Christoph Waltz) and his wife/lead attraction Marlena (Reese Witherspoon).The circus storyline is fascinating. It can get deeply disturbing. Waltz has the intimidating persona locked down. The only missing element is the chemistry between Witherspoon and Pattinson. The love triangle is a melodrama to begin with. With such limited chemistry, it really degrades the movie at its center. At least the movie around the center is great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An average historical romantic drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So Robert Pattinson actually can act? Apparently! Well, a little, at least. He's pretty much on par with Reese Witherspoon in this historical drama. The story is about a young guy who's got some trouble with The Great Depression and falls in love with a circus director's young wife.The film isn't very sad, it's not very funny, it's not surprising at all, but it doesn't fail very badly either. All in all it's average.People seem concerned about the animal abuse this film portrays. I say, get a grip. Sure animal cruelty is a thing, and this film helps raise awareness. Obviously they didn't actually hurt an animal in the making of this movie. Actually I had to cringe a little when the characters in the film take Christoph Waltz's cruelty towards a circus elephant as a sign of his absolute wickedness - in a film set in the 1930's, when animals had no more rights than women or ethnic minorities!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit after reading the book i was mesmerized by the whole story and couldn't wait to see the film. Just like the book the film was elegant, sophisticated and very well written. After seeing Robert act in the twilight films i was cautious as to how he was going to portray Jacob but his acting was superb and i really believed his love for both Marlena and Rosie. Christoph Waltz was exactly how i pictured August and i think he played the part perfectly.There was some parts of the book that i felt were brushed aside in the film. For example the minor friendships between Jacob and other performers as well as the extra information about August's past. However, i think this is probably reasonable as not everything can be included in the film. Overall, i think you'd be missing out if you didn't watch the film or read the book. It has to be one of the best films i have ever seen!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like Running Away</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone with a sense of adventure ever wishing to run away and join a circus will appreciate "Water For Elephants". Early on the hero jumps a train and throughout felt like I was along for the ride. I went into the journey not being prejudiced by the book, which I now know the film does justice.Details of circus life during the great depression seemed so believable I later searched to discover whether a "Benzini Brothers" circus ever existed. The answer is no, but the events are a composite of real happenings. I did not have to investigate to know mistreatment of animals depicted in that era wasn't exaggerated. At risk of spoiling am compelled to acknowledge a predictable plot device I typically spot fooled me. It is a credit to the movie I was so engrossed didn't realize an unlikeable supporting character wouldn't be all bad. Call me a rube.It isn't a perfect film as I knew by mixed reviews it wouldn't be. They can't all be gems and I still came away satisfied it wasn't wasted time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, this is a visual spectacle. A depression era circus, complete with a steam train, tents, animals, performers, audiences, a speak easy and towns is spread out before you in crisp detail with a cast of thousands. It is all so real, you forget this takes megabucks of movie magic.It is the story of August (played by Christopher Waltz), the owner of a second rate circus, a tyrant, a control freak. He forces everyone around him into abject submission, even animals. He treats his wife as a trophy or toy to show off. He is a sadist as well. He enjoys toying with people as if there were puppets. It is very much absolute power corrupts absolutely.The basic plot is August commits cruel deeds, abuse of power or sadism both the the people around him and to Rosie the elephant. The movie foreshadows some dreadful revenge will happen to him. This tension builds and builds and builds. I found myself eager for this event to happen, perhaps a fire, perhaps being torn apart by lions, perhaps having his head squashed like a watermelon. What actually happens is not nearly as gruesome as my imagination demanded. I am told the book was watered down for this scene.Robert Pattinson as Jacob is eye candy. He is so pleasing to look at. His perfect posture projects wholesomeness, kindness, old fashioned virtue, and a slightly quirky uniqueness.The only time I noticed the special effects was in the escaped animals scene. All the other times it looked like Reese Witherspoon, Christopher Waltz and Robert Pattinson were performing their own stunts. I don't know who to give the credit to, actors or CGI technicians.Especially the beginning of the movie captures the desperation of the depression era. You were on your own without any help from anyone. I think people don't like this movie because the world it depicts is so bleak, hundreds of people at the mercy of August, unable to resist. His endless cruelties are pretty depressing. It has a happy ending, but that can't really counter all that misery.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Economic Allegory</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A few times every year I watch a chick flick with my wife, trying to be good husband. I watched this film with my wife last year and to my surprise found out that, overall, this is a decent film about wealth and power in the USA.Robert Pattinson, who is terrible in the Twilight movies (which are, of course extremely terrible), does a decent job here. Wisely, someone trimmed his eyebrows, and Pattinson also manages to project a human affect...if this guy can ever get away from being typecast as dumbass lovesick vampire, he might have a career doing supporting roles in film, or maybe as a co-star in a TV series.Reese Witherspoon is good here, and the early 1930's type make-up has the unexpected effect of making her somewhat bizarre face (actually, it's just the chin) seem quite lovely.And it's nice to see Hal Holbrook getting a little work. It's not the best job he's ever had, but it's better than most of the crap comedies geriatric actors seem to get stuck in.The major dramatic power source, however, is Christopher Waltz, radiating melovolence and pain like a wounded shark. The main thing about this movie is that a writer did some good homework on circuses of the Depression Era, and wrote a good story capitalism, power, poverty, and cruelty.Oh, yes, there is a love story, which was the focus of the marketing. That factor, plus the casting of the 2 romantic leads according to a demographic expectation regarding the tastes of female movie viewers, caused this gritty and harrowing economic allegory to aimed away from a large viewership that might have more fully appreciated it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>hit-and-miss</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Water for Elephants, whatever its merits as a book (I don't know because I haven't read it), is only okay as a film. Although startling, well-staged moments are sprinkled throughout and interesting knowledge about how low-income circuses were run in those days is dispensed liberally and entertainingly both in the dialogue and actions, somehow, the whole thing fails to gather steam. The specialty of the director, Francis Lawrence, is music videos and TV shows, which might explain the spottiness of the finished product.The story, which begins promisingly, is framed by an aged nursing home resident (veteran actor Hal Holbrook) reminiscing about his experiences many decades earlier. In 1931, an impoverished veterinary student (Robert Pattinson, as the younger Holbrook) stumbles upon a hard-scrabble traveling circus, whose unstable manager (Christoph Waltz) hires him to tend to the animals. We are swept into the past through a series of fluid traveling shots that follow Pattinson's journey from home to the road to the circus itself. A love triangle develops involving the manager's wife (Reese Witherspoon) as she works with Pattinson to develop an act with a newly acquired elephant. Witherspoon does some impressive physical stunts with this engaging pachyderm; you can't say she didn't do her homework. But despite many little moments of well-timed action and some excellent supporting performances (Jim Norton as an aging alcoholic crew member who befriends Pattinson, James Frain as a Cockney elephant trainer, to name just two) there is a remoteness to the interactions between the main characters, most fatally an annoyingly persistent lack of chemistry between Pattinson and Witherspoon, even in the lovemaking scenes (which, to be honest, are boringly staged). Waltz, whose volatile character is supposed to surprise and even shock, has nothing to play against.Possible Spoilers in this paragraph: Then there is a makeup problem. For a film that is set in the grit of a low-income rough-and-tumble milieu during the Depression, the extras (circus workers and patrons) all seem to have had extensive cosmetic dentistry a la Beverly Hills in the 21st century. The type of people depicted in this drama simply didn't have such teeth, yet no attempt was made even to yellow them a bit. It adds to the stilted artificiality of the film as a whole. Another gaffe: Witherspoon gets a nasty black eye one night and the very next morning the shiner is gone. I could perhaps have accepted the sudden transformation if a brief scene of her assiduously applying makeup had been inserted. But no. And the pristine morning-after face is presented to us in lingering close-up to ensure our incredulity!The climax continues the film's schizophrenic course (good elements used poorly).Finally, due to the fact that there is no real drama (outside of the string of heartbreaking subplots of abused animals), our minds wander to such matters as chins (both Waltz and Witherspoon have long, pointy chins) and eyes (both Pattinson and Witherspoon have widely spaced eyes).</fullReview>

I think that maybe R-Patz got a bad shake down but all in all i think it is a great little movie that has many elements in it for everyone.... People need to get passed what people "HAVE" done and get on to what they are doing....I cannot believe that this movie is over looked by so many i personally cannot see why, I judge a movie on what it is not who is in it....Romantic drama? No i think this was an entertaining movie/ story, I really hope that people see what i see in this and start to see good in things and go into stuff with an open mind. I have seen rob's other stuff and this is probably my favorite part he has done ( yes even eddy) I think he is a great actor and deserves to be in the spotlight, i have seen so many horrible movies recently that this one actually stands apart from them as a Great 1 and i will actually boost my rating from 7 to 8...Reese W. is as well great in this movie although to be real she is great in just about everything that she does, but in this she is just WONDERFUL. So in conclusion Everyone GO SEE THIS MOVIE NOW it is a must see!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is always good when a critic or audience member is surprised by a film that does not look appealing but it turns out to be as this film is a case of. I thought Water for Elephants was going to be a lame ripoff of Twilight or some stupid romance story. But what I got was a dazzling, magical film with an amazing production design. Yes, there is romance in this film but it's not as profound as one would expect.Francis Lawrence's film is about a guy, Jacob who has lost almost everything in the Depression. He boards a train looking for passage/work but he runs into a traveling circus show. There he is hired to be a vet and look after their most prized animal, Rosie the elephant. But, he falls for the wife of the iron-willed circus owner and that could ultimately bring his downfall....The acting was actually not bad. Robert Pattinson is a little less wooden than he was in Twilight. He does not sparkle and shows some emotion. Reese Witherspoon is really good as the wife. But, the real king of the show is Christoph Waltz. He really knows how to play the slimy, bad guy. I just love this guy as an actor.Overall, this is a really good film that will pass as family entertainment. There were some animal brutality scenes which I never like, but it works for the film. This film has a wonderful story, great acting, and very good visuals/production design. I almost thought this film as a fantasy romance which it feels like when you're watching this. I'm glad this is not another Twilight. I rate this film 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The cinematography in this movie is beautiful. It really does a good job of bringing the 1930's back to life. It shows the circus as glamorous and shows how beautiful of an event it once was. When the circus came to town everyone would get dressed in their best and take the whole family to see a magical event. The lighting in this movie was amazing and made important scene more dramatic. The film also did a good job of looking old and the clothing the actors wore really helped as well. The language they used was even how people spoke back in the 1930's. This movie shows the lengths that someone will go to for love and the well being of others. Marlena and Rosie were both victims of August and his abuse and Jacob was there to save them from their dark future. From the first time August beat Rosie for not responding and the first time he saw a mark on Marlena he has always stepped in to stop what is right. He even does it for the others in the show as well. I enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to anyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Beyond the evident concrete beauty of this film, i.e. .the aesthetic value, era-appeal, and all around enchanting yet dark setting, the most awe-inspiring aspect of this production for me was the emotionally charged presence it conveyed. Although in part a love story about two people, the love story between the humans and animals was what was most relevant to the story for it was the mutual love for animals and the tenderness shown by each Pattison's character as well as Witherspoon's character that seem to bring the two together. I really felt a weight of emotion come over me while experiencing scenes involving the animals in particular. I am not sure what it is about the setting, acting, or mystique of the film that caused these severe emotional reactions from me, but for that I believe then that the film was successful capturing such a heavy environment. Although not so subtle or intricate, and the viewer may not find his or herself deeply involved with the characters or plot necessarily, the film still captures a beautiful mystique and therefore still leading you on an emotional journey of a tried and true love story, but from a much more intriguing standpoint.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very well made film with great attention to detail. The cinematography was good, without being particularly spectacular, although I did like the warm feel to the colour palate that was used. As far as performances go, well, the stand-out for me was Christoph Waltz as August; he is really getting some meaty 'bad-guy' parts, and (so far) he's always delivered. Reese Witherspoon did a decent job as Marlena, as did Robert Pattinson as Jacob; it was nice to see him with a little colour in his cheeks! Honourable mentions go to; Paul Schneider as Charlie, Jim Norton as Camel and Hal Holbrook as Old Jacob.This film does suffer a little from cliché and predictability, although I did like the way Christoph Waltz played the character of August. At times you could almost feel sympathy for him before he'd turn it on its head and show his true colours. The romance did get in the way of a decent drama, but then again I guess that's what the paying public wanted. For me, it confirmed that romantic dramas aren't really my thing although it was pretty well made and Christoph Waltz was very good.My Score: 6.9/10IMDb Score: 6.9/10 (based on 37,502 votes at the time of going to press).MetaScore: 52/100: (Based on 35 critic reviews provided by Metacritic.com).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 61/100 (based on 185 reviews counted at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 71/100 (based on 60,395 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is about the life of Jacob told by himself in his advanced years about how he ended up in a circus from an ivy leaguer to how he married his wife, and his life after the circus.Life is not a strait path, and I believe this story told a version of it through life of Jacob, it's main character. Things can be disappointing at times, and it certainly hit Jacob one day while attending Cornell university. He had plans to take over his father's business, and was moving in that direction until everything came to a sudden end. He then quits school, and tries to become a hobo of sorts, but fate has its hand in stall for him.Good movie that has series of unexpected events guiding the story. The story is about the strange twist in life, and how powerless a person is in controlling his destiny. But in the end, you're left with a question, maybe this was the best life Jacob could have lived.Interesting and unusual movie that is worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A True Quality Film in "Water for Elephants"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The cinematic genius of director, Francis Lawrence, is extremely well displayed in his dynamic "Water for Elephants". The novel by Sara Gruen is adapted to the screen by Richard LaGravenese, and it is an elegant screenplay adaptation. It is about a traveling circus and set in the 1930's era. Christoph Waltz gives a perfect performance as the very complicated personality of August, the ringmaster. Reese Witherspoon very graciously plays his wife, Marlena Rosenbluth. She is both seductive and caring with her character being very believable. Their employee, Charlie, played by Robert Pattinson, is dashing and well cast. All of the costuming and set design is totally perfect in this cinema, and it does not depend on any plethora of violence or sex or animated 3-D tricks to accomplish the theme of this compelling story. It should be seen before the Academy Awards start in the Kodak Theater.</fullReview>

Robert Patison takes over here and Chritoph Waltz plays a mentally ill Circus master who is running a great but fatally flawed circus. Reese Witherspoon is his wife.I do admire the effort put into bringing Sara Gruen's first novel to the screen. There is a lot of care taken in the story telling and the love story is carefully balanced with the circus drama. While it is a nice story, it is not the best drama this year that I have seen. I would rate another film a much better one - The Golden Veil- which does not rely on CGI either but uses a fact based true story.I do like the effort here, but it does not quite make the top of my ratings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Water for elephant is a good watch with good direction , mind blowing cinematography , mesmerizing art direction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Opening :- Water for elephants was a good entertainer with decent performances , nice background score and well-told story about the life in a Circus. The Story :- Jacob is studying veterinary but has to abandon his studies after his parents are killed. He is left with no home and no money to survive the era of Great Depression. He leaves the town in search of a job and catches a train only to find himself in a group of circus crowd. Sooner, he gets a job by circus owner, August, to train an elephant to do tactics in circus. Jacob falls for August's beautiful wife , Marlene. Marlene is happy with August as he is a very short tempered guy. Jacob and Marlene soon realizes that they love each other immensely and would do anything to live with each other. The review So , overall , I loved the film. It was a period flick but I found it to be very interesting. The direction was superb and so was the cinematography. The art direction was breath taking transforming you into the era of 19th century. The background score was amazing. Christopher Waltz steals the show as usual with his enduring performance. The film could have been trimmed by few minutes. But, the direction and performances compensates for that. The bottom line Water for elephant is a good watch with good direction , mind blowing cinematography , mesmerizing art direction showcasing the great depression in US with ease ... and some powerful performance Christopher Waltz and decent performances by Reese Witherspoon and Robert Pattinson ( finally this guy showed some expression) !!! Go for it if you like a period film ? Good : 3.5 / 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A captivating romantic drama with the outstanding performance of Christoph Waltz</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching the trailer and hearing all the media buzz, I was not too optimistic about this movie. "A cheesy romantic tale in a circus setting with beautiful Reese Witherspoon and handsome Robert Pattinson serving as bait for sentimental enthusiastic chick-flick lovers" ? thought I ? and was seriously mistaken. "Water for Elephants" turned out to be an emotional, romantic, thought- provoking historical drama with a significant amount of violence. While the movie is not a masterpiece and has its flaws, it offers a strong combination of a surprisingly engaging, well-directed (Francis Lawrence) story and a very good, fantastic at times acting.I cannot give a professional evaluation of the historical accuracy of the movie, but it seemed to do a good job in depicting the life of a travelling circus in the times of the Great Depression and offered some nice authentic details in portraying the Great Depression era in general. "Water for Elephants" strangely reminds me another relatively recent historical drama ? Martin Scorsese's "Gangs of New York"(2002). The two movies have surprisingly much in common, although "Water for Elephants" is bigger on romance and on all the related little psychological nuances and "Gangs of New York" is more of an epic style, with bigger focus on fights and action.Both movies are firmly grounded in the crucial points of American history, characterized by mass suffering, cruelty, and poverty: the Great Depression ("Water for Elephants"), and the Civil War ("Gangs of New York"). In times like that, a power vacuum, society decay, and anarchy bring to life a fascinating but horrifying phenomena ? strong and charismatic, but brutal and merciless informal leaders, who are above the law, or more precisely, who ARE the law of the land. In "Gangs of New York", the supreme law of Lower Manhattan's "Five Points" district is "Bill the Butcher"; in "Water for Elephants", the highest law of the "Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth" is August Rosenbluth. At the core of both movies is a fundamental conflict between the charismatic leader who rules by fear and plants the seeds of death and destruction among his "subjects" and his young apprentice, motivated by a turbulent mixture of love and revenge. In both movies, a beautiful woman serves as a symbol of the conflict and the winner of the deadly struggle gets the woman of his dreams as the main prize. Not surprisingly, the most heavily marketed and the top-billed cast members in the both movies were the romantic sweethearts and the true stars, of course, were the villains.With all my respect, the characters of Leonardo DiCaprio and Cameron Diaz in "Gangs of New York" simply pale before the unforgettable "Bill the Butcher" masterfully played by Daniel Day-Lewis.The verdict on the acting in "Water for Elephants" is a little more ambiguous. While Robert Pattinson is trying hard, his acting seems to a little monotonous and his slightly forced Jacob Jankowski is not a match for the naturally brilliant August Rosenbluth, played by Christoph Waltz. Christoph Waltz, by the way, is hardly visible on the poster and is barely noticeable in the trailer! It is a shame, taking into account how much he contributed to the success of the movie by playing his complex character magnificently well.For Reese Witherspoon "Water for Elephants" was a successful and a memorable comeback into serious acting. It was also a reminder that such a gifted actor whom we still warmly remember for her meaningful roles should not waste her talent on the disposable comedies like "Four Christmases" or "How Do You Know". knowyourmovie.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Circus-themed story with fine acting and great cinematography.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My wife had started reading the book but didn't finish it because she said she "never really got into it." And she reads lots of novels. But we saw this movie last night and she really enjoyed it. So this is one of those cases where the movie might well be better than the book! It starts in modern time, with an old man, played by Hal Holbrook, who must be nearing 100 when you hear his story. He was in the circus in 1931 when something memorable happened, and he tells the story in flashback.Robert Pattinson is college student Jacob, studying veterinary sciences, and was in class taking his last exam before graduating and getting his license to practice as a Veterinarian. But he gets called away, and receives the devastating news that his parents had died in an auto wreck. Distraught, he never went back to get his degree, instead began walking, and in the night hops onto a train.The train turns out to be a traveling circus. Instead of throwing him off, they decide to find work for him. And they do, shoveling animal dung.The star attraction of the circus is Reese Witherspoon as Marlena Rosenbluth, doing an act with 4 horses, two white and two black. But her husband is the circus owner, Christoph Waltz (of 'Inglourous Basterds' fame) as August. A much older man, he had rescued her from an orphanage, and then married her. But August is not a very pleasant man to be around, and rules his circus with an iron fist. When someone gets in trouble, he has his men just throw them off the train into the countryside at night. Or when money is tight, that is how he accomplishes "lay-offs'. Not a very nice man.The story is told very well. Jacob demonstrates skills in animal husbandry and is retained as the "vet" even though he never completed his degree. He and Marlena become attracted to each other, but August handles that the way he handles all other disagreements. Jacob barely survives. All the actors are fine in their roles and the cinematography and sound are first rate. Overall a very good movie with a touching story.SPOILERS: Jacob cannot stay away, and returns to rescue Marlena. An elephant had been added to the circus, a very smart elephant. When August had Marlene down on the ground, trying to choke her with a bar, the elephant picks up an iron rod and swings it, killing August. However someone lets all the big cats out of their cages, mayhem results, the audience runs for their lives, the tent comes down, and the circus disbands. As the old Jacob relates, he went back for his degree, married Marlena, and they settled on a small farm in rural New York and raised a family.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watered Down Acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the biggest waste of time for me. The acting was not the best and the storyline was quite lacking. The love story was dumb and the morals made it difficult to root for the protagonists. Mr. Pattison did a good job in playing the lead but I wasn't into the story due to the concepts and the way the plot line moved. Reese looked as if she should have been playing Pattison's mom and her acting was also lacking. The only highlight of the whole movie was the bull elephant. Story just got more and more ridiculous as it progressed. The resolution even left me feeling as if I should get my ticker back and somehow get the two hours as well. The director tried to make the movie epic but the story was too small and well told in the book to be disrespected like this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Capturing the Desperation of the Depression Era</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WATER FOR ELEPHANTS succeeds on many levels: it offers a satisfying transfer of the novel by Sara Gruen to the screen by Richard LaGravenese, the direction by Francis Lawrence is well paced, the sets and costumes capture the flavor of 1931 and the transient popularity of traveling circuses, and boasts a cast that manages to find the focus of the many characters that make this story interesting. If it dips into the saccharine mode at the end, even that is used in a manner that makes if a satisfying way to end the story,The film opens with the old Jacob (Hal Holbrook) relating the history of the fall of the Benzini Brothers Circus in 1931 to a contemporary Charlie (Paul Schneider). Old Jacob's voice is soon assumed by the young Jacob (Robert Pattinson), show preparing for his doctorate exam in Veterinary Medicine when he is told that his beloved Polish immigrant parents have been killed in an accident: the money for Jacob's education came form borrowing against their home so Jacob is abruptly homeless, and despite the fact that he didn't finish his Cornell exams he strikes out on his own looking for a future in the time of the Great Depression. He happens upon a circus owned by August Rosenbluth (Christoph Waltz) and starring his wife Marlena (Reese Witherspoon) as a woman with horse tricks. Marlena's horse is sick, Jacob's veterinary skills make the diagnosis of a fatal condition and despite the wishes of August he has the courage to put down the ailing horse. Marlena sees the compassion in Jacob and a mutual attraction begins. August is somewhat bipolar and in the long run copes with the increasingly evident attraction between Jacob and Marlena. The Circus is struggling in the hard times and August is known for throwing men off the train that carries the little circus from town to town to reduce costs. August comes across an elephant name Rose, buys her, and in time with Jacobs's discovery that Rosie understands Polish commands Rosie and Marlena bring the circus great audiences and luck. But the schism between the wild behavior of August toward both Jacob and Marlena leads to an ending that results in the ultimate closure of the circus and the end of August. It is the survival of Jacob and Marlena that completes the ending of the tale.The three main actors - Waltz, Pattinson and Witherspoon - carry the film well, but the cameos among the supporting cast provide just the right flavor to make the story not only credible but also in recreating a tragic period in American history. Those actors include fine portrayals by Jim Norton, Scott MacDonald, James Frain, Mark Povinelli among others. The sets and costumes are superb and the musical score by James Newton Howard is first rate. This is a well done reproduction of a successful novel that offers much food for thought.

The only thing i didn't like was how the movie skipped a very important part in the beginning where it was Jacob in the nursing home talking about his life now and his age.I just wish they included that part but thats how Hollywood is i guess. But i do think that it was a great movie and followed pretty closely to the book. Another part they forgot to include is when Marlena comes to Jacob after they spend the night in the hotel and tells him shes pregnant.</fullReview>

The images, the elephant, the love story and the atmosphere of economic crisis are good ingredients and the recipes is not bad but the film is , in many ways, artificial, baroque and mannerist. A steamed mirror for book, it is powerful at first bit. Then, only a foggy memory. The love story, old and honest, has not the right interpreters. Each of they is interesting. Together are gloomy.Or boring. But that is only a small impression. The film is a good show and, if the novel is unread, it is better. Bright colors and slices of circus life, sketches of Titanic and interesting characters, a new kind of happy end and story of another crisis period are inspired food for soul.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Looks Like a Job for Jack Fisk</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When most films marketed towards younger audiences are defined by manufactured special effects hinging on spectacle, it's a rather picturesque delight to see a sincerely involving teen-geared movie, comprised of real people and lifelike sets. The production designer has fashioned a convincing one-ring circus, and even the train itself has a persona. What becomes most intriguing about the story is another mammoth spectacle with a much more sympathetic persona, the 53-year-old elephant Rosie. Rosie goes through a kind of hell in order to become a heroic figure in the story, which makes it worthwhile in spite of its trite trappings.The most conspicuous among its human star enticements is the Austrian-born Waltz as the manically temperamental August Rosenbluth. Waltz tears into the role, and his character's negotiable American accent. He all but licks his fingers in a role which requires the same sensitive fusion of charisma and madness he displayed in Inglourious Basterds. He's an awe-inspiring actor to behold. It's August who employs the story's teller, Jacob Jankowski, a veterinary student constrained to withdraw from Cornell and join the circus just nigh on finals when his parents die. And it's August who is wedded to the beautiful circus performer Marlena, who arrests Jacob's attention. Naturally, with August around, that's no good.Yet their temptation is also the most banal element of this traditional sweeping romance, which, like a well-rehearsed circus animal, sometimes has the sense that it's just going through the motions. You know exactly where it's going. Nevertheless, as well as being a story of forbidden love, it's also both a young man's coming-of-age chronicle and a rather captivating behind-the-scenes glance at the sordid plane of early 20th-century showmanship. The flies, manure and slop are abundant here, as is the abuse of animals that August wages. That infuriates would-be vet Jacob, and together with his budding fondness for Marlena (though like all polished Hollywood films with this theme, the first sight is rose-colored love), it encourages his inescapable collision with August. But it makes the film at times hard to stomach, especially for the more sensitive animal lovers like myself. It's this show of balls, however, and the ultimate triumph about which we truly do care, that makes the film strong.The movie somewhat unimpressively markets wholesomeness amidst what seems like an illicit scenario. It's well produced but faint-hearted. Nevertheless, with the benefit of Terrence Malick and Paul Thomas Anderson's production designer Jack Fisk, director Francis Lawrence summons a mostly convincing world, roughly 1931, of acrobats, sideshow comics, clowns and grunts down on their luck. Then there's Rosie, who will be tough to forget.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not very good, only for fans of R Patz or Witherspoon.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a disappointing and mediocre romance. Unromantic is the word that comes to mind. The main leads: Christoph Waltz acts and talks like he does in Inglorious but a bit more seriously. His character is a bit extreme though. Some serious miscasting is going on here. Witherspoon is a good actress but physically she doesn't have the look of a circus performer. Her body isn't the right type. Rob Pattinson does the passionate lover okay but his sudden grins are out of place. There has to be a larger range of expressions on his face. But he is probably the main reason many people are watching this movie. The story: The main fault is the story isn't that interesting. There isn't enough drama to the story so to liven things up there are too many beatings up. Somehow the romance is unconvincing, surely not one of the great movie romances. Overall a mediocre watch it if you really want to see one of the stars then go for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Somewhere between TOBY TYLER and FREAKS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE CIRCUS HAS always been a popular subject for filmmakers; from the Lon Chaney starring vehicle, HE WHO GETS SLAPPED, Chaplin's THE CIRCUS, Clyde Beatty in THE BIG CAGE and RING OF FEAR, right down to Walt Disney's TOBY TYLER OR TEN WEEKS WITH THE CIRCUS. The films have managed to straddle all categories of economic level from the poverty row to that of Cecil B. De Mille's THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH.THERE HAS ALWAYS been some underlying feelings that Circus life was indeed something truly other and those denizens of there Big Top were, by nature and out of necessity, just a little strange. The realities of a life that would keep one on the road for 9 or 10 months out of the year would seem to underscore the reality of this; while , at the very same time, show us why.RIGHT FROM THE get go, we realize tat what is on the movie screen is going to be different. From the title, we are somewhat puzzled; mainly because it may be just a little too obvious. It does, however, quickly prove to be a much less than a horror tale and more akin to one of those microcosm movies with so many characters having their own varying stories to tell. This would be something along the lines of John Ford's STAGECOACH or the John Wayne vehicle, THE HIGH AND THE MIGHTY. The main difference here being that most of the characters who are portrayed only briefly with their own story, with the bulk of the storyline being given over to the budding romance between Marlena (Reese Witherspoon) and the young Jacob (Robert Pattinson).A CERTAIN ELEMENT of the plot tends to make us think of Jack London's story, THE SEA WOLF or Jules Verne's 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA; what with the element of a cruel and tyrannical martinet's having absolute control in his domain. In this case, the "domain" would be the circus; but even more specifically the circus train, which seems to have a peculiar sort of detachment from the rest of the world. This is even more pronounced of a gap when the train is moving.THAT THE STORY is told mainly in flashback by the elderly Jacob (old 'Mark Twain',himself-Hal Holbrook) leaves us in much more of a state of confusion as to just what is happening and where is the story going. Is it some sort of Film Noir, will it leave us shocked and depressed with some horrific ending, something like Todd Browning's MGM masterpiece, FREEKS (MGM,1932)? IN THE END, we find that we have been treated to an old-fashioned 1940's-type of comedy drama; comedy being in the old, somewhat archaic meaning*, that is. What with all of the twists, turns and bizarre circus-types, we find a sort of happy ending right in front of our very eyes.ALL OF THIS, with fine color photography and great music made us, its audience, a great feeling at film's conclusion. All is well in the end; the production team's having projected a very positive sentiment in the end.THIS IS ANOTHER example proving that Hollywood can indeed, make a fine and enjoyable movie without excessive and gratuitous sex, blood &amp; gore-type violence and exotic locations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall I was very pleased with this movie. I never read the book, although I do plan on reading it soon. The scenery, stage design, and apparel were all beautiful. Christoph Waltz is once again an amazing and enthralling actor. He portrayed his character to be charming yet terrifying, powerful yet pitiful. Every time his character was on screen I was holding my breath. Robert Pattinson and Reese Witherspoon lacked romantic chemistry. I couldn't see them together and I just didn't believe in their "love".The one thing that I did not imagine was that the movie would turn out to be a happy ending for the couple.If I were in charge and could change the ending, it would look a little something like this: (Note that this is just my take on things, not that I am criticizing the author of the book for choosing to end the story her way) The elephant, being terrified because of all the chaos and noise surrounding her, would begin stomping and freaking out in the process accidentally squashing down on both August and Marlena. Jacob would be devastated but he would need to calm the elephant down before it starts rampaging everything in sight. Afterwards he would run back to the two bodies and push August aside to caress Marlena's cheeks for a bit before releasing a droplet or two of tears onto her face. When the scene returns to the older Jacob, he would still be in tears and tell the young man about how he lost the love of his life in that great circus tragedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great drama that hasn't been talked about enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never read the novel that this movie is based on, but the story telling of the film is so well told and well displayed visually on screen. It feels at times I was being read a story and my eyes created the visuals of this movie as the story was being read. This is a fantastic story telling film that is so creativity written and directed. When watching this film you can feel the passion behind the words as they come following out the cast mouth. It seems like the cast are taking turns reading this novel out loud word for word from the book. The cast are so well assembled and play their role to perfection. Robert Pattinson finally does a great job in an acting role. He commands the role and is actually enjoyable to watch through out this movie. When he is not being chased by females or acting in the overrated Twilight movies, he becomes a good actor. Reese Witherspoon is also pleasant to watch as she sways the audience with her characters charm in this movie. Not her strongest role, but a good one. Pattinson and her have a great on screen connection that adds something extra to the movie.The actor that really stole the movie to me is Christoph Waltz with his wonder betrayal of a circus ringleader. The role was just done beautiful and he owned every minute he was on screen. His acting was on par of his German Nazi character on Inglorious Bastards. Besides the good acting of those three people the film never loses its flare and keeps its flow while the story is being told. The story is what out shines the rest of the elements in this film. It takes something so small as a young man traveling with the circus and enlarges it to make this stand out in front of the various summer movies in the world. I have to say with all the positives this movie carries it also has a negative that is not really bad for the film. The abusing of the animals during this movie goes along with making this movie, but is hard to watch and times it makes the viewers want to look away. It's disturbing at times, but works well with the film to get its point across. This film is better than I thought it would be and I enjoyed it a lot. This is another example of a short lived movie at the box office that could have been better received and easily released with the Oscar award movies in the late year and have gone further than what it has done already.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a great dramatic movie with romance, but has enough positive elements to be worth a watch a least once</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't read the book but heard good things about it, but still wasn't sure about this movie since book adaptation into a movie isn't always good. But since the book is good I decided to give this movie a try and from few small clips I seen Christoph Waltz seem to stand out because of his charisma and charm. And that is exactly what he had in this movie, he plays the role in a charming manner and also has charisma to back it up. Anyways Waltz was the main reason I decided to see this since his performance has been entertaining to watch since "Inglourious Basterds" where he played the Jew Hunter. He is indeed a captivating actor. Some people complain that this movie doesn't come close to how good the book is and is almost nothing like the book. I however didn't read the book the I can't compare the movie from the novel and will just review the movie as it is. The story takes place during the great depression and the prohibition, when the protagonist's parents die he has not other option to be on the road to find a job. Soon he end up joining a circus and falls for the ringleader's wife and the drama begins. This isn't a classic movie nor is it one of the great movies that takes place in the 1930's but it's a somewhat touching film that is worth seeing at least once. A lot of grandparents will probably enjoy watching this movie as well, especially as a couple. The cinematography and the design is well done including the environment such as set pieces, the acting was pretty darn good and the stunt people did a great job as well including the animals, especially the elephant. The film does has it's flaw with it's story since it isn't anything special, there just wasn't anything that really grabbed my attention and I like some romance movies. But still for a date movie it's worth seeing, there is probably isn't a lot for the male audiences though.6.3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Titanic love story with a circus touch!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What attracted me to watch this movie was its promotional poster. It is simple, in a way, that manages to capture the intensity and imagination of what this movie might be. I did not read the book so i was clueless from the start. All i knew were what i derived from the title and the poster. A couple. Another man. Elephant. Circus. Water for elephants.To be frank, i'm not a fan of its cast: Robert Pattinson (yes in Harry Potter Goblet of Fire and no in Twilight) or Reese Witherspoon (yes in Just Like Heaven, maybe in Monsters Vs Aliens). However, Robert Pattinson's performance, as Jacob in this movie, is surely commendable. Somehow, i could sense some resemblance of him to James Franco in 127 Hours. And his character is like Jack in Titanic. Christopher Waltz, who played villain, August, is another actor that deserved tremendous applause. His character moves the story forward, a character that demands great acting skills of its actor to deliver and Waltz nailed it- he portrayed his character perfectly.The way the story is being told felt like watching Titanic, with a circus touch. It begins with the main character, who has aged, telling and reminiscing his days of his youth. The story flashes back to when it all began. It also shares the lower-upper class-like love story struggle. First thought, not very original. Predictable. But combining with circus life, it becomes a masterpiece. The story develops well, from how Jacob joins the circus troupe to becoming a man of attention, and the movie peaks at the right moment, leaving everything to fall into place. Additional credits as the script is beautifully written.This story centralizes on issues like the abuse of animals in circus, and it is shown discreetly in some of the scenes. What the audience watches in the circus is an illusion performed at the commands of their master, August, and Jacob and Marlena (Reese Witherspoon) realize and see the pain inflicted on the animals and soon, their lives. There is a reason why this movie is entitled 'Water For Elephants' and my bet would be a reason pertaining to this. Watch it yourself and share with me your interpretation of the title.In short, Water For Elephants is an intriguing movie with a solid development of its plot. A redeemed YES for Robert Pattinson. A good choice of movie to watch if you want an escape from computer-rich effect movies.</fullReview>

Veterinary school student Jacob meets and falls in love with Marlena, a star performer in a circus of a bygone era. They discover beauty amidst the world of the Big Top, and come together through their compassion for a special elephant. Against all odds -- including the wrath of Marlena's charismatic but dangerous husband, August -- Jacob and Marlena find lifelong love. well immediately after seeing this movie i wanted to rate it four stars since i was in that emotional magic of it, the ending basically. but now i think i should rate it 3.5 stars. i was waiting to see this movie, i don't know about the book it is based on but the trailer gave me chills seriously i loved it, the music and the look of it.well its nice to see Robert Pattinson outside the Twilight movies, he tries Remember me but i haven't seen it i think it isn't that good. but this movie was a good movie for him. he really looked good and did a nice job in it. he plays a Veteran Doctor who is about to graduate but tragedy strikes him and he leave his house and embarks on a journey an unknown one and finds a train which belongs to the Benzini Bros Circus and he works there but they discovers he is a Vet and into animals and that is where he meets Reese Witherspoon character, Marlena who is a performer. he finds her very attractive and kind of feels something for her even though she is older than him and the owner's girlfriend who is August played by Christoph Waltz, the bad guy obviously.Reese did a fine job but still she wasn't there completely. she looked strikingly beautiful and very gorgeous. it was just nice seeing her. Robert was okay and can do better but he looked good and the role really suited him. Christoph should actually try something different, he is always the bad guy in every movie now, he does a good job in this movie he was good. other actors were just fine Paul Schneider, Jim Norton , Hal Holbrook , Mark Povinelli , Richard Brake , Stephen Monroe Taylor and tons of others. performance wise nothing great but just fine. chemistry was good between them and romance looked real, well shown.cinematography is superb and beautiful, stunning. also stunning art direction and costumes. wow lovely. everything was good visually. movie is surprisingly directed by the two sci fi movies director Francis Lawrence who directed Constantine and I am legend. movie is written above average, screenplay suffers a bit in the middle in few places which actually somewhat ruin this movie overall. that was a low point of it otherwise it was a spectacular and lovely romantic drama. movie was emotional too, towards the end i got tears in my eyes too, yes seriously. movie features animals too and those torture scenes were unbearable for me. i liked this movie and so will you. Watch it guys.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jacob finds himself on circus and falls in love with Marlena, the star-studded performer and who happens to be the circus manager's wife.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Water For Elephants, based on a novel by Sara Gruen, is a love story set on a circus during The Great Depression. Jacob accidentally hops off on a circus train, looking for a job. His application is about to be denied when he mentioned he is a veterinarian graduate from Cornell. August, the circus manager, take interest and hires him.At that time, the circus is at the brink of quitting. August thinks an elephant would be the solution ? by attracting more attention the circus can gain more profit. Rosie, the elephant, is untrained and knows nothing about tricks or following orders and thus the role of Jacob comes in. At work, Jacob falls in love with Marlena, the star-studded performer and happens to be August's wife. He knows his feelings would infuriate August and decides to hide it. But he can't.The film starts off like Titanic. An aged man is full of stories and when he is prompted, he floods the asker with details. The whole events in the movie happens during the man's revelation.If it's possible, the elephant is the star of the movie, at least as far as an animal can act. I felt horribly sad when she moans for help and flash his teary eyes or I'm at joy when she splashes water from her trunk, like a child eager to play. Also Christoph Waltz as August gives the thrilling and almost scary tension out of Jacob and Marlena's forbidden love. You might know him from the movie Inglourious Basterds. He's good.What made me frown is the chemistry of Robert Pattinson and Reese Witherspoon. I found none. I don't know if it's the age gap or the make- over but they don't look good together. True, in the novel Marlena is older than Jacob but I was hoping for an intimate couple and not lovers looking like an innocent mother-son relationship.You will get what you paid for. There will be stunning circus performance like the elephant standing on a foot or two or sitting like a lady or posing like superman. The one-ring circus is dazzling together with the various performers. I heard the soundtrack before I saw the movie and it was moving. There are some dance songs and don't be embarrassed if you find yourself dancing. I perfectly understand it.If you are okay with cliché love triangle but with a different setting and attitude, I bet you'll enjoy this. Well, my sister did.Robert Pattinson is not bad after all. He is more than being the pale blood-sucking vampire. But it would be great to see him other than in a love story. In Harry Potter, he fits well with Cedric Diggory. Perhaps I have to watch his How To Be and Little Ashes for a personal verdict.What made me frown is the chemistry of Robert Pattinson and Reese Witherspoon. I found none.

		<shortDescription>Good looking film despite a story that is kind of predictable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The funny thing about this film is that there isn't much water in it for the elephants but there is more mistreatment of them. This is a charming film that has all the elements that will make romantics go 'ahhh'. You have the impoverished handsome young man who is the underdog, has the heart of gold and is not only a charm with the ladies but also the animals. Add a bright vivid setting with trapeze artists and a show business like atmosphere, a train that takes them all from one location to another and then to top it off, how could you forget the young beautiful woman who is stuck with a guy who controls her as though she were one of his animals in the circus? So everything is totally predictable and cliché ? but that is how it is meant to be. This doesn't take away the fun of the film because it is a pleasant and cheerful ride. This is helped by decent performances from Pattinson, Witherspoon and Christopher Waltz who make the trio of the love triangle.Set in the era of the depression, Jacob (Pattinson), after his parents die which prevents him from taking his final exam in Veterinary Science, hits the road and ends up on a rail way train in his path. Soon discovering he has hopped on a circus train where the owner August (Waltz) is struggling to pay off debts and needs cash flow coming in, he gets a job scooping up animal dung, feeding them while also falling for the beautiful Marlena (Witherspoon) who performs in the circus with horses. For new publicity and hopefully t boost ticket sales, they get an elephant who will hopefully become a star attraction at the show. Jacob discovers he has a great form of communication with her and helps to make her a big hit.This is a reminiscent film. It is told from the perspective of an older Jacob who goes into a flashback about his life and events. The good thing about films and stories told from an older version of the main character is that you know he made it out alive whatever the circumstances were! So hence it is more about whether he gets lucky in his earlier years and manages to overcome adversity in a way that is made entertaining for us.The sets look great, the circus feel of the film reminded me of Big Fish with Ewan McGregor ? obviously haven't seen a lot of films based in circuses. At the heart of the film is a story about where you go when you need a direction and how we all sometimes stick to what we know rather than find out what else is out there. This is the case with Marlena who represents the less daring character and Jacob who takes what is thrown at him.I would have liked a bit more switching from past to present. Once you're five minutes into the film, it wastes no time in flashing back and not once does it switch back to the present to sort of get older Jacob's perspective. This does work ? Titanic, Curious Case of Benjamin Button and a whole bunch of other films that contrast the two time situations.The conclusion feels slightly rushed but the journey you take on with these characters is enjoyable, but nor is it groundbreaking or anything you haven't really seen before. Perhaps the atmosphere and look of the film makes the adversity a bit less hard as it should be. Pattinson proves that he is more than just Twilight Edward Cullen persona and does a convincing performance though he needs to work more on facial expressions sometimes. I did think to myself during the love scene that Pattinson feels way too young to be touching Witherspoon but hey this is a story about life isn't it?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much more than a love story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The grim life of the Depression and Prohibition is the backdrop and helps set the tone for Water for Elephants. Despite living a good and decent life, Jacob receives the difficult news that both his parents have died in a car accident. There wasn't any financial security left for Jacob so he decides to leave town prior to receiving his diploma in veterinary science from Cornell University. Jacob doesn't wallow in self-pity, but decides to hop a train that turns out to contain the Benzini Bros. circus. He soon realizes a new life that he didn't know existed. Even though he came from a stable and sheltered home, he was willing to work hard for his keep. His efforts were repaid with his eventual elevation to veterinarian. He confesses that he is not a degreed vet, but the circus owner, August, assures him that the world is run on tricks. Everything is an illusion to August. Jacob soon falls for the beautiful Marlena, August's wife. August decides the new attraction will be an elephant named Rosie and Marlena will be her rider. He has high hopes that this will make the Benzini Bros. circus profitable at a time where they aren't filling seats and are forced to cut circus members weekly. August's harmful physical control of the animals and Marlena are difficult for Jacob to view. Jacob empathizes with both and eventually shares a moment with Marlena that confirms their attraction to each other. August realizes he may be losing his wife to Jacob and decides to destroy them if he can't stop them. In the end, August is the one who is destroyed. The injustices that August threateningly held over his employees did not earn respect. His life of deceit and tricks was put in a downward spiral by them. Rosie was able to deliver the life taking blow that kills August. Marlena and Jacob escape and start their life together. The title itself sheds light on the overall meaning of the film. Jacob discovers Rosie's sweet personality as the previous owners just think that she is a dumb elephant. When August physically abuses her for not following commands, she is profoundly injured and in pain. Jacob comes to her rescue with water laced with alcohol. When the cruelties and injustices of life befall upon the innocent, we all feel pain. Sometimes the best thing we can do is be present with them to take away the pain. In this case, Jacob was present and offered Rosie water with a sedative. He empathized with her and took care of her. Water for Elephants is much more than just a love story. It is a story about innocence, injustice, and empathy for the lives around us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Spectacular Show</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Date: 15 June, 2012 -First Time Watch- After finishing the book 'Water for Elephants' I decided to watch the movie, thinking it may not be as spectacular as the book (though I admit the book was kind of disappointing. To my surprise, I actually really liked it. I liked how the movie began when Jacob went to the circus at the end of the book and began telling the story to the circus owner instead of doing flashbacks as Sara Gruen did in the novel. The only hard part about this movie was Rosie. That poor animal. How can any home just keep hitting and stabbing a poor animal? I for one was very happy when Rosie killed August in the end. That was very enjoyable since August deserved it. I thought Robert Pattinson, Reese Witherspoon and Christoph Waltz all did a fantastic job and were enjoyable to watch. One thing that did bother me about the movie adaption is that Walter wasn't in it as much as the book. Walter was my favorite character in the book so I was kind of disappointed that he wasn't in the movie as much. Overall a well done movie that deserved more recognition that it got. I didn't give this movie a ten because it is not one of my favorites.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jacob learns quickly that you have to go after what you want</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jacob is an elderly escapee from the local nursing home who goes to track down the circus. Charlie, the head of the circus, manages to corral Jacob in his office and learns that Jacob has a long and distinct history with the circus. With Charlie's encouragement, Jacob begins to tell his story. As a young man, Jacob had set his sights on being a veterinarian. On the day he was to take his final test, news came that his parents had been killed. Jacob lost everything that day. His home, his parents, his career.Jacob sets out for a new town and jumps a train, never suspecting that his life was about to change forever. Following the theme of this film, Jacob quickly learns that you have to go after what you want. The train turns out to be a circus train. He is nearly tossed off as a freeloader when he lies and tells August, the owner and ring master, that he is a vet. The circus, having many animals, was in need of a vet so Jacob was spared.When Jacob first lays eyes on Marlena, the wife of August, he is smitten. August likes the status of having a circus vet so Jacob is quickly taken into the inner circle. Jacob begins to spend a lot of time with August and Marlena and his desire for Marlena grows as he also learns that August has an uncontrollable temper. Marlena returns Jacob's desire but keeps him at arms-length.August acquires an elephant, Rosie, that turns out to be the main attraction along with Marlena. Jacob learns how to control Rosie by speaking Polish to her. Marlena begins to train with Rosie much as Esther Williams did in The Big Show. The angle of the camera in many shots makes Rosie look huge.Life in the depression era was tough. Even the circus was affected but the film shows how life in the circus was filled with never ending activity. When the circus had financial difficulties, August would solve them by throwing workers off of the train while they were moving so that he did not have to pay them. Sometimes they survived and sometimes they did not. This activity was done in the dark of night which made the lighting quite important. They did a nice job with the lighting and shadows on the train.Going after what he wanted, Jacob continues to spend time with Marlena. What follows is wrapped in adventure, drama, romance and death.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Welcome Change From Most Of What Comes Out Of Hollywood These Days</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not your typical Hollywood big budget movie - and I mean that in the best sense possible. There are no spectacular special effects work, it doesn't include any nudity, and from what I remember it doesn't even have any particularly foul-mouthed language. In many ways it's a very innocent movie compared to most of what you see these days, and yet at the same time it's a powerful movie, and sometimes even very hard to watch. It's a flashback movie (OK - a bit cliché these days) as an old man played by Hal Holbrook wanders into a circus at night in the pouring rain. Found by the manager, he recounts the story of his own life and adventures in the circus, leading up to what we're told was the great Benzini Brothers Circus disaster. So we wait to find out what the disaster was and what caused it, and we wait patiently, because the story is a pretty good one.As a young man in the flashback, Jacob is played by Robert Pattinson. Jacob's life is at this point a pretty tragic one. On the verge of graduating as a veterinarian from Cornell University in 1931, his parents are tragically killed in a car crash. It's the midst of the Depression, and Jacob has no money to keep the family home. Forced out on the road, he ends up latching on to the Benzini Brothers Circus, charged with looking after the animals - eventually including Rosie, a female elephant acquired to be the star attraction. Essentially, the movie traces Jacob's relationship with August (Christoph Waltz) - the owner of the circus, and with Marlena (Reese Witherspoon) - his wife, and the circus's star performer. August was abusive - even cruel and sadistic - toward the performers, the animals and even his wife. Waltz captured that character quite well. Unsurprisingly - and, again, a bit cliché - Jacob and Marlena develop a relationship, which of course leads to much tension with August. I thought Pattinson and Witherspoon worked pretty well together. Their relationship wasn't the centrepiece of the movie, but it seemed authentic enough. The nature of the circus disaster when it was finally revealed took me by surprise. I was expecting something very different.The movie at times is difficult to watch. As innocent as it is, there are scenes of abuse and violence that can make you wince. Because the focus is so much on the three stars, the movie offers an interesting but not especially detailed look at circus life of the era. It's not an overwhelming movie. I couldn't honestly say that it took my breath away at any point, but at the same time it held my attention throughout. The novel on which this is based was written by Sara Gruen, who apparently says the movie is based on the biblical story of Jacob in the Book of Genesis. I'm not sure I see those parallels in the movie to be honest, and not having read the book I can't comment on it. I did like the movie, though. It was very interesting, and very much a welcome change of pace from what you normally see from Hollywood these days. (8/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Water for Elephants was a real surprise for me.Set in the 1930s traveling circus era, we are treated with some very good acting and a completely believable plot.I was particularly impressed that my daughter, who is 11, at first wanted nothing to do with the film. But then she sat down and was completely engrossed within minutes. I found the movie a little edgy, but mostly appropriate for her age. There was no significant foul language and only one brief sex scene that made her wince, even though there was no nudity.I was also impressed that the story delivered several good themes relating to personal character, treatment of animals, relationships, domestic abuse, perseverance, etc. A few scenes were hard to watch (brutality to animals), but triggered some decent family conversation afterward.This is a solidly entertaining movie with some very tight acting by all parties, excellent scenery, superb direction and a wonderful message at the end.I completely recommend this for an enthralling trip back in time. The kids will like the animals while the adults enjoy a little romance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Water for ElephantsIf you fall in love with the circus boss' wife, it usually means you are into bearded woman.Thankfully, in this love story, the ringmaster's mistress is clean-shaven. Forced from his home following the death of his parents, Jacob (Robert Pattinson) hops a train in hopes of finding a new life, which he does, aboard a circus train.Relying on the little veterinarian skills he has to remain germane, Jacob's hired by the hard-nosed owner, August (Christoph Waltz), to maintain his pachyderm star.But when Jacob learns that August rules over his wife (Reese Witherspoon) the same way he lords over his animals, he soon plots an escape for her and himself.Despite its obviousness love triangle, this adaptation of the popular novel has a thrilling backdrop and a ferocious performance from Christoph Waltz.As for animal cruelty in circuses, it needs to stop...and be re-directed upon the clowns.

		<fullReview>OK, so I read the book (Like Water for Elephants, Sara Gruen) and it was so amazing I cried when I finished reading it, because it was like losing a dear friend.The movie got a pretty good wrap from the reviewers I saw (David and Margaret Pomeranz), and I like their reviews so watched it.I must say, it so perfectly capture the essence of the book, for me at least, that I was immediately transported back in my mind's eye to the pictures I'd formed reading it. In fact, it's pretty well how I imagined things ... spooky! My only negative comments, and I hate to write it was leaving out the old man's story so much. In the book it's the beginning of each chapter. However, as a narrative piece, this works. On the screen, not so well so I understand why this was done.Wasn't Rosie just the most perfect elephant?! I cried for her pain at one point. I loved Ms Witherspoon, she just played that character so well.Please, oh please read the book if you've not done so yet. So much more magic to discover.

		<fullReview>Well, maybe that's because it's the only circus movie I can think of off the top of my head. But nonetheless, a great film. It's the perfect length, the perfect amount of action, the perfect mix of drama and comic relief, and overall, it's got a good story.Really well put together. For the type of movie it is, it's really quite impressive. I mean, obviously it's not the most exciting story in the world. It's a story of a troubled man who finds work and falls in love at the circus. But even with that limited plot, the filmmakers did an excellent job of bringing the movie to life and making you feel like you're part of the scene. It's definitely near the top of my list as far as 2011 movies go, but I don't expect it to be much of a classic. I'm thinking it'll turn into one of those movies that time just blows over into obscurity, but if discovered by a new generation, they'd definitely enjoy it. With love, Simba Jackson</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In a magical movie about the circus, Robert Pattinson falls in love with Reese Witherspoon.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think it's time to cut poor Robert Pattinson some slack. Since he was cast as the sweet-talking and pale vampire Edward Cullen in the teen hit "Twilight" all boyfriends in the world are jealous of the one guy their girlfriends are more in love with then them at times, and have therefore labeled him as an atrocious actor with no talent and a face that lacks any sort of expression. Well, granted "The Twilight Saga" or "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire" certainly haven't shown him in the greatest light as a performer, but then again those two film series are not exactly best known for their outstanding opportunities to demonstrate fine acting. Therefore, the adaptation of Sara Gruen's novel about a circus during the Great Depression era in the 1930s "Water for Elephants" turned out to be the first big screen trial, and as far as I'm concerned, he passed the test with flying colors. The film turned out to be an extremely well-made, enjoyable and superbly acted drama, that was by far the best film about the circus I have seen in a long time.In 1931, Jacob Jankowski is just about to get his degree in veterinary sciences from Cornell, when his parents pass away in a car accident and leave their son homeless and without a future. Traveling along the railroads, he one night encounters a train full performers from the Benzini Brothers Circus, who take him to a brand-new life and offer him a job. He soon meets the animal trainer and ringmaster August, a charismatic, but arrogant and brutal man, who first wants to throw Jacob of the train but hesitates when he finds out he is a veterinarian. Instead, he hires him to treat the injury of his star attraction, a beautiful horse, trained by August's wife Marlene. But soon August discovers a new attraction, an elephant named Rosie and he picks Jacob to train her. But when he sees that Jacob is unwilling to establish complete control over her, he turns raging and brutally forces the elephant to listen to his orders. Jacob turns more and more against August, and falls in love with Marlene, who is torn between being with the man she loves, or the man who was responsible for making her a star.Although Francis Lawrence's only two works as a director so far have been the comic book adaptation "Constantine" and the acclaimed science-fiction horror thriller "I am Legend", he handles a historical film with great ease, and transformed Gruen's novel onto the big screen in a mix of lush sets and colors, but also a tone of sadness and melancholy in regard to the Great Depression. "Water for Elephants", while more of a fairy tale than historical fiction, is brilliantly executed on a fairly small scale that rightfully indulges in its sparse, but well-constructed sets. The film conveys a perfect circus atmosphere, especially when the tent is built and dozens of workers are pulling on the ropes, or a montage of circus acts is shown with the underlying and incredibly nostalgic music by James Newton Howard. Ultimately, it's a tour de force that relies on its escapist tone and particularly a scene when Jacob and August first met, and the latter takes the newcomer on the roof of the train, you feel the thrill and excitement of taking a journey that you are curious to witness. Although the story is not nearly as creative, with a rough, yet charming young outsider falling in love with a beautiful circus performer, who is married to an older and brutish man, and certainly does trip over one or the other cliché occasionally, it's told with passion and dynamically, so there's always the occasional unexpected twist. The film is also a bit light on the real despair that went on during the Great Depression, and although the true horrors are hinted at occasionally, there's a reason it's merely rated PG-13.As mentioned, Robert Pattinson deserves some props for stepping up his game big time for this film, and considering his face finally doesn't look like a bucket of chalk has been emptied over it, he has a quite weathered and charming aura, that will come to serve him well in the future. His chemistry with Reese Witherspoon though was a bit dry, especially compared to the sizzling of her and Christoph Waltz, which may be because she's 11 years older than him. Nevertheless, individually they are both superb, with Witherspoon giving a tough and sympathetic performance as a star, who's been at the very bottom and will do anything never to get back there again. But the show is once again stolen by Christoph Waltz, who is one of those actors, who never seems to miss a beat or step out of line in the slightest. The delivery of every single syllable is perfectly timed and precisely planned, and he is easily one of the most intimidating and brilliant actors Hollywood has seen in a long time. But it really was quite amazing that August always seemed to be able to pull his bodyguards from hammer space, whenever Jacob was ready to attack him, which was my only real issue surrounding his character. Hal Holbrook also leaves an impression as an older Jacob, narrating the story, and finishing up the film with a moving and wonderfully final line.Mostly due to the fantastic leading trio of actors, especially Christoph Waltz, and the surprisingly inspired direction by Francis Lawrence, who has just recommended himself for more historical film projects, the film is enjoyable and moving at the same time. I have just won back my love for the circus thanks to this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but could've been better with someone else directing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The main problem with this movie is that it's not compelling enough. Now, i don't know if the book has the same problem because i never read it, but i'd like to see a movie like this in the hands of someone like, if he was still alive, David Lean or maybe even someone new(ER) like Darren Aronofsky, Rob Marshall, Ron Howard or Sam Mendes. I know, they are very different directors and how can they even be in the same sentence, but i just think that they'd all do a good job. I can see everyone of them directing this movie. But don't get me wrong, Francis Lawrence is not a bad director. As far as the shots go everything is in place and he brought some good stuff from the actors too. There are some very good performances in the film. Especially by Christoph Waltz. However, i think that he didn't bring the best from the scenes that were meant to be intriguing and emotional, such as (----- MINOR SPOILER -----) the one where Jacob asks Marlena to come with him, to jump off the train. It looks so ordinary and unimportant. It should've been longer and a short slow motion between the two of them wouldn't hurt. Also the scene where Jacob is washing the elephant's wound and so on...&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The writing is fine, i don't know about is it a good adaptation or not, but the film is structurally well done. The only thing missing, at my opinion, is the length. It should've been longer. It's a period drama, nothing under two and something hours works that well, i think. But than it's possible that the producers had something to do with that! &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Christoph Waltz was, as i mentioned above, great. But Rob Pattinson and Reese Witherspoon should be mentioned too as they both bring good performances. Reese already has her place among the Elite Acting Talent's and Rob is getting there. I won't mention Twilight because i think it sucks, but he definitely proves him self to be a good actor and not just, what many think he is, a pretty face. He did that with Remember Me as well.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It's a good movie. Once again, i think it could've been better with a different director but it works fine like this too. It's not exactly a masterpiece but it's definitely good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this particular movie we see combined elements of love,sadness,betrayal and torture that together make up this movie.The story of this movie is oustanding completely with the excellence of acting.the story is portrayed as chains of memories that the narrator had at a young age where he had fallen in love with a women in a circus.If there is love there is also an element of sadness.As we know we can't have a perfect life.There are also a few action scenes but they are not fictional but they are realistic because this is a story that portrays the reality of life.Speaking of life there are also cute animals being tortured by the cruel circus owner which later has a great impact in the storyline but to avoid the spoilers i won't say much.overall this movie is excellent because it really portrays love in life as it is and life cant be perfect but its filled with problems both in relationship an jealousy.Love that also appears in animals that respect us but some of us humans torture them.i highly recommend this movie to anyone that loves a beautiful well written story9/10 (excellent)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Titanic In A Circus Tent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Couldn't help but compare this with Titanic movie, as the plots are almost similar, involving a love "wreck"tangle between two people and a third party. Depending on your p.o.v., Robert Pattinson as would-be vet Jacob Jankowski is that third party, having the misfortune of learning he has lost both his parents and his home at one fell swoop, suffers a nervous breakdown just before his final exams, and runs away, only to fortuitously end up in a travelling circus where he is employed to look after the menagerie after August, the circus proprietor, learns that he studied veterinary medicine. Here he encounters the beautiful Marlena, the leading performer who is married to August, who can be alternatingly charming and brutal depending on the his moods. Jacob falls in love with Marlena, and she reciprocates, and that's the basic premise of this historical movie, set in the early years of the Great Depression. Of course, what would a circus be without animals? Rosie the elephant literally steals the show and the viewers' hearts at the same time. The scenes of animal cruelty are predictably disturbing and distressing to watch, but for those who protest and advocate boycotting the movie for this reason,please remember that this is a period film which protrays the reality of life at the time, and that it DOES NOT in any way promote nor condone animal abuse, it was simply the status quo then. That would be like saying "Gone With the Wind" endorses slavery just because it portrays such a situation. I have had the good fortune of reading the Sara Gruen novel ages before the film adaptation was even conceived, and while there are a few omissions and detractions from the original (No Uncle Al or nurse Rosemary, and Marlena is depicted as being an orphan raised in foster homes instead of coming from a prominent family), I do not find these deviations very distracting. This movie is one of the very few that have managed to capture the essence of the original book. Truly worth watching if you like romance and animals.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't wait for the DVD, you'll miss the point. All three (four, really, because Tai/Rosie is great actor) leads do well and the movie has an old Hollywood glow to it that's been missing for years in Tinseltown. Perfect it's not. Why? Mainly, two reasons: 1) a less than commendable emphasis on the cinematography rather than character development. This is somewhat understandable as Francis Lawrence seems to have assembled an academy-winning crew and probably couldn't help but let them do their thang. And 2) slight tedium in editing during the middle sequences. That said, Reese Witherspoon was a stellar circus act and played jaded but romantic hopeful Marlena to perfection. Christoph Waltz's scenery-chewing prowess had ample display but I'd like to see him as the "hero" in his next venture as I'm not German or Austrian so I haven't seen enough of his work. As for Robert Pattinson, I'm not going to say "woah the dude CAN act after all" as I already knew that. What he's done with the badly-written Edward is really commendable. He made THAT role iconic and this one luminous. The kid has a bright future if he chooses well. Lastly, Rosie. If ever there was natural actor -- she's it. The movie stayed with me for a while, so that must mean something. Imperfect as it is, I'd rather spend my ten bucks on this than Fast Five.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent film brought to life with its magical setting and great acting!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found Water For Elephants was a truly magical film. I had not read the novel before going to see it, or even heard of it for that matter. However what that enticed me to watch it was mainly down to its setting. I see that it may be down to a matter of personal opinion and taste, but the idea of a love story set within the 1930's depression era at a circus, really drew me in! I do not normally enjoy films with Robert Pattinson taking the lead, yet i found that he made it flow well and he fitted the part perfectly. The romance between his character Jacob and Witherspoons Marlena; worked well as they clearly fit together. Witherspoon flourished with the part and the connection with the animals she acquired evoked my enjoyment further. Good acting along with the nostalgic setting, narrative and altogether enchanting vibes within the romance helped me really get into the film and feel emotional for the characters and connected with them.For me though,the true star of the film was August (Christoph Waltz)I have seen Waltz often play the 'baddie' within the narrative and have always admired what an excellent job of it he does. Augusts aggressive persona mixed with his passion for his job and wild lifestyle was brought out so well by Waltz and made me actually feel empathetic at times for him. He played the part so convincingly, making me feel anxious and frightened with his intimidating character. I know that no other actor would have been able to portray the part of August like he did, letting me accredit it such a high rating. I really did love the film, and would recommend it to anyone seeking a romance with the added twist of a charismatically fascinating setting beautifully assisted by the dreamy lighting, wild animals, and the vintage feel to the entire cast and narrative.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Are circus movies outdated?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While not quite prolific enough, there was a time when circus movies could almost make up a genre: Greatest Show on Earth (1952), Trapeze (1956), Circus of horror (1960), just to name a few of the best known. The times are changing. Cirque du Soleil is likely what kids today think of when the word "circus" is mentioned."Water for elephants" takes the well-used structure of a character's reflections, usually with voice-over (wisely used only sparsely here). The movie opens with an old man Jacob (Hal Holbrook) arriving late when the show has long finished and people are packing up. As a kindly circus worker is trying to contact the old age home, Jacob grumbles about none of his five kids having a place for him, although they take turn in visiting at weekends. This time, he wanders off because his 71-year-old son has forgotten (probably forgivable for his bad memories, Jacob adds). Then, a picture of a circus that suddenly folded in 1931 starts a conversation, arousing the circus worker's curiosity, and that's when the story really begins, during the Great Depression.To cut a long story short, young Jacob's (Robert Pattinson) promising future (despite the Great Depression) is abruptly shattered on the verge of his graduating from Cornell with a degree in veterinary science. Not only are his parents killed instantly in a car accident, but he also finds the family house and other valuable possession taken over by the banks. To cut a long story even shorter, he goes out into the world, joins a failing circus as their resident vet, makes all kinds of friends, helps to take care of a newly bought fifty-something year old elephant that becomes the star that turns the show around, gets entangled in a love triangle with the autocratic owner August (Christopher Waltz) and his lovely wife Marlena (Reese Witherspoon), roughly in that order.This starts out as an interesting story but ironically loses some steam upon the appearance of the titular "star" Rosie the elephant. The story drags on because, in part at least, hard as Pattinson and Witherspoon tried (and they are not bad, at least Reespoon), there just doesn't appear to be any true spark between the characters. Add to it the predictable predictability, there just does not appear to be anything that can really sustain the audience's interest at a desirable level. The finale climatic pandemonium is rather contrived. Perhaps the one minor surprise is that with the intentional red herring in the beginning, the old man's desolate look and the ominous reference to the collapse of the circus, there is a happy ending. A happy ending of sorts, because of the state we find the old man in at the end, despite the good life he had enjoyed with his beloved. A lamentation of the inevitable natural progress of a human life, namely ageing, I suppose we can call this. Waltz, reprising his Oscar winning character from Inglorious Basterds, is the highlight of this movie. We all know what Witherspoon is capable of but there just isn't much for her to do here. Pattinson I'd rather see continuing as the heartthrob vampire. One pleasant surprise is Holbrook who at the age of 86, other than having gained some weight, is as good as ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this movie was really very entertaining. Rob showed that he is on his way to becoming a great leading man. He could be suave and cool, but also sweet and endearing, and always intense. Reese seemed to be missing something... Her Marlena never seemed really in the action, sort of aloof. Christoph was fantastic as August - he captured the split personality perfectly, making you smile one minute and cringe the next. Rosie (Tai) was fantastic. The ending was perfect and fitting that Rosie got her revenge. The movie was beautifully filmed, like a movie from the golden days, not today, and held my attention and that of my companions (not Rob fans)for the 2 hours. It kept us immersed in the story, and did not drag. At the end, they both (1 male and 1 female) said that they really enjoyed it and would recommend it highly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really recommend Water for Elephants, it was such a fantastic film, and both Robert Pattinson and Reese Witherspoon did brilliantly.When I usually go to the cinema I wouldn't say my attention span is 100%, where I do spend sometime considering what to eat next and I do occasionally whisper something to my friend about the film. However, I was completely transfixed whilst watching Water for Elephants, and I don't think I even moved a muscle. It was probably a mix between the brilliant acting, the fantastic story line and my love for animals! I mean it does have a typical love story structure, and is a bit like the Notebook. However, you get a great insight into the lives of the circus workers in early 20th Century, and some violent scenes made me wince quite a bit...It's not a typical cheesy romantic film at all, so men don't be put off that Robert Pattinson is in it, but to all the women...this film will make you love him even more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see this picture because I love animals, travelling circuses and that period in history. I also had some background on the treatment of animals in the circus that I acquired from reading and television. My maternal grandpa was a veterinarian and it was always nice to hear from my mother of his devotion to animals. Water for Elephants is about a young man who was dragged away from academia and a ordinary life because of extenuating circumstances. The boss's wife becomes attracted to him because he is the opposite of her brutal spouse. I recommend this to viewers who are daring and love to accomplish the impossible. At the same time it is the true immigrant story that led Jacob (Pattinson) to experience the life that he did and hopefully it can encourage people to accomplish all they can. After all people throughout history had to make do with what they had and some good can come out of despair.Kudos to Sara Gruen and those who helped bring it to the big screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>worst screenplay adaptation of a book ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm giving it a 2 rather than a 1 because the acting and photography were okay. The actors couldn't do much about the fact that the screenwriter completely butchered the book, which I finished immediately before watching the movie. Combining the characters of circus owner Uncle Al and Equestrian Manager (aka Ringmaster) August caused many aspects of the story to make no sense. There was no Uncle Al in the movie; August was also the circus owner.But the most egregious mistake in the screen writing was the transformation of the character of Marlena from a Catholic girl who eloped with August to escape an arranged marriage by her over-protective parents, regretting it within 3 weeks when she discovered August's brutality, to an emotionally tough orphan, raised in foster homes, who by all appearances seemed to genuinely love August. In the movie, it wasn't clear why she would want to leave him.Which brings me to Problem #3: Reese Witherspoon is too old for this part, 10 years older than the romantic leading man who's supposed to be falling for her, and she looks it. There is no chemistry between them at all, partly because of the severely flawed screenplay, which completely changes her character (she's supposed to be a kindred nice girl to his nice boy, not a tough hard case), and partly because Witherspoon is miscast and too old for the part.The ridiculous additions to heighten drama at the end of the movie, not in the book, are just trashy melodrama. I won't say more because I don't want to include spoilers. I thought this screenplay was so exceptionally bad an adaptation of one of the best books I've read that I went to the screenwriter's page on IMDb to see what else he's done so I don't bother with it.In short, pass on the movie - it's a waste of time. But read the book! The book is wonderful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a Very Good Film!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, this film was visually stunning. It captured down to the color of what I always thought things looked back in the 1930's. The costumes and the circus acts were equally amazing! The one thing I really enjoyed about this film was the heart that was in it and the emotions that were played by actors and animals alike. Robert Pattinson did a fantastic job of making me believe that he had a love for two things in this film: The lead character(Reese Wither Spoon), and animals. There was always a certain amount of compassion he portrayed towards both these elements that made the film worth while!!! I think Robert can easily make it in Hollywood after Twilight if he keeps doing different roles, and displaying the kind of acting he showed in this film!! All of the actors did wonderful in this film, from the extras, to the animals! The only complaint I have about this, is it seems in a way that it was kinda rushed and it ended a little to quickly. Other than that, A lovely, romantic film!!!! Even the score is written well, and meshes together well with the scenes and what you are probably feeling at the time. I know that even though the critics will bash this film, because it has a Twilight star in it, don't take their opinion!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't believe this movie was directed by the same guy who previously made two horrible and ugly films such as "Constantine" and "I am Legend". Mostly because this movie ended being incredibly good, having a incredibly emotional and heartwarming love story that seems like an homage to the romantic films made in the golden years of cinema.Just like "Australia", this homage works very well, with memorable scenes and characters. All the performances were very good, Robert Pattison makes a incredible work as the main character, and Christoph Waltz gives an excellent performance as the antagonist.If you like classic movies from the golden age of Hollywood, then you will love "Water for Elephants". It is such a great underrated film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The criticisms on this site are unbelievable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a huge fan of the original novel, I was expecting to be disappointed with this movie. After seeing it, I am baffled that the movie fails to explain the significance of the title but was pleasantly surprised.The negative reviews on this website truly blow my mind. I will agree that the animal abuse scenes are upsetting and difficult to watch. For that reason, I have not recommended this movie to those of my friends who do not like "sad" movies, although the movie does have a happy ending. Nor would I recommend this movie for children. But one reviewer in particular seemed to think that the movie promotes animal abuse and I think is obvious throughout that only the movie's villain engages in any animal abuse whatsoever and that the protagonists of the film and many other characters are strongly against it.Some of the descriptions of the plot as having serious fallacies as well I also think are unfair. Yes, some parts are schmaltzy and cliché but no more so than many other dramas out there. The film is beautifully done and I think Waltz does a terrific job. I actually would give the weakest performance to Reese, but I feel that that may reflect the bit of "putting her on a pedestal" that Jacob gives to her character, similar to the heroines in other recent movies such as Latika in Slumdog Millionaire. For a young actor, I think that Pattinson does a good job- you feel his passion for his work and he is likable. Perhaps not the strongest acting out there, but I am unable to think of an actor near Pattinson's age who I would have preferred to see in the role. Overall, the acting is well done and the characters are engaging.Overall, this is a wonderful and unique story. I highly recommend reading the book and I definitely think that the movie is worth seeing if you are looking for a movie with some thought and originality. Do I think this will win the Oscar for Best Picture, Best Actor, or Best Actress? No I do not. I think Supporting Actor nod for Waltz and some production awards are definitely forthcoming, and that if you are looking for a well done movie with an interesting story, you will enjoy seeing Water for Elephants.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'WATER FOR ELEPHANTS': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) 'TWILIGHT's Robert Pattinson co-stars with Reese Witherspoon in this adaptation of Sara Gruen's popular novel of the same name. The screenplay was written by Richard LaGravenese (the screenwriter of such films as 'THE FISHER KING', 'THE BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY' and 'THE HORSE WHISPERER') and the film was directed by Francis Lawrence (an experienced music video director with only two other feature films under his belt, the sci-fi action films 'I AM LEGEND' and 'CONSTANTINE'). The movie revolves around a forbidden love affair at a traveling circus during the depression era with Pattinson and Witherspoon as the two somewhat oddly matched lovers. The film as a whole is a little hit and miss but it definitely has some good moments and is entertaining for the most part.Pattinson plays a young ex-veterinary student in the 1930's named Jacob (which is kind of funny if you know anything about 'TWILIGHT') who dropped out of school when his parents were killed, after becoming greatly in debt due to him. He hops on a train and meets up with a traveling circus run by a brilliant but insane ringmaster named August (Christoph Waltz). He impresses him with his former education and knowledge of animals and is given a job as the circus vet. He then meets the beautiful star of the show, Marlena (Witherspoon), who is also August's wife. So when they fall for each other this of course spells trouble.One of the main problems with Hollywood romance films is you can't force chemistry. So just casting two popular actors together isn't going to work if they don't have it. That's the case with this film, you never truly believe Reese and Robert are in love with each other (which should be the heart of the film), but that's the problem with a lot of films so you can't fault it too much for that (and I don't think it's because of the two leads' ten years age difference, like some have noted, but it is funny that Pattinson played Witherspoon's son in a deleted scene to the 2004 film 'VANITY FAIR'). They're not horrible together and neither is really bad on their own either. Pattinson was a horrible actor in the 'TWILIGHT' films but here he's adequate (not great but OK). Witherspoon is good like always and Waltz is outstanding as the mad villain of the film (but he's really beginning to be typecast as such). The movie looks beautiful and there are some decent action scenes and thrilling moments. It does start out a little slow but it picks up and is mostly amusing from then on out. If they had only cast two more fitting actors together the movie really could have been something.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7A8qHI10rk</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Water for Elephants was a WONDERFUL book. I was afraid that no movie could compare to the delicious tale spun by Sara Gruen. I was particularly worried about Robert Pattinson being able to bring life to Jacob on screen (given that he's really only excelled at being a dead vampire). Also, the critics weren't too nice to this film.I have to say though, I was pleasantly surprised at how easily I fell back into the story with the cast of characters. As everyone else has said, the film itself was beautiful and will probably win an award for cinematography. Of course having read the book, much of the descriptive detail of the circus life and circus characters was left out of the movie. Also, the book is extremely heart-wrenching in it's description of old Jacob in the nursing home and some of that feeling was left out along the way (though the opening scene brought me to tears!). Also, some of the scenes with Rosie brought me to tears. They picked a GREAT elephant for the part!! A screenwriter has a time limit to work with when paring down a book and overall it was done very well! If you've read the book, you won't be disappointed...the meat of the story and the characters makes it to the screen. My husband had not read the book and didn't know what he was missing and liked it as much as I did (and even laughed and shuddered along the way with me).I have to say that I thought the one weak link was Reese Witherspoon. I thought her film portrayal of Marlena came across as weaker than the book version, but she was physically perfect for the part-beautiful! I loved it, it's definitely worth seeing!</fullReview>

Poor Reese did her best to help him out, but she couldn't turn this into a decent movie all by herself. The book was beautifully written but the film script was lacking any depth. The book made me cry several times but the movie was almost laughable. Actually the movie wouldn't have been so bad with a bit of decent acting but whoever decided that Pattinson would be a good choice certainly made a mistake. Reese doesn't deserve to be put up against a no talent like him. My suggestion would be to read the book and forget about this movie.

Better yet, for us gentlemen out there, the were even some intense, high-action scenes to keep us interested. Likewise, almost any type of circus animal or child-enticing aspect can be seen; this is truly a crowd pleaser that appeals to any type of personality.

		<shortDescription>Life Under the Big Top Lacks a Genuinely Convincing Lead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though this 2011 period movie makes no bones about echoing the epic romanticism of "Titanic" and offers Jack Fisk's evocative production design to back up its claim, director Francis Lawrence and screenwriter Richard LaGravenese cannot seem to conjure up the cinematic magic necessary to pull off the old-fashioned melodrama that's at the heart of the story based on Sara Gruen's best-selling 2006 novel. That's not to say there aren't any dramatically affecting moments sprinkled throughout, but taken as a whole, the film falls short in capturing the robust, often fatalistic life under the big top and the depth and complexity of the entangled protagonists, which are portrayed by a trio of stars to variable results. The "Titanic" reference is apt since Lawrence follows Gruen's similar bookending technique with nonagenarian Jacob Jankowski reminiscing in the present-day about his transformative experience working in a Depression-era traveling circus.The story flashes back to Jacob's memories of his youth in 1931 when he faces a sudden family tragedy as a veterinary student who is unable to graduate and inadvertently hops on a traveling circus train. His background in animal medicine proves helpful as he is hired to tend to the animals, in particular, a limp show horse beloved by the circus' star performer Marlena. She is married to the owner and ringmaster, August Rosenbluth, a conflicted totalitarian who thinks animals can only respond to cruel proddings and beatings. He takes an initial liking to Jacob, and soon Jacob finds himself training August's latest acquisition, a libation-loving elephant named Rosie upon which Marlena learns to perform acrobatic stunts. However, August's continued sadistic treatment of the animals, especially Rosie, proves to be a catalyst for Jacob and Marlene coming closer together. The rest of the plot is inevitable highlighted by a climactic scene where the circus animals are freed and wreak intractable havoc. Looking inspired by James Dean in "East of Eden", Robert Pattinson is an unfortunate blank slate as the younger Jacob, alternating between glazed looks and camera-ready grins.Part of the problem is the fact that the character was written to be an observer for much of the narrative, but Pattinson doesn't exhibit the chops necessary to make Jacob's situation more involving or provide a convincing transition to the feisty senior citizen played with gusto by Hal Holbrook. Reese Witherspoon has the chops but seems wrongly cast here. Known for her steely intelligence and down-to-earth demeanor ("Legally Blonde" aside), she carries a screen persona at odds with the victimized platinum-blonde glamour girl she attempts to portray as Marlena. Truth be told, the actress is too contemporary in sensibility and not languid enough for a role that would have been a better fit for the likes of Charlize Theron or even Angelina Jolie. There is also an awkward lack of romantic sparks between Pattinson and Witherspoon. Christoph Waltz, however, is terrifically malevolent as August, bringing that same odd touch of vulnerability he brought to his Nazi colonel in "Inglorious Basterds", even though the character is more predictable here. Fans of period pieces may enjoy the proceedings, but there is a nagging sense throughout that the movie could have been so much more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Dullest Show on Earth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Not Recommended) The well known proverb, " You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink ", has been in continuous use since the 12th century. Updated to 21st century tastes, that same phrase could use a slight revision, especially when discussing Sara Guen's best selling novel, Water for Elephants. Rather, one could more accurately state the following phrase: " You can lead a pachyderm to water, but you can't make it think! " Such is the case in this lumbering romantic Hollywood melodramatic film adaptation. The creative team had no real thoughts in their empty heads when they made this old fashion cliché-ridden film. Yes, no animals were hurt in the making of this film, just unsuspecting intelligent moviegoers.Richard LaGravenese wrote the screenplay and has handsomely redefined the book's characters and follows the basis outline of the book while streamlining its plot. He also has cleaned up some of the real grime and grit that brought out some of the real atmospheric color and hard times during the Great Depression. It's still Benzini's Circus, just without much of the flair and substance, although the impressive art direction by Richard Fisk has done wonders to create this intimate big tent world of clowns, misfits, gadabouts, and other motley circus performers. The strong period cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto and the romantically inspired score by James Newton Howard add the right mood. Yet the whole enterprise seems like it's all sawdust and faded sequins without much genuine drama.Francis Lawrence has done a rather pedestrian job in directing this predictable menagerie, but in all fairness to him, the source material was paper thin and hardly substantial from the start. The book was Chick Lit. 101 material and it's target audience was of the female variety. The movie takes the same aim and stays on that course, investing more time in the romance and relationship of three troubled souls. Let the swooning begin!Robert Pattinson plays Jacob, a handsome veterinary student who joins the circus to see the world and escape his miserable life. It is there that he meets the beautiful circus performer, Marlena ( Reese Witherspoon, looking right for the part, but acting wrong for the part ), who feels an instant palpable heated attraction ( Is there any other kind? ) for this newest member of the troupe. Unfortunately, she is married to an evil and bi-polar cad of a husband named August ( Christoph Waltz ), who flies into sudden rages and brims over with jealousy for this newest member of the troupe too. August is pure Snidely Whiplash all the way, and Waltz brings the successful sense of menace to this one dimensional role. As for Pattinson, he does have a strong screen presence, but his acting consists of too many reaction shots of downward glances, stoic posturing, and sullen posing. It may be right for this role, but there's no real stretch in the acting department for this teenage heartthrob.However, all are upstaged by the film's imposing main character, Rosie the Elephant, who acts rings around her three-ringed co-stars ( except for the talented pro Hal Holbrook as the older Jacob character who escapes relatively unharmed in the making of this film ). Note to actors: Beware of performing dogs, children, and now, elephants! They are hard acts to follow, and let's face it, they literally work for peanuts. So, Water for Elephants might still interest fans of romantic fiction and the lovelorn few in search of unrequited love. But this moviegoer found it to be a bit of a boring tedious mess.

		<fullReview>I was enchanted by this film. The feel, the music, the costumes. Truly a beautiful film. Story line was not complicated, things did not explode. It was a wonderfully woven story of love, loyalties, finding second chances and a little history thrown in for good measure.The story was enriched in the details and it was a lovely way to be transported for two hours and feel so many emotions all at once. I love animals so this film touched my heart. August was both charming and terrifying. Brilliant. Marlena a woman torn between a life where she finally had a family, though imperfect, and a second chance! Jacob was the eyes and ears that we saw this whole story from. I felt his every emotion and lived it with him.The secondary characters and animals were so rich and interesting.WELL DONE!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Christoph Waltz saves this movie from complete embarrassment. Miscast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Casting choices for this film are up there with the worst of them. Main character cast for his fan-base of teenage girls and certainly not his acting ability which is cringe inducing during most scenes. Yes folks,Robert Pattinson is the offending 'actor' here playing Jacob Jankowsky, played at the start of the film by Hal Holbrook. The old Jacob who is around 95, is discovered by circus staff long after the end of the show in a parking lot having run away from his nursing home after hearing the circus was in town. On discovering the old man once worked for a historic circus, the manager asks him to tell his story, so queue the narrative and now it is 1931. Jacob is a student vet who is given the tragic news of his parents demise just 2 minutes into his final exam, a rather unbelievable point that is central to the story. Would they have been any less dead had they waited 118 more minutes later,at least letting him finish his degree?Anyway I digress. As they do not, having confirmed that his apparently well known parents were indeed his parents, dropped out of uni and discovered that his parents had financed his unfinished degree with a loan secured on all their assets thus leaving him with nothing, he decides to head for the city in search of work. He ends up jumping a train that happens to be a circus train where an alcoholic old workman with no authority at any other time in the film has the authority to stop the circus owner's evil henchman from throwing him off the moving train and later helps him get a job in the circus as it's vet. He spots the circus owner's wife Marlena, played by Reese Witherspoon who is (well meant to be) a stunningly beautiful and super talented performer, the star attraction of the entire show no less, for whom he develops an infatuation. Now I have nothing against the actress as such, however the director in casting her again got it horribly wrong again. She is far too old for the character she plays and is not especially beautiful nor a performer so she just looks plain wrong as Marlena and I see little point delaying saying that her performance is probably the worst acting from her that I have seen. Whether she was trying to match her costar I know not, but she is very wooden and completely devoid of personality; not even slightly believable. Waltz plays August, the ruthless and psychotic circus master. He seems to suit such personalities rather well and it's thanks to his performance that this film isn't a complete train- wreck. (Sorry! Couldn't resist) When Jacob discovers a horse essential to Marlena's star act has a terminal condition and shoots it, August aquires an elephant and promotes Jacob to it's keeper. Initially unaware how to control the creature, there are problems which cause drama, especially when August looses his rag and attacks the poor creature to the disgust of his wife and Jacob, in fact everybody. While mad at August, Marlena starts falling for Jacob and things develop between the two, however following the assault, Jacob discovers the elephant does in fact perform really well but takes Polish commands. Due to this, their affair goes flat for a while until August next goes evil. This occurs one night when he notices a look between J and M looks far from benign. He then comes close to possibly killing J although is prevented by one of his henchmen.The 2 then jump from the now moving train as it leaves town and flee to a hotel, where they finally sleep together. Barely finished, August's henchmen find them, grab Marlena and leave him a bloody mess. After they jumped off the train, an enraged August had his henchmen throw several workman off the moving train, killing two and engaging many more. The next show, some of the enraged folks sabotage the show causing chaos. In the resulting mayhem, August again tries killing Jacob, but Marlena stops him so instead he tries to kill her. This time he is stopped by the elephant,who also happens to kill him. J and M go off together, join a rival circus.. happily ever after.So a thoroughly believable story then, made all the more believable by 2 main characters, one by their inability to act, highlighted by their tendency for sudden cheesy grinning where their only other expression - pouting feels unsuitable to him; the other by seemingly not having her heart in it, perhaps she felt as out of place as she looked but couldn't turn down the fat pay cheque? If nothing else the film will serve as an indisputable example to others of both the result of terrible casting and how you can sadly still pull in the viewers on the strength of cast member's fan base regardless of the quality of the production. The few stars I gave were purely for the performance of the elephant and some of the other veterans involved and not at all the leading pair or director.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rosie gets her man.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rosie is one smart elephant. She understands Polish commands; not really commands, but gentle suggestions. She performs her 'answers' on cue. She is perfect. This is in sharp contrast to that brute, August, who beats her and stabs her with all the grace of a Neanderthal psycho ignoramus. Elephants never forget, so it is said, so Rosie eventually doles out her own intelligent solution upon the evil August.August is cruel to animals and people. He may physically abuse his wife. It looks that way, but I don't remember actually seeing it. She knows she has to do what he says. Meanwhile, he throws employees from the train because of budgetary problems. It is the Great Depression. I know from my own historical studies that circuses struggled financially in that time period. Some of these employees were killed upon impact with the ground or sharp rocks. August could not pay them their salaries, so he just dumped them.Robert Pattinson was wonderful as younger Jacob, and Hal Holbrook was excellent as his older self. Reese Witherspoon was perfect as Marlena. She had a very nice figure, IMO, to wear those lovely and skimpy circus costumes. August was a perfect villain.I love circus history. This was a very interesting movie.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this film, not just because I'm a big Rob Pattinson fan.(He did do a wonderful job- a change from buttoned up Edward Cullen). I 'm also a fan of Reese and Christoph. The film looks perfect. Jack Fisk is to be commended for working to keep the look of the early 30's and even the costuming was excellent. It was an old fashioned love story set against the circus venue. No bad language, minimal violence and the mistreatment of the elephant was handled off screen, mostly. I read the book, and like the changes that they made to tighten up the story. Christoph Waltz gave August a more human touch even though he was a psychopath by the end. Rob brought the right tone to Jacob, fresh and naive in some ways and Reese did a fine job also. She did all her own stunts, too I read, which is amazing! I saw this film twice, both times there were some older folks in the audience and in both cases, there was applause at the end, which you don't get a lot of today. It's an old fashioned film- no explosions or car chases, just a nice story that ends well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was amazed by this movie! Now, I never read the book either but I am really considering doing it now. The story line was so sweet and exciting at the same time. I never liked Robert Pattinson in any of the Twilight films or "Remember Me" but he was the perfect Jacob. He was shy at first but then really broke out of his shell when he became more accustomed to all the animals around him.I remember when I went to the circus when I was little, and being completely in awe of the elephants; and the elephant Rosie was no different. Such a big animal being trained to obey commands on screen was pretty phenomenal.I loved all the costumes. Marlena's clothes were always pristine and time appropriate. I have never hated a movie that Reese Witherspoon was in and this one was no different. She was perfect as always.You know how in other movies they always end at a bad time and you're like "AWW Man! I wish I knew what happened to them after!" You don't feel this way in this movie. They do a little re-cap of their lives afterwards. So cute! And the older gentleman that kept popping in to re-tell the story was truly remarkable. I shed a few tears; I am not going to lie.Overall this was one of my favorite movies and I swear to you that you will love it to. You will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With his parents being killed in an auto accident on the day of his final exams to be a vet, a young man leaves college and instead joins the circus in depression stricken 1931.Robert Pattinson is wonderful in the role and he gets fine support from former Oscar winner Christoph Waltz and Renee Witherspoon. Waltz plays the sadistic circus owner and Witherspoon his wife.You definitely get the depression era feeling as the film unfolds.The problem with this film is the choppy writing which we have to endure. While the Waltz character is a definite brute, we needed to see more of this. Witherspoon rides the elephant and shows some emotion, but her part is actually quite limited in scope. It is only Pattinson who is given the opportunity to do some fine acting here. Hal Holbrook is effective as Pattinson as an older man revealing the story to another man.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was originally asked to watch this movie by my girlfriend at blockbuster. I said no. This movie had chick flick written all over it. So I watched it by myself on HBO about a month later. I thoroughly enjoyed it.Jacob Jankowsky (Robert Pattinson) a finishing student at Cornell is studying to become a veterinarian but after learning of his parents untimely death in a car accident Jacob is left with nothing. He hops the rails set in the 1930s only to join the Benzini Brothers circus. Acting as the ivy league vet Jacob quickly endears himself to the tyrannical ring leader August (Christophe Waltz) and the star attraction and ring leaders wife Marlena (Reese Witherspoon). The bond formed by Jacob and Marlena over the new elephant Rosie doesn't go unnoticed by the unpredictable August.Surprisingly Robert Pattinson isn't ridiculous at all and actually decent. Christophe Waltz is one of the best actors today and doesn't let up here. Reese Witherspoon is great in all endeavors and exudes a white glow on that elephant. The scenes are vivid and fluid with epic steam engine shots spilling across the screen. A well done picture.</fullReview>

It is a beautiful storyline that isn't complex but definitely evokes a lot of emotion from the viewer especially with the animals. The acting was really good and very believable, especially from the two main characters (Witherspoon and Pattinson) and their bond became very believable. This storyline had me gripped from the start and for anyone else who is looking for a film that is slightly different, this is what you need to watch. I have seen a lot of reviews that don't like this film but I think that this film is for a selective audience who don't mind going outside of the normal genre. Overall this film was amazing for me and I would watch it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A solid movie and captivating story, "Water for Elephants" is well thought-out and as big a spectacle as the source material it covers. Director Francis Lawrence has done his homework as the script, set design, and costuming are all strongly convincing. Stealing the show surely is Christoph Walz as a great layered antagonist - aiding in keeping the movie above water. His character is a harsh businessman who has been out in the cold it seems. The leads are not quite as good but satisfactory although Reese Witherspoon seems to have skated in her performance compared to "Walk The Line". That could be some on the direction, but the chemistry is fairly wooden between her's and Robert Patterson's character. The ending is a bit meshy and kind of thrown-in but if it's based on a novel, so be it. Still worth a watch for the general story and settings.</fullReview>

He is a horseshoer and for one thing was not impressed with what the film said was wrong with that poor horse that was supposedly going to "founder." Then also the pacing of the film seemed a bit static, and so was Reese Witherspoon's acting. Pattison certainly has potential and a good strong screen presence. The ring master part was played with great intensity, so that character was compelling to watch. And many of the bit parts were very good.

		<shortDescription>A nice, watchable movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have not read the book, so I can't say if this is a good adaptation...The movie is enjoyable, nice to watch, you don't see the time pass, the characters and their story unfolds and you're caught into it. The acting is very good, Christopher Waltz especially, alternating between brutality and tenderness. Robert Pattinson is very natural as a naive, kind-hearted, unexperienced young man struggling to find his path in life and follow it. I do not understand why some people criticized Reese Witherspoon, I thought she played the character of the mature married woman very well. Marlena knows the bitterness of life, and is mature enough to understand that her teenage dreams will never become reality. Jacob with his innocence, kindness, idealism and love of life touches her heart. And it's here that something is missing...I did not see real passion, this is not a love story ? la "English patient" or "Asylum" between a mature woman and a young man, with all the sexual tension..instead the story plays it safe, and there are just 2-3 kisses in the darkness between her and Jacob. Actually, my impression was that Marlena in a very strange way understands and pities August, and that she feels a lot of gratitude and admiration towards this man that took care of her and made her the star of the show. She knows his demons, and she is the only one who has the power to tame them and keep him sane. Her sudden change of mind to jump off the train with Jacob, and spend the night at the hotel with him seems more like a desperate attempt to find another anchor point in her life to replace the one that she has lost, than real love. And since Jacob is (fortunately) able to fulfill all her dreams, they live together forever after in domestic bliss, surrounded by their 5 children and all the circus animals (dog, elephant etc). A nice feel-good story. The only thing missing is the passion between the main characters. They're more like a middle-aged couple than two young people freshly-in-love. 7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Follows the journey of a young veterinarian as he joins the traveling circus.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Water for Elephants is based of the novel bearing the same title written by Sara Gruen and is set in great depression. Jacob (Robert Pattinson), the son of Polish immigrants, is about to finish his education to become a veterinarian before he finds himself poor and homeless. Having no other options he sets off to find a job and he encounters a train carrying a circus and is taken in by the workers. Jacob is introduced to August (Christoph Waltz), who is the owner of the circus and his stunning wife and star performer, Marlena (Reese Witherspoon). Jacob is instantly attracted to Marlena and her act and wants to spend time with her and all of the animals. August is reluctant to take Jacob in but eventually tries to become his mentor. Jacob works hard to earn his way into this family of misfits where everyone seems to have their own place. Marlena and Jacob's connection continues to grow when August acquires an Elephant named Rosie in hopes of selling out shows. Augusts' cruelty to not only the animals, but the rest of the performers is a running theme throughout the film and eventually everything comes to ahead. The movie keeps your interest and keeps you on edge that when the tragedy of this traveling circus is revealed you have no idea what to expect. This film is romantic, heartbreaking, and inspiring and very well made. The film's directing, editing, and soundtrack makes the scenes flow together so seamlessly and naturally that you have no trouble understanding the significance each situation impacts each character and the time period it is taking place. The acting of all the major and minor characters and the insight into what life was like for people throughout the great depression were realistic as to the struggles that people went through. I would highly recommend this movie and look forward to watching it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the midst of the Great Depression, a Cornell veterinary student is preparing to take his Final Exam when he gets word that both his parents have been killed in a car crash. He finds they had mortgaged the homestead to pay for his college, so in an instant, he has nothing.The man is played by Robert Pattinson, who I just don't get. This is the fifth movie of his I've seen, and he leaves me cold. Three of those have been Twilight movies in which he was woefully miscast. When you're casting against Taylor Lautner, who oozes sex from every pore, at least choose someone who could believably keep up. Someone with romantic gravitas. Kyle Schmid has makes his living playing sexy vamps on TV ( "Blood Ties" and "Being Human"). But I digress. Even in Pattinson's non-Twilight films he gives me nothing to hang my hat on.Pattinson jumps a circus train where he eventually become the vet. The star attraction, a big white horse has developed a nasty sore on its hoof. RP takes one look at it and realizes the horse is in severe pain and must be put down. The miserly owner won't hear of it, wanting to squeeze every penny out of his star. RP shoots the horse anyway, and nearly gets thrown from the moving train,.He falls in love with the beautiful rider of the horse (Reese Witherspoon), who (wouldn't you know it) is the wife of the sadistic owner (wildly overplayed by Christophe Waltz. I'm surprised the Costume Department didn't supply him with a mustache to twist)Waltz procures an elephant for a song from one the dozens of circuses that were going under at that time. He mercilessly beats the animal when it refuses to perform at first. Then, it's discovered it only understands Polish. (I swear I'm not making this up.) Eventually, RW gives in to RP's (alleged) charms, Later, Waltz discovers them. The shite hits the fan all at once, leading to a circus disaster, where the elephant saves the day!I'm always skeptical about this gimmick where the old man meets a stranger at the beginning of the movie and tells the story of his life. This time the framing device was my favorite part. Due to the wonderful Hal Holbrook, the first and the last 10 minutes provide the movie's limited pulse.What is Reese Witherspoon doing in this pile of elephant dung? Though she emerges relatively unscathed, the men don't. One barely holds the screen, the other shamelessly hams it up. Had they met in the middle, it would've been a better movie. Maybe.NOTE: I just read that Emile Hirsch auditioned for Jacob (the Pattinson role). He would've gone a good way towards single-handedly rescuing this mess. They chose chopped liver over Prime Rib.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Movie I have seen in a while</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Have you read a book and then went to see the movie it was based on and got really disappointed? For most movies and books that usually happens, but not this movie. Water for Elephants was based on a historical novel by Sara Gruen, on April 22nd 2011 directed by Francis Lawrence it was released in theaters starring Robert Pattinson and Reese Witherspoon. This movie was one the best ones I have viewed in a while it had amazing characters, unique story that had a twist to it and made you feel a part of it. The movie is set during two eras, it flashes back and forth between the Great Depression era and today's modern time. The movie shows the craziness and drama behind a circus. Robert Pattison plays a young 23 year old named Jacob. He is two days away from getting his degree in Vet school when he hears the devastating news that his parents were killed in a car accident and his family was so far in debt that he was left with nothing. Jacob in the middle night decides to leave and never look back. He jumps a train and learns very quickly that it belongs to the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth. August, who is the owner of the circus,finds out that Jacob went to an Ivy League school to be a veterinary and he hires him on to the crew to take care of the circus animals. The owner buys an elephant named Rosie from one of the dying circus's they run into on the way to a show and makes Jacob in charge of her. Marlena(played by Reese Witherspoon) is married to August, and is now part of the elephant act and starts to work with Jacob and Rosie. Jacob and Marlena become pretty close and end up actually falling in love, which causes some drama with August. In the end there is a murder that is kept a secret for years and years. The expectations of the movie were set high because of how amazing the book was. I believe that the movie met the expectations perfectly. The recreation of the 1930's and Great Depression era were done very well. The Director coordinated the important events from that time into the movie very smoothly. In the beginning of the movie it really caught your attention by starting off with the tragedy of Jacob's parents just like the novel. I could feel the sadness and confusion of Jacob when he found out the news of the accident. The movie captured all the important details and main parts of the novel that made the story so unique. The circus was everything I could imagine it would have been it made me feel a part of it every time, all the music, craziness, children running around, and view of when performers were on made me feel like I was sitting front row. The actors all played their roles perfectly and made me feel like I knew what they were thinking and feeling without saying anything. I don't think they could have found any other actors to play the roles as well as Pattinson and Witherspoon did, along with the other actors in the movie too. The movie kept me on my toes the whole time and wanting more every second. The story is very emotional and touching and the movie captured that feeling very well. I would recommend anyone who wants to see a well-played and twisted but unique storyline to see this movie whether you read the book or not, it was one of the best movies I have seen in a while. It really is amazing story that will make you cry,mad, and laugh all at the same time.</fullReview>

I actually forgot that he was that guy; wonderful. This movie was beautiful and diverse in casting of people and animals (circus). YES! I was so HAPPY to see the director had used REAL animals. There was "big realism" in this film; Reese, Rob, and Christopher (as well as others) made this movie a classic.

In the beginning, I was afraid that they were going to give a romantic portrait of the circus, with animals and people exploited in a humane (!) way. Happily they did not. The female character says both people and animals work until they drop dead, or even worse, they can not even die until their owners let them...This is very true of circuses. Good that we get to see how animals are tortured until they learn to obey, and to do stupid tricks which have nothing to do with their nature. But anyone who sees this film should not forget that it is only a mild portrait of what is going on in reality and unfortunately; nice looking vets with good intentions do not come along to save elephants and tigers so that they can spend the rest of their lives in peace. We should also remind ourselves that those animals in the film are real and actually show animals, like Rosy; so they had to learn to 'behave' at some point in their lives. With beating, torture, electric shocks...This is really ironic a film like this, supposedly judging the mistreatment of animals; makes use of the same animals...We should be aware of this irony. And each time we see an animal jumping over the fire or dancing, we have to remind ourselves that this animal had to learn to do so. Not in the best, polite way, but the exact opposite, without exception.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Honestly, there's not a lot I can really say about this. It's not particularly well made but there's nothing overly negative about it either. I think that Reese Witherspoon is an actress entirely void of any kind of life and having her in a central role always diminishes my ability to enjoy any film. So that already put it in kind of a negative light for me, but it still managed to have some solid moments. It started off pretty slow but the final act was quite intense. I like Robert Pattinson, although the role here was flat and didn't allow for him to do much. The only performer who got a shot to showcase their talent and took full advantage of it was Christoph Waltz who managed to take what could have been a caricature villain and made him interesting and highly menacing. The bookends were sentimental horse crap and Witherspoon was as unfortunate as always, but the film was middle-of-the-road overall. Nothing good, nothing bad, completely forgettable but not a horrible way to spend two hours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An awesome Novel adaptation!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is set in 1931 in the great depression time.Jacob Jankowski (Robert Pattinson) raised in a Polish family in America and studying to be a Vet like his Dad. But in the midst of his exam he is informed a shocking news that his parents died in a car accident.Young Jacob then find himself adrift with no house and no family.While walking on the side of a train track he jumped into a train for a free ride that he thought might take him to another city. But as faith brought him on board,The train belongs to a second rate circus group filled with circus performers, workers, animals and the boss of the circus group the charismatic August (Christopher Waltz) and his beautiful wife Marlena (Resse Witherspoon).This movie is beautifully made! Robert Pattinson brought about a nice portrayal of Jacob. A young man struggling for life and love. The shots in this movie is beautiful as well. There are so many emotional up and down felt in this movie. It makes me forget that Edward the Vampire is in the movie. So, kudos for Robert Pattinson for taking it up another level of good performance.The talented Resse Witherspoon perform nicely it is hard to tell whether a stunt made that jump up and down the horse and elephant. The chemistry between her and her two male co-stars are blended nicely.But Christoph Waltz! Oh, Christoph Waltz! Man, this dude sure brings the key performance. As the brutal circus owner and a possessive husband. I love this guy! He's so good. I think he can play any role! Anyway, this novel adaptation movie itself is worth watching. Francis Lawrence makes it shocking beginning, funny in the middle and tragical and so many other emotions could come up while watching this movie.It is a suitable movie where you can take your boyfriend and girlfriend to watch.</fullReview>

The Rosie character could be considered as a metaphor of Whiterspoon's character's life.Christoph Waltz steals the show in a rude manner. The man is a fantastic actor. Pattinson demonstrates he's a talented young actor while Whiterspoon plays herself and it always works.The situations could be labeled as endearing, tragical, romantic, cruel, and overall heart warming.Hal Halbrook also demonstrates he's a top actor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was dying to see this film as it looked beautifully done and I was interested to see the chemistry between Marlena (Reece Witherspoon) and Jacob (Robert Pattinson). I was not disappointed at all. Reece is superb in the role, always looking glamorous and she captures the essence of the good wife, who has a calming effect on her highly energetic, at- times explosive husband August (Christoph Waltz) as well as the captivating star of the circus show. Waltz is the real star of this movie, as his volatile character shows him as the adoring, lovable husband, and flicks to his bad tempered abusive side. Pattinson plays a likable young man, whose strong love for animals and the kindness he shows Marlena, make him appealing and believable.The scenery and filming are beautifully done, especially at the start of the movie. Being an animal lover, I struggled to watch the scenes where the animals were being abused, and showing the caged life of Circus animals. But these scenes added to creating the passion and intensity of the movie.I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Mixture of Fun, Suspense, Romance, Escapism and Adventure....And It's All Takes Place Under The Big Top</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Water for Elephants", based on the best-selling novel by Sara Gruen, is a lot of fun. Why did I say that? It wasn't me being absorbed by "Twilight" heartthrob Robert Pattinson too much or being thrown overboard into a circus where every character plays its part by setting up for the big show in the first 10 minutes of the film. It was, actually, taking me on an adventure that's a mixture filled with romance, escapism and suspense. Not to mention that the elephant named Rosie is so clever and so interesting, she could be the 4th main character in the film, as it was in the novel. The film begins and bookends with an old man named Jacob Jankowski (The legendary Hal Holbrook) telling his story about being a part of the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show On Earth to the owner of the circus (Paul Schneider). Then the story moves to the 1930's, where we meet Jacob himself (Yes, he is played by Mr. Pattinson himself), soon to be graduating from Cornell, until his parents died in a car accident. With no money and no home, Jacob leaves to find work, but hops into the train of the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth, owned by August Rosenbluth (Oscar-winner Christoph Waltz from "Inglorious Basterds"), the sadistic, but high-spirited ringleader and his showcasing wife Marlena (Another Oscar-winner, Reese Witherspoon). When Jacob starts to work for this big-top circus as a vet (and a bull man), he meets a slew of colorful characters including the elephant named Rosie (Tai the Elephant), who can really be fearless and not afraid to show a little humor in the Great Depression and did I ever tell you that having hired heavies like Blackie (Scott McDonald) are bad for this kind of movie? Not to me. You know where this is going if you never read the book because of the romance between the three main characters with Jacob and Marlena being the foremost, but director Francis Lawrence (I Am Legend) and legendary screenwriter Richard LaGravenese adapt the Sara Gruen novel with some terrific results and it never goes that way until the last half of the movie. (It's 120 minutes long, don't release your urine until it's over.) This is probably the most fun I ever had on a film like this. Fans of the novel (i.e, me) will rejoice this movie. Did I even admire the casting of Pattinson, Witherspoon and Waltz. Totally! Pattinson is a good-looking guy and a good-looking actor, he takes the fangs off of Edward Cullen and starts to feel right at home with his performance as Jacob (not the werewolf with the last name Black). He can be funny, charming, romantic, emotional and....dare I say it? Brooding. Witherspoon does remind you what a great actress she is and she does it again, this time around, she would make a great Jean Harlow. Tai as Rosie the elephant is incredible. And Waltz's August makes for an intriguing character instead of a villainous character. He warms our hearts, but underneath this charm that he's got, he has a sadistic side that's waiting to pounce on Jacob. This movie made me smile. It's a real escapism of a adventure. Need a place to get away from your troubles? Then come on down to The Most Spectacular Show on Earth in "Water for Elephants" and have yourself a very good time. P.S: "Water for Elephants" is perfectly fine for children 12 &amp; up despite one love scene, but the shocker for this PG-13-rated film is the abuse of animals being depicted. Take this note into consideration before you see this film.</fullReview>

I can only mention good things about the film: circus, 1930s, USA and of course the fabulous music through the whole movie. Plus the actors (Pattinson, Waltz), and Reese Witherspoon made a fantastic job. I hope, Waltz will have the chance to win another Oscar-prize after Inglorious Basterds. Robert Pattinson can expect a bright future in his career. I think he made a mistake with that vampire-story, but he acted quite good in Remember Me, and now he became a professional actor with the Water for the Elephants. I don't know, why it got only 7.0 on IMDb. I hope, bye the time it starts to spread in other countries and becomes more and more popular, this number will be increasing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite extraordinary..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a relief and delight to see such a grand and lavish 1930s epic circus film made in this clever new century. WATER FOR ELEPHANTS is perhaps not a good marquee movie title which is possibly what it was slow on the uptake in most cinemas. However word of mouth propelled the film into wide acceptance and rightly so. With astonishing accurate and eye catching production values by the great Jack Fisk, and imagery as compelling as the 1933 film WILD BOYS OF THE ROAD (the great depression era train movie), this circus drama of hard life and tough romance meeting youth and struggle (with some psychotic love) is one heady brew. Visually every frame of the film is composed with such care especially the moonlit vistas of the train chugging across the countryside. Robert Pattinson is Elvis' brother...yes? He might be Aaron reincarnated. He sure looks as though he could easily be the brother of Elvis Presley. Reece Witherspoon gives a terrific portrayal of a B grade circus Jean Harlow with a hard edge (maybe even like Karen Black in DAY OF THE LOCUST) and the fringe cast are all well portrayed. My only moan is the one-note Christop Walz who plays August the ringmaster and bully as the same cultured Nazi psychopath seen in INGLORIOUS BASTERDS. So far in his two films that I have seen he plays it the same. Yes go see WATER FOR ELEPHANTS and especially on a big movie screen. And yes, I loved Rosie the elephant.</fullReview>

I'm not entirely sure if there's a true story or aspects of it behind the film but it wouldn't have made a difference. It's definitely a tear jerker and I had to look away a few times at the intense parts.Reese Witherspoon and Robert Pattinson were great together. I hadn't seen any of the Twilight movies and I wasn't planning on great acting but he really played the part well. All in all, I highly recommend watching this.

		<shortDescription>Circus life is awful.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Can anything good result in evil? Can anything evil result in good? These questions are answered in the recent 20th Century Fox presentation of Sara Gruen's novel. The story takes place during the Great Depression of the 1930's. A veterinary student is forced to leave school as a result of his parent's death. He jumps aboard a moving train at night and immediately realizes it's a circus train. And that's about it: A circus, economic hard times, and a man who has lost everything. How much worse can it get? We will find out quickly. And this is what makes the film so enjoyable. We enter this world with our hero and learn about the harsh brutality of circus life. We see performers, animals, roustabouts, and acknowledge their desperation, living conditions, and poverty, more than the exhibition of their talent. We see the circus as it really is: humanity struggling to survive.Amid this backdrop is the owner and ring master, August, played by Christoph Waltz. His portrayal of a cruel psychotic deserves an Oscar.The PG-13 rating is warranted. I don't think I would want to see such a film if it were rated R. Circuses wreak of desperation. They have done so since their beginnings, thousands of years ago. The circuses we see today, Ringling Brothers and Circus Vargas are vestiges of Eastern Europe. Indeed, many circus performers today have their ancestry rooted there, particularly Russia. These are a hard-working, dedicated people, very clannish and tight-knit within their community. They are very accustomed to the rigors and uncertainty of their gypsy-like existence. They are a hard people.The adventure of our hero gradually becomes a life-threatening one. This ingredient in the story is exciting, but the overall story is formulaic and eventually clichéd. Yes, good can come from evil and evil from good. This is nothing new.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I chose this film originally because of the actor Robert Pattinson, who I really liked in the Twilight films. I went with my b/f and I didn't think that he would enjoy it that much because he isn't into romantic comedies and he doesn't rate the Twilight saga however he really enjoyed this film and so did I. The film had a great story line, which was quite original. I personally feel Robert Pattinson (Jacob) played his part better than Reece Witherspoon whose acting wasn't too great in some parts but it was only in parts and it didn't ruin the film. All the other actors were great. The is quite a good one, one that you love to hate. Overall I would definitely recommend this film to anyone, especially the R-PATT fans out there!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say I was very pleasantly surprised with how well the movie was adapted from the book even though some parts were omitted or truncated. Even more surprising was how well my husband liked the movie. We talked about it for quite some time after leaving the theater. It just left us thinking about so many things in life.Although there were parts that were hard to watch, you couldn't help but be captivated by the classic tale of good vs. evil and love vs. hate. The movie did a great job of portraying the "illusion" of the grand circus life with the beautiful scenery and costumes versus the actual hardship behind the scenes. I can't remember the last time I went to a movie where the audience actually clapped, not only once, but twice. There was an overwhelming sense of justification at the end of this movie.All the actors did a great job, including "Rosie". Rob Pattinson was able to convey so many emotions through his eyes, facial expressions, and actions. Reese Witherspoon was able to portray someone who was so strong yet vulnerable at the same time. And Christoph Waltz as August was the guy you loved to hate.All in all, this has to be one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I am so glad I went to see it and highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid Hollywood Nostalgic Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie seems to have been marketed as a romance. This is not a surprise given the recent success of Robert Pattinson in the Twilight franchise of movies. But this is inaccurate of what the movie is, certainly there is a romantic element, but it is also the story of one young man's journey to find himself after tragedy changes his current course in life and also an adventure in a forgotten time of hardship and survival.From the opening which starts in current times we meet an old man who starts to tell the story of a significant period in his life many years ago, not unlike 'The Green Mile' &amp; 'Titanic'. We are then transported back to 1930s America to see this story unfold. Jacob's(Pattinson) life is turned upside down with the death of his parents and an inability to support himself sees him hit the road without any solid plan. He jumps aboard a train only to find it belongs to a circus struggling to survive no doubt like many other enterprises during the great depression. Starting as a labourer his veterinarian skills become known to August the head of the circus played by Christoph Waltz, and he becomes part of the circus' 'family'. His wife the younger Marlena(Reese Witherspoon) is the star attraction of the show and catches the attention of Jacob.Christoph Waltz with his brilliant performance in Inglourious Basterds may seem slightly typecast as the sadistic tyrant of this circus but he pulls it off well and you can see in the harshness of the times they live in how he can justify to himself to act as he does but you offer him no sympathy. His long suffering wife feels this reality is as good as it gets for her while young Jacob feels he can make a change in this unforgiving of circumstances. It is certainly an informative glimpse into tougher times given our current economic struggles in this day and age and may leave you counting your blessings. Witherspoon pulls off a good performance and Pattinson demonstrates that there is more to his range.Overall this is a solid drama, I stress not just a romance that will keep you entertained and sufficiently satisfied after it's 2 hours. Oh, and there's an elephant in it too which is lovely!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say I really liked this film a lot and actually considered giving it a 9. I'd read the usual reviews in the various newspapers and I do feel a bit like people hold the Twilight series against Robert Pattinson, but it seems that's very unfair. The reviews were mediocre at best, so I went to see the movie without any real expectations and I loved it! I thought the film had a warm and watchable quality. The trailer didn't give as much away as I'd thought it did and so there was more to it than I thought there might be. It was a lovely warming story, the old guy at the start telling the story was also great! The elephant was the star I have to say, but I think Robert Pattinson finally proved to all that he can act and he does the character justice. Everyone in the cast did well, especially I thought, for the characters that didn't have major parts, but you really liked them. I loved the story, it gave you a look at what the circus must be like especially in the backdrop of the Depression, although the depression angle didn't come through quite as much. It's definitely worth a watch, I honestly don't think you'll be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well Produced and Stands on Its Own</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One can never expect too much from a novel to film, but the producers and cast of this film HAVE made a film which brings to life the grittiness and the emotions of Sara Gruen's best seller. Watching the great production design and cinematography, it was the shabby, faded, patched, mended, and not so Hollywood glamorous which I found so effective in conveying the desperation and live for this moment Depression era. The reactions of the circus audiences were well captured, since we now are so high tech we need to remember the shock and awe of the hooch dancers tent and the chance to see exotic Rosie the elephant veer so close to the audience benches. The main and supportingcharacters, by the way, were wonderful in scenes with the horses andthe elephant, it never looked unnatural or too artfully posed with the animal trainers just a hair out of the shot. I thought Witherspoon and Pattinson were well cast and though some of her costumes were outwardly glamorous, she always conjured up the real pain, weariness, and cynicism born of her own bad choices. Her circus costumes were appropriate for a struggling circus, not Hollywood flashy and sexy. Its fair to say Waltz does quite well with another brutal, unsympathetic character (always in uniform, so to speak, with a subtler accent) and I really hope to see him cast in perhaps a contemporary role that will offer facets beyond the danger lurking under the charm surface. Don't worry about having read the novel--you will find this movie transports you to another time and place with some Old Hollywood magic but with even more attention to the timeless themes of hard worn love and loyalty</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Storytelling at its finest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was fortunate enough to see Water for Elephants this morning in a free preview screening. My gut instinct before going into the cinema was telling me that I wouldn't like this film. I wasn't entirely sure what the film was about but my favourite genre is somewhere between drama/thriller to give you some context. I was under the impression, purely based on the trailer and poster, that this was going to be quite a slow-paced, mushy flick. Also, I only know of Robert Pattinson from the Twilight Saga, which I have never watched but associate with teeny boppers.I am pleased to report that Water for Elephants is not an overly mushy film. It's a well- rounded offering and has elements of action, suspense, excitement and a dollop of wonderment to boot. The film had me gripped from the start, there was never a dull moment and it irks me to say that it was a really great cinematic experience.Afterward, upon leaving the auditorium, I realised that I appreciated the casting of Robert Pattinson, as the lead actor, for two reasons:1) The guy can actually act and unbeknownst to me he is also quite talented - he made the Oscar-winning Reese Witherspoon look dazzlingly ordinary in my humble opinion.2) As a British actor he acquits himself with an American accent far better than any recent attempts in the reverse direction (see Russel Crowe in Robin Hood for example - OK he's not a Yank but you get the gist). Nothing gets to me more than actors failing with a fundamental tool of their craft - their voice.Finally, without spoiling any of the plot I am compelled to point out that the villain (another Oscar winner no less) Mr. Christoph Waltz was the real star of the show. His part will definitely draw comparisons, as well as plaudits, with his Inglorious Basterds outing. But I think it would be a faux pas to lumber his performance with that tag. He plays a far more nuanced baddie, one that is tormented by demons and is feeling the pressure, as many in society currently are, of an economic recession (The Great Depression) forcing his hand.This film undoubtedly works well as a choice for couples as there is a romantic undercurrent carrying much of the plot so that one could crudely confine it to the romance category. But there is so much more reason to see this as a dramatic adventure, a leap back in time to a period when the circus was the pinnacle of entertainment and as a spectacular specimen of spellbinding storytelling :-)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Circus is a way of life with a mystique about which we could all fantasize. At a time when the nation was struggling with "The Great Depression", ladies, gentlemen and children of all ages longed for reprieve from their everyday hardship. That traveling show of daredevils, clowns and acrobats provided such relief.When an unexpected tragedy strikes at the heart of Jacob (Robert Pattinson), he abandons his dream of becoming a veterinarian and sets out on a journey which leads him to the to a traveling circus fronted by the sadistic ringmaster August (Christoph Waltz). Jacob faces many trials along this journey and even though many of the circus personnel do not accept him, his infatuation with Marlena (Reese Witherspoon) keeps him working toward becoming an official member of the circus family.The look and feel of the film is excellent in the portrayal of a time in our history when men and women struggled for survival in an uncertain economy. Christoph Waltz does a very good job in portraying a controlling -sometimes out of control - boss and husband.The movie has many superb moments and also some very lackluster scenes. Fortunately, the good moments out weigh the bad and overall is an enjoyable film. I am not so sure that teenagers would enjoy the film as much as an older audience, but all in all is a worthwhile trip to the movie theater.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Water for Elephants Review by FeaturedFlicks.com</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Water for Elephants has a genuine old time charm that is unmistakable. Based in the great depression this film takes a look at beauty during hard times. This film is based on the best selling book and I can't imagine how challenging it would be to narrow down 4,000 pages into a 120 minute film and from someone who hasn't read the book I think they did a great job. The attention to detail was authentic and allows the viewer to simply enjoy the film as if they were in another time period.The story was straightforward and didn't have any alarming twists or turns. The audience is very in tune with Jacob's life. Where he came from and what he is all about. I wish there would have been more of a back-story on the other two leads Marlena and her husband August. Knowing more about Marlena and August would help the viewer to feel more connected and understanding of some of their choices. The actors and actresses all did a wonderful job. Reese Witherspoon was beautifully brilliant as usual and Pattinson gets by on his talent rather than his looks for a change. Christoph Waltz plays the villain again and he is suspiciously talented at playing the bad guy. The three leads do a wonderful job at connecting with the audience and making every interaction more personal. The sights and sounds of the circus were exciting. Having an insider's perspective on the time period and the traveling train circus was very cool and this should be a movie everyone should see in the theater.</fullReview>

(I don't know if this would be considered a spoiler or not) For those who read the book, they kept as close to the novel as they could within a 90 minute movie would allow. Hal Holbrook made for a wonderful older Jacob, and how they transfered the storyline into the younger Jacob (Robert Pattinson) was well-done and interesting. Chistophe's character was made to hate and how he played the role, he didn't disappoint me at all. He was terrific! As was Reese...she is hands-down beautiful and I really enjoyed watching her interact with the animals. As for Robert, well this was the role that will bring him out of the Twilight and into the Sunlight!! He was terrific in this movie and I really enjoyed seeing him do something different then playing a 17 year old boy, and playing the man that he is. I have followed Roberts career since he started in movies...and this really excited me. To see where this young man is going to go with his career! It's going to be terrific to watch.

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Water for Elephants</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There aren't too many circus related films these days, with the last I can recall being Tim Burton's Big Fish, so this was a refreshing shot in the arm rather than to revisit yet another comic book film, or a reboot / remake. And with a circus comes the myriad of bountiful performances from clowns to acrobatic acts, right down to the taming of the lion even, that we the audience get to enjoy ringside seats at the celluloid big top spectacular, under the guidance of ringmaster August (Christoph Waltz), an astute businessman with a violent temper and penchant to get to his objectives set through any means possible.Jacob, a Cornell veterinarian undergraduate into his last legs of study until a family tragedy meant a wiping of kin and money, forcing the kid to grow up fast and take to the streets in order to survive. In a stroke of coincidence he finds himself in the company of a circus troupe headed by August who decided to take the chap in based upon his close qualifications, in a session that really hit the nail on the head with its rationale of providing talent a chance at something rather than be bounded by paper certificates. It's not always easy for the new guy in the various orientation / honeymoon stages of a new job where he's tasked to look after the circus animals, and then that of its star attraction, the aged elephant christened Rosie.What I enjoyed about the film isn't the romance, but rather how the troupe opted to survive under the leadership of August, who doesn't always make the popular decisions, but the right ones, sometimes dubious, necessary to ensure the continuation of their corporation. In some ways it almost resembles local politics even, where this party got chosen for its leadership team, who often also has enough muscle to dish out punishment if someone were to stray from the party direction. A conforming behaviour is expected where questions aren't supposed to be raised, and everyone going about their assigned duties to ensure economic survival in dire straits, with leaders obsessed with performance and revenue figures, while at the same time highlighting how those who fail to perform get unceremoniously tossed aside, since they aren't contributors and the circus isn't a welfare. Every conceivable trick of a circus or performance having to employ its own insiders, cannot get more pronounced here, which makes it quite fun to observe at the wayside, showing the darker side to things we seldom see beneath the surface.But the film isn't really all about Circus Tycoon, than it is about the troubled romance between a married woman, and the newest kid on the block. Smittened by Marlena (Reese Whitherspoon), Jacob tries to keep his feelings under wraps but I guess when there's an almost animalistic like attraction between a couple, no force in this would could come in between. And here's where I thought the romance failed with the pairing of Whiterspoon and Pattinson, with one clearly older than the other, and it shows in the most unlikeliest of pairings that makes it a stretch to believe they could be anything more than platonic friends, with weak attempts at innuendo to betray their true feelings. It could also be that biting the hand that feeds you isn't my cup of tea in the first place, and the love shown by the respective individuals for the elephant they have to work with, chalks up more mileage instead, with emotions running a little deeper especially when they have to rehabilitate the mammal.Those who suspect Robert Pattinson's acting chops outside of the wildly popular Twilight series will probably change your mind when you see him whip up a spectrum of emotions as a youth at the crossroads of his life having opportunities ahead of him being whisked from under his feet, from downcast with losing the only folks he knows in the world, to the elation of finally being accepted and finding meaningful work with his own abilities. Reese Whitherspoon on the other hand didn't lift her game opposite her more youthful co-star, and didn't look at all comfortable which shows in the film.Animal lovers will likely take offense at Christoph's ruthless portrayal of August, which is a good thing as he makes it easier to dislike his sociopathic character. Like his previous roles in Inglourious Basterds and The Green Hornet, he lulls you into complacency with a friendly demeanour, only for his true colours to show later on which provides that additional sucker punch feeling of danger as you realize the presence of pure evil. But the brilliance of Christoph's portrayal also means playing the sympathetic card as well, since the real push of the character over the edge, is the slow losing of the grip on his wife, and his troupe as well, in what would be a CG filled final act that didn't quite look too polished.Francis Lawrence that took a leaf from how James Cameron's Titanic bookended the film, with Water For Elephants delivering a surprisingly enjoyable period piece with great production values set around train travels, animals and circus acts, complete with emotional maturity befitting a classic, if not for the relative weaker romantic elements to rob it of some shine.</fullReview>

The acting is impressive and very well cast. This unique story was brought to life in a creative and realistic manner. While this film is very much geared towards women, it can be a pleasant surprise to most audience members. It makes you apart of a world that is completely different and unknown to us today. If you are looking for a whimsical story of illusion and survival, Water for Elephants is the film to see.See it!http://burningreview.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this was a wonderful movie.The story is interesting, the acting good, and the photography and production values outstanding.Of the three main actors - Robert Pattinson, Reese Witherspoon and Christoph Waltz, I'd go with Waltz as the best. Man, I've only seen this guy in two movies but he is fantastic, just riveting. In here, he plays a circus owner named "August." He's a complex man, and you never know what to expect from him.There are all kinds of characters in this film, but I guess you'd expect that when the story is about a circus in the early 1930s. Despite that variety of characters, the story flows as smooth as silk, a credit to the director and screenwriters.This is one of the few times I actually prefer the movie over the book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I honestly don't know how critics could award this film less than 3 and 1/2 stars, if not 4. Every aspect of it was made with such beauty and skill that it's incredible. The score, the cinematography, the performances by the three leads were all perfect. If you want a movie to take you on an emotional roller coaster, if you want to walk out of the theater feeling exhilarated, and if you want to see how film can truly be art, then this is the movie for you.I almost never get on IMDb, and I've certainly never written a review for them before. Thats how much I loved this movie. Christoph Waltz, my hat goes off to you sir for a stunning performance. When an actor can convince me, someone who has read the book and knows how dark this character is, that he is not all that bad... I would say that he most certainly did his job as a performer and more. I would liken his performance to Ralph Fiennes' portrayal of Amon Goeth in Schindler's List- yes it's that good. The ever changing emotions and how his eyes go from warm and inviting one minute to cold and cruel the next is downright fascinating.Robert Pattinson blindsided me as well. Water for Elephants is one of my favorite books, and I was more than disappointed when it was announced that he would be playing the title role. I was sure that the pasty little vampire boy would bring the rest of the cast down. Wrong-0! Pattinson proves that with competent directing comes even more competent acting. He and Witherspoon are great together. Reese- what can I say? She remains one of my favorite actresses.So all in all, its a much needed break from the mindless crap out there nowadays. If you yearn for movies that offer something more, that divulge such raw human emotion, than I would say this is the ticket for you. Now go see the most spectacular show on earth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stigma and Sensibility</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film followed a book that was read by countless book clubs, my own being no exception. I've wondered why on earth this second rate story has been so over-rated by both readers and film goers and all I can conclude is that many of us have a nostalgic draw toward circuses and a huge soft spot for sad animal stories.Both book and film do a fine job of capturing the feel of a depression era circus. Hence two stars.Everything else was weak and flawed. The dialogue was corny and far too contemporary. The film's many heavy handed lessons; be kind to people of other races, be kind to animals, poor people have a rough life, all were obvious enough for Sunday school class. The romance was slow and served to point out the over-the-top sensitivity of the main character who seemed to be too soft for his chosen field, let alone circus life. His university had a huge scholarship program for veterinary students at that time, he should have checked it out before he ran away to the circus.The films biggest flaw was it's "diagnosis," of August as a paranoid schizophrenic. He is shown to have huge mood swings going from highly competent manager to irrational rage. These are not symptoms of schizophrenia, bipolar maybe, but no unmedicated schizophrenic would have the organizational skills needed to manage a circus or carry on a persona of elegant competence. August didn't hear voices, have delusions, or lose contact with reality, he was just a cruel, violent person and the movie, while being so pointedly politically correct in other areas, does a great deal to promote fear and stigma against the mentally ill by falsely labeling August as schizophrenic. Apart from all else the term schizophrenia wasn't commonly used at that time. Doctors would have said dementia praecox and lay people would have called it insanity or simply madness.This film would be harmless, if childish, entertainment if not for it's potential to further stigma against the mentally ill. But then, "schizophrenia" has served as a quick substitute for actual character motivation by lazy writers for a long time, I guess we shouldn't be surprised.</fullReview>

Reese Witherspoon and Christopher Waltz played great parts, as did all the other cast. I had to stay in the theater until the credits were almost done because I had tears streaming down my cheeks. It's a sweet story and I will see it again and own it when it is available on DVD. Robert Pattinson definitely held his own with Reese Witherspoon and Christopher Waltz. The scenery was beautiful and the animals were exciting to see, too. The allusions to the Depression were not blatant but understood and the costumes were beautiful.

		<shortDescription>Robert Pattinson needs to take a break</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Originally my intent was to sit and write a sophisticated review of the film. However, sometimes, I think keeping things simple is the best way to go.Simply put, this is yet another film in which we are subjected to Robert Pattinson's style of acting. I think he needs to take some time off from leading rolls; I believe Twilight has pushed him to the top before he was ready to handle such a position. He is young, and he does show some promise, but, right now, he just isn't cut out to be the lead in a movie... really, even his Twilight part wasn't done very well, and the movie mainly survived because of a rabid fan-base (much like Hayden Christensen in star wars.) Get a cardboard cut out; have someone do voice overs, and you'd get about the same experience.What makes it worse is that the movie in general just wasn't very good. Too many parts which made the book somewhat enjoyable did not translate very well into film. If you want to watch this -and I'm sure there are many people who will love it (I'm just not one)- pay the dollar to rent it from a Red Box and borrow it from a friend. If you pay movie theater prices or buy the DVD, I think you'll kick yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Soap Opera Lacks Flair or Heart; Waltz Is Great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Water for Elephants" is a flat soap opera lacking flair or heart or even coherence. It's a love story set in a Depression-era circus; how could it be so boring? Direction and miscasting. Director Francis Lawrence never milks the Depression or the circus setting. He directs as if in the suburban living and bedrooms of television's Pine Valley. You never get the sense of how a Depression-era, small-town kid would be thrilled, terrified, and curious seeing a lion or an elephant for the first time. There are a couple of what appear to be CGI shots of a train chugging across moonlit landscapes; even these lack magic.Robert Pattinson, star of the teen-vampire sensation "Twilight," is miscast as Jacob, the lead character, a circus vet. Pattinson displays the skills necessary to make teenage girls swoon: he pouts, he broods, he is self-absorbed, he makes zero intellectual or psychological demands on his audience. He has heavy brows and lots of hair. These skills deserve respect. They cause teen girl fans to post reviews of his work that end in multiple exclamation points!!!!!!! But Pattinson is in so far over his head in "Water for Elephants" all you see of him, in some scenes, are bubbles on the surface as he sinks into invisibility.Reese Witherspoon is a crisp and perky professional with shiny hair and perfect teeth. Problem is, she's playing Marlena, an orphan trick horse rider who marries an abusive circus boss, August (Christoph Waltz.) Marlena should exude desperate vulnerability combined with manipulative power, the kinky raw sex appeal of a woman who, scantily clad in skin-tight, revealing costumes, performs suggestive tricks with muscly animals in front of applauding throngs. Witherspoon doesn't even try to bring that Marlena to life. She just plays Reese Witherspoon, professional movie star with flawless hair and teeth, a little bit bored as Oprah interviews her. There's nothing of the abusive orphanage, the poor street, the skanky Big Top about her at all.Robert Pattinson's Jacob and Reese Witherspoon's Marlena have zero chemistry. They are the least sexy screen couple I've ever seen. Al Gore and Bill Clinton had more chemistry. When they do kiss, it's not that long-awaited, thrilling moment of release. It's "Huh?" Christoph Waltz as August, the circus owner, is from a completely different, much better, movie. People are going to walk out of this film wishing that they could have seen the movie centered around Christoph Waltz's August. Waltz demands the audience's attention in a way that no one else in the film does, except Tai as the elephant, Rosie. Waltz's nuanced performance brings to life an August who is very complex and worth caring about, despite his being a monster.It's clear that Sara Gruen, the book's author, and the filmmaker wanted to tell a story that featured lots of animals. The plot is a cobbled-together, soulless bit of scaffolding on which to hang shots of circus animals and shallow depictions of circus rituals. Why is Jacob a Polish speaker? Why is the elephant a speaker of Polish? Most Polish immigrants to the US at this time were descendants of recently liberated serfs, and did very harsh manual labor in the US: coal mining, steel, cleaning. It's very unlikely that a Polish speaker would be an Ivy League veterinary school graduate. In any case, the film makes no use of Jacob's ethnicity. He could as easily be Spanish or Italian or Greek. Why would a man who had the focus and self-discipline to complete an Ivy League veterinary school education toss aside, literally, everything he has worked for, and everything he owns, to jump on a passing train? The moment utterly lacks verisimilitude and psychological depth. It's obvious that the film just wants to get to its circus setting and animals. Jacob is just a pawn. Why is the film told as an old man's flashback? That approach, and the voice-over narration, add nothing to the film.</fullReview>

The movie is from 2005 and shows how elephants are subjected to electric shocks and how they are beaten during the "training".This is actually how the elephant got trained before the movie started.

		<shortDescription>Great Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story of a Depression-era orphan with an all but completed study from a prestigious university, this film centers around Jacob Jankowski. First seen as an elderly man (Hal Holbrook) Jankowski was studying to become a veterinarian when his parents died in debt after exhausting their savings to pay his tuition. With no home or money to complete his studies, Jankowski (as a younger man played by Robert Pattinson) simply abandons his home, studies, and life in search of employment. This search ended when he hopped a train utilized by the Benzini Bros. traveling circus. After a brief stint shoveling excrement, August Rosenbluth, the man in charge, hires him as Benzini Bros. own Cornell educated veterinarian. Rosenbluth is played by Christopher Waltz who soon proves to be just as evil as he was when he was playing an SS officer. His long-suffering wife is played by Reese Witherspoon who is the star of the big top with her equestrian act and with a similar elephant act. But when the act struggles to take shape in the beginning, Rosenbluth demonstrates the brutality lying beneath his charismatic show persona by viciously attacking the elephant. He later appears sickened by his actions, but Jacob is certain he'll repeat them and determined to prevent that from happening. In developing the act, Marlena (Witherspoon) and Jacob become attracted to each other. While trying to keep their relationship a secret, they're eventually found out. This and other tensions arising from the shows continuing financial struggles eventually boil over in the form of an employee insurrection, the result of which was alluded to in earlier scenes with the older Jankowski. Whether Titanic started it or simply solidified it, Leonardo DiCaprio became the dream of teenage girls everywhere thanks to the James Cameron opus. And, as a result of that and a genuine dislike for the story and the film, I have hated DiCaprio ever since. He's made, for the most part, quality films ever since and I'm convinced he's so not for his career but simply to annoy me. Others would argue he has no idea who I am, but I feel that's immaterial. Pattinson, thanks to the Twilight series, finds himself in a similar position. With this and Remember Me he seems intent on making quality films to annoy me. Witherspoon and Waltz, while demonstrating great range with these roles, are more than adequate. The story is engrossing, the scenery spectacular, and the ending is satisfying (though I understand the book version was far more dramatic). All in all, I'd call this a superior film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Water for Chocolate," an impressive look at how life used to be lived in Mexico, had appeared ten years earlier, so I guess it was time for "Water for Elephants," an evocative look at how life used to be lived in a 1930-era circus in rural America.I can't imagine any other reason for giving this romantic drama the title it has except for the earlier success -- commercial and critical -- of the Mexican film, can you? Well, you say, there IS an elephant in the movie, and there IS water, and on one or two occasions they're brought together. Still, I can't help thinking that -- Enough of this alter-casting rhetoric. A young, awkward drop out from veterinary school, Robert Pattinson, lands a job with a strapped circus run by Christoph Waltz, who gives the best performance in the movie as the demon-haunted owner and ring master. Waltz has a wife, the petite and nicely assembled Reese Witherspoon, who rides animals. The circus has a miniature zoo with zebras, hyenas, and lions and tigers. The newly acquired elephant is named Rosie. So Waltz needs both the veterinarian manqué and the beautiful wife to maintain the acts.The young Pattinson and the sexy Witherspoon are attracted to one another -- Pattinson by youthful ardor, Witherspoon by desperation. Man, Christoph Waltz is a tough man to deal with. He's jealous to the point of paranoia. He brutalizes the animals. He throws sick employees off the moving train, sometimes to their deaths, so he doesn't have to pay their fare. He drinks booze like it was going out of style. His charm is all on the surface. And yet Waltz pulls off the amazing feat of making us feel some sympathy for his character because of his torment.It's leagues away from a Walt Disney animal movie, despite that title, which I can't shake from my preconscious, but there's not much that's truly original about it. Rosie the elephant, thank God, is given no human traits, the pathetic fallacy, until the very end, at which point the entire movie collapses along with the Big Tent.Nicely photographed in shades of buff and tawn, but it would have been nice if more use had been made of locations. It's supposed to be the Great Depression and prohibition, but if we weren't told it was so, we'd have a bit of trouble finding it out. There's very little in the way of local color, and I've seen Roger Corman movies that paid more attention to period detail.Yet, it's informative in its own way. There have been a lot of circus movies around over the years so we've come to know that they're pretty cohesive and establish firm social borders between themselves and outsiders. They even have their own lingo -- beyond "Hey, Rube!" -- which we hear little of, alas.It's all told in flashback by Hal Holbrook as an old man applying for a job with a circus as a ticket taker, now that his love and his elephant are both dead. The musical score is fey and magical. Lifted from Elmer Bernstein's "To Kill A Mockingbird."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Less a circus film than a romantic film with a circus setting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1931, during the Great Depression, young Polish American Jacob Jankowski is a veterinary medicine student at Cornell University. Unfortunately, his parents are killed in a car crash, leaving him nothing but debts, and he is left homeless when the bank forecloses on the family home. Jacob is forced to abandon his studies and becomes a homeless wanderer. He joins the Benzini Brothers Circus, initially as a labourer, but when the circus owner, August Rosenbluth, discovers that Jacob has studied veterinary science he is hired as a vet for the circus animals. The rest of the plot is essentially a love-triangle comprising August, Jacob and August's attractive younger wife Marlena. Indeed, one could call it a love-rectangle, with the fourth member being Rosie, the elephant who is the circus's star attraction.The best acting performance comes from the Austrian actor Christoph Waltz as August. This is in many ways a difficult part to play, as August is really the villain of the film. At one point he states that as the circus owner he is head of his own sovereign state. Unfortunately, however, this state is a dictatorship. August is an autocratic figure who will tolerate no dissent or criticism, and keeps a squad of paid thugs who will beat up anyone who crosses him. Although his business involves working with many animals, he is no animal lover, and is guilty of cruelly mistreating the animals in his care, especially Rosie the elephant.Anyone who criticises his methods is dismissed as a mere sentimentalist; according to August people who care about the suffering of animals only do so because they do not care about human suffering. The weakness in this argument is that August does not seem to care about human suffering very much himself. Those who provoke his anger are threatened with being thrown off the circus train. While it is moving. Jacob is threatened with this treatment after he dares to put down a valuable horse which was suffering from a painful and incurable foot condition. August is also a jealous and possessive husband who sometimes treats Marlena roughly.Waltz, however, plays August as someone more complex than just a straightforward villain. He is not simply an evil man, but someone who appears to be suffering from a split personality; at times he can be affable and charming. Much of the roughness in his character seems to be the result of the financial problems of keeping the circus on the road during the hard times of the Depression, and his possessiveness of Marlena may stem from a genuine love for her.Of the other actors, there is a good cameo from Hal Holbrook who appears as the elderly Jacob in "bookend" opening and closing scenes, probably set around 1990. Robert Pattinson as the young Jacob does enough to show that he is a decent actor as well as a male sex symbol, and Reese Witherspoon as Marlena gives another in a series of good performances which have shown that there is a lot more to her than her airheaded "Legally Blonde" persona. The film is that Hollywood rarity, a love story based around a romance between a younger man and an older woman- Witherspoon is ten years older than Pattinson- and it is interesting to note that the difference in their ages is not made an important plot point as it was, for example, in "The Graduate" or "Prime".Circus dramas, such as "The Big Circus" and Cecil B. De Mille's "The Greatest Show on Earth", were popular in the fifties, a period when the cinema was desperate for spectacle in order to compete with television. "Water for Elephants", however, is not really a film of that type, even though it ends, in time-honoured fashion, with a disaster. (At least this does not involve a train crash or a fire, those traditional clichés of the circus melodrama). There are no death-defying stunts on the high wire or the flying trapeze and no clown whose smiling face hides a tragic or guilty secret. It is less a circus film than a romantic film which just happens to have the circus for a setting, and as such it works very well, generating both excitement and touching human drama. And all animal-lovers will adore Rosie the elephant, who deserves to become a big star in her own right. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A magical tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a magical film, based upon the novel of the same title by animal-lover Sara Gruen. The film is set in 1931, during the Great Depression, and concerns a travelling 'train circus'. Although circuses later switched to road transport, at this time, they toured America in special trains of their own, as vividly portrayed here. Sara Gruen had no circus background herself and stumbled across this subject, which she then researched obsessively for a considerable time. The story is thus largely an accurate portrayal of what a train circus, complete with its collection of wild animals and even wilder humans, was like at that time. One of the stars of the film is an old circus elephant named Tai, who is called Rosie in the film and supposed to be aged 53. She is based on a real 53 year-old circus elephant named Barbara whom the author befriended during her research period. Because the hero of the film is of Polish descent and speaks Polish, he is able to figure out that the elephant, which has been acquired in the story from another bankrupt circus, only understands commands in Polish. This saves the circus, in which he is a vet, from collapse, by enabling it to have a star attraction and sell out performances. The film manages to capture an air of genuine magic in its portrayal of this story, and credit for this should probably largely go to the director, Francis Lawrence, the screenplay by Richard LaGravenese, and of course the strong original story. The film has some unfortunate flaws, such as poor sound recording and occasional patches of dialogue where we cannot make out what people are saying. The girl in the film is played by Reese Witherspoon, who is unfortunately miscast. As this is a period film set in 1931, her pert contemporary way of talking, or should I say of chirping, is irritating and unsuitable here. Those mannerisms made her perfect for ELECTION (1999) and LEGALLY BLONDE (2001), but in this film, she is a fish out of elephant water. Someone also got her hair all wrong for this film, but then, it was ultimately the actress who was all wrong if the hair/wigs needed that much work. What a pity that Scarlett Johannson turned down the part, as she can do any period (as she proved to such effect in GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING, 2003). This all sounds like a harsh judgement on Reese Witherspoon, but is not meant to be. Some people work in certain things, that's all. She did well in the period film VANITY FAIR (2004) and in the demanding role of June Carter in WALK THE LINE (2005). In this one, she does her best as far as the acting is concerned, but the clipped voice and the hair just won't leave her alone. The lead man Robert Pattinson is marvellous, but he also mumbles sometimes. When Pattinson and Witherspoon are mumbling together, it is time to go and get a sandwich, and that is not just faulty diction, it is also the fault of the sound man. Putting all these quibbles aside, the film is really wonderful, and it is greatly helped by a strong and scary performance by Christoph Waltz, an actor born in Austria who is multi-lingual and who has now become a Hollywood fixture, successfully disguised as an American. He plays the owner of the circus, who is also the ring-master and the husband of Witherspoon. But he has some problems: he is a sadistic psychopath who throws people off his moving train and murders them to avoid paying their salaries, beats his wife, savagely attacks his animals, and is insanely jealous where his wife is concerned. Into this unstable mix comes the handsome and noble young Pattinson who falls in love with Witherspoon and wishes to save her. Witherspoon is excellent at portraying a cowed wife who is in fear of her husband, and when she nervously glances to left and to right we worry that he is coming, which alas he often is. But life is tough, and we should not let these harrowing sides to the story detract from the fact that this film is a stunning evocation of a lost world of desperate men, sad women, trained animals, and trains which roll slowly through magnificent countryside by moonlight in the most romantic of settings and situations, all of which come together in this powerful drama, with its overwhelming authenticity and atmosphere.</fullReview>

This was so cliché: young boy, Jacob, joins circus and falls for wife of circus owner whom just happens to have a temper and loses it sometimes. Also, he thinks nothing of throwing people off the train that he can't pay. But for some reason, the wife, Marlena, acts like she really loves him.So, you know what's going to happen. There will be several scenes of Jacob and Marlena sharing intimate moments, and of August being mean. And you know August won't just let Marlena leave and there will be conflict at the end and someone won't make it.FINAL VERDICT: It's too long, but Rob Pattison does look cute in this. So if you are a fan of his, you'll probably like it; otherwise, skip it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK having seen a ton of movies in my lifetime, I would love to think I have a pretty good scale on a good vs. bad movie. Only one time have I ever said "Wow, that is my favorite movie ever." and that was "Cruel Intentions"... Well about 12 years later I've said it again, and that was tonight. "Water for Elephants"... It gives you ever emotion you want out of a movie. Crying, laughing, despair, hope, fear, and just makes you go back to a better time when things were different, but really not that different then they are today. It makes you believe that everything leads you to your true destiny in life and that's what you... or I want out of a movie. In my opinion, the common denominator is Reece Witherspoon. Every movie she IS APART OF turns to gold. She is just brilliant.... I had to share because this has never happened but one other time, so I hope you rent it to watch&lt;3 I loved it so much that I opened a IMDb account just to review this movie. Please trust me... you won't regret it!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I did not read the novel so I cannot compare the movie to it. Reviewing it on its own merits, I found had a good atmosphere of the 1920's, not only showing the glamor but the dirt and vermin as well.As for the performers, the best performance by far was by Christopher Waltz as the owner/ringmaster. The performances by the other stars, unfortunately, were wooden and raised no real emotions. If there had been chemistry in their romance it would have added far more tension to the movie, but instead it created a weak spot.While you may root against the circus and its ringmaster, I was displeased by the ending. Letting all the animals out among the audience, causing a stampede? Innocent people would have been killed! The ringmaster may have been a bad guy but not that type of bad guy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw some clips of this film on a couple of chat shows, and it sounded like it was being bigged up quite a lot, so I had to see if it really was worth all the fuss, from director Francis Lawrence (Constantine, I Am Legend). Basically Cornell veterinary medicine student Jacob Jankowski (The Twilight Saga's Robert Pattinson) has lost his parents after they died in a car crash, leaving him penniless and homeless, and with nowhere to go he gets on a train as a stowaway. When he arrives at the destination, he finds out that it is a circus train, the Benzini Brothers Circus, run by owner, animal trainer and ringmaster August Rosenbluth (Inglorious Basterds star Christoph Waltz), and he also sees the star performer, horse rider and trapeze artist Marlena (Reese Witherspoon), Rosenbluth's wife as well. To get close to Marlena, who Jacob is obviously attracted to, he notices that her fellow star performer, horse Silver, is suffering laminitis, and he can tell that Marlena cannot bear to see him in pain, so he allows the new young man to shoot him and end his suffering. Starting as a labourer and roustabout, Jacob talks to August about having a proper job in the circus, and with his good knowledge of animal health he learnt from his education he becomes the official vet for all the animals that perform in the shows. Eventually Silver the horse is replaced by a new star act that August is sure will get more people to the circus, an elephant named Rosie, but Marlena has her doubts because it needs to be trained, and for a while it looks like it can't be, and the ringmaster beats it badly for not following orders. Soon enough though Jacob finds out that Rosie the elephant only understands commands in the Polish language, so soon enough she is trained to do the tricks needed to make a successful circus act alongside Marlena. As they were training her, is it obvious that Jacob and Marlena were getting closer and developing stronger feelings, to the point when they have fallen in love and start an affair, and unfortunately August finds out. He plans to throw the young man out of the moving train, but instead he has him beaten by his henchmen, but this doesn't stop him returning to the circus, and many of the other performers join him to exact their revenge on the cruel ringmaster. This becomes a chaotic chain of events at the circus performance, crowds of people running away in the havoc, and August becomes violently angry, trying to choke Marlena to death, only to be kicked by Rosie, and then she kills him with a metal spike in the head. It should be said that this story is being told by the Old Jacob (Hal Holbrook), and he explains that after these events he returned to finish his veterinary exam and degree, young Jacob and Marlena got jobs with the rival circus run by the Ringling Brothers, similar to before, and they married, having five children, keeping Rosie until she died, and he worked in Albany Zoo and Marlena died in her sleep, and the end sees Old Jacob allowed a job in the circus at the ticket booth. Also starring Paul Schneider as Charlie, Jim Norton as Camel, Mark Povinelli as Kinko / Walter and Richard Brake as Grady. Pattinson gives a mature performance that is a good escape from being a teen vampire, Witherspoon as always is terrific being the kind hearted and talented performer, together they are a good couple, and Waltz is good as they fiendish and horrible head of the circus, it does seem like a simple forbidden love story in the circus with some animals and acts thrown in, but overall it is a nice film that you can settle into, a likable period romantic drama. Worth watching!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More like water FROM elephants</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw this without knowing the animal training controversy, and found myself feeling embarrassed for the actors to have to perform such a typical, albeit poorly written and directed "love triangle" type screenplay. In spite of the fact that both Robert Pattinson's character (young newcomer to the circus) and Reese Witherspoon's character (wife of sadistic, domineering owner of the circus) know full well that Christoph Waltz's character (said sadistic, domineering owner) is volatile and merciless, they flash looks back and forth and whisper in each other's ears in his presence. Couple that with Pattison's performance which is less animated than a 2x4 pine board, and you've got one very predictable, and colossal waste of time on your hands.Oh, and one can just imagine the director saying to Christoph Waltz, "Chris, baby, I just loved you in Inglorious Basterds! Just give exactly the same guy. It won awards the first time, didn't it?".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can see that some people enjoyed this movie quite a lot. I can tell you that I didn't. And there are reasons for that. I don't think the fact, I hadn't read the novel plays into that. In fact I still haven't read "The Notebook" and I consider that as one of the best movies period (and maybe the best "romantic" drama, if you wanna call it that, ever. For some at least).Problem is maybe that I got spoiled with Notebook. And the structure of this movie reminds one of the Notebook. Not step by step, but the overall picture (forgive the pun). And it looses every one of those comparisons. While Reese Witherspoon tries hard and is the best of the leading trio, all the actors seem to be pigeonholed into a cliché. Christoph Waltz is a great actor, but seeing him in this you wouldn't really come to that conclusion. He plays his villain with Gusto (and cherishes in the dark moments), but in-between something is missing. There might be some nice additions in the bit player department (Ken Foree of "Dawn of the Dead" fame comes to mind), but overall it's not only something you've seen, but is played by the numbers, not raising the level of emotion, that I'm sure the book/novel did.</fullReview>

I read the book and surprisingly, this movie closely follows the book. However, the book provided characters with chemistry between/among them. Reese Witherspoon and Robert Pattinson have no chemistry...period. They seem to be sleep-walking throughout the scenes...including the romantic scene, which is so dark that even a good imagination can't help it. Christoph Waltz has an accent that interferes with his English. After 2 hours, I began to understand his sentences. An Oscar should go to the elephant. Forget the rest of the actors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Christoph Waltz stands out in this weak love story with no chemistry.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now where do I start on this 'timeless love-story?' Let's start with the title. This has to be the most inappropriate title in the history of cinema. The title has nothing to do with the story, which is primarily a love story, but the title tricks you into thinking that it is not. Sara Gruen who has written the novel 'Water for Elephants' credits someone else in her book for coming up with this title. I'd say she should have used her own discretion. Now coming to the movie, and as a fan of both Reese Witherspoon and Robert Pattinson, I'd have to sadly accept that this movie doesn't justify an iota of their talent. There is just no chemistry between the two ? an essential quality for a love story. On the other hand there is Christoph Waltz, who is absolutely brilliant throughout the movie. He, in fact, is the sole reason that this movie is watchable. Take him out of the equation and you have a dud on your hands. The love story is too weak to make you feel any passion. The main character, Jacob, at times, comes across as a spineless individual who eventually has lived an adventurous and successful life with all that he ever wanted, and still finds something to complain about. The story, beyond all comprehension, is not as dramatic as it was intended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ho hum</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is well made and wonderfully produced kitsch. It's source may be a well written novel but the film is a confection worthy of a low brow book club. What dazzles the eye is the core of the problem and its inauthenticity and a sugar coated niceness that yields to stale predictability.First is the structure with the nice old man narrating his story and a bit of history. This technique is a cliché and since 'Titanic' did it in 1997 seems to be only way of serving up the past to audiences. Second is the overpowering need to show this as grand cinema which is exemplified in one shot early on of two men scaling and then walking along the train carriages which will look stupendous on a wide screen but is not right for this story which is not about grand gestures, not in that way at least.The third and most compelling lack of authenticity is the style and portrayal of the circus which is tough but not too nasty. Compare it with 'Nightmare Alley' from 1947. That is a circus story in tough times (and also contains an intriguing use of the word 'geek' for a rummy who is really on his downers) and compare it with the niceness of ladies' book club of this concoction and it is clear.In a cognate way it's like watching smokers in an old film and in today's movies ( whether it's a period movie or not) where few people actually smoke so when they hold a cigarette their expression and then how they pucker to smoke the thing shows their awkwardness, that they do not smoke; or there is a cutaway shot in order not show it, or another contractual obligation that smoking cannot be shown to endanger the actor. While no one wants to see smoking an audience deserves authentic action, however, if its part of the story. Filmmakers have to get it right.In a sense one source of the problem is the casting of Robert Pattinson who is a callow screen presence, nice, not too dangerous and 'kinda cute'. Tyrone Power's performance in 'Nightmare Alley' makes it work, because he is handsome and lethal.Essentially this lack of genuine essence makes the Depression sad, but not too depressing; the circus life, tough, but not too cruel and with lovable characters. As such the story falls into a predictable heap as it's quite obvious how it must go because it takes no risks, it has removed all the jagged and true edges that make a story of this type worth telling. And the ending is saccharine as the old man completes the story and the audience can all go 'aaahh', collectively at the full circle of his life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, this film would be thousand times better if it we didn't have to remember every 10 minutes this is Hollywood. There are many plot holes that automatically remember us that this is a film, like when Jacob talked in that language to the elephant. Where did he get those lines from? How did he know how to speak that? Since when do elephants understand languages? How Jacob got back in the train? And how those guys invaded the hotel, didn't it have security, lock or anything?The film is greatly photographed, with authentic and professional acting from all the cast (except for the unexpressive Robert Pattinson), but these things aren't enough to save the whole thing. The story is well developed with some little surprises, but the script is too weak to really satisfy me. Not to mention that I didn't believe Marlena and Jacob's love, thought the actors tried their best to make it work. I'm still giving it a 7 because it's very entertaining and the story is not repeated as in many 2011's films. See this film without commitment and criticizing feelings and you will probably have a good time...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Christoph Waltz takes the cake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After an hour of travelling and another hour or so of awkwardness, I can safely say that this movie was worth it. Let's just ignore the fact that I watched the movie alone because I really have nothing to do with my life, and let's focus on the fact that hey, Robert Pattinson can act and that Christoph Waltz is just a spectacular actor. But of course, like in every movie, they include something in order to work the audience up and remain under the movie's spell. The objects (in this case, an elephant), though they play a very small part, are used as a a sort of sub-plot to give a twist to a cliché storyline. I mean, it wasn't that bad, with a whole circus themed tale of two star crossed lovers, but it was based on the same thing: A woman cheats on her husband with a charming young intern who woos her with his mysteriousness and slight awkwardness. To be frank, the plot was extremely boring, there were barely any twists and my thoughts were frequently shifted over to my screaming bladder.Let's not focus on the storyline, but rather, on the acting in this movie. I've never fully respected Pattinson enough as an actor, considering he looks constipated or in pain half the time. This movie showed a slightly different side to him. Maybe he actually can play roles outside of a mysterious, introverted and slightly violent character (references to Remember Me and The Twilight movies). He proves everyone wrong by playing a rather romantic guy, with a heart of gold. Not as openly as I would hope, and still violent and impulsive, but still a sweet guy. I have to admit, I'm not that impressed with what Reese Witherspoon had to offer. Sure, she managed to portray her character believably, but I didn't feel as entranced by her character like I did in her other movies. This character had the potential to be played in a very captivating manner; I mean, she is after all, a star attraction and a woman who is trapped in a forbidden romance with the faeces shoveler. Surely she has a lot more emotions that can be played with.Of course, I've saved the best for the last; Christoph Waltz. I was immensely impressed by his performance, he plays his character so well that you forget that maybe he isn't like that in real life. Once he's on screen, it's as if no one else is present. He has such great presence that he commands attention the second he's in the shot. Waltz makes the character so enchanting, that it's so easy to hate him but love him at the same time. August's sick humour and his impatience and heartlessness, accompanied by Waltz's amazing rendition of this nasty man made him my favourite character in the entire film, despite his obvious loathing for anything other than him and his wife. Looks like I'll be catching Inglorious Basterds soon.Overall, this movie wasn't that spectacular. Sure, it kept me interested long enough, but it probably won't be one I'll be remembering. Tales of classic romances like this is just too cliché for my liking. I'd give it a 6/10. Still, two thumbs up for Waltz's amazing acting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, this movie has all the classic elements of film noir: the femme fatale, a man with incredibly bad luck or karma, the homo-erotic tension between two men, bleak cinematography. The problem is it also wants to have an artificial Hollywood happy ending on it and that ruined it for me. That and the bookending of the story as a flashback is about the oldest and hackneyed scheme of a plot.Still I gave it a very high rating for the nuanced performances of the three leads, despite a large proportion of simulated animal cruelty, which did not sit well with me. Reese Witherspoon delivers a fine performance, but Robert Pattinson as the head of the circus fails to deliver on why he is damaged goods although he clearly has a cruel past. His character is either happy, angry, contrite, or depressed depending on what is needed to finish the scene.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jacob Jankowski is an aspiring trainee veterinarian at the prestigious Cornell US University during the depression.Abruptly torn from his studies he quite literally, albeit unintentionally, runs off to join the circus.The story is told in flashback by the 90 year Jacob (Hal Holbrook), recounting his story which segues into Jacob as a young man (Robert Pattinson).The Benzini Brothers circus is exciting, rough, brutal and desperate for money. Preying on the abandoned remains of other circuses that failed to attract an audience.The whole travelling troupe are governed by the less than benevolent ringmaster, in every sense of the word, August (Christopher Waltz). One of the star attractions also happens to be his wife, the bare back horse riding Mariena (Reece Witherspoon).Jacob's veterinary skills are soon uncovered, used and then boasted as a badge of honour by August, his constant desire to beat other circuses even extending to a full time Ivy League Vet.The circus is pulled from town to town on a very cinematically filmed train, well illustrated by a beautifully played scene atop the train. Punters are fooled, amazed and generally relieved of any spare cash they have, before the whole enterprise pulls up tent pegs and moves on.This is set during the depression, the animals are looked after little better than the humans who may be tossed from the train at any time, if the wage bill needs a little trimming.This is at heart a love story and whilst the leads are effective and Pattinson, probably enjoying not looking pale for a while, does not let the side down in this post Twilight starring role. However, there is little chemistry on display with Mariena and even the many animal scenes, curiously leave you emotionally disengaged.The period setting is fun to watch and it is clear that Waltz's recent Oscar win for "Inglorious Basterd's" was no fluke. He again scorches the screen in every scene, displaying another well dressed psychopath who can be charming one moment and chillingly murderous the next. Compared to the other performers, his characterization holds the film together and demands audiences attention.Witherspoon clearly has learn't some performing tricks and does well but seems more alive and believable whenever Waltz shares the screen. There are short periods where the story flags but it's difficult to dislike any film with a performing circus elephant (Rosie) for too long.The reality of the times and struggle to live, for everyone, animals, circus and staff alike, is intriguing and the suggestion of a more innocent townsfolk, is neatly evoked. In the Internet age, a few tigers, lions, clowns and even the performing elephant, would not be enough to hold many children's attention for long.Based on the book by Sarah Gruen Summary A romantic historical circus drama, formulaic in places but enjoyable enough entertainment with another winning performance by Waltz.http://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

The main actors Reese &amp; Rob make a lovely fictional couple. Well acted and beautifully executed. Backdrops and costume's and the general feel was very 1930s and colours where vibrant and scenes very beautiful. Not exactly Titanic grand, but in its own way just as good. All the actors where very very good :) big thumbs up! I am loving Patterson as the hopeless romantic and Reese as the helpless damsel in distress. Without giving away too much I recommend you watch this film with a female buddy or your partner, either way, you will both walk away feeling a little lighter and happier.

		<fullReview>This movie has a wonderfully photographed period look in its costumes and in its images of circuses on the edges of 1931 American towns, with pennants fluttering in strong winds atop tents. Such images made we want to run away and join a circus unrelated to this movie, which is melodramatic and emotionally manipulative in unclever, obvious ways. Roger Ebert pointed me to this movie by praising what it could do without crass special effects. But it still has the bludgeoning moralism of many action movies, a tyrannical villain (played with panache by Christoph Waltz) and a two-dimensionally "good" antagonist (Robert Pattinson, who looks great, but is capable of 1.8 facial expressions as an actor) who is, over and over again, placed in situations in which he can't do anything to right wrongs (often perpetrated by Waltz's character). "Oh, wrench your hands in frustration, and await catharsis" these scenes instruct us. The director has annoyingly confused melodramatic tension with actual drama--evidently ordering these players to be cardboard-like and passive (except Waltz, and maybe the elephant, who steals the movie) in order to ratchet up frustration and expectation ("oh, when will evil be recompensed?!," we are supposed to feel, chronically). Implicitly, the movie's soundtrack, which is one long, monotonous instruction to "feel the impending doom within this ambiguously sweet spectacle" is really the star of the movie, when it could have been Reese Witherspoon, or somebody who could act better than Pattison, who looks, without benefit, like he's in an ad for Polo cologne in much of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Elephant is the true star of the show</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>¨I don't know if I picked that circus. But something told me that circus picked me.¨Francis Lawrence (I am Legend, Constantine) directed this film which was adapted from Sara Gruen's novel of the same name by screenwriter Richard LaGravenese (P.S. I Love You, The Bridges of Madison County). Water for Elephants is a period drama that takes us back to the era of the Great Depression and introduces us to the dark side of the circus entertainment industry. Not everything is pure fun and entertainment because once the show is over we get to see the suffering and difficulties that go along with running a circus. Some things are just illusions as we soon find out from the mean spirited manager of the traveling circus. He seems so fun and nice during the show, but when the lights go off he runs the place with a stern hand, throwing coworkers off a running train, or beating animals whenever he's upset. The mood of the Great Depression can be felt throughout the entire film, and only when the show is running can we experience the illusion of happiness. There is also a love triangle involved which makes things more depressing because it proves how difficult love can be at times. I really enjoyed this period drama and thought it depicted the era quite nicely. There are some interesting characters, but the heart of the film revolves around the elephant (which happens to be the star of the circus and the symbol of hope during their struggle to survive). Jacob Jankowski (Robert Pattinson) is a veterinary student who seems to be living a normal life until he receives some bad news: his parents have just passed away in a car accident leaving him with nothing. Jacob abandons college and ends up spending the night on a train. The train happens to belong to a traveling circus but there is no space for newcomers. One of the men that find him wants to throw him off the train, but another saves him and introduces him to the manager of the circus: August (Christoph Waltz). August runs the circus with a very stern hand, he's volatile and dangerous, but at the same time he has the charisma it takes to run a circus show. When August realizes that Jacob is a veterinarian, he hires him so that he can take care of the animals which are pretty much all in a bad shape. The first thing he has to do is sacrifice one of the horses who was badly injured, and unfortunately happened to be the star of the circus along with her rider Marlena (Reese Witherspoon). Now with little money and no main attraction to bring in an audience the circus is barely struggling to survive. August might be mean and evil, but he is a visionary and finds an opportunity when he encounters an elephant named Rosie and decides to invest all his money on that animal. Marlena must learn how to ride it, and Jacob how to master it. The two young good looking kids spend a lot of time together and they begin to fall for each other. The only problem is that Marlena is married to August and he will surely not let go of her so easily.I could think of no better actor to play the part of August than Christoph Waltz. He is just great in this film and inspired fear every time he got upset. He proved Inglorious Basterds was no fluke and he is a great villain. At times he seemed nice, but he was just a time bomb waiting to explode the moment something went wrong. I loved Reese Witherspoon in Walk the Line, but in this film her performance isn't really memorable. I would have preferred another actress in this role, I really didn't feel the chemistry between her and Robert Pattinson. It was good to see Pattinson playing a none-vampire role, but I would have chosen two different actors to play these roles. They are probably the weakest links in the film. The film actually picks up when we are introduced to Rosie, the elephant. Without her I don't think I would have enjoyed the movie as much as I did. She doesn't just save the circus, she also saves this film. She is the heart and soul of the picture. This isn't one of the best films of the year, but it is a satisfying and entertaining film and definitely worth your time. It could have been so much better if the lead actors would have had a better chemistry between them. The romance didn't work as well as it should have, but the film still succeeds at depicting the era and the mood during the Great Depression. Rosie and Waltz are worth the ticket price alone.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mediocre, but better than I expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before watching Water for Elephants, I expected to find another predictable and disposable adaptation of a book written by Nicholas Sparks, or something like that. However, the quality of the production, some good performances and the colorful circus environment made the experience to be tolerable in my case. Nevertheless, I found the film to be mediocre and occasionally a bit boring, and its main problem is that the central romance never feels sincere nor passionate. However, the film kept me moderately entertained in general, and it ended up being better than I expected. Oh, and it is effectively based on a book, but not one from Sparks, but from Sara Gruen, which I have not read, so this review is exclusively based on the way in which screenwriter Richard LaGravenese and director Francis Lawrence interpreted the story.Among the solid performances which help Water for Elephants to be tolerable, I have to mention Christoph Waltz's. His work in here is absolutely credible and energetic. I also liked the performance from the great Hal Holbrook very much; maybe due to his advanced age he does not accept as many roles as he used to, but he has not lost even a pinch of his talent and amazing presence. I just wish he had more screen-time. And Ken Foree is very well in a brief but intense role in which he confirms his talent outside the horror genre.However, the main reason many people will go to see Water for Elephants is due to the presence from Reese Witherspoon and Robert Pattinson in the leading roles. However, I could rarely feel the supposed love which links their characters with each other and inspires them to fight against adversity. I generally like Witherspoon's work, but for some reason, I felt her a bit cold and distant in this movie. As for Pattinson, I did not dislike his work in other movies (with the exception of Eclipse), but he does not seem to be very interested in his character in Water for Elephants.Nevertheless, Water for Elephants did not bore me (with a few exceptions), and despite being mediocre, I found it better than I expected, like I previously said. I could not totally swallow the central romance and the ending is a bit absurd, but I think it deserves a slight recommendation, at least because it avoided to fall into the lachrymose and bland routine from films like Remember Me or Dear John.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jacob (Robert Pattinson)'s parents die just before he takes his vet exams (in the 1930s). Left penniless, he joins a circus where he falls for Marlena (Reese Witherspoon), the wife of charming but violent and underhand circus owner August (Christoph Walz).I have heard this referred to as Titanic with performing animals: to be fair, I think that stories involving the eternal triangle of a woman caught between decent but impoverished young chap and rich but possessive nasty piece of work have been around for a long time before James Cameron got his hands on Rose and Jack. Perhaps people are referring to the fact that the story is bookended by present-day Jacob (Hal Holbrook) telling the story. It doesn't really matter.This isn't a film which attracted me in the first place, but I'm glad I saw it because it is absorbing and well-told. The circus setting is unusual enough to hold the attention and hide the familiarity of the love story. Pattinson is adequate but, with only two expressions (glowering and smiling), he doesn't make this a breakout role (although his popularity explains why there were so many women in the audience - I can't imagine that circus movies have suddenly become flavour of the week). Witherspoon is better, and Waltz always grabs the attention even when he strays into panto villain territory. Hal Holbrook is by far the best thing in the movie.The title is rubbish, though - probably better for a book than a film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>classy and smooth. an elaborate movie, with really good actors (ohmy, Robert is allowed to do more than just one "i'm so torn"-face) Christoph is, as always, the perfect psychotic villain (so convincing that i'm really hoping someone will give him the part of the hero in the future)...and Reese is...well...okay i guess... screen adaptations often seem kind of incoherent for people who haven't read the novel, but the style of the story was really smooth and seemed effortless...it wasn't hard to follow at all... well, okay, it may not be a masterpiece. i admit it has it's faults. some scenes were a bit gooey and predictable if you ask me... but even when the romantic-dialog got over the top (blahblah about her being a beautiful woman deserving a beautiful life...), a die-away sigh escaped my lips (aw dammit! i just can't help myself) and the parts when i knew what would to happen (and it's almost always something bad) still made me dig my claws into the arm rest. though the ending kind of surprised me...... it just makes you wanna join the circus... 7 out of 10... + a half for Robert not being all pale and clean and brooding... p.s.: i still think the title should be "Whiskey for Elephants", since the elephant seems to be an alcoholic :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Water for Elephants-movie vs. book?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into the movie "Water for Elephants" having already read the beautifully written book by Sara Gruen. Her flawless transitions and vivid descriptions made the book impossible NOT to love. I was a little nervous about the cast of this movie due to the questionable chemistry between Reese Witherspoon and Robert Pattinson. However, I was pleasantly surprised and I was proved wrong about my concerns. I really enjoyed Water for Elephants and the movie was extremely well directed and well produced. It was undoubtedly worth my money and time. However, I don't necessarily think that I would have had the same reaction if I had not read the book. Reading the book and having a fascination with the plot, propelled me to see the movie and really drove me to want to see more. If I hadn't been so drawn in by the book, the movie would have gone on my life of movies I've never wanted to see. I known that potential viewers may not have the motivation to see this movie, but it is definitely worth your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tremendous film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not often that I'm this impressed with a film, so I highly recommend this movie.First off, I hesitated to go to this movie because I had been so unimpressed with what I considered to be the anemic performances of Robert Pattinson in the Twilight movies. Of course, since he was other-worldly, perhaps he was supposed to look and act anemic. In this film, however, he turns in a remarkable performance, and my respect for his abilities as an actor has skyrocketed. I look forward to seeing him in future films! Reese Witherspoon, as is typical, was also simply wonderful. With each film I see her in, I increasingly suspect that she will be a star for many, many years to come. Christolph Waltz was superb as the villain...not playing it too heavy to be real...just right. And of course, Hal Holbrook is a national treasure.Production standards here are high, and no where better seen than in the scenes related to the animal stampede at the climax. And, I liked that following the climax the film didn't simply end...loose ends were tied down (unlike the wild animals), and I walked away feeling we knew how the tale ended.And, this film does a remarkably good job of portraying life during the Great Depression. The settings certainly look authentic, and I think one gets a good idea of just how tenuous life was during that era. The cinematography here is excellent, and really improves the ability of the director to tell the story in the context of the time.To be honest, I can't think of anything to criticize in this film. It was that good. Bravo to all involved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very pleasant two hours but not to be relived very soon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just been to see a preview of the movie. I must say I was pleasantly surprised with Pattinson whom I usually find rather annoying; he did not detract from the movie. The performance of the main actors was good, the plot was entertaining and the movie did not drag. I found the circus environment quite refreshing as it is not often covered in movies. Also, the 30s atmosphere was very believable (for a layman like me) and added attractiveness to the picture. I would not say it will be the best movie of the year but certainly one of the most enjoyable ones if you try not to pick nits. Having said that, I feel I need to comment on and be pedantic about one thing: the use of the Polish language. I do agree with other people's comments that Rob's character could have descended from any other culture and it would have had the same effect on the movie. Also, that might have helped to make the movie a bit more believable to another nation's ears since a different language might have proved easier to pronounce for the actors. Being Polish myself, I struggled to understand the phrases and single words uttered in the picture in Polish. It took me quite a few seconds every time to guess what they had said - apart from main character's mother. However, she said 'I love you' in a very thorough way which would have been typical of a language purist. I think they should have practised the few phrases that they used a bit more to make it more authentic for the nation concerned as clearly little effort was put into this. Or they should have chosen a different language. Don't want to be mean there, though - overall, very enjoyable viewing.</fullReview>

The story, on the other hand, is a tad weak.There's no new ground broken in the show. It's a really basic love story with a rather poorly written villain.The evil circus owner is so uneven that I had a real difficult time believing his character at all. He's insufferably mean one minute and the sweetest guy in the world the next. Caring and sensitive while being heartless and cruel, with little or no reason for such wild swings. And the idea that one could get away with murder simply because they own a circus, I found a little hard to accept as well.Overall, it an attractive looking film with a passable story, just don't expect any depth, 'cause there just ain't any...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Marvellous OR Mediocre movie depending on what you bring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on Sara Cruen's award winning, eponymous novel. Stars: Reese Witherspoon, Robert Pattinson, Christoph Waltz, &amp; Hal Holbrook in a cameo role.Ratings show very strong splits between those thinking it's great vs. mediocre (or less). The demographics of age &amp; gender on the film's IMDb ratings are very strong (q.v.). And, those who've read the book usually praise it highly as do fans of Pattinson from his two "Twilight" vampire flicks--while those without those experiences are often more critical in their rating (scan User Reviews).Plot: Two circus employees find a very old man ("Jacob" in his 90s/played by Holbrook) who'd been mistakenly left behind by his nursing home aides after a group of its residents viewed the circus. On discovering that Jacob had worked with the Benzini Brothers Circus in the early 1930s before it suddenly folded, the circus employees encourage Jacob to describe his experiences. The rest of the film portrays Jacob's (played by Pattinson) reminiscenses of his life during that time 70 years ago.Jacob was about to take his final exam in veterinary medicine at Cornell when he's told his parents were killed in a car crash. Jacob skips taking the final and hops a train to a city, looking for work. The train happens to be the Benzini Bros. Circus train and eventually he's employed by the circus as a make-do vet. August (excellently played by Christoph Waltz) is the circus owner/ring master, short-tempered and sadistic; he's expert in finding needy people with talents who'll fit his needs. These include his much younger wife, Marlena (Witherspoon), who was orphaned and raised in a variety of foster homes before August found her.Marlena became the circus's star, performing on a trained horse when she and Jacob first meet and later, after her horse dies, on an elephant,"Rosie." A romance blossoms between Marlena and Jacob and this aggravates August, of course, setting in motion the series of events that leads to the destruction of the circus. But, after that, eventually, there's a happy ending for Marlena, Jacob--and "Rosie.""W4E" gives partial glimpses of circus life, the desperation of survival in the Great Depression, and some animal-human bonds. The role of August is crucial to the development of the plot and movie. It apparently bothers few others but (as a retired therapist) to me it was inconceivable that a person so impulsive and sadistic would advance into and successfully manage such a large organization for so long. (I lowered my rating because of this. But on IMDb's "Message Board" I've found that in the book, it's "Big Al" who runs the circus with August as his ringmaster. In the film, "Big Al's" character was eliminated and his functions condensed onto August.) IMO the Benzini Bros. Circus could survive sufficiently long if headed by "Big Al" rather than August with his impulsiveness and sadism--his traits which the film shows as leading to the circus's implosion and disintegration. The brief scenes of animal cruelty in the movie made me (&amp; many) uncomfortable but this was necessary for plot development (and was feigned, no actual cruelty took place during filming). But there is a group claiming cruelty was used in training Rosie BEFORE the actual filming; whether there's any valid evidence for this is disputed and unclear at this time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ladies and Gentlemen ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Everyone loves the circus (except those who are scared of clowns). Everyone loves trains (except those who are scared of wrecks). Everyone loves performing animals (as long as they are a safe distance). Combine those elements with a best-selling novel, three popular actors and a twist on "Titanic" and you end up with a very watchable, though slightly mundane dramatic love story.You are probably wondering where I came up with the "Titanic" reference. Allow me to explain. The story begins with an old man caught in a rain storm. We quickly find out Hal Holbrook is playing the Robert Pattinson character as an old man. Mr. Holbrook's character corresponds to Gloria Stuart's character in "Titanic". Both provide flashback detail to a love story engulfed in tragedy. On top of that, both have twinkly blue eyes! Paul Schneider is in the Bill Paxton role ... trying his best to get the secrets of what really happened so many years ago.The story is based on Sara Gruen's best selling novel and is set in depression-soaked 1931. Jacob (Pattinson) is sitting for his Cornell veterinarian finals when he is notified of a family tragedy. He promptly sets out on the road and jumps a train. Not just any train ... the Benzini Brothers Circus train. He is taken under the wing of Camel, the old timer played well by Jim Norton. Soon enough he is summoned to meet the circus owner. A brief meeting leads first to the order to toss Jacob off the train, but he is saved by his knowledge of animal medicine - a valuable job in the circus.Now is as good of time as any to let you know that the great Christoph Waltz plays August, the circus owner. As in his Oscar winning role for "Inglourious Basterds", Waltz' August is alternatingly charming and chilling. He is a ruthless circus owner who values no man or animal. He values only making money and his star attraction and wife, Marlena (Reese Witherspoon). Oh, and just because he values her, doesn't mean he treats her well. He is near-psychotic when he goes off on her or anyone or anything else. Pause ... then a few minutes later, he is back to his charming self. Very frightening stuff.Of course, it's not surprising that Jacob is enchanted with Marlena (a bareback rider) or that she returns the affection. What is surprising is that they continue to push the boundaries of good sense while within the confines of the circus group - and August. You can imagine the confrontations and situations that arise, but Marlena's insistence that no life exists for her outside the circus is head-scratching.The story really picks up when the struggling circus purchases a performing elephant named Rosie. It didn't take me long to figure out that Rosie may be the smartest character in the film. She is certainly the most crucial for Marlena and Jacob.The screenplay is from Richard Gravenese who has a track record with this type of story. He was also responsible for "The Horse Whisperer" and "Bridges of Madison County". What's surprising is the director is Francis Lawrence, previously known for "I Am Legend" and "Constantine". This movie has no resemblance to those films and his cast and crew obviously help him adjust to a more melodramatic storyline.What I really like about the film are the realistic characters and the setting. The trains, big top, circus performers and workers all seem real, as do the few circus scenes presented. Without the Christoph Waltz character and performance, this film would be truly just a run-of-the-mill dramatic love story. His element and the realistic circus life make this one worthwhile.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first watched this film "Water for Elephants" I got to admit I was nervous. I wasn't sure of what to expect from this film. But I pulled through it and watched it. Now it is at the top of my films list. It was better than I ever expected. The film was a combination of classic, with the new coming of age bling to films. Whenever the circus was played, it was the warm heart glow of excitement. The picture was unbelievable. The actors were well casted and played. I have to tell every single person out there who love watching films to watch this. If you are in to the fine details of films, you will be amazed. The story itself brings out unique taste and yet full of excitement without being overboard. Reese and Robert do have what it takes to bring out the romance and the bravery and adventure without it being cheesy. It was a perfect cast and just in overall the whole movie, every detail, every shot. every costume, every line, every movement was just perfect and in the dreams of every filmmaker's dream creation. This movie is not some waste, it should be recognized and honored for the small details that made this film big, and a huge success in a film artwork and storytelling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A blue ribbon, five star film all the way; this critic would nominate it for many awards, including best picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the Depression, Jakob Jankowski (Robert Pattison) believes he has a bright future. He is about to graduate from Cornell University's Veterinary Medicine School and has his eye on a beautiful female fellow student. Unfortunately, as he is beginning his final exams, he receives word that his parents have died in an automobile crash. Stunned, he leaves the examination room to identify the bodies. As heartbreaking as this news is, more is revealed. His veterinary father mortgaged the family home in upstate New York to pay for Jakob's tuition; there is no home and no money left. In a daze, Jakob starts on foot to Albany, for he hears big cities have job possibilities. A train whistle sounds. Jakob makes the decision to hop aboard. Immediately, he is in a boxcar of hostile circus workers, who almost throw him off again, for they think he is a freeloading bum. One man, Camel (Jim Norton) has pity on him and lets him stay, although he warns Jakob that, if the circus owner, August (Christoph Waltz) doesn't want him, he will be thrown off a fast-moving train to die. Next day, on the way to the bossman's tent, Jakob catches sight of a beautiful trick rider, Marlena (Reese Witherspoon) and her dazzling-but-ailing white horse. August doesn't like the looks of Jakob but when he hears the man is a veterinarian, he lets him stay. Almost at once, Jakob defies August by shooting the white horse, who has no hope of recovery and who August would have worked to death. Only the immediate need of fresh meat for the lions allows Jakob to escape punishment. As the young almost-vet soon learns, August is a showman who puts money and glory above everything else. His anger is dangerous and his word is absolute. So, when August has the good fortune to acquire an elephant, Rosie, he insists on using sharp prods and beatings to tame the animal. Jakob discovers that the beautiful pachyderm only knows Polish commands and soon, Marlena and Rosie have a fabulous new act. Money rolls in. Unhappily, treacherous waters are ahead, not only for Camel, who has a bad leg, but for Jakob and Marlena, who are struggling mightily to hide a growing affection. What is ahead for the circus company, disaster? This is a lovely, blue-ribbon, five-star film worthy, in this viewer's opinion, of awards. First, Waltz delivers an amazing performance, as another evil being (remember his Oscar for Inglorious Bastards?). One hopes that Hollywood will let him do another type of role, for his talent is beyond measure. Witherspoon and Pattison also give fine performances, without a touch of dishonesty. All other cast members, including Norton, Hal Holbrook, Paul Schneider and the rest, are most noteworthy, too. Then, the cinematography and stunning editing make for a breathtaking view, accompanied by a magical score. Based on an outstanding novel, the movie truly magnifies the fine story presented in the book. Finally, the elephant of the film is a marvel and a joy. Movie fans, don't even stop to drink a glass of water. Go, now, before the tent goes down, and see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a fan of the book. Am too old to be a Rpatz fan, LOL. The book has a better beginning and a much better ending. I felt all the voice-over should have been by 'old Jacob'. Some of the changes in dialogue changed the direction of the book. i.e. The book starts, with Jacob stating he was a 23 year-old virgin in 1931 who has no chance with the 4 girls in his class (At Sydney Uni now more than 70% of vet students are girls) The change that after his exam he is going to get her into bed makes him look cocky, not retiring as he is in the book. Still, Rpatz plays him as shy for most of the film. No disagreement with the combination of Uncle Al and August,most outstandingly played by Waltz. He reminded me of a young Christopher Lee with style and menace and a strange charm. (More my age than Rpatz, LOL, in Wikipedia it says he has had 4 wives, I am not alone in noting the charm) The costumes and 'look' are outstanding, perfect 1930s with everybody in a hat and rather worn clothes. It should get an Oscar nomination for costume and cinematography. I was not disappointed in the film, all the errors lay with compression of the story and with changing the dialogue. If I was not such a die hard fan of the book I would have enjoyed it more as a film.</fullReview>

The story is riveting; the acting is strong; the dialog is snappy and the cast outstanding. Robert Pattison proves that he a major star who can carry a movie. The director makes excellent use of the flashback in unfolding the story, in a manner similar to that used to great effect in Titanic, and one is soon engrossed in the lives of characters. Christoph Waltz again proves that he is magnificent actor. But it is Reese Witherspoon who is the real star of this movie. She is stunningly beautiful and her performance is magnificent. She is the epitome of cinematic perfection. And as for the other stars, the animals, their performances are outstanding too, which is a tribute to their trainers. Congratulations are in order for them. This movie is well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has such great potential in the novel it is based on, the cast, and high production values, but it fails in most of these areas, and that's why the review is so low.In choosing to turn a novel into film some hard decisions have to be made, and I'm not a stickler for making it "just like the book." In fact, it should be its own thing, a film interpretation of the book. Well, what they chose was the conflict, therefore giving them a basic plot line to work with. What is lost is the magic of the book and the circus and the themes. Perhaps it starts with the casting, or is it the acting. Reese Witherspoon, whom I've always liked, is terrible in this and never comes alive as a character or an actress. She seemed to be walking through. Hal Holbrook is the only one with real magic, and I could repeatedly watch his 10 minutes in the opening before the big flashback, and his final 5 minutes at the end. He's the only one who believes in the story and the circus, and it shows. So I would fault casting, acting, directing, and production in the end. It just tires out and fails to come to life...and it lost a wonderful chance with a good period story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautifully Shot and Wonderfully Acted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this book and was looking forward to it being made into a film.I was worried a lot about the reviews I had read but did wonder about how vastly different they were. People either loved it or hated it. Some feel it does not translate well onto the screen and other thought it perfect. I even read on here someone that thought the violence towards the animals was too much. Some love the cast, some hate them especially Rob Pattinson. I'm finding he has a band of haters who I guess resent the fact that he is hugely successful, gorgeous and actually has some talent. Maybe they wish they were in his shoes?? Geesh give the guy a break. Let him learn his trade acting with proved quality.Well it opened here in the UK today and I went tonight. The cinema was full of mostly females but with a big age range. I think I clocked maybe a dozen or so men.So my thoughts.......Absolutely loved it. I thought it translated perfectly. Yes there are parts of the book missing but we all know surely that a book cannot be translated to the screen word for word. Cannot happen and I for one accept that and am more than happy with the end product. It was shot beautifully transporting me and the audience back to the era it was set in. I did hear several sighs throughout from around me at certain parts in which I was certainly transported back to the era.Of the actors I can only say BRAVO to all. The three leads were truly magnificent and I had worried about things I had read like 'lack of emotion' 'wooden' 'lack of chemistry'. I thought Rob Pattinson did a fine job, his emotions were just right, anymore would have been too OTT. I saw the tears in his eyes and the veins pulsing. Christophe was a credible August and Reese if any of them was the weaker as Marlena. She, however looked beautiful and I did not notice the age difference. The supporting cast I thought were also outstanding and the relationship between Jacob, Kinko and Camel truly believable.After seeing the film I can now put my fears to bed and thoroughly recommend it to all my friends.I just wish the haters would move on and stick to their 3D CGI specials.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Painting with Cinematic Magic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been a while since I've witnessed an experience like this, an epic romance set in times gone by, full of nostalgia, rich performances, and truly remarkable cinematography, art direction, music, and a solid grasp on the material. Most spectacular is the blazing performance by Waltz, the man who is conflicted, assertive, a ringmaster in more than one sense of the word, for whom emotions don't run half-speed, someone who doesn't put the same value on a human being's life.It's the 1930's, and it's rough in the United States, with people suffering through the Depression and its aftermath. The young protagonist reaches a turning point in his life and joins the circus. He is confronted with a series of people who have made this place a home, and in a bit of twist, we get to see the dark side of their arrangement with the owner. It's a way to have a roof over their heads, to survive, but from the start, it's clear it's not heaven.Jakob meets Marlena, intensely played by Witherspoon, a tough and beautiful survivor, who knows her life is the best she can do at the moment, and hangs on to an abusive husband because after all, he somehow cares what happens to her. Yet, her new acquaintance might prove to be a little problematic because he might prove to more than a simple dilemma. In fact, things become more complex, and a resolution must be reached, with the assistance of a very charming and troubled pachyderm.What makes the film special is its look and feel; from the start, we're attracted to the denizens of this circus. They're not freaks, but people who have joined another world, and don't quite belong in ours anymore. We have a connection to them because we're human, and we can't help feeling attracted to their offering. It's an old fashioned bag of tricks, with the horses, the animals, the acrobats, and whatever elements made circus such vivid entertainment. Having a romantic triangle in the middle, with a disturbing and abusive authority figure in the middle is just icing on the cake.Waltz just relishes his part, and it's all obvious in his delivery, his eyes, his moves, his interaction with every single member of the movie. He joined the circus because he knew this could make him a much bigger star, and in the end, it's his powerful and repulsive magnetism that keeps us watching until the very end, as we realize that not all Thar glitters is gold.</fullReview>

I bought it, but didn't get around to reading it until I was on my way back from Paris. I remember sitting on the bus to Charles De Gaulle airport, reading the first sentence and instantly being hooked. I read most of the book on the plane, and was unable to put it down. Sara Gruen really knows how to craft a story, and does so carefully in the book.And then, about a week later, while waiting for an IMAX showing of Sucker Punch to start, I see a trailer for the upcoming movie. I figured, "Hmmm, this could work." Well, I'll start on the good stuff. Starting off, I think the filmmakers did what they could with what I consider to really be an unfilmable book. They stayed true to the source material for the most part, so I can really have no complaints there. In addition, Reese Witherspoon was fantastic and so was Christoph Waltz- He is easily the best actor out there today and really managed to play the sick cookie August well. I was actually scared in some scenes he was on screen.I will also advise people not to let the words "Robert Pattinson" scare people away, because he does a pretty good job here, and it's also funny he plays someone named Jacob in this flick. That said he proves himself to be more tan just "that Twilight guy" in the movie.However, I must say I found this film to be rather pale in comparison to the book.For starters, Jacob is much younger in the movie than in the book. He's 93 in the book, here he's 80something. And we don't get any signs of his supposed dementia that the book implies he has.Another complaint is that the only character that they stayed true to was August. Kinko seemed way too nice here. In the book, he was this smug and arrogant jerk, who was also a ticking time bomb. He'd FREAK OUT when someone walked in on him having alone time. Here he's just like "oh hey what are you doing here". Furthermore, Marlena is reduced to a damsel in distress here. Whereas in the book she was a sweet, nice, and desperate character who's married to a sick puppy, here she's nothing more but a sue and a damsel.Another complaint is that the movie really seemed rushed in comparison to the book. It kinda felt as if they cared more about visual interest and star power as opposed to being a somewhat faithful adaptation.That being said, this movie is worth it for the acting and the visual style, and I guess I can say I enjoyed it for both. Oh, and James Frain's cameo as the caretaker was hilarious! But truth be told, I'd much recommend buying a copy of the book instead. 3.5 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie is pretty to look at, and Christoph Waltz delivers yet another fine performance ? but that's about it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No, you are not reading a review written by a Robert Pattinson fan. But yes, this columnist gives credit where it is due. And for the record, the man who has made the millions of girls crazy with his soulless portrayal of a charming (but frighteningly pale) vampire can actually deliver a decent performance.At least that is what we can tell from this film adaptation based on Sara Gruen's 2006 novel of the same name.Here, Robert Pattinson discards the white foundation and plays a young man who finds himself on a rickety train after fate surprises him with an unkind twist of events. The train is home to a circus troupe and the veterinary student is put in charge of caring for the circus menagerie. He also meets the charismatic but violent owner of the circus, and his beautiful wife who happens to be the equestrian star of the traveling shows. It is also on this journey he meets an untrained elephant who will become the hope for the fading troupe.If you ask us, the film does not do much justice to the title of Gruen's award winning historical novel. Sure, we got the part about the elephants, but where's the significance of water in the film? We understand (without having read the book) that water is a symbol of purification and self worth, and is portrayed many times in the novel, but we are guessing that director Francis Lawrence (I Am Legend, Constantine) was more concerned about how to make this 122 minute production look beautiful on screen.Cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto (Babel, Brokeback Mountain) captures the splendour and magic of a bygone era on his lens. With the story taking place in the 1930s, the Great Depression never looked so good on film. With production design, art direction and set decoration by Jack Fisk, David Crank and Jim Erickson (the trio worked on 2007's There Will Be Blood), and a wondrous score composed by James Newton Howard (The Last Airbender), it is evident that an elite team has been gathered to ensure that production values are top notch. The effort and talent from the production team is evident in the mesmerising and skillfully created scenes. Be prepared to be transported to a world of spectacle and adventure where circus animals and acrobatic acts enthrall.We don't mean to point fingers, but the problem does seem to lie with the somewhat unexciting storyline where the character development is predictably dull, and the story plays out in the most conventional way one can imagine (cue a white haired old man reminiscing about his glorious past). It may have helped if there was more chemistry amongst the protagonists too ? Pattinson and leading lady Reese Witherspoon (Oscar winner for 2005's Walk the Line) seem to be playing it safe as the couple embarking on a journey of forbidden love. The sparks between the two are minimal and as good looking as they are individually, the pairing just doesn't seem to work.Austria born actor Christoph Waltz (Oscar winner for 2009's Inglourious Basterds) takes on another Hollywood role and manages to outshine his fellow cast members. His portrayal as Witherspoon's husband is charming and brutal at the same time. The violent and abusive owner of the circus is a paranoid schizophrenic, and Waltz effortlessly portrays the role so well that audiences can fall in love with his charisma one moment, and loathe his offensive behaviour the next.Unfortunately, the fine performance by the multi award winning actor isn't enough to elevate the overstretched movie to a level of spectacle a traveling circus show promises.- www.moviexclusive.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Does it have problems? Sure, but it's still a beautiful movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Last night I saw Water for Elephants, a film based on the New York Times best selling book by Sara Gruen. The film has been receiving a wave of mixed reviews recently, and rather unfairly in my opinion, because I very much liked this movie.Centering on a veterinarian student at Cornell named Jacob Jankowski (Played by Robert Pattinson), it tells the story of how his parents were killed in a car accident, and thus Jacob goes on a life on the road, eventually hopping onto a train belonging to the Benzini Bros. circus. He's hired as the animal care specialists by the ringleader August Rosenbluth (Played by Christoph Waltz), and also forges a separate friendship with his wife Marlena (Played by Reese Witherspoon), for which he develops an infatuation. But soon after gaining a spirited elephant named Rosie to help sell out tickets, it isn't long before Jacob and Marlena's relationship starts to get complicated, and that August's dark nature slowly emerges.The screenplay does tend to get a tad formulaic on occasion, but it's an elegantly handled premise. It captures the essence of hardships during the Depression Era, of which period the film takes place. The characters feel appropriately fleshed out, and the performances are quite engaging. I did notice that Pattinson and Witherspoon's chemistry was not always up to par, but they did a well enough job, and on their own are quite good, as is Christoph Waltz's quietly frightening turn as August.The film still does have faults, such as the aforementioned occasional formula and lack of chemistry, and I also think a couple scenes in the second act kind of dragged. But it's also impossible for me to completely hate a movie as well designed as this one. The cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto is lovely, Jack Fisk and Jacqueline West do an excellent job with dazzling respective sets and costumes, and the film features yet another addition to a string of outstanding scores by the great James Newton Howard.It isn't perfect, but I'm gonna give Water for Elephants *** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The train moves fast not the movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a beautiful period piece with attention to detail. Well photographed, great costumes and an excellent score. Reece Witherspoon looks good but doesn't break a sweat. Robert Pattinson still exhibits the range of the living dead. Christoph Waltz is a standout, as kind of a glorious bastard. A book has time to meander, but maybe the movie didn't have to take the time to show going off to school and dead parents. My guess the book took the time to give a little more depth to the Reece character. It's too long and too slow. The foreshadowed long promised circus disaster comes across as funny. The dispatch of the well played villain is not at the hands of the hero.There are beautiful animals. Don't worry about the animal cruelty scenes as there is a disclaimer in the slow over-wide end credits that states "no animals were harmed..."Like the second rate circus, it's a good movie that could have been great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't think Robert Pattinson was all that much to look at. I gotta be honest with you. I don't know what all the kids see in him, but okay.Wait, they have voice over in this movie? When? I just figured somebody was doing a soliloquy like in Shakespeare. You stand there and rattle off a few lines and do your Shakespeare thing and then things start to happen again. They don't do that in movies? They do in my movies. Ha ha.I thought the character development was great. You really got attached to the characters in this one. You understood the love story going on between these two. A little bit of a chick- flick. Reese Witherspoon was a lot of fun, but she seemed a little too refined for spending her whole life in the circus. I mean, you figure, she probably in her mid-20's now. She's gotta have some circus on her, but she's this very classy woman. Hey, you know what might have been fun? If instead of Reese Witherspoon's voice they replaced it with Joy Behar. That would have made her sexy!I'll tell you, they talk about Robert Pattinson being such a big star. Whoever they got to play Rosie the elephant was unbelievable! Man I really was convinced that was an elephant. I swear to God. They had me. You know, that elephant worked for peanuts. Ha ha.I mean that Robert Pattinson? he was kind of monotone through this movie. There wasn't a lot of emotion. He wasn't really up like this and freaking out and he wasn't really down like this, but the whole time he about right here.Christoph Waltz was terrific as August. His emotion was fantastic. This guy could snap at any moment. You don't know what this guy is gonna do.In part of the movie, I guess what's happening here is the elephant is doing some tricks and their cheering and the circus is going on and the elephant is doing its thing. Nice for you sighted people to look at, but really it adds nothing to the story. What the tricks are, I don't know. Probably did a couple of card tricks. Ha ha. So, for Water for Elephants, I'm gonna give it 3 out of 4 eyes open.Hey, you know what time it is when an elephant sits on your fence? Time to buy a new fence, of course!

		<fullReview>No way I will ever watch this movie. I heard about it, and it awoke my curiosity as I love animals. I was even curious to see ex-Twilight guy Mr Pattinson in a new role. However when I went to Parental guidance I was shocked. I like to read this section for myself, and rarely for my kids. My reason is that I am not keen on too much violence and am not particularly interested in intimate scenes that belong in my opinion to people's personal lives. I was happy there is some parental guidance already to this movie! Because, I do not want to watch any Hollywood movies and no Mr Pattinson in a film full of cruelty to animals. I do not even care that hopefully during film making no harm was done to any animal (well hopefully at least, although I can well imagine some people doing bad things for the sake of profit........), but still, I always sit to watch a movie to make me happy and think about issues, but I am not willing to watch film full of blood and cruelty. Even if the world is full of this kind of stuff, movies should promote doing good things and no bad things. I cannot care about anything else. I also don't care if people go against each other, if they are that stupid, but poor animals have so little way to defend themselves. Let us start protecting them by not making stupid films about doing ANY harm to them! I am an ordinary person but this is my way of thinking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice film, well done - but Marxist throughout</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a very enjoyable film - for the story line, script, characters, acting, editing, photography and direction. I commend the whole production for its entertainment value. It is an engrossing story of a man's very interesting and challenging life.However, the whole and only theme here is a total Marxist rant against capitalism. Set in the Great Depression, the only evil main character in the film is, of course, a greedy capitalist circus owner. There is also a small scene that portrays the typical crass banker with no mention, of course, that his first priority is to protect his depositors. The circus owner is portrayed as selfish, heartless and cruel - the embodiment of evil who claims his firm (the circus train) is above the law of the land. Everyone else - man, woman and animal - is exploited, debased, abused and victimized by him and the harsh reality in the quest for profit. Almost every scene is about the oppressive world of life on the circus train and its many victims. Redemption only comes with his downfall and the seizure of the circus by the state, after which the characters are free to resume normal civilized life.Be prepared for a heavy dose of anti-capitalist propaganda, if you can stomach it.</fullReview>

I just lost more than an hour hoping that something , anything!, will happen. Something romantic for this is rated as a romance, or something dramatic as it is also a drama. Or at least something like an ending. I hoped that would do well. No...Nothing happened and Robert Pattinson is still a bad actor. Please people stop shooting him while he is facing the camera because all he ever does is nod and shake his head with an idiotic smile as someone is shooting him with a shotgun instead of a camera.

		<shortDescription>Oscar Worthy! Stunning cinematography and directing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Epic period piece beautifully directed with astonishing cinematography. If you can watch the train disappear into the foggy night without feeling deeply moved and lonely then the romantic in you needs awakening! The characters are deep, full of life, believable and evoke intense emotion. Perhaps the most poorly written character was Marlena played by an outstanding Reese Witherspoon - this may be her best performance but the writers failed to give her character the lines and the passion she needed in this role. Despite this, Witherspoon did a fine job of giving us a somewhat naive but strong female character - one who knows right from wrong but does not know quite how to reach out and grasp it.First of all: It's amazingly beautiful. The costumes and sets are gorgeous, the cinematography is exquisite, the animals are cute (especially Rosie the elephant) and the three leads are very easy on the eyes as well.Robert Pattinson was outstanding as Jacob - there is just something about the way he can speak volumes with his facial expressions - you can see his childlike joy and delight as he watches the circus performances, his anguish at the explosive temper of August and his feeling of betrayal at the treatment of the animals -- just an amazingly expressive face.Christoph Waltz was the Nurse Ratchet of this flick -- you just LOVED to hate him through the entirety of the movie - from his rage, jealousy, his greed, his blind passion for his "dreams" of glory, fame, riches -- to the point of being unimaginably cruel. So believable, I personally wanted to strangle him - I found it difficult to say "he is acting" -- that is a sign of a GREAT performance.The chemistry among the actors from the opening scene with Hal Holbrook meeting the carny guys to the end is pure magic. Outstanding casting, the best storytelling in cinema in YEARS, and cinematography so stunning you can smell the smoke in the air all combine to make this film a journey worth taking more than once.I loved that the writers did not rely on overt sex or heavy sexual overtones to convey love in this movie - but rather let the actors convey it in looks, body language, and reaction to situations. This movie proves it can be done.I loved that they combined the past with the present - a handful of flashback references to provide continuity of script and they paid attention to detail -- the costumes were breathtaking and accurate, the hobo camps, train jumping, the overcrowded sleeper cars, the bond of the carny family, the pain of a bust economy and the losses suffered the details are glorious and so heart-wrenching and real in this movie.There are parts of this film that require you to have a strong stomach for suffering but the ending makes it understandable and somewhat worthwhile (as worthwhile as suffering can be) Easy easy 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lovely surprise.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the bestseller book of the same name by Sara Gruen, 'Water for Elephants' (2011), tells the tale of young Jacob Jankowski (Robert Pattinson), a veterinarian student sitting his final exams upon hearing the news of his parents death. Set during the 1930's, during the depression era in the United States, Jacob is forced to give up his course and leave home. Eventually joining a traveling circus run by August Rosenbluth (Christoph Waltz), Jacob works as the circus vet when the circus acquires its new 'star attraction' Rosie the Elephant. During this time Jacob meets August's wife Marlena (Reese Witherspoon) and the two soon forge a close relationship. I went into this film with fairly average expectations, but by the end it had completely skyrocketed above those expectations. There is so much to love about this film, the cinematography is excellent, the romantic story between the 3 is a fairly typical love story but the performances by the 3 leads lifts the script to its full potential. There is no Edward in Robert's performance (something I was concerned about before going into the film), Reese is stunning and slick as the endearing Marlena, and Christoph Waltz once again reminds us how in debt Hollywood is to Quentin Tarantino for bringing him to mainstream audiences, as the steadfast and brutal circus boss. Perhaps the only criticisms I could give was the length of the film as I felt it could have gone for 20 minutes less and still had the same impact, but ironically, the last few scenes felt slightly rushed and time that was spent during the middle of the film could have been used to further emphasis on the closing scenes. But overall, 'Water for Elephants' is defiantly a triumph, and much of the credit should go to the outstanding cast for rising above what could have been a cheesy script.</fullReview>

Hopefully this movie will prove that Robert Pattinson is a talented actor with a great future. Christopher Waltz was perfect in the role of the ring master.

		<fullReview>I, like a lot of sons probably, went to see Water for Elephants with my family on Mother's day. I've got to say, this movie was pretty solid for the most part, and I definitely didn't expect it to be.A lot of elements about this movie were really fantastic. The cinematography for one, Director of Photography Rodrigo Prieto really did fabulous work showing you a side of the circus most of us will never see. Scenes on the Benzini Brothers train are extremely colorful and well shot, there's also a montage of Jacob's first circus that really stands out.The writing was also top notch and I've been told that the book this movie is based on is very good, so that's not a big surprise. This film is also paced well, it moves along at a good steady pace for a large majority and only drags for a few scenes.However, the most notable item in this film is Christoph Waltz. This guy is really just a phenomenal actor, no doubt about it. Now I've only seen this and Inglorious Basterds but in both of these movies, he's just incredible and I'm glad he's getting the recognition he deserves.That covers what I liked about the movie, now why didn't it get a higher score? This movie has some of the WORST lead performances I've ever witnessed on film. It's a huge let down because everything else about this movie is quite strong, but Pattinson and Witherspoon have absolutely no chemistry, or acting capabilities period. It's literally painful watching these two butcher what could have been such a great love story with their idiotic mumblings and **** terrible presence. You end up wishing Christoph's character would just kill them both and we can just watch him be crazy for the rest of the movie. It's like if an artist hand painted a beautiful piece and then stood up, dropped trou, and took a gigantic **** all over the canvas and tried to have a conversation with it.</fullReview>

If only Robert Pattison's Jacob could have had the sparkle in his eyes of old Jacob, as beautifully played by Hal Holbrook. Pattison's lack of charisma brings down the usually solid Reese Witherspoon. Even Christoph Waltz, who was chillingly brilliant in "Inglourious Basterds," came off as mostly bland. The performance by Rosie, the elephant was one of the film's too few highlights. There seems to be an interesting story, here, but Pattison's lack of personality, as Jacob, brings down what could have been a decent film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Water for Elephants</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my first time posting a review. I think I have picked an easy film to review. Water for Elephants was a throw-back to by-gone years of movie making. It appears to be a big old Hollywood film. The music, costuming, cinematography, sets, and acting were all top of the line. You felt you were back in the depression. The circus was anything but glamorous. It was dirty and grimy. Only to be beautiful under the lights and during the illusion. Then it is all taken down and moved down the line. Reasonably true to the book you will only be aware of changes if you have read it. Reese brought a certain strength and tiredness to Marlena. But she also had an inner strength that had helped her survive. Christophs' August was a volatile character. Pleasant and charming one moment, then in a second, a nasty, mean, angry man. Finally, Robert Pattinson. The young man is growing. He is actually perfect as Jacob. Young, idealistic, and above all else moralistic. He learns to love all the people around him. I love this film and want to see it again and again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sara Gruen's Book Water For Elephants was a masterpiece and while books are always better than the movie, this movie came pretty darn close.A few changes were made from the book but the movie captures the essence of the book masterfully. The cinematography alone deserves awards. The set design and costumes are the best I've seen since The Titanic.The cast is sublime. Robert Pattinson proves that he is more than a pretty face. While he still seems to be stiff a couple of times his performance is spot on. His work with Rosie(Tai)the elephant melted my heart. Tai herself stole almost every shot she was in. Reese Witherspoon and Christoph Waltz remind the viewer why they are Academy Award winners. Francis Lawrence's direction and vision for the movie truly transports the viewer to the 1930's. I've seen the movie 3 times and I know I'll go back to see it again. I'll be buying the DVD the day it is released too. The movie is a must see in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Water for Elephants, in short, is not to be missed. I was terrifically surprised to see Robert Pattinson hold his own as Jacob Jankowski, a young veterinary student who joins a traveling circus. He broke from his stolid, cold (no pun intended) Twilight acting; I had groaned when I heard he was playing Jacob, for I have read this book, but I was surprised to be very, very pleased with his performance.The movie is incredible from beginning to end. The whole atmosphere is fantastic, and you feel as if you are transported from your seat. The acting was fabulous from truly every cast member, though, naturally, Robert and Reese stood out the most. Those behind the camera stayed very true to the book and did not leave out much from what I could see.All in all, this movie is what watching a movie is all about. You are truly brought into this time period, and, when it's over, will want to watch it all over again. It is most definitely a favorite of mine. Sara Gruen (author of Water for Elephants) should be proud.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly Spectacular</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Water for elephants is truly the most spectacular show on earth. The whole movie just transports you to another time and your attention is immediately caught and held. Be it because of the characters, the wide array of scenes or the story line - or all three. You are unable to move out of your seat until the very end. At which, admittedly, I was sad to see. The scenery is just beautiful and incredibly fascinating as well. When Jacob gets on that train - the audience does too and his journey through the circus world is simply amazing. Robert Pattinson, in my opinion, does a great job at portraying each and every one of Jacob's feelings. Incredibly emotional and very much inside of his character. You can honestly sympathise with him, laugh with him, and feel as he does. His performance is flawless. Christoph Waltz provides the perfect 'bad guy'. You are really able to despise his character, but also feel pity for him at moments. He does a spectacular job at August's ever changing moods. Reese Witherspoon plays perfectly Marlena, she looks the part and acted it too. Her character's relationship with the two main leads (and Rosie of course!) is pivotal, and I really feel she did a marvellous job. And Tai, of course she steals the scene many occasion. She is enrapturing and simply lovely. Couldn't have picked a better Rosie.All in all, I can sufficiently say I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Powerful, emotional scenes ensued, along with its ability to make the audience be right there in the circus with all the characters and action. Gets your heart pounding more than once, and brings tears of sadness and joy to your eyes. In my opinion, this is a movie anyone can enjoy - all ages. I'm already buzzing to see this again. Truly, Water For Elephants is spectacular.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sometimes a movie captures your heart...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>and this one did just that.This hasn't happened to me for a very long time. If you rate a movie 10/10 for touching your heart, enthralling you, engaging your mind and sitting you on the edge of your set. Then Water for Elephants deserves a full score. Everyone in the cinema was completely caught up and sighs and gasps were easily heard in between the moment of sheer suspense when it is so silent you are afraid to breath.Reece Witherspoon was stunning. Graceful and beautiful, this role was meant for her. Pattinson was the best I have seen him to date. But Christoph Waltz made this movie. He was exceptional playing this character! Of course the shining star was Rosie. There isn't a more beautiful and awe inspiring creature on this earth than an elephant. And this movie reminds us of that.The sounds track was also moving and perfect.This one will stir me for a long time to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Must see Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Excellent movie with superb acting by all three leads as well as the supporting cast. The visuals were also breathtaking - really took you back to the thirties. The entire time watching this movie, it felt like you were in the thirties with them. Robert Pattinson's performance as Jacob is outstanding. He is exceptional - so expressive and portrays the innocence and inner beauty to offset the violence of the movie. He is truly the heart and soul of this movie. I went with my husband (and yes I had to talk him into it) but he liked it as much as I did. It has just enough romance and action to keep everyone interested. Both male and female viewers will love this movie. Don't know what some of the critics were watching but it could not have been this movie - or they would have all rated it as a must see or at least a see! It is a 5 out of 5! Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Water for Elephants, is one of the best movies I've seen this year. A lot of people wonder how well Robert Pattinson will be in the movie, an from my point of view he did a wonderful job. He was so wonderful, an he an Reese have great chemistry in this movie despite some rumors. I could go on an on about this movie but I'm not going to ruin it for anyone. I highly recommend everyone take the time to watch it. I could watch it over an over i loved it so much. Robert, Reese, an Tai, an the rest of the cast were wonderful an if I could give the movie a rating higher than 10 I would. And Tai the elephant did a great job. I've enjoyed all movies she's been in. But to give a little heads up there are a few scenes that can be a real tear jerker, and with me personally I cried an was angry at the same time. I don't really have much else to say. I'm just wanting to put a good word out about the movie, an I cant wait to see it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful scenery and great emotion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to the movie with an open mind. Yes, I have seen the twilight films but that said, Mr. Pattinson and especially Cristoph Waltz stole the show. Cristoph should have no trouble being nominated for an academy award next season. Reese Witherspoon was good but the others and the supporting cast as fellow circus workers made it worth watching. I am an animal lover so some of the scenes were extremely hard to watch but knowing that this is movie making and they have people on set to make sure none of the animals are hurt made it a bit easier to see. The beginning was a little slow but kept building up over the two hours where i was not disappointed spending my money. I was very surprised that I actually had a few tears running down my face at the end. If you are sentimental like myself you will very much like Water For Elephants.</fullReview>

I laughed, I cried, I cheered, this movie evoked a wide range of emotion. Robert Pattinson does not disappoint with his performance and I really felt like he became Jacob Jankowski. Christoph Waltz sent a shiver through my spine with his perfprmance as August. Many of the supporting roles were top notch as well, on of course Tai practically stole the show as Rosie the elephant. this is a movie definitely recommend for the 13 and over crowd.

All the actors were great. The costumes were so spot on, especially Reese Witherspoon's. It really transported me to that time and place. Loved seeing Robert in this role, just because he plays Edward Cullen on one of the most popular film franchises does not mean he can't act. I thought he also did an incredible job in Remember me.

		<shortDescription>Absolutely beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen the movie twice now, and think it is absolutely stunning in every way. The scenery and cinematography are gorgeous. The night shots of the train through the countryside - spectacular. The actors were fantastic. I positively LOATHED Christoph's character, adored Rob's character (and must admit, am horribly jealous of him for getting to have the fantastic experience of hanging out with the animals) and am slightly puzzled at some reviewers disapproval of Reese's Marlena. I do think I understand what is being said of her coming across slightly remote, but I personally think it makes sense, given what her character has been through in her life. I think if you've read the book, you of course have a much more in-depth understanding of the characters. If you haven't read the book - do it. Its amazing.Admittedly I chose to leave the theatre for 5 minutes when August goes back for revenge against Rosie. But as anyone who has seen the movie will attest, he receives his just desserts - in a perfect way, in my opinion.Just a beautiful movie, perfect for any age, and gender. Read the book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rarely take the time to review films, but tonight I am taking the time to review this one.The American Humane Association is saying no animals were harmed on set. I'm sure that is true, I certainly hope it is. However, how the animals were treated prior to filming is apparently another very sad and disgusting story.Consider doing a web search for Water For Elephants Animal Abuse, read the articles and watch the video of Tai, (aka Rosie in the film) being abused when being trained to do the circus tricks, just a few short years ago in California.I somehow wished Tai was always treated humanely, but apparently, according to the journalist in the news video I watched, you can't get an elephant to do these ridiculous stunts without abusing it. Not a big surprise,really. UPDATE: Thanks to organizations like Animal Defenders International, who had evidence of abuse and fought for Tai (Rosie in the movie) and Rosie (another Elephant owned by Have Trunk, Will Travel), AZA recently announced new standards for human interaction with elephants. The new 'Protected Contact' standards will provide greater safety for elephant care workers as well as enhanced animal welfare.Please visit the Animal Defenders international web site and search for "elephant" for more information.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>truly the most spectacular show on Earth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am really surprised about this movie. After reading all the reviews i begin to think something very important: did we all watch the same movie? Robert Pattinson was truly spectacular, proving once and for all that he can in fact be a great actor. While I love the Twilight films, I feel that they do not show Pattinson's true worth. "Water for Elephants" does this. Pattinson's portrayal of Jacob Jankowski was truly amazing. Another thing I was shocked to hear about was that about Robert's and Reese Witherspoon's so called "lack of chemistry". I saw lots of chemistry between the two of them. They showed the true love between the two characters. Christoph Waltz was amazing as August;he pulled off his character was amazing finesse. But the best part of this whole film was the chemistry between Robert and his not human costar, Tai the Elephant, who portrays the star attraction Rosie. She stole the show, and with Pattinson as her costar, made for a spectacular film to watch. I loved this adaptation of the book. As with all movies that are based on novels, it did leave out certain things, but I felt that it was pretty dead on in covering the main focuses and point of the novel. All the actors are accurately chosen and made this film truly one of the most spectacular shows on Earth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did they even read the book?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was so upset by this movie that I booted my computer back up and created an IMDb account just to review it. I like Reese Witherspoon and have nothing against Robert Pattinson; my issue is with integrity (or even remote integrity) to the book. I know they have to cut out details and streamline, but they took so much liberty with this screenplay that I truly wonder if they even read the book. I think someone just told them about the highlights of the book and they took it from there. Characters were collapsed, significant scenes were jumbled, new story lines (many new story lines) were created. The book gave you insight to circus life based on actual research. The movie gave a cursory glance to that as it tried to "improve" upon the romance thread. I didn't even like the book as much as I disliked the movie. Maybe this is an OK chick flick if you haven't read the book, but anyone who read the book and liked the movie needs to read the book again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...Well not quite that bad but I doubt I will remember any of it in the coming weeks! Witherspoon looks bored and Pattinson goes all out to show us just how average an actor he really is. There is no passion between the two of them at all. Considering this part of the story is pivotal to what unfolds, it is nigh impossible for the film to get any emotional investment from its audience. Waltz gets the meat &amp; potatoes role for the human element, but even his performance will be one he will probably like to forget in years to come. Would have preferred to see more of the circus because Rosie the elephant is by far the best actor here and lights up the screen whenever she is in shot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film out of its time - but nice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is just like a film from the 30s, 40s or 50s - realistic of its period(1931), slow burn, no real sex (although it is about real passion), animals in a circus (cue Animal Rights antis - why not look at Iraq for human cruelty?), and costumes that do not flatter modern women. So the circus life and world depicted looks like a small version of 'The Greatest Show on Earth', complete with train; heavy handed, driven head honcho; Germanic animal trainer who is vicious and jealous; gorgeous married leading lady with an impure past and a suppressed roving eye; good animal acts; and a medical man hiding from his past. Cue ending in disaster as the animals break free. But who will survive? So the plot is derivative, but works reasonably well. The sense of period is excellent (except Modern day America does not wish to be reminded that it was once very poor) and the photography very good. The direction and script moves a bit quick to begin with, and then settles into a slow smouldering burn (Again modern day heroines are supposed to be feisty not under the thumb of a vicious husband!). It works, well in places, but does hang back a little because of modern sensibilities and the 12A cert. There is not enough ease of showing animals in the circus, and the intimate moments look coy and old fashioned.The acting is where the film shines and sags. Robert Pattinson starts well as the naive youth, but when a greater range is required later on, he does not manage to pull it off, say like a mature Clark Gable (who did not really act too often, let's face it). The knife scene almost looks silly. Reese Witherspoon again demonstrates her understated dramatic skills, keeping her feelings locked up for most of the film (cue lack of chemistry comments with her co-star) as the story demands (but which modern audiences demand to be upfront early on), and doing wonders riding the elephant! The circus costumes for her appear authentic, but hardly flatter a very attractive actress, and the 30s duds require a taller girl to do justice to them - but once again Ms Witherspoon takes a risk and pulls it off despite the lukewarm response from audiences. Not having seen Christophe Waltz before, he does well in a half hearted way with the vicious (but not enough) husband/circus boss role - it is too subtle or pulls its punches. The film is not quite courageous enough frankly. And, of course, it is seen as dark without a redemption to let the modern audience walk out happy, despite a moderately happy ending. Wake up, America, all is not sweetness and light for you - China's dominance is coming. try and get a redemption out of that!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the greatest show on earth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The age-old question for all film critics is this: can you judge a movie based just on what's on the screen, or does any preconceived notion of the material creep into your opinion?I read Sara Gruen's 2006 novel "Water For Elephants" over the last winter break. It is a beautiful story, lushly told with larger-then-life character and rich historical details. While it is through the eyes of a fan of the novel that I watched the film, which opened April 22, I will try not to let my admiration of the novel cloud my opinion on the film, which as a whole, stuck quite closely to the source material. "Water For Elephants" tells the depression-era story of Jacob Jankowski, a Columbia veterinarian student who, during a final exam, finds out that his parents died in a car accident. Alone and depressed, Jacob leaves school and ends up jumping an unknown train that turns out to be The Benzini Brothers Circus; a second-rate show ran by the brutal ringmaster August Rosenbluth. Once August hears that he is a vet, Jacob is hired to oversee the animals, especially a sick horse that is the circus' main attraction. While treating the horse, Jacob meets Marlena, August's wife and star of the show. He is instantly smitten by this beautiful, graceful woman who seems to be everything her husband is not: talented, gentle and kind. With the help of Camel, a crusty veteran roustabout (the working-class laborers) Jacob soon becomes immersed in circus life. When August buys an elephant named Rosie, which Jacob is to train for an act staring Marlena, it begins a series of events that will change Jacob's life and the history of the Benzini Brothers forever. Bookending the film is scenes of a 90-something-year-old Jacob who arrives to go to a local circus long after the show has ended. He ends up in the manager's office where he shares his life story over a couple drinks. "Water For Elephants" is a gorgeous film. Each shot is beautifully composed, like a painting, and give it an old-fashioned, reminiscent quality. Although, at times, the world of the film does seem a little too shiny, a little too clean for its own good. The Benzini Brothers in the novel is a rat-infested, hack show, run by unscrupulous people who think nothing of throwing people off the moving train because they didn't have the money to pay them. It is place populated by alcoholics, thieves, whores and other dregs of society. While the movie shows this, it is through the lens of a love story, shot in the glossy warmth of "The Notebook" or "Titanic." It edited the book's sex and violence into a PG-13, surely so all those Twihards can see it, but it makes the film a little sanitized, more fable then the novel's gritty reality. While there is nothing wrong with films like "The Notebook," it leaves this film which a certain unoriginality that was absent from the novel. Robert Pattinson, who makes tweens swoon as a hunky bloodsucker in a certain series of vampire films, is stiff and somewhat wooden in the role of Jacob (maybe he's stuck in undead mode?). His Jacob is good-hearted but has no real personality or recognizable traits. While this might work in "Twilight," allowing teen girls to impose their ideal of a perfect man over this blank slate, it doesn't really work here. In those films, his character is almost a prop, an archetype to be fawned over by its main character, but here he is the lead, propelling the story forward. That perpetual motion is not quite achieved because of his lackluster performance. Playing opposite him is Reese Witherspoon as Marlena. We all know Witherspoon's talent and versatility and her performance is brimming with heart and warmth. But while her performance is good, Witherspoon is miscast. Her character is supposed to be a few years older than Pattinson's, but the age difference in the two leads is distractingly big. Witherspoon is still a beautiful woman, but her romance with a boy 11 years her junior never quite feels comfortable. Although, some of that may be due more to Pattinson's acting than Witherspoon's age. This would have indeed been a much better film with Emile Hirsch and Rachel McAdams, perhaps, or Andrew Garfield and Amanda Seyfried as the leads.Despite those casting snafus, the rest of the actors deliver. Christoph Waltz, Oscar winner for "Inglorious Bastards," is captivating as August, the abusive and hotheaded ringmaster with just an unpredictable glint of charisma in his eye. Despite having only a few scenes, Hal Holbrook gives a touching performance as the old Jacob. The supporting cast also is strong, with such character actors as Jim Norton (as Camel), Mark Povinelli (as Kinko) and Paul Schneider (as the modern circus manager who takes a shine to the old Jacob)."Water For Elephants" is a solid film. Especially in this day an age when most films include explosions or CGI effects, the film is unique in its simplicity and commitment to old- fashioned storytelling. You get the idea the same film could have been made in the '40s, which does give the film a timeless, classic quality to it. But, perhaps if it were made then, the story wouldn't have felt as predictable and stilted. Whether you see it because you're a fan of the book or of the film's star, "Water For Elephants" will surely please. Although the lack of chemistry between the leads and the occasional-romance-novel feel make the film seem a bit like "Titanic" on a train and less of the gritty historical drama found in Gruen's novel, which prevents it from being what it could have been: The Greatest Show on Earth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty well done love story in a circus setting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Familiar formula romance flick done in an unusual Depression-era circus setting. Loving but jealous and mean circus-owner husband fights hard and rough but loses pretty young wife to a nice young lover who joined the circus by pure chance when his financially supporting parents got killed in a car accident. Some interesting twists for sure, but it still was that same old Hollywood love story over everything else that supported it. We are always suckers for that wonderful Hollywood romance fairy tale(the producers sure think we are)that never works out the same way in real life. And, it looks so perfect on the big screen that viewers think maybe, yes maybe, all that wonderfulness could happen to them! So, they buy tickets every time no matter how repetitive that same old love story is told.In this story, Christopher Waltz was the total charisma, along with Rosie the elephant, as Reese Witherspoon was poorly cast as his horse/elephant performer wife, and Christopher Pattinson was OK in his role, but about as average as 10 other young actors would have been if cast. As his narrow emotional acting range was mostly offset by his shy and nice demeanor in the role, he pulls it off satisfactorily but not memorably. Waltz, however, as the insanely jealous and probably psychopathic(thus insane)circus owner, was the brilliance here, as his tremendous acting talent and skill could not be matched by Pattinson and Witherspoon combined in a thousand years. Waltz was just as spellbinding and terrific here as he was as the dynamic but evil Nazi officer in Inglorius Basterds. A real movie star for sure, but also one who is a great actor(many are not). His will soon be a household name.With Rosie the wonder elephant doing her amazing tricks, and Waltz doing his amazing acting, this movie was an overall success, but the wife and lover roles could have been done as well or better by nearly any other pretty actors chosen, and for a lot less money than Witherspoon charged("hey, she sells tickets") The movie was very attractive, professional and artistic, with a good score, plus outstanding circus and train scenes, and Depression-era staging/costuming/grooming. However, one major thing I didn't buy was the total avoidance of any legal consequences for all the circus worker murders orchestrated by the owner over the years. Folks, that was still America in those days, not medieval Russia, so that part was a real cred stretch. Overall, a very watchable and entertaining film mainly due to Waltz and Rosie and great filmmaking technicals.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful film that certainly did the book justice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story of a young man of polish immigrant parents; happy, content and without a care in the world despite the Great Depression of the 1930's, who is coming to the end of six years of veterinary studies at his Ivy League University, Cornell and looking forward to a wonderful life, his whole future mapped out before him. How aptly he describes his world slipping from its axis as he sits down to begin his final exam; 'then with the opening of a door, every plan I had vanished.'I would be the first to confess that I was going to see this film regardless, purely because Robert Pattinson was playing the lead role. (He sold a copy of the book too really as I bought it awaiting the film release and wouldn't have done otherwise!)The book captured me right from the opening page and I'd read it within a matter of hours. As with other reviewers that have read the book, I too immediately related to Hal Holbrook's performance as the elderly Jacob Jankowski and my heart went out to the rather lost and forlorn character who still has plenty of life in him despite the opinions of almost all but one nurse in his nursing home . . . and even she leaves him! Quite how Hal Holbrook managed to pull off the essence of the older Jacob when in comparison to the book his 'part' was so small, I have no idea but manage it he did. All credit to him for his few minutes of screen time. He has one of the best tongue-in-cheek lines too: 'have you got anything to drink around here that isn't apple juice?' The story is indeed set in the 1930's depression and to use a circus to bring the idea of the struggles of life back then and how people with so little somehow managed to survive (well, not all perhaps when August Rosenblum is your boss!) was pure genius on the part of Sara Gruen and I don't think the scriptwriters let her down in their interpretation of her story. Despite the difficulties of the era, somehow within the circus setting, life seems very colourful, exciting and with plenty of scope for romance, comedy and drama all of which were brought to the screen exceedingly well in this film.This film was my first experience of Christoph Waltz but he was phenomenal in the role of August Rosenblum and whilst the scriptwriters did indeed blend Gruen's character, Uncle Al with the character of August, I did not miss Al at all; in fact he really wasn't necessary for the film. The only thing lost was the slightly 'grovelling' nature that August sometimes displays around Al in the book which adds to the complexity of the character and almost a direct contradiction at times. However, Waltz carries off this 'combined' character sublimely. For me he was August; loving, kind, caring, compassionate with every antonym to these keywords too! At times he was positively frightening.Reese Witherspoon plays Marlena, wife of August with a new romantic interest on the horizon in the young Jacob. For the most part, I thought she portrayed Marlena well although there were a few moments where I couldn't fully relate to the character from the book though that may be more down to scripting than the actress. However Reece was amazing each time she portrayed her character in the ring and all credit to her for her amazing performances.Robert Pattinson has really come into his own in this film, although I felt he had done so long before in other films he has made (and I'm not referring to a single Twilight film!). In Water for Elephants though, the boy has become a man and he plays the part of Jacob with equal skill to that of Hal Holbrook. He is tender, comical, thoughtful, romantic and dramatic in equal measure. I was able to believe he was Jacob. Quite a lot of the book is expressed by Jacob's thoughts and Pattinson presented this well by expression alone bringing to the character all that was not included in the script. His voice over's are well delivered too and when blended together with Hal Holbrook's it's superb! Very often when you read a book and see the characters you love on screen you can be left wanting but that was far from the case here. As with Waltz, Pattinson owned the character of Jacob and his performance was outstanding, though I doubt he will receive the true accolades he deserves for this. He certainly seems to be the man the critics have singled out to love to hate and destroy if they can!Tai the elephant, as Rosy was a real sweetheart and there are some wonderful moments between Tai, Pattinson and Witherspoon. Not quite as sweet when the character of August is involved so be warned; he's downright cruel and vicious!Would strongly recommend Water for Elephants for the story and the cast. I don't much care about the cinematography as it's pretty much irrelevant to this story. If you're that way inclined this is a tear-jerker for sure. One of the sweetest moments for me was the 'home movie' shots of Jacob, Marlena and their children. A nice touch and brilliant close to the film.Just one small point. For those whining about the cruelty to animals, can I just point out that there are laws against that sort of thing and you can be assured that all the animals would have been well cared for and the making of the film closely supervised by bodies responsible for animal welfare. If you believed all that you saw in this film then I think it just shows how well it was really done!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Snail's pace boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I literally fell asleep twice. Although I like the book, this movie just has no spirit or heart. The circus scenes could and should have been spectacular to contrast between the life behind the scenes. Reese Witherspoon phoned this one in. Christoph Waltz is always good. Pattinson - meh. It was gloomy and depressing and nothing ever happened until the end. No chemistry between the star-crossed lovers. If you want a nap, watch this. Additionally I have to write more so that there will be ten lines of text. Even though I have pretty much said everything that I wanted to say. So as soon as I finish this sentence, it should...there we go.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful romantic, circus film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know I would say this but: I was shocked by the "59%" rating on Rotten Tomatoes and the controversy I had read online. I loved this adaptation of the book as with all movies that are based on the novels I have at home. I thought it is a beautifully done romantic, circus film. But for those of you with sensitive hearts , you might cry at some scenes - just a reminder. I had read the original book and I love it. In fact I love both the book and film versions of the story, even if there were changes to the characters.Twilight's Robert Pattinson stars in the film as the orphaned, penniless Jacob Jankowski, who had quit college just before his Veterinary Science finals, on the news of the death of his parents. Then he'd hitch a ride on a circus train, and soon found himself employed as vet to the animals in "The Benzini Brothers" circus. Jacob soon became enamored with Marlena Rosenbluth, the circus boss' wife and also the star attraction of the show. Now I know I would say this too: that is all I will tell of the film, folks - you will have to see the film for yourself how it ends.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was extremely disappointed with this film. Although the first hour was great, the era was entertaining, the costumes were glorious and the plot. I found that the violence in particular the cruelty to animals quite disturbing and unnecessary. I do not think it is suitable as a 12a I think a number of children would be rather upset. It did upset me and I was disappointed as I left the cinema early and that was a first! I would love to know how it ends as it started really entertaining but I do think parents should be warned. Both Robert and Reece were exceptional however the emotion was real and heart jerking in most scenes as their bond was quite clear from the start. Overall I was disappointed but a strong stomach would be bearable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is pretty bad when I say the most redeeming quality of this film is the fact that it helps me forget Robert Pattenson was in the biggest tweener series since the high school musical series. A Luke warm showing by Reese Witherspoon capped off my worst fears of this film. I was hoping she would be this movies saving grace. Unfortunately she was the grown version of the character she played nearly 2 decades ago in fear or worse a off beat June Carter Cash. I expected more from her. Same classic book to movie complaints ..... Doesn't follow original story any more than necessary. Considering the cast could have been the sleeper hit of the season. At least they didn't follow the new mantra if you can't make a good movie make it 3d. For any person expecting the hype of the trailers save the $20 and buy the DVD or better yet get it at red box.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Elephant is really cool... the rest is not so bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So today I decided to treat my mom to a film and she chose Water For Elephants, the latest Reese Witherspoon movie. My first thoughts about this movie were that Robert Pattinson would play a mopey lover boy, Reese Witherspoon would be a depressed starlet, and everyone else was just along for the ride. However, there was a little flexibility in the roles each of them played, but I must comment it was not much of a change from what we have seen in the past. So let's get started: The positives of this movie begins with the awesome trained elephant in this movie. Rosy is a fantastic, beautiful elephant that brings a lot of humor and majesty to the film. I found myself laughing at her more than anything else, and was really impressed by the character she added to the film. She is very fun, very well trained in her stunts, and was a gentle giant that I was actually connecting to. Right now I would say that was the most enjoyable thing about this movie. The second positive thing I would say is the combination of the camera work, scenery, and music in this movie. These three aspects were well balanced and blended as they paint the setting of a circus in the depression. Intense music plays during sad romantic scenes, joyful uplifting music is shown as we see the various shots of the circus, mainly Rosey's training, come to life. And spectacular performances are integrated to make you think you are in an actual circus show. Combine this with the camera work to capture the emotion of the animals and performers and you've come up with an impressive scene. A third positive is the extras in this movie, that did a fantastic job playing a close knit circus family. It helps one get into the mindset of actually being in the circus, which also is due to the camera work mentioned earlier. Finally I do have to mention that Robert Pattinson did actually play a role where he smiles and is happy at some points. It's a nice change from the emotionally depressed and unstable character that he plays in just about every other movie. Reese Witherspoon is good as always as well, but you can basically get her character from the trailers.Okay negatives about this movie. The first is the plot is predictable basically from the first twenty minutes of the movie. Pattinson meets his crew and makes friends and enemies, and from the first real big scene where we see the antagonist's actions you know what is coming. A second weakness is that there is a lot of harsh treatment of animals in this film. I warn any who can't stand animals suffering or being hurt to be prepared for this movie. I'm not saying the guy is pulling a Micheal Vick, but there is some brutal beatings and heartbreaking shots that can make your heart break. Although it brings you into the world, I'm not one for seeing animals suffer. Third there are times where the drama gets a little to soap opera like for me, especially when it comes to the kissing and one liners this film has to offer. However it is a drama and one should always expect the classic soap opera lines. Perhaps a fourth thing that I could say is that if you're not one for a sad movie, then you may be turned off by this movie. Although there is a somewhat happy ending in this movie, there is a lot of scenes that break your heart or at least make you sad. I won't reveal anything, but be warned it is sad.So what did I think overall. Well the elephant is really cool and worth checking out how well animal training can be, the acting again is good by both the main cast and the extras and brings you into the circus life. I'm a man who loves setting the scene and thus have enjoyed the world they created in this movie, and finally the story was okay, though again the book was better. Overally I will give this soap opera movie a 7.5-8 at the most. It's predictability, romance story, and mediocre dialog are still a little too cheesy for me. Recommended audience for this movie are fans of the book, Pattinson and Witherspoon fans, people who love drama/romance stories, and people who really like elephants. As always enjoy the movies and I'll see you next week.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disastrous Casting Choice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to this movie, hoping to like it, as the novel made a nice impression. Since the appeal of the book wasn't so much the improbable plot as the milieu of the story, the colorful world of a 1930's circus. There is indeed much to like in the movie, most notably the photography. This is likely the most beautiful movie of the year, superbly photographed, almost magical in spots. Unfortunately, there is one major thing to dislike, in two words, Reese Witherspoon. Elephants is a secular fairy tale. Good looks are always nice, but this particular role required them, a sort of ethereal beauty that instantly captivates the hero. Reese Witherspoon was both too old and too plain for the role. The chemistry between her and the hero was exactly zero. There was no attraction, and the love story - which is central - became static and died. Too bad - this could have been a superb picture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Remember the seeing film with Bruce Willis and Haley Joe Osment and how surprised you were when you found out at the end that Bruce's character was one of the dead people? Wasn't that the best part of the The Sixth Sense? Yes, it was.Now imagine a book that has just as big a surprise. It is called Water for Elephants. And guess what? The book was made into a beautiful movie that is cast well and has glorious cinematography -- but for some reason the big surprise was removed from the story.How much would you have liked The Sixth Sense if you knew all along that that Bruce Willis was dead? We'll that's just about how much you'll like Water for Elephants. Because they TOOK THE BEST PART OF THE BOOK OUT!!! In the book, there is a murder. When Jacob tells the story about the stampede, he tells the reader that she looked him right in the eye before she did it -- and he tried to stop her.But she saw an opportunity and she committed murder. And all the way through the book, we know that the "she" he was talking about was Marlena. And we continue reading to find out what finally drove Marlena to finally kill her abusive husband.Was Marlena worthy of Jacob's love? We're never really sure. There was always this murder thing hanging over her character.And then we are shocked at the end to find out that Marlena was innocent. Marlena wasn't the "she" that Jacob was talking about.HOW COULD THEY HAVE DROPPED THIS FROM THE FILM? Why did they drop the delicious misdirection that made you say WTF when you got to that part of the book? I'm still shaking my head.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not quite the 'greatest show on earth'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There was a time in this country's history when a visit from a traveling circus was about the most exciting event small towns could witness. Often times, practically the entire community would close down from the time the troupe rolled into the hamlet until it packed up and left again.From the late 1800s through 1944 (when a fire at the Ringling Bros Circus in Hartford, Conn killed over 140 people, mostly children), the traveling show was many times the only entertainment the populace would see all year. Twentieth Century-Fox's newest release, "Water For Elephants," chronicles a small piece of this history.And, had this adaptation of the popular Sara Gruen novel, directed by Francis Lawrence ("Constantine," "I Am Legend") stayed faithful to this plot line, I could have given it a higher grade; instead, however, it drifts off into a tepid love triangle between the three leads, Jacob (Robert Paterson of "Twilight" fame), Marlena (Reese Witherspoon, "Walk the Line") and August (Christoph Waltz, fresh off his Oscar-winning performance in "Inglorious Basterds").August and Marlena are married. He is the owner of the barely successful Barzini Bros. Circus, while she is the star equestrian performer. Jacob, whose parents die on his last day as a veterinarian student at Cornell, ends up hopping the circus freight train and soon becomes the resident vet.Here, he meets a group of rough but lovable roustabouts, is ordered to become the trainer to the circus' newest attraction (Rosie the elephant) and falls in love with Marlena. He also witnesses the cruelty August exhibits to both animals and humans, especially his wife.Jacob and Marlena try to run away together, but August's goons are always one step ahead. Then, after a weird conclusion, things are wrapped up in a flashback narrated by Hal Holbrook ("Into the Wild").Waltz and Holbrook are wonderful in this picture, the former seething in delightful wickedness, yet holding on to some humanity; while the latter revels sweetly in a very small role. As the unfaithful wife and circus star, though, Witherspoon seems tentative and almost totally miscast. Worse yet, although he gives it his best, Patterson is dark, brooding and as unemotional as the pasty, undead teenage vampire character he has cut his acting teeth on. It's like watching a cigar store Indian trying to impersonate James Dean."Water For Elephants" is a three-ring affair with one of the rings removed. Marketing this movie - "The Notebook" meets "Circus World" - as a love story is a mistake. The is no love story. There's no love between Marlena and August and there's certainly no sparks (or chemistry) between Marlena and Jacob.That's sad, because I wanted to give this movie a higher mark. The scenes with Waltz and Holbrook, as well as the wonderful cinematography and nice period detail and sequences with Rosie were terrific. I just wish there was more elephants and less infidelity.That might have truly made this one of the "greatest shows on earth," or at least one of the better films of the year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the film in South Africa on Friday afternoon - The trailer was an attractive, appealing one which made the film look intriguing; promising a sweeping period story and an epic romance. "Water for Elephants" certainly isn't unwatchable. However, it lacks any serious emotional power, Robert Pattinson (so effectively cast in the "Twilight" movies) is a good looking, and interesting looking, guy, but he definitely isn't a great actor. Pattinson fails to create a three dimensional character. One never sees what is going on in Jacob's head, because Pattinson isn't capable of projecting internal emotions. Reese Witherspoon - who can act - is miscast. Christopher Waltz - who was really well cast in "Inglourous Basterds" is certainly entertaining to watch and I would attribute some of the failings of his colorful character to the script rather than his acting ability.The "chocolate box" cinematography is pleasant, colorful and sometimes atmospheric, rather than brilliant, and the film never really gets into top gear. Like its leading man, it's nice looking, but lacking in real substance. The narrative structure is also lumpy, and the story doesn't flow naturally. The best acting in the picture is done by Hal Holbrook and Paul Schneider in relatively small roles. But, to be honest, Rosie the elephant is easily the most endearing character in the film. While the film was disappointing and is certainly not an out and out flop, the story has been dumbed-down to appeal to a teenage demographic. It's got no real sexual or romantic heat. But, funny enough, I think youngsters will enjoy it. Especially teenage girls. I just hoped for so much more. No wonder 20th Century Fox are keeping it away from the critics for as long as possible, and opening it in a few smaller territories before the States. It ain't going to pick up sparkling reviews.Don't think I hated it though, I just expected and hoped for so much more. The film's ending is a wee bit anti-climactic, but then the romantic part of the storyline is so predictable that it could hardly have ended any other way. I was, however, touched - little tears even welled up in my eyes - by the scene involving the horse's tragic demise, and a scene involving Rosie being hurt by Waltz's August. The costumes and period details are good, (although things sometimes look a wee bit too glamorous considering the milieu it plays out in), but the dialog and body language of the actors feels too contemporary. I imagine, given the film's target demographic, and the marketing campaign - which is centered around Pattinson, that this was intentional.The story, while interesting enough (not surprising, since it is based on a popular novel), never really gathers an epic sweep, not is it ever intimate enough to compensate for this. Mostly, it just lacks the genuine romantic heat to succeed fully. There is virtually no erotic chemistry or tension between Pattinson and Witherspoon. So serious, passionate adult cinema-goers looking for intelligent, emotionally resonant fare will be disappointed, but maybe it will work for "Twilight" fans, if you know what I mean. The teenage girls will like it, and their boyfriends won't mind it. I must say, though, as a 51-year-old adult male who works in the DVD industry, writes film reviews for local publications and watches over a 100 films a year on the big screen (plus another 400 or so on DVD), I am hardly the target demographic, so, depending on age, tastes and how seriously they take cinema-going, others might well enjoy it more than me. Those young viewers who are looking for lightweight escapism with a pretty, contemporary star in the male lead will probably forgive the film its lack of genuine dramatic tension, and a compelling narrative structure.Like I say, I really expected more from this film, but I guess so many of today's films are tailored to a teen aged democratic who lack the ability to concentrate for long periods of time, want fast editing and are not interested in seeing characters breathe or develop in interesting, realistic ways.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is watchable and the scenery and environment (circus) was good but little else.The problem with the movie is Christopher Waltz (whatever his name is) character. His was mean, nice, mean, mean, and mean in the movie. It didn't make sense when he was nice for 15 minutes or so in the movie and was inconsistent with his character.Also this movie advertises a big circus tragedy. Since it has to be of epic proportions and couldn't simply be a death or two at a circus, it obviously had to be a circus fire, yet this movie didn't have it at all. Instead the main bad guy's character dies at the end and some animals escape.Lastly, it made no sense that the elephant killed Waltz' character at the end. There is no way it could distinguish good from bad like that and I doubt it was waiting for its revenge that long to take it out on him. The only possibility is that the elephant could smell or detect death somehow (Witherspoon's character about to die) and therefore it went ballistic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the best I can tell, no one, director included, wanted to be in this picture. Not even the elephant.Robert Pattinson is, I would say, not wooden enough. He needs to go to Clint Eastwood's school of "don't just do something, stand there." Instead we get lame close-up reaction after lame close-up reaction after lame close-up reaction. The camera person must have been a Twilight fan, because every time something happens, we get a reaction from Pattinson, who cannot act his way out of a paper bag. Or, the director was so proud to have Pattinson attached that he spent the whole film on him - give the girls what they came for, right? Either way, I'm still sponging that sheepish, smirky twink-like face from my mind, and am open to suggestions. (I already tried the image of Ken Jeong's pi-pi in The Hangover.) Anyway, back to Edward Cullen, talk about quintessential pretty boy, told to "stand in front of the camera." He's like Elvis without the singing. Who is coaching this boy! There is LESS THAN ZERO chemistry between him and Reese, he can't use his hands, can't reach out and pet an animal or grab a tool - and he's playing a circus veterinarian for crying out loud! He doesn't seem to be of this world, maybe he is a vampire. There are actors who can take a situation and act it out for a half hour without a script, and it's all interesting and usable. Not Pattinson. I'm afraid he's too pretty and too hot a property right now to turn down, so he moves up, ahead of so many more capable actors.Now, I got the feeling the director drew the short straw and got stuck with the next "book to movie, ugh!" then eeked it out quickly so he could get back to the vampires and mutants. Having helmed two yawner sci-fi's and a bunch of Britney Spears vids, he brings a lot to the table. I'd say give him Snakes on Titanic, or Apocalypse Re-imagined Movie #664.Hal Holbrook, trying for that Oscar, cues tears whenever he's on screen. How about something deep for a change ol' boy. Show an emotion with those eyes, what's the second or third thing you felt after the tears? You've seen that picture a thousand times, that woman, that man. What are you thinking this time? Oh. Tears again. Okay, that works. Everything is surface level nowadays. Tears get the Oscar, and going full retard. For fear, make pee come down the leg. Everyone gets it. Tears. Pee. Retard. Oscar.The ending had me a little miffed. I thought in the book the circus manager asks "Old Jacob" to join, but the movie has "Old Jacob" begging for a job. Wouldn't it be better to follow the book and show a 'converted' youngin' respecting the potential value of gramps? Maybe a deeper storyline? No? Okay.Another missed opportunity is with August. Christoph Waltz is obviously a bad choice because he's a new star and desperately does not want to be typecast as a bad guy, which may be all he does well. So he plays a bad guy who arbitrarily morphs into sensitive guy once in a while to look more like a good guy with problems. Not the character I read in Sara Gruen's incredible novel. But, again, hot property attachments get butts in the seats! Reese is too old and not sexy. I like her other movies (of yore) but she should stick to rom-coms. No idea why she's playing this role, except she won a lottery to star opposite Pattinson and kiss his flat, pallid mouth.The cinematography and music were beautiful. I wanted the movie to keep going in sound and pictures, but talking faces kept thrusting into view, forcing dialogue and overacting scenes to, maybe, help this poor, slow novel along...Screen writing brings up a whole other question: How can you always tell a movie is based on a bestselling novel? Narration! Will screenwriters ever go deep enough into an adaptation to let go of narration, i.e., reading the book to the audience? Many good adaptations have it, but it ends up being what people make fun of most (Shawshank). Movies have too much dialogue already. Sure, the book is about a guy telling another guy a story, but is THAT the story? Why not tell the story, about circuses and elephants and love, with action? I digress.Depth! Depth! Please, Hollywood, give us depth!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent, but brought down my a weak central performance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Due to the preordained success of "Water For Elephants", which really should have been called "Whiskey for Elephants," 20th Century Fox has already released the title of its two sequels, "Food for Giraffes" and the cautionary prequel"Fish for Tacos".While were on the subject Robert Pattinson ruined what was otherwise a half decent movie by bringing absolutely nothing to the table. His game plan in every frame? A smirk or a constipated look; he alternates between the two throughout the film, and sometimes, when he decides to try really hard, combines them in the same shot. The Elephant carries more emotional weight in the movie than he does. In every seen the elephant was in I wanted to yell "Will someone please feed the poor thing and let her drink some water." On the other hand Pattinson's presences made me want to see the film recast with an actual actor in his roll. When you have such good actors in most every other roll, you have to look at Pattinson and wonder if that was the Directors first, second, or even third choice for that part, my guess is no. If Francis Lawrence can get a half decent scene out of Will Smith in front of CG vampires then the fact that he can't get Pattinson to do something besides look like he's about to mess himself in front of real people feels more like Pattinson's shortfall as an actor than Lawrence's as a director. This is not to say the movie isn't without other flaws, it's pretty emotionally weightless in its depiction of romance and sympathy for its main character; mainly by fault of Pattinson's inability to lead the cast. However some blame must also be placed on poor pacing at the beginning of the film. Lawrence doesn't linger on the big emotional scene that gets the movie going at all, it's mostly voice over and a brief shot of Pattinson's feet and then off to the train. Never mind that your parents just died, you don't look nearly as shattered or upset as you should. Lawrence uses way to much emotional short-hand in these early scenes and it undercuts the impact and weight of the material. The short lead- in to the past at the very beginning of the movie falls flat as well. Hal Holbrook's take on Old Jacob falls short because he also lacks convection and weight in his words. Both of the actors playing Jacob bring the movie down.I have heard rumors that Pattinson was sick while the movie was shooting, this doesn't surprise me; he was probably scarred silly to be in a film with actors who are way beyond his range. Most of the real human emotion in the movie comes from the viewer's own anger at watching the animal cruelty by Christoph Waltz's character more than from anything going on between Pattinson and Witherspoon. Witherspoon and Waltz put on a good show but Pattinson weighs them down; the main attraction makes the show feel like a scam, welcome to the circus.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awful Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my honest opinion, I didn't like the movie at all....It is totally against Animal abuse, and it was very unfair to all the animals that were used the the film. I don't care if it was computer generated or not, it was still awful!! I go to the movies to enjoy a movie, not to walk out of a movie....My boyfriend, Grandma and I watched the first 30-45 minutes of the movie, and We couldn't take I walked out of the movie....it was one of the worst movies, i've ever seen, I'd rather watch the Hangover or something better then this movie. We are telling friends and family not to go see it...this is against all all animal rights. It makes me think that the Cirus isn't a wonderful place or show to go see. I'm glad I hate the circus!!!! I will not allow my kids to go to the circus!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Depressing, disappointing, rated S for "savagery and sadism"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I looked forward to this movie after watching the HBO documentary of the making of Water for Elephants, and reading Roger Ebert's positive review- Ebert wrote it was "good, sound, family entertainment, a safe PG-13,but not a dumb one." I loved Christopher Waltz in "Inglorious Basterds" and Reese Witherspoon is a talented actress, so I was all in, and pulled my 12 and 14 year old sons away from their game consoles for an old-fashioned, well-acted period movie. It was promising for about the first 15 minutes, but it went downhill from "promising" to mediocre to horrifying and depressing. Yes, Christopher Waltz is an incredible actor, playing a cruel and sadistic man, but the savagery towards the elephant (and other animals) took my breath away. I actually considered leaving the movie half-way through, but I thought my family might be tolerating it better than I, and that the plot, some surprising and redemptive moment might make it all worth it. It was not to be. My family all agreed it was a depressing, dark film without the imagination, intrigue, or meaning to redeem the cruelty, th and ugliness we suffered through. Let's just say it was no "Schindler's List" or "Saving Private Ryan" in that movies can show the horrors of particular historical times in ways that leave us with deeper, wiser, and yes depressing understanding of our own times. This movie is too mediocre for that, and I do not recommend it for any reason.</fullReview>
