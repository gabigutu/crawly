		<shortDescription>I laughed my arse off</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Glancing over some of the other reviews of Me, Myself and Irene that crop up on this page, it seems loads of people absolutely hate this movie. If anything, the majority of negative comments appear to be coming from people quick to dismiss it as a dumb piece of un-PC gross out comedy, which is completely missing the point. This is a Farrelly Brothers film with Jim Carrey in the lead role, what were they expecting? Citizen Kane redux? I myself have a masters degree in Film Studies and while I like to sit around, stroking my beard (or failing that, somebody else's), watching Almodovar films and saying "fascinating" at regularly timed intervals, I also like to laugh. And Me, Myself and Irene is one of the most gut bustingly funny films I've watched in months.The story concentrates on a Rhode Island police officer named Charlie Bailey-Gates (Carrey), a downtrodden member of the community who everyone else in the town regularly takes advantage of and who hasn't been the same since his wife left him for a midget limo driver. One day though things get a bit too much and Charlie snaps, goes mad and ends up driving a car into the front window of the town barber shop and defecating on his neighbour's lawn. One trip to therapy later and it transpires that all his bottled up rage has manifested itself as a split personality called Hank and he has to keep taking pills to keep him sedated. Shortly after this happens, he meets a down on her luck woman called Irene (Renee Zellweger) who is in serious trouble with the law and events conspire to send the duo on a wild cross country journey to clear their names of murder.To say this lends itself to some painfully low brow humour would be an understatement and whether or not you will enjoy the movie rests largely on what your reaction to the phrase "Jim Carrey being hit with nun-chucks by an angry black midget" is. For those of you who prefer his more gentle approach in The Truman Show or Man on the Moon then this is not the film for you. If however, you howled with laughter watching Dumb &amp; Dumber as I did, then this should be right up your street. Carrey, fresh off playing more restrained roles in the previously mentioned films looks to be having a total riot letting himself loose and his rubbery faced contortions are hilarious. Watching him wrestling with a cow, beating himself up and getting drop kicked down a hill is an absolute blast, the man is king of physical comedy. Throw in some very, very funny scenarios involving rubber dildos, albino waiters who may secretly be serial murderers and tarantulas and you have a highly entertaining turn.Its not all about Carrey though and some of the best moments come from his three sons. Charlie it seems was too happy to be married to be concerned when his wife gave birth to three black triplets and ended up raising the boys as his own, so when the storyline properly kicks off he has a trio of bickering homeboys for kids who all happen to be geniuses. The dialogue between the three provides some of the highlights of the film, especially during the scene where the boys steal a police helicopter. It also leads to the immortal line "no bitches after eleven." So before you all start complaining about this being crude, offensive, low brow trash and how we should all be watching Aguirre: Wrath of God or The Seventh Seal to really get the best out of cinema, consider this: not all movies have to be po-faced musings on the fates of man. Sometimes, all you really want is crude, offensive, low brow trash and this one was so hilarious, I had to stop the DVD three times because I was laughing so much I kept missing half the jokes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly hilarious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back when I first saw the commercials for this movie, I thought it looked pretty stupid. One day, I was at the video rental place and I decided to rent this because I like most of the Farrely brothers movies, and I also think Jim Carrey is hilarious. What I got was a big surprise, a hilarious movie that looks dumb on the surface, but really makes you laugh out loud.In the movie, Jim Carrey plays a man with a split personality named Hank. Hank is violent, but has some funny ideas and does some really weird things. I don't want to spoil anything, because the comedy of this movie should never be spoiled for anyone.There are some good actors in this movie that help keep the movie from becoming stupid. The advertisements did the film no justice, but you should see this anyway because it is exceptionally funny.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I find it strange so many people disliked this movie. Just because a critic dislikes a movie, doesn't mean you have to dislike it too! I'm not suggesting it was the greatest comedy of all time, but it certainly achieved its purpose. There were easily enough laughs throughout the movie to keep me entertained, and Jim Carrey was his usual talented self. Renee Zellweger played her part well, allowing Carrey to steal most of the thunder. I'm not Carrey's biggest fan when he's being interviewed, but his acting is always impressive and appropriate.I would definitely like to see Carrey pursue a few more dramatic roles.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Funniest movie I have seen in a long time, wish I had seen it much earlier. I thought I had grown tired of Jim Carrey movies. He seemed like the same character in just about every film. True enough, I can still see elements of the same kind of character in this film, but I think the story is a good one. Renee Zellwegger is lovely and sexy. There were so many funny moments in this movie, from when Jim Carrey nurses on the lovely young mother to the very end when the three boys leave us with "Thank you for watching our **** movie!" I actually got all of my friends to watch this movie with me because I was so excited about it and it's already almost 7 years old. Who knew? I guess that just goes to show that you can't judge an actor or a movie until you've seen it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jim Carrey and the Farrely doing what they do best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is probably no other movie coming out this summer that will produce more from the gut laughs than Me, Myself &amp; Irene. Sure it's crude, sure it's vulgar and juvenile at times, but sometimes we just have to take ourselves back to when we were younger and used to laugh at things that we would otherwise find rather disgusting. The main treat is to watch Carrey transform from the sweet natured Charlie to the vulgar, Dirty Harry sounding Hank. Hank does things that not many people would even dream of, and it's a kick to see him get away with some of them. Equally funny are Charlie's three sons, who are highly intelligent, love their dad and use a certain phrase to great effect. Some may find this movie offensive and occasionally funny at times, but I found it enjoyable from beginning to end. A good way to blow off steam from a bad day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Me, Myself and Irene' is one of the few comedies that have a strong repeat value as it always made me laugh every time I rewatched it. Sure it has its share of crude humour. After all, it is a Farelly Brothers movie but none of it bothered me (as was the case with 'There's Something About Mary'. I just love the whole wackiness of it, the adventurous feel, the landscapes, the comic timing, the story, the lively soundtrack...all of it combined brings a freshness. Jim Carrey is in his hilarious comic form. He and Zellweger form a great pair (of course it's also known that they were dating during the film production) and have a brilliant chemistry. Zellweger is cute and vivacious. It was quite fun to watch Chris Cooper play the villain. the rest of the cast (which is a lot) contribute well. 'Me, Myself and Irene' is one of my favorite comedies, simply because it hasn't lost its repeat value and gets me laughing out loud.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is not only the funniest film of the year (so far), but one of the best of the year (so far). Jim Carrey's comedy antics (not seen this good in 3 years) makes a come back thanks to the Farrelly brothers (Dumb and Dumber, There's Something About Mary) who make their 2nd collaboration. Here, Carrey plays a gentle police officer who gets screwed in life so many times, he grows a new personality that is incredibly bad. Carrey plays 2 characters here- 1 (Charlie Baileygates) is a little funny, but the second (Hank) brings out one of Carrey's best performances yet. Renee Zelwegger is a good co-star for Carrey (coincidentally, Carrey dated Zelwegger off set just like how he dated Lauren Holly off set of Dumb and Dumber). The best scenes include the hilarious sex scenes, and Carrey's kids, who are straight A black guys who curse in every other sentence and yell German at each other. Split personality is at it's best here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great directing, great story line, great acting. Jim Carrey is brilliant in his role as both "Hank" and "Charlie." The problem with rating any comedy is that what's funny for one person is repulsive, boring or stupid to the next. You can't please everyone---but this one definitely comes close (hence, the above average overall rating at IMDB). Don't miss this one!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>hilarious, a laugh riot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, Jim Carrey fans, this is Jim doing some of his very best work. I don't think anyone else could have pulled off playing Charlie Baileygates. I was disappointed in Renee Zellweger's performance, but I'm not really a big fan of hers. (And, for the record, I'm also not too fond of Carrey's over-the-top style, but I pick and choose to make sure I see him in roles I would like.) The Farrelly brothers, known for their irreverent comedy, made this movie enjoyable and hilarious. I don't want to spoil the movie for anyone. Just expect twists and turns that leave you laughing. This movie is not for the faint-hearted, and it's not for kids. (If you've never seen a Farrelly movie, you'll need to know this!) This is not laden with "Oscar-quality" performances at all, but just something to watch when you want to laugh and not think. -- Movies like this are good, if that is what you're looking for. The plot was great, and the casting (overall) was incredible. I can't get over Charlie's family. You'll see! I find them the most fun of all. Watch it with good friends who love to laugh -- I think we can all find something like Charlie in all of us.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First let me say I really DID NOT LIKE "Something About Mary" and "Dumb &amp; Dumber", But I totally enjoyed this film. It has a heart, that the other two do not. Unlike "Something About Mary" the jokes are not based on people's physical pain or disabilities. Or in "Dumb and Dumber" where I just could not relate to or care about the ridiculous characters. Instead, MM&amp;I portrays a sweet, caring underdog that is being horribly taken advantage of by everyone and gives him a leg up in the world with the emergence of a split personality that takes revenge. This split personality is weird and a sicko but he kicks ass. He's an unlikely hero, but gotta love him for coming to the rescue. It's silly fun that showcases Carey's talents very well. Jim has got to be the all time best physical comedy performer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Me, Myself and Irene" doesn't deviate from the Farrellys' trademark scatological humor, but that works to a surprising degree here. It'd be unfair to say that Jim Carrey is the cog that makes this all work (seeing as there are so many other necessary pieces to this puzzle), but he's playing his physical comedy to the hilt, and it's some entertaining stuff. The guy even gets into a convincing brawl with himself. It's beautiful. But it's not just Carrey; Zellweger fits pretty well, his three sons steal every one of their scenes and it even has space enough for a persistent dildo. As a road movie, it's not nearly as focused as "Dumb and Dumber" (really tends to wander), but there's some genuinely funny material here.7/10 Oh, and the music that plays when Jim Carrey snaps is priceless!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charlie-Hank (BUKOWSKI)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Charlie" and "Hank", not a random coincidence that these are Charles Bukowski's names. Bukowski (portrayed in Shroeder's Barfly) was famously unstable, swinging from kind and lovable to mean and rowdy. Same extremes that Bailygates had in this movie. Charlie Bailygates/Bukowski loved women but often found them unapproachable. He was congenial and self-effacing easy to take advantage of.) The Hanks threatened people, loved slang and crude language, never backed down from a fight, and scared people. The Charlies got married, the Hanks got laid. I can't find this theory anywhere else online but I believe the Farrelly Bros. had this in mind. Also, most sources omit XTC's I'd Like To in their soundtrack.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ah, yes, Jim Carrey. The golden king of comedy next to Lee Evans of course. The movie is about a cop who is always nice to everybody. When everyone keeps disrespecting him he eventually loses it and gets his tasteful revenge. He is later revealed to be a schizophrenic who has a split-personality disorder so basically he thinks he's a bad-ass rebel with no rules every 6 hours and then he thinks his Charlie to the point where he alternates between them; he's in a state of confusion to who he really is. The movie isn't supposed to be taken seriously as it takes the mick out of itself and the sort of thing I like, something that cheers you up and you're viable to leave your brain at the door throughout this movie. While being funny it teaches us a few lessons and I'll see if you can spot those and no, it's not that Han Solo really shoot first.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jim Carrey's best comedy performance. Love it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My first sentence has to be, this movie is Jim Carrey at his absolute best. I am a big Carrey fan and love Dumb and Dumber, the Ace Ventura's, Liar Liar, The Mask and more but Me Myself &amp; Irene beats them all hands down. The films about Charlie/Hank who has a split personality and mood swings brought on by allowing people to take advantage of him time and time again. The film just makes me laugh so many times with the phrases Hank says and the faces he pulls. It seems to me that the film doesn't get old neither, even today I can watch it and still be crying at some scenes. There's no point in telling you what happens because that would just spoil the story but I will say that Jim Carrey is pushed to the edge by his wife, friends and work mates until he explodes with hilarious consequences. When he's in the transition from Charlie to Hank, it's sort of like when he puts the mask on in 'The Mask' but its better. The story doesn't slow down and your kept interested by Carrey and Zellweger's on screen chemistry which is why it just keeps moving along at a great pace. I honestly think it's one of the funniest films I've ever seen and it always seems to be the 1st film I think of when someone asks me to recommend a good comedy. Watch it it's worth the time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my opinion, ME, MYSELF &amp; IRENE is a pure gut-busting, in-your-face, laugh-out-loud comedy. Charlie/Hank (Jim Carrey) was a really funny guy in my opinion. He was especially funny when he was goofing off. I thought that Irene (Renée Zellweger) was a very beautiful woman. The two characters I couldn't stand were Dickie (Daniel Greene) and Lieutenant Gerke (Chris Cooper). This was because they were pure a*******! One thing that surprised me was that Chris Cooper from A TIME TO KILL was in this movie. In conclusion, I highly recommend this gut-busting, in-your-face, laugh-out-loud comedy to all you Jim Carrey or Renée Zellweger fans who have not seen it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From puerile to infantile</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning alarms start off for "Me, Myself &amp; Irene": can I get into the Farrelly brothers frame of mind and enjoy a movie I anticipate will be mostly low-brow but, hopefully, amusing? Well...I tried, sometimes succeeded, but mostly was left unimpressed.Jim Carey is Officer Charlie of the Rhode Island police. He's a lovely guy who never really deals with nasty truths like how his wife had an affair (his kids are black), or why she left him. This leads an evil split personality to develop called Hank and hilarity, of course, ensues as the two personalities switch to comedic effect.....But is it actually funny? It's the Farrelly brothers so expect the humour to be explicit and cruel. "There's Something About Mary" and "Kingpin" managed this. "Shallow Hal" did not and this movie falls short as well. The humour is meant to partially come from the contrast between Carey's two roles...but Hank isn't that funny as he is played, as one would fear, completely OTT by Carey. One would think the man couldn't do subtle but "The Truman Show" proved otherwise. The gags are mostly vulgar set-pieces and decidedly childish - the breast gag, the dildo gag, the cow...Smart it ain't. The funniest gag was his foul-mouthed children, a neat little take on swearing-black-kids in movies because, instead of cussin' each other out over drugs or "bitches", they cuss each other over molecular equations and one's inability to translate a german helicopter manual. I liked them. However the rest of the humour relies too much on gross-out gags that often feel just nasty, rather than amusing. Carey is grand for a Farrelly brothers vehicle, but his elasticized responses and animated motions tended to set my teeth on edge after a while."Me, Myself &amp; Irene" isn't that bad of a movie. It has some amusing moments, besides the kids, but no actual belly laughs. I guess I shouldn't expect "Fraiser"esque comedy from the two brothers, but I would like something I could enjoy or laugh at a bit more. 5.5/10.</fullReview>

Still, it is full of some terrific comic moments, including a short black midget, who beats Jim Carrey up with nunchuckas, and a cow that won't stay dead. 8.5 for the young, 4/10 for the old.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Overall: Honestly this is up there with some of Jim Carrey's better performances and a must but for me on Blu Ray. Some will not enjoy this movie due to it's humor and the fact that its main point of humor is Split Personality disorder which may offend some people. Nevertheless, I think this is a great movie and would highly recommend it.Good: Hilarious and entertaining from the offset and throughout. Each character is likable and unlikable when they need to be to help the plot progress and change the viewers feelings towards them. The acting is superb for all the characters as is the overall cinematography .Bad: The overall villain is not that interesting and quite weak to be honest. He didn't really have much, if any, purpose other than to score a pretty forgettable climax. The actual plot is never properly cleared up or actually explained but his is probably glossed over because who really watches a comedy movie for the though provoking and moving story. The music isn't the best and feels quite lazy at some points.Best Part: The fight scene between Jim Carrey and.... himself! 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gloriously unapologetic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Probably the most ridiculous outing the Farrelly brothers have ever taken us on, Me Myself &amp; Irene cares not a whiff who it offends, how many eyes are rolled or how badly the scales of humour are tipped, or rather yanked, in the direction of extremely bad taste. With the exception of Stuck On You where they played it safe, every dirty little flick in their career is a testament to the utmost raunch in film, the very definition of lowbrow humour and never not flat out totally hilarious. Obesity, dates gone wrong, Amish people, conjoined twins, bowling, physical disability, they've tackled every scatological venture you could dream up. This time it's mental illness, in a completely unapologetic depiction that will leave most people red faced, either from fuming or laughing their a&amp;@es off. Jim Carrey plays Charlie, a meek little puss who spends one day with his newlywed bride, before she's whisked away by a black midget played by Tony Cox, who gets all the black midget roles, that little bast$&amp;rd. Charlie has a knack for never standing up for himself, and letting anyone walk all over him. He's a Rhode Island State Trooper with no balls to back up his badge, and is pretty much the laughingstock of the town. All this bottles up and reaches a boiling point, resulting in a classic Carrey meltdown of rubbery expressions and spastic guttural incantations. Emerging from the mess is Hank, Charlie's abrasive, dysfunctional and borderline psychotic alter ego, a result of what the film imagines multiple personality disorder just must be like. Hank causes all hell, and the first time he shows up is the funniest bit in the film, an extended montage of hair raising antics that oddly seems to sum up the Farrely's career. Charlie/Hank then get caught up in some intrigue involving beautiful Renee Zellweger, back when she was still Renee Zelweger. The scattershot story is just a playground for Carrey though, and this is some of the edgiest R rated mayhem he's ever caused, guaranteed to arch the backs of some of the more, shall we say... *sensitive* folks we have to deal with running around these days. Charlie has three loudmouth black sons that were dumped in his lap, and they've now grown into profane geniuses who love their pops to bits, and it's here the film finds its only bit of heart amidst the crass vulgarity. The baddies are the classic slimy Farrely cretins, a dirty cop played by Chris Cooper, and an unsavory golf club owner (Daniel Greene). Robert Forster makes a welcome appearance as Charlie's Trooper boss, and keep a look out for Anthony Anderson, Cam 'Sea Bass' Neely, Richard Tyson, Lenny Clarke, and the always hilarious Richard Jenkins. Like I said, this is likely the lowest rung of the ladder in everyone's career, but it's a splendidly offensive, colorfully trashy piece of gross out bliss, and definitely the dirtiest of the Carrely team ups. Where else can you see Jim stare a five your old kid down and growl "What are you staring at, f$&amp;ker?"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jim Carrey's finest movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Me myself and Irene' is directed by the Farrely Brothers, who previously were behind films like the hilarious 'Kingpin', Dumb and dumber and the recent 'Hall Pass' They require no introduction and many people are aware of the tone of their films. They have the ability to provoke laughter by using sex themes, disabilities and crude behaviour. Many people could mistake them for the 'scary movie' directors. This film is no exception. This is Jim Carrey's second film with the director duo. And he has pushed the boundaries of uncanny studiedness to the furtherest limits. The plot revolves around cop who has to escort a hit and run witness, played by Renee Zellweger to New York as the authorities are after her. Her ex boyfriend gangster is also chasing her as he was who she witnessed behind the incident. The story is nothing special and unique, but this scenario gives the lead actors the opportunity to interact with each other to their fullest potential. Zellweger and Carrey share good screen space and their chemistry works wonders on the screen. I would rate this as one of the Farrelly brother's best movies. However I would state that this is not exactly intelligent comedy but more in the slapstick vain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very funny Farrelly bros</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jim Carrey at the top of his prime. Farrelly Bros again. In this one Carrey develops an entirely separate schizophrenic identity within him. Lots of good laughs, some very good. You'll find yourself at least entertained even if you don't like Carrey particularly because this film contains so many gags, it's got a lot in its repertoire. The film is constant comedic material, it just lever lets out. It's, just like Dumb and Dumber but not as great as Dumb and Dumber, a movie entirely created for the purpose of making people laugh. This is what you would call: a pure comedy. Yes there is a romantic element in the plot but it's only a part of the ride and helps contribute to the laughter. This film is full to burst with various wacky characters, scenes, jokes, just a bunch of different angles to hit the viewer with. It's certainly at least a very fun ride, and if you're looking for something purely entertaining that's silly, GO FOR IT. Oh and Zellweger looks SMOKING in this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just because I rock, doesn't mean I'm made of stone.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Charlie is a Rhode Island state trooper with a split personality. He is otherwise mild- mannered and non confrontational until somebody or something pushes him a little too far. That's when his maniacal alter-ego Hank takes over. Charlie is assigned on a routine mission to return alleged fugitive Irene back to upstate New York, but they wind up on the run from corrupt police officers. And their escape would be a lot simpler on everybody involved if Hank didn't keep stepping in at the most inopportune times....The kings of bad taste are back with another inane comedy, poking fun at ethnicity, disability, and mental health problems, all for the pleasure of you, the viewer.The Farelly Brothers have had one of the luckiest careers in Hollywood, because with a lot of hindsight, they only really made one decent film, Dumb And Dumber, and I believe it was only successful because Jim Carrey became the biggest comedy star in Hollywood at the time, and it didn't hurt that his face was plastered everywhere.So they try to recreate the pseudo magic of their initial movie and fail, miserably. And it's because they don't listen to the cardinal rule, less is more.So they lay on the smut, racism, misogyny, and innuendo as thick as they can, and instead of raising smiles, it raises eyebrows in the fact that this was a tent pole release in the summer of 2000.Carrey gurns and gurns as if his life depended on it, Zellweger looks bemused throughout, and the rest of the. Farrelly regulars do the same thing that they do in every one of their movies, do random things because it seems to be funny.It's a shame that people with real life disabilities, whom appear in these 'films', whether they suffer from spina-bifida, or albinism, don't realise that they appear in these movies to be mocked by the moronic fans of this sort of unfunny trash.There are good comedies out there, but they are few and far between. It's about time we turned our backs on so called comedies trying to push the taste boundaries to give us all a laugh.This didn't. It offended me, and no doubt, several others.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jim Carrey As Two-Face.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Me, Myself and Irene (2000): Dir: Bobby Farrelly, Peter Farrelly / Cast: Jim Carrey, Renee Zellweger, Chris Cooper, Anthony Anderson, Robert Forster: Twisted and vulgar comedy featuring a scene where a chicken is seen penetrating someone's anal track. Gimmick title regards two personalities of one factor and the obvious presence of another. Jim Carrey plays a Rhode Island state trooper who gets married but loses her to a black midget limousine driver. He fathers the three black children but viewed as a joke when his neighbour's dog craps on his lawn. When he snaps his aggression forms Hank who retaliates by driving an illegally parked truck through a window, and craps on his neighbour's lawn. Central plot regards his transporting Renee Zellweger across state and the bad guys that pursue them. Great background story gives way to typical road movie and bathroom humour. Directors Bobby and Peter Farrelly address split personalities but this isn't a masterpiece like their Kingpin or There's Something About Mary. Carrey is hilarious but subdued in road movie clichés before his heroic climax. Zellweger is a prop with the personality of a rock. Chris Cooper is wasted as a villain. Robert Forster came off an Oscar nomination for Jackie Brown and is greatly underused here. The black children display some growth and intellect. Vulgar yet amusing take on today's headaches. Score: 7 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Jim Carrey's Best, Not Jim Carrey's Worst</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have very mixed reactions to Jim Carrey's work. Sometimes I think he's quite good, other times both his performances and his movie leave something to be desired. On the other hand, I adore Renee Zellweger. She can make even a bad movie worth watching - for me, anyway. So, Zellweger was in this. It was worth watching.It was a decent movie and sometimes quite funny. Carrey's character Charlie is an officer with the Rhode Island State Police - "the best law enforcement agency in the country" as we're told many times. But after a marriage breakup, Charlie's life begins to fall apart. He's left with his three black sons (his wife had an affair and then dumped both Charlie and the kids) and just tries to get through life. Then he meets Irene (Zellweger) - a fugitive from justice who Charlie has to return to New York State. You see where this is going - and then comes the twist, as Charlie suddenly develops a split personality, as the arrogant Hank makes his appearance. Irene and Charlie (and Hank of course) end up on the run from corrupt cops.It's a fun movie. It's no comedic masterpiece, and it's a little too long for this type of movie (almost 2 hours), but it's quite watchable. It's also very crude at times. Charlie's three sons have an obviously favourite word (let's say it starts with "mother" and includes two more syllables and it occurs over and over and over.) Basically, it's neither Carrey's best movie, nor is it his worst. (6/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This IS a funny movie. If a movie can make me laugh out loud, cringe at the character's embarrassment and still maintain my interest from start to end, then IMO, it has achieved its purpose as a comedy. Every time I have seen this film, it never fails to make me laugh. It's not supposed to be the most clever comedy nor does it try to be. The humour is crude and at times nasty, but the outrageous style in which it is executed makes it funny and I'm a fan. Although I'm not the biggest Jim Carey fan, I can still appreciate that he is talented and rather unique in his style and I can't imagine anyone else doing a better job in the lead role.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know... as hot as the Farrelly brothers started with Dumb and Dumber and There's Something About Mary, I don't think this movie was nearly on par with those. I know I may be in the minority here, but Me, Myself and Irene didn't strike a chord with me quite like the two movies prior to that. Jim Carey was on top of his game at that time but maybe on the down slide. Bruce Almighty was the only real hit he did after Me, Myself and Irene. Could it be that MM&amp;I started the downward slide? Or was it him taking a role of God that started it?Back to MM&amp;I. The jokes just fell flat and I've never been a fan of Renee Zellweger. There were some funny scenes but nothing memorable. Hey, it could have just been me. I think that the late 90's-early 2000's was a transformation of tastes for me. At any rate, I wasn't impressed with MM&amp;I.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Average run-of-the-mill comedy...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you watch "Me, Myself and Irene" without any expectations, then the movie delivers well enough, because this is certainly no milestone in American movie history. That being said, then this is a fairly average Jim Carrey movie, that have several similarities to "The Mask" in ways.The movie itself is entertaining for what it is worth. The storyline is good, consistent and has a good flow to it. And it is the type of movie that requires no brain activity from the audience - so just sit back, switch to autopilot and be mildly amused for about an hour and a half.Jim Carrey and Renée Zellweger do have good on screen chemistry and they make the movie work.The characters in the movie were unique and well portrayed on the screen, most of them being eccentric and quite out there. Which worked out nicely, because their oddities and eccentricities were a main driving force to the movie.The jokes in the movie are straight and to the point, and the comedy is often bizarre and semi dark humor. It is a movie that will have you smiling and put you in a good mood, but hardly the type of comedy to have you in tears from laughing so hard."Me, Myself and Irene" is a movie that you will thoroughly enjoy if you also enjoyed "Dumb and Dumber".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like comedies like this. It's full of laughs and dirty humour that can guarantee to make you laugh. "Me Myself and Irene" is a unique, funny comedy with laugh-a-minute gags, goofs and toilet-humour. Jim Carrey plays Charlie Baileygates - a Rhode Island State Police trooper, whose always been taken advantage of by people throughout the most of his life; unfortunately so. Charlie has a split personality called Hank Evans and this has been caused by "Advanced delusionary Schizophrenia with involuntary narcissistic rage", apparently. Unlike Charlie, the personality of Hank is somewhat rude and crude, and violent. The co-star is Renée Zellweger. Renee plays Irene Waters- a woman who committed hit and run, and has to be taken back to Rhode Island by Charlie. The film has some pretty hilarious scenes, all-round golden comedy and some heart-warming scenes that never get old. A rather brilliant comedy! 9.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Split personalities, not all that funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Carrey has reunited with the Farrely brothers in a film, with a more misfire of laughs than successful ones, though still it's adequately funny, the setting of story, that being in Rhode Island, is interesting. Carrey plays a Rhode Island state trooper who has been the butt of a lot of people, that walk all over him. A yes man. Finally cracking up in a supermarket, while waiting at a counter, he creates a new, "take no s..t" character Hank, the absolute opposite of his character, Charlie Bailey. In split personality, this is what can happen, a person is so revolted by his own self, he replaces it with someone totally different. Renee Zewellger, as an EPA employee, who we kind of get the feeling, she would rather be somewhere else, plays an ex girlfriend of a guy involved in corrupt dealings with the company, where she's caught and transported by Carrey on police motorcycle to a safer place, pursued by the bad guys, that involve other corrupt agents etc. The movie does play well as an adventure though, and Carrey's three black blasphemous sons (there's a story there) are a hoot, probably the funniest thing in the movie. Too, near the end in a fight to the death between Carrey and Zewellger's ex, we have an ugly bit of violence, unwarranted, only if in another attempt to humour, when Carrey's thumb is blown off. The theme song was another good thing about this average humorous movie that still plays in my head and takes me to 2001. Farrely fans should still see this, with laughs, far and few between. Carrey does make a goose of himself and overacts in this though, where the every changing back of personalities in scenes, is something you just don't buy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Charlie (Jim Carrey) is a meek Rhode Island state trooper. His wife cheats on him and he refuses to acknowledge it. Even when she leaves with her lover, Charlie still raise the kids as if they're his own. One day he just snaps, and a new alter ego named Hank emerges. Charlie is assigned to escort fugitive Irene (Renée Zellweger), but all kinds of chaos follow Charlie and his alter ego Hank.The Farrelly brothers are trying to merge multiple personality with their usual gross out humor. The multiple personality bit isn't that funny by itself. When Hank goes off at first, it was mostly stupid, inappropriate, but importantly unfunny. Jim Carrey does get a few workable jokes in when he's with Renée Zellweger. She's great reacting to Carrey's insanity.I'm tempted to say that it would better if Jim Carrey would just be Hank. If Irene was forced to rely on Hank, I think there's a funny movie in that. The multiple personality is really just forcing the stupidity onto the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unnecessarily crude, but funny and entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Released in 2000, "Me, Myself &amp; Irene" is a Jim Carrey comedy about a Rhode Island motorcycle cop (Carrey) who has a mental breakdown after allowing people to walk all over him for three decades. He develops a split personality consisting of Charlie, the nice guy, and Hank, the take-no-crap dude. After going on meds, he's given the assignment of escorting Irene (Renee Zellwegger) from Rhode Island to upstate New York. The two become fugitives as Charlie/Hank falls for Irene. Meanwhile Charlie's three black sons get involved in finding him.The film works because Carrey gives the schizophrenic role all his heart and the Farrelly brothers (the directors/writers) go to extremes with the gags, as usual. There's quite a bit of crudeness and cussing, but I was able to overlook it and laugh. Most of the cussing comes from Charlie's three black sons who are veritable geniuses, but maintain their homey lingo. It's not meant to be offensive, but funny; you either get it or you don't.The film also works because we can all relate to the struggle within between wanting to get along with people and not wanting to be taken advantage of. It's somehow enjoyable to see Charlie morph into Hank with his take-no-sheet attitude. I also like the way the film ties up the schizophrenia issue. The answer is to maintain a balance between being overly nicey-wicey and overly forthright &amp; intolerable. The "middle road" is the key.This was the first film I saw Renee in and she really shines here -- petite, sassy, smart and beautiful. I also like the funny three black sons and the addition of the dubious albino dude.FINAL WORD: "Me, Myself and Irene" loses points for being unnecessarily crude, but -- if you can overlook that or laugh with it -- it is entertaining and funny. It places well with Carrey's funniest movies, although the first Ace Ventura film, "The Mask" and "Liar, Liar" are better.The film runs 116 minutes and was shot in Rhode Island and Vermont.GRADE: B+</fullReview>

There is no consistency whatsoever and you quickly get bored watching this muddled, interminable and totally uninteresting script, from where a particularly strange atmosphere comes out.The gags aren't that funny overall, of course a few ones are rather good and may crack you a smile, but they are too sporadic and lost in this almost 2 hour feature.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Six years after Dumb and Dumber, Jim Carrey reunited with Peter Farrelly and Bobby Farrelly for this anarchic comedy with a hint of romance.Me, Myself &amp; Irene is a comedy starring Jim Carrey and Renée Zellweger. Chris Cooper, Robert Forster, Richard Jenkins, Daniel Greene, Anthony Anderson, Jerod Mixon, and Mongo Brownlee co-star to play key supporting roles. It is about a Rhode Island state trooper named Charlie who, after years of continuously suppressing his rage and feelings, suffers a psychotic breakdown which results in a second personality, Hank.Charlie is a good-natured Rhode Island state trooper who likes helping people. But years of internalizing his frustrations about his work and his family have caused Charlie to develop an alter ego: Hank, an abusive, violent, sexually compulsive police officer. Charlie can keep Hank at bay with medication, but just barely. When Irene finds herself in legal trouble through a series of misunderstandings involving her ex- boyfriend, Charlie must escort her on a long drive to New York for questioning. After Charlie loses his medication, he and Hank wind up vying for her affections: Charlie wants Irene to marry him, while Hank has more brutal intentions.Me, Myself &amp; Irene will satisfy Jim Carrey fans eager for a return to the contortionist slapstick that made him a star.It does deliver enough laughs to merit a recommendation although the Farrellys' usual attention to disability that will surely be misread as insensitivity to disability.But the big shock here is how flagrantly unoriginal the movie is.That is why a viewer may not totally enjoy it as a whole.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Peter and Bobby Farrelly have been directing films ever since the 90's. I have enjoyed all of their films. Some more than others. They have done some classics, such as Dumb and dumber and There's something about Mary. Me, myself, and Irene is a nasty movie, like There's something about Mary, but it's a funny one. Like almost all of their films.Charlie(played by Jim Carrey) is a Rhode island state trouper who is a pushover. His wife left him for a black midget and gave birth to three black kids. And left him with them. People in Rhode island don't respect him. Not even the police force. So one day, a switch goes off in his mind that gives him a second personality:Hank. Hank is not a pushover.Hank is a foul mouthed, bad tempered pervert. Charlie, and Hank, are offered to escort Irene(Renee Zellweger) to New York. Irene has had some trouble with some criminals. So Irene and Hank and Charlie go on a road trip. Irene and Charlie have to deal with the insanity of Hank, while getting hurt in the process.There are some really gross out gags here. Like when Hank sucks on a woman's breast and has a milk mustache. But yet there are some very funny and crude lines that come out of Carrey's mouth, such as"That's okay my little pussy fart".I am a lifelong fan of Jim Carrey. So it won't surprise you that I am reccomending it. No it's not as good as the first time the Farrelly brothers worked with Jim Carrey, but I still thought this was a good movie. Though the plot is a bit ridiculous and some of the jokes are very nasty. See it still though.B</fullReview>

Certainly not the Farrelly brothers or Jim Carreys finest work,but Me,Myself and Irene is still a very enjoyable movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good comedy. A friendly cop with a split personality must protect a woman who is on the run from her ex- boyfriend while also finding out how to control the other part of him.

		<fullReview>I won't tell you this is the funniest comedy I've ever seen because it's not. It's not unfunny, either, though. Jim Carrey portrays a "schizophrenic" Charlie / Hank who develops two personalities as a result of his ruined marriage.While, this comedy is funny at nearly every turn, it's actually inaccurate about what condition, it's trying to play off. Charlie/Hank suffer from Disassociative Identity Disorder. Schizophrenia has nothing to do with multiple personalities, for that matter.It's really sweet and romantic at times with Renée Zellweger and the chemistry with Carrey is just simple great. Peter and Bobby really know how to write their comedies but more than anything, know how to develop and write their characters.Dumb &amp; Dumber, There's Something About Mary, Shallow Hal all fall into a minority of comedies that can actually achieve loud laughter from their audiences. Me, Myself and Irene is a part of that minority. Carrey's extremities and insane antics as the "lovable" Hank Evans, it something to be hold.It's a riot to watch Hank flip out or the little things and go to town on each and every character in such an extreme way. Charlie seems to pop back up in the mix when it continues to get worse. Charlie seems to take the lumps and bruises that Hank tacks on.Supporting cast really puts on a great showing as well and without the three sons of Charlie, I'm not sure this movie would be as big a comedy. Carrey shines in the spotlight, but second to him is definitely the sons to his character.There's a lot of jokes that can really make you laugh and a condition like D.I.D. is not usually seen as funny, but this movie can make it happen. I'd definitely recommend this to any age appropriate person.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After hearing about Me, Myself and Irene by a friend, I decided to check into it. My first big surprise was that Jim Carrey starred in this film, which later turned out to be hilarious. When I saw Renee Zellweggers name in the cast, I was pretty disappointed considering her bad performances in nearly everything, but my sadness turned to happiness when I saw Anthony Anderson's was also cast with Jim Carrey and Renee Bubbleburger. What was even More and More surprising was that the Farrelly brothers were directing this. I knew from that point on that this film was going to awesome because the duo have created lots of funny movies, such as Dumb and Dumber, Osmosis Jones, and The Heartbreak Kid, which were amazing. My local library, luckily, kept a copy of Me, Myself and Irene so I quickly picked it off the shelf and into my library bag. As soon as I got home, I snatched the disk out of the case and inserted it into my DVD player. My hopes for this movie were so high and If it turned out disappointing, I would've chainsawed my body in half: Me, Myself and a Chainsaw. The film starts out like any other typical comedy film. Jim Carrey is Charlie Baileygates, a man who has everything: A wife, a future, and a....Job. But that all changes when the "midget" comes. Tony Cox is pretty funny in his cameo role as the Limo Driver. Even though his part maybe short but his laughs are big and humorous. Charlies wife leaves him for the attractive midget, leaving a big hole in Charlies life. He also has to raise some black kids who are actually the midget's sons. Not knowing that they are not his kids an adventure starts that puts Charlie, Charlie II, and Irene in a lot of trouble. Jim Carrey really hasn't changed from what he does best, and that is making people laugh, but sometimes he goes too over-the-top with his acting. His made up expressions are still a blast but they do make his acting way over-the-top. Renee Zellweger did not appeal to me as hard-to-get Irene who will eventually sleep with Charlie II. Her part is so clichéd. Anthony Anderson is more lovable than ever with his role as the fat-smart kid who usually makes the greatest jokes. Him and his brothers were too cool for this movie. There are MANY parts in which you will find yourself laughing out loud especially the scenes in which there is Charlie II.It had all started when a patrol officer named Charlie Baileygates was married. Unfortunately, his wife left him for the short black guy who was their limousine driver. Charlie is single again and taking care of 3 children. A series of misfortunes for Charlie developed an inner anger within him, then it came out, in a form of another personality known as Hank Evans. While Charlie is nice, kind, and usually calm, Hank is is the polar opposite of Charlie, being outrageous, mean, and short-tempered. Luckily, Charlie told his doctor about this other personality, and prescribed him with medication to suppress Hank. One day, Charlie was assigned to personally escort a woman named Irene Waters to a prison in upstate New York. Then, a series of unfortunate events happen as both Charlie and Irene run into a group of corrupt cops and Irene's abusive ex-boyfriend, in the middle of it all Charlie loses his medication and now fears that Hank will come out and makes the situation worse. While running, Charlie and Irene fall for each other (and so does Hank). Now, Both Charlie and Irene must stop the dirty cops, Irenes ex-boyfriend, and to stay one step ahead of Hank.If I had to choose my three favorite scenes out of the entire film, it would have to be: The part where he wakes up from a rough night, only to discover that he had slept with Irene and a dildo in his pants. It gets really funny when he finds out that he (by himself) forced it up there. Minutes later you see him in the toilet splashing water on his azz. My other favorite scene was when Charlie II was battling the cow on the street and how he had to shoot it in the head four times and twist its head. He thinks it is dead but at the end of the film you find out that cow was still alive. Funny sh*t! Jamaal and his two brothers came up with fresh new laughs that never get old. Jamaal is the most funniest one in the whole film after Jim Carrey. There are some flaws in this film and they are: the acting from Renee, which I cannot stress far enough, was a piece of broken old turd. She lost a star from me and I really hated the parts where the film would slow down. The story behind this is nothing new but it will not disappoint you. Period. The film will leave a smile on your face after it finishes and you can't wait for a sequel. Final Thoughts. If you like Jim Carrey as an actor then this film will appeal to you. The lame story and acting from Renee Zellweger was also very tedious. 7/10 - So good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very funny...But, there will be those who find it too crude.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie really is so much better because of Jim Carey. He's certainly not the sole reason that it is so hilarious, I don't think it's possible to remember all the scenes that doubled me over with laughter but it's hard to imagine it being so "over-the-top" funny without him. It is just about the perfect comedic vehicle for the multi-talented rubber faced actor.This movie skewers so many things about all of us that you need to watch it twice, or more, to get all the jokes and references as they come fast and continuously. The Farrelly Brothers know how write because it could be sophomoric crude without so many elements coming together. As usual, their selection of music is impeccable too.This is a very funny movie that begs to be watched with friends so be sure and put this on the "gang's shortlist" and enjoy. If crude humor makes you uncomfortable this movie is a must to avoid, but, if, however, you have no hangups regarding the sophistication, or lack thereof, of your comedy then there are not many better comedies you could "waste" two hours on. Recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Me, Myself and this movie: how this movie made me laugh.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Me,Myself and Irene is another funny Farrely Brothers movie made purely for 2 hours of comedy. The movie is about a simple American cop(Jim Carrey) who after being dumped by his wife holds his anger and pain so long he develops SPD(Split Personality Disorder) and after getting told to take a Pretty blond girl(Renae Zellwegar)away gets caught in the web of assassins and lies that she was right in the middle of. The movie has many laughs that may be in bad taste but in the good way. The characters are very well portrayed by Jim Carey as the guy who pays the price for holding his anger, Renae Zellwegar as the girl and even Jim Carrey Characters kids play their parts magnificently. Overall the movie is made just to laugh and you should never go into a Farrely Brothers expecting to see an Oscar standard film or expect to see much Policticaly Correct stuff in them. I rate it 73%.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Upon further review, this movie is actually pretty funny!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't describe it but when I first saw this movie I thought it was horrible and something Jim Carrey never should have touched. Having seen it again recently I noticed it's actually really funny. Initial impressions can sometimes be a foggy cloud, especially when it comes to a comedy. For those that didn't enjoy this movie watch it again and you'll be surprised how funny it actually is. Same thing applies with Jim Carrey's other "flop" known as "Cable Guy". Must be why he's doing dramas and thrillers now, even when he made a decent comedy he got no love. I'm guilty too Jim, we apologize buddy. Please come back when you've forgiven us. In the meantime, it looks like your rocking out some dramatic stuff pretty well so more power to you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some people say "it's the worst movie I've ever seen" and I think "how lucky they are!!"... I find this movie as being a complete riot of gags and funny situations, with many pervert lines and lack respect for puritan viewers. I like that. It has sexual content, it jokes with hilness, it has bad-taste jokes!!! Great! I like it because of that: makes it different. Jim Carey has again some great moments, mainly the way he changes it's facial expressions when he turns into Hank. Those moments are the greatest parts of the movie and by no means he's doing a worse job than usual.See it with open mind, and take it easy on the more shocking moments. They're just fooling around.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jim Carrey Was Great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Have not watched very many films of Jim Carrey and this particular film had me laughing through out the entire film. Jim played the role as a Rhode Island State Policeman who lives in a very modest home, a box, and just got married to his bride and carried her over the threshold and things started to happen which I would never have dreamed could happen. It seems that after their first, second and third son was born that the marriage went down hill for some odd reason. Renee Zellweger,(Irene Waters) meets up with Officer Bailey Gates/Hank Evans) played by Jim Carrey who has a split personality and is constantly fighting with himself and Hank Evans. The rest of this film is filled with a great comedy situations in motel rooms and cars being pushed into gravel pits and unbelievable train rides and some way out comedy skits. Enjoy</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rude and a bit crude, but enjoyable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is replete with stereotypical clichés one after the other, but it was still fun to watch...when you're not uncomfortable, or feeling sorry for Charlie (Jim Carrey), that is.The problem with this one is that Charlie is so pathetic, that you really find it difficult to view him as a hero in this situation. He's a victim, of that, there is no doubt. But a hero? No, I just couldn't get there.It has some laughs, though they are tepid, and the slapstick is classic Carrey, but the material is too sad to let the laughs permeate and you're left feeling conflicted about what enjoyment you DID manage.I liked it and I like Carrey, but this will not make it to my collection.It's a tepid 5.4/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Carrey Gold</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have this flick in my DVD stash, and finally watched it for the first time in a while, the other night when I was really sick. Carrey fans will get an absolute kick out of this--the scene where he fights himself is physical-comedy gold. In fact, you could call this entire movie "Carrey gold." A lot of the critics say the gross-out humor in the movie feels forced, but I actually thought it made it more exciting and enjoyable. Sure, most of it had nothing to do with the plot, but if you're going to make an R-rated comedy, I don't have any problem with gratuitous raunchy material being shoe-horned in there for no good reason. Make it raunchy! You won't get any complaints from me! On the down-side, this movie's way too long, and focused too much on its "plot," which I neither followed nor gave a crap about. Screw the "plot," and the running-around BS. That stuff just made the movie drag.Overall though, it's not too shabby. Just don't watch the TV-edited version, whatever you do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nastier than Dumb and Dumber but not quite as funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's face it: Dumb and Dumber was a flawless comedy, I've never seen any other movie in my life that made me laugh as loud as it, but "Me Myself &amp; Irene" sure as hell comes close. I used to live in a quaint little mountain town in America--and as I was sitting in the crowded movie theater laughing my ass off with my sister and her friend it dawned on me that the rest of the audience was not laughing. How could they not laugh at this? Was it too disgusting to them? Shouldn't they have been accustomed to the Farrelly's warped sense of humor by now, since "There's Something About Mary?"Jim Carrey plays Rhode Island state trooper, Charlie. He finds out that his wife is blatantly cheating on him with a cocky little limo-driver--actually, he's not a limo driver but that's a story on it's own. The little man also happens to be black so Charlie is stuck fathering three African-American children. And even though there not his kids, it doesn't matter, it almost seems as if he's in denial over him not being their biological father.Charlie (understandably) as a lot of rage suppressed and this is when Hank comes out. He's a very hateful character; he's sort of like Clint Eastwood.Anyways, fans of Carrey &amp; or the Farrellys will not be disappointed with this one, unless they have a sharp stick up their ass.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Perfect Movie for Carrey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the kind of movie Jim Carrey was born to play. Few movies can make the best of his comedic prowess. The Mask was one. A Series of Unfortnate Events was another. And then there's Me, Myself and Irene.Carrey plays Charlie Bailygates, a Long Island cop. Charlie's wife cheated on him for the duration of their whole marriage with their limo driver, finally leaving him with 3 (black) kids from her affair. The town is laughing behind Charlie's back, and he knows it. Sad to say, Charlie is a nice guy, and no one feels bad about exploiting the fact that the poor guy won't stand up for himself. As the narrator himself puts it: when you can't deal with your own problems, it's hard to deal with others.That's where Hank Evans comes in. Hank is rude, crude, and feels no shame about kicking the ass of anyone he doesn't like. Hank has a raging libido, a big mouth, and a serious mean streak. And as he himself puts it, unless Charlie learns to deal with his life on his own, Hank is going to have to move in for good.Carrey plays polar opposites in this movie, and it rocks. He can play such a variety of roles, this movie lets him play the nice guy and the mean guy. Good cop, bad cop: That's Charlie and Hank! This movie simply is hilarious, and a must see for any Jim Carrey fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very, very convincing performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People say Jim Carrey is an over-actor.Well, he pretty much overacted in Ace Ventura, but in this movie god, he is GOOD! He played both guys as if he were two people and I almost believed that there were two of Jim Carrey. Both are distinctively different (aside from the physique)! Renee Zellweger was also good, but she didn't give the Cold Mountain performance in this one. This is a light, hilarious comedy and I think that's why it wasn't nominated for any Oscars. But if the storyline is twisted to be a bit heavy and mind-twisting (as all Oscar-winning movies are), I think Carrey would definitely bag the gold statuette for his great acting. Did the critics hate this movie? Who likes those critics anyway?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too many Laylas in the world (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm surprised the honeymoon scene w/ Shonte &amp; Layla isn't given more noteriety than the Psycho shower scene &amp; the death of Bambi's mother put together. The best part of the comedy is the poetic justice being implemented-the Vagicile'baking a loaf &amp; I think it's sour dough" scene pulled on the bait &amp; switching shopper, dunking that girl because she disobeyed him out of defiance &amp; disrespect, Shonte's sons bonding w/ Charlie, even though they were Shonte's-but what would have been good to add was something happening to Layla to castigate her abominable treason for what it was. Rather than stand by her man who was turning the other cheek while unarmed &amp; in the right, she smeared him as the offender, while honoring the race-baiting Shonte as the victim even though he was in the wrong, lying, throwing punches &amp; using a weapon.The problem is that society is infected by too many Laylas who treat race baiters as the rightious ones-superior in their ability to detect "sin"(even if they have to make it up), &amp; the Charlies who hold their ground against them as the pompous pharisees. Many think it's unfortunate, but few castigate the Laylas for being wrong.I think this movie missed an opportunity to have a scene that could have scared Laylas from endorsing baiting like Jaws scared people from the water. The scenes go as follows: When Charlie's w/ Irene, Layla come crawling on her hands &amp; knees (remenicent from the movie Wolf) begging him to take her back because Shonte's beating the crap out of her. "Now let me get this straight." Charlie/Hank says, "You betrayed me for Shonte &amp; now Shonte's betrayed you. What's that to me? It's not my problem you thought someone who told lies about your husband that you believed was a more suitable soulmate than your husband himself, &amp; that now you want me back because it's not working out. OBTW, has Shonte freed Willie yet? You really look like you need some Whale Bludder!!" lol. Shonte drags Layla away while she's kicking &amp; screaming, "HELP ME!! DON"T LEAVE ME WITH HIM! HELP ME CHARLIE" "Layla, you're getting what you deserve!" Charlie/ Hank says. That should put the fear of God into Laylas everywhere &amp; tear the tendency out of their DNA</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Plotless in Rhode Island</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Farrelly brothers (and Jim Carrey as an occasional RI Dirty Harry) tackling issues of schizophrenia can lead only to excessive political incorrectness and juvenile humour. But who would watch this expecting anything different? There is precious little plot, what plot there is being little more than a peg on which to hang a few typically gross visual jokes. Renée Zellweger jogs along without expending too much effort, but then character development is hardly a strength of this film, despite its supposed subject matter. The real stars are the Baileygates triplets, though don't ask where they acquired their ghetto talk in tranquil Rhode Island.Several of the jokes work, several don't. Persist right to the end though, even after the credits have rolled, if only to find out the cow's fate. An enjoyable way to idle away a couple of hours, although a pair of scissors on some of the "plot" scenes might have been a useful addition as it runs about 20 minutes too long.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite Farrelly Brothers film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Me, Myself, &amp; Irene is my favorite Farrelly brothers movie to date. It's just SO damn funny at points, and it maintains an odd sort of sweetness. Both of Carrey's characters are hilarious in their own right, and this film is the best example yet of his comic talent. This is definitely Jim Carrey's movie, and like all Jim Carrey movies, it's about him acting fairly weird in a world that doesn't know what to make of him. Renee Zellwegger plays her character with plenty of attitude, and it's nice to see how she is so able to stand up to Hank, yet is really submissive with Charlie.The biggest scene-stealers in history have to be Jim Carrey's three sons, who happen to be black (it's explained at the beginning). All three are geniuses, brought up by a single, white father in a small town in Rhode Island, yet they speak like they've been living in a ghetto all their lives, sprouting profanities all around. They're really a sidelight to the movie, the only other part that's intentionally funny. The sweetness I'm talking about comes from Charlie, and the soundtrack. Boy, does the soundtrack rock. It's full of great music. It's what makes this film more than just a Jim Carrey vehicle, it really allows the viewer to get a look at the characters. It's hard to believe, but this film actually does have a message, which interrupts the comedy enough to make the movie into an actual story.But what the heck. It's funny. If you liked "Dumb and Dumber", you'll love this. For me, it had me rolling in the aisles, and actually watching when I wasn't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh grow up? Why on earth would I do a thing like that?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really like the fact that I can tell an idiot from their use of the word 'puerile' when describing a movie. This is especially valid if the movie in question is a Farelly Brothers movie. It's SUPPOSED to be crude and childish and lowbrow. That's the whole point. If I want Frasier humour, I'll watch Frasier (and I do). If I want a subtle romantic comedy, I'll watch Four Weddings. And if I want a movie that has irreverent grossout humour, I'll watch a Farelly brothers movie. Accusing one of their movies of being puerile is about as constructive as accusing a Hitchcock movie for being far too suspenseful. Are you truly so incapable of letting go of your highbrow sensibilities for 90 minutes that you could enjoy a comedy for what it is - a comedy? One can enjoy both Beethoven and Roll Over Beethoven, you know?As to the 'this movie insults people with mental illness'. Oh please, I dare you to tell just one joke that doesn't make fun of something. That's the whole point of humour. And the point of having a sense of humour is knowing when people are making the jokes to be funny, instead of making them to insult a person or a group of individuals. Anyone with half a brain can tell that this movie was not portraying mental illness in a serious or realistic manner. Mental illness like that does not exist outside comedy. IT'S A JOKE, meant to be funny. That's all. Why not go one step further and accuse this movie of insulting little people, and black people, and people who enjoy anal sex, and chickens, and New Englanders, and why not Canadians, as Jim Carrey, a Canadian, plays a an overly POLITE person. IT'S A JOKE.Grow up? If that means losing my ability to laugh at a cow who gets shot six times and still keeps mooing, then no thank you. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Carrey, Zellweger, &amp; Farrellys at their all-time best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. I don't think any of the Farrelly brothers' other movies come close, though some of Jim Carrey's might. The premise is brilliant, and used to its fullest potential. The comedy obviously required creativity and thought. A lot of jokes in movies these days are just recycled from similar ones used in films for decades; so much in Me, Myself, &amp; Irene is truly original. I mean, the whole thing with the midget chauffeur is brilliant. Short of having dreamt it I can't see how the Farrellys could even have come up with that. There's a lot to laugh hard at from beginning to end, as well as drama, adventure, and suspense. Jim Carrey and Renee Zellweger both turn in excellent performances. A real good film, genuinely good beyond the comedy, is Me, Myself, &amp; Irene.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Odd For Me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like odd movies, but this one is even too odd for me. Jim Carrey stars as Officer Charlie Baileygates who has a split personality. There he is also Hank Evens. Anyway, Charlie/Hank fall for Irene P. Waters, and what happens next is even more odd. What about the scene where Carrey beat himself up? That's fun because it reminds me of Liar, Liar where he beats himself up in the bathroom. But that's about the only great thing about this movie. Too much crude humor for me.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I had a love - hate relationship with this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found myself both loving and hating this film.First, the hate part. As a mental health worker, I object to the way in which this film spreads misinformation and stereotypes about mental illness. Young people with a mental illness may see this movie and feel demoralised, isolated and stigmatised. The marketing for this movie was so bad that the SANE stigma watch program managed to get the makers to withdraw some of the promotional materials, which were heartless and inaccurate. I don't think the extremes and stigmatisation were necessary to make the film work.Second, the love part. This movie, despite being politically incorrect, despite being crass, crude, rude and tasteless, despite being excessive in every way - made me laugh so hard that at times I was nearly bursting my sides and my eyes were running with tears.Unlike other reviewers, I found such scenes as the breast, the lawn crap, the cow, and (especially) the dildo hilarious. Tacky - yes. Awful - yes. Something not to show grandma - yes. But so funny and sick that I had to laugh or I would die.The movie (if watched while in the right mood) provides a real juvenile laugh that hasn't been felt for years. I found myself weeping with laughter and yet mentally chastising myself for doing so. Perhaps that's just me.I gave it 5 out of 10. The stigmatising attitudes cost it 5 marks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>could have been really good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well-crafted but consistently crude comedy is a waste of good talent considering the cast and crew involved. Carrey is a thoughtful, put-upon Rhode Island state trooper with a bad habit of suppressing his anger and failing to assert himself. He's eventually pushed to the limit, and unleashes a dark, mean-spirited troublemaker who causes havoc for all those around him. While battling his split personality, he also tries to help a woman in danger (Zellweger). Carrey is enthusiastic as usual, but his alternate persona is extremely unlikable and the script squanders a clever setup with excessive profanity and redundant toilet humor. Zellweger's heroine is repellent and unfunny. *?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lord have mercy!!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was somewhat entertaining for about 70% of the time. During that 70%, however, there were a few scenes which blew me outta my socks; One of those scenes is when Charlie first becomes Hank. The grocery store checkout aisle and the VagiClean price check, dunking the girl in the fountain, the breast, the milk mustache, "parking" the car through the barber shop window and the ticket for a headlight out....only the way Jim Carey could execute this scene! I nearly lost my breath from laughing so hard. I was coughing, tearing at the eyes, slapping my knees, falling sideways. It was too much to laugh at all at once! I've never laughed so hard in a movie (this was much funnier than the magnifying glass seen in "Antz".) Even a week later, that scene would pop up in my head during class and I'd have to fight to keep the chuckling to myself. That's not the only such scene in this movie.This is just one of those stupid movies you have to shut down your brain for before watching, and just sit back and enjoy the sheer stupidity of its meaningless slapstick comedy. If you're looking for wit or meaning of any kind, you'll enjoy this movie the same way you'd enjoy riding a roller coaster for a slow, scenic Sunday drive. Jim Carrey, once again, does a spectacular job at making his character(s) work. Renee Zellweger is a perfect level-headed opposite to Carey's character, and the music (Cake?) just perfects the comedy.Yes, there were some slow scenes, but overall, I got off my sofa feeling a hefty dose of the therapeutic benefits of several good, hard laughs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like one reviewer said before. If you are familier with the Farrelly Brothers work, or had seen a preview you should know to expect crude disgusting humor and were offended by this you are indeed an idiot! Crude humor is always in Farrelly Brothers movies. It just comes with the territory.The basic story is that Charlie marries his girlfriend, the smartest girl in town. But she falls for the limo driver, and african-american dwarf, who is only driving the car as a scientific experiment and she cheats on Charlie. She gives birth to the other guys kids, african-american triplets. She dumps Charlie and takes off with the other man. Charlie then looses the ability to confront his problems. He becomes a laughing stock of the town.Jump to present time. His kids are geniuses but curse worse than truckers. They are the top three students in school. He never blames them for what their mother did and loves his kids like they were his own. Charlie soon snaps and becomes Hank. Hank is his other personality who is pure agression and nastiness. He is the polar opposite of Charlie. Well his superiors have him take a vacation while transporting a girl, Irene, to a an upper NY police station.But her ex boyfriend/boss is a criminal and thinks she knows too much so he has her marked for death and has a couple of crooked cops after her. Charlie snaps between his and Hank's personality often which causes lots of pain for Charlie. Charlie and Irene meet Casper, an albino, and continue their journey to try and keep her safe.The humor is a little crude at times like a cow laying in the road and Charlie tries to help by shooting it but the thing just won't die. In another scene a man has a chicken's head stuck up his ass with the rest sticking out. If you are easily offended I'd avoid this film. If you do like raunchy humor then this is a fairly good film. I'd give it about a 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well. Before this film (and the next few Farrelly follies), I wanted to contact the Farrellys about directing a film for which I wrote a screenplay. Notice the word WANTED.Now SOMETHING ABOUT MARY was not the greatest movie in the world but it got laughs and made a whole lot of money. Maybe the Farrellys just thought "well if it worked once it will work again." John Steinbeck would have a field day with that.Why was it so bad? Ever see the guy who always tries WAY too hard to impress women? "Myself" over and over again tried to be hilarious. And with the exception of Tony Cox (THE LIMO DRIVER), the movie did not accomplish its goal. Besides trying too hard, it was way too dragged out. Silly comedies, IMHO, should be 90 minutes long at the most. This pushed two hours.Now the jokes did not offend me at all. I'm all Jewish and usually lead the room with Jewish jokes. But the gags in "Myself" were just not funny nor entertaining.In any event, if you are not in the least bit tired, don't mind wasting a couple of bucks, have a para-normal attention span, are socially inept AND have a vendetta against cows, go rent it.If all these do not apply, go see something else =)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>give it a chance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me just get this out of my system: If you knew this movie starred Jim Carrey, or you knew this movie was done by the Farrelly brothers, or you saw a preview for this movie, or you knew anything about this movie whatsoever, and you said that the humor was offensive, you are an idiot. If you didn't know to expect raunchy humor from this movie and you knew at least something about it - yes, you are an idiot. Thank you. Now that that's out of the way...I didn't think this movie was racist or stereotypical at all. Sure, Carrey's African-American sons used excessive profanity - but did you not see the scene in which they all watch Richard Pryor, and then it's about 10 years later and they're all watching Chris Rock? It's not that the movie's saying that black people were born with some innate quality of saying motherf***er all the time - the kids grew up with the influence of foulmouthed comedians. I liked the irony in that they were profane and crude, yet they were still the 3 top students in their class. So if it's a racist stereotype to say that black people are extraordinarily brilliant, then yes, this movie might've been a spawn of the KKK.Finally, while this movie isn't perfect, and it doesn't compare to "Dumb and Dumber" and "There's Something About Mary", I still enjoyed it - it was a guilty pleasure for me. Sure, I still find pleasure in laughing at the subtle humor of movies like "Fargo", but hey, there's nothing like kicking back, relaxing, and laughing at the guy who has a chicken inside his buttocks. Jim Carrey's physical humor, especially with his face, is also amazing. So give this movie a chance, unless you are the kind of guy who just refuses to enjoy the simple pleasures in life, like laughing at Carrey trying to put a cow out of its misery. If you can't enjoy these simple pleasures, I feel sorry for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suddenly, I find myself really enjoying this movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a Farrelly brothers fan to be sure, but I didn't care for Me, Myself, and Irene when I first saw it in theaters. I hadn't watched it again until last week when I caught it on television, and for some reason it's playing a lot better to me. The jokes are suddenly working, the characters are a lot more involving, and I dig the movie a whole lot more. Don't ask me why; perhaps there's more merit to the theory that I am mentally regressing than I thought.Jim Carrey stars as Charlie Baileygates, a Rhode Island state trooper who got a raw deal from his wife, and ends up repressing his emotions to the point that he develops a split personality; a fast-talking, sexually perverse, confrontational guy name Hank Evans. Charlie has to bring Irene (Renee Zellweger) back to New York where there's a warrant for her arrest. Things go sour quick, and Charlie loses his medicine, so it's Irene and Charlie/Hank on the lamb.Carrey's performance seemed way over the top when I first saw this movie, but now I really appreciate it as quite an accomplishment. He pulls off two characters, serious physical stunts, and does it in style. Zellweger and Carrey have good chemistry, in both his personalities, and there are lots of funny bits. The movies isn't perfect, and it certainly isn't as good as Kingpin or There's Something About Mary. First off, the movie has an omniscient narrator that feels really odd, and doesn't work at all. Second, Carrey's three foul-mouthed African American teenage sons are so over-the-top that they get real old real quick. Still, Carrey's really something to see here, and the movie, like all Farrelly Brother flicks, has a top notch soundtrack. Definitely not a film for the ages, but one that I'm coming around to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll be honest with you. When I first rented this movie, I watched about 40 minutes of it before I was so angry I actually took it back to Blockbuster. I thought it was the worst piece of garbage on the planet. I gave it a 1/10. ... While I had no intentions on watching it again, I couldn't help but to catch bits and pieces of it on HBO after it premiered. Once I saw bits and pieces, it didn't seem so bad. After catching it a few times, I even started to like. I decided to change my rating! It was up to a 5! Now, I've probably seen it completely like 8 times. Honestly, it gets funnier every time I see it. I think my rating is up to 8 or 9! It does actually have an interesting plot, which is hard to follow if you miss even a few minutes of the movie. Overall, the comedy wasn't stupid like Ace Ventura, but it did make me laugh throughout. Charlie's sons were the funniest characters in the movie! If you're totally against the movie, at least watch it fully a few times to see if it gets better. I guess it finally grew on me...</fullReview>

I do think some of the potty jokes went a bit too far but other than that it was truly a funny film with a GREAT sound track! Pete Yorn is great and probably most who did not like this film have never heard of him. One shining quality that comes out in Carrey's character even though he is a mental case it that he never considered letting go of what was most important to him, his kids. Not that this would be a good movie for kids but no matter what he did the right thing unless he was Hank. Carrey played the square dad perfectly and the kids while a bit over the top were portrayed brilliantly by the actors. Why do so many people have trouble laughing? Maybe they should have a drink with Hank and spend a night in a motel with him.</fullReview>

However, once he snaps, things really heat up. He acts really well with his surrounding cast, and Renee Zellweger is also pretty funny as the deranged convicted New Yorker.

		<shortDescription>Comedic overkill</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I fear that Jim Carrey has outdone himself with this one - and I don't mean that in any positive sense of the word. This movie somehow reminded me of dusting off some old dorky joke line, like "I'd rather have a bottle in front of me than a frontal lobotomy!" and delivering the line by standing on your head, screaming it wildly, and making a ridiculously funny face... Yeah, okay, ha, ha, uh... ha... I guess.Perhaps it is the fault of the movie-going public that, over time, has come to expect (demand) more and more of Jim Carrey - so much so, that he has to dig so deep for laughs that he eventually hits manure, instead of paydirt.That being said, I assure you there were actually many parts of the movie that WERE funny, with more than a few memorable lines. And I sincerely mean this - no, I'm NOT damning the movie with faint praise here, there actually WERE good scenes and funny lines. But regretfully this was overshadowed by a sense that, throughout the movie, there was a sort of hidden desperation going on - it seemed like the people who made this movie were desperate not just to be funny, but creative and original, cutting edge and shocking as well, all at once, to the point that they ended up alienating fans and irreparably tainting a good product.I'll probably watch it again some day, though, because I like Jim Carrey, as well as many of the other cast members. I also liked the New England setting: some of the shots were pure picture-postcard material. And I think the movie had enough funny stuff in it to make it worth watching again. However, I could really do without some of the vulgarity in the film - but at least if I see the movie again, I'll know what to expect, and I can mentally tune it out before it hits me.And one more thing: for those of you who have already seen the film, I hope you liked my ************ review!!</fullReview>

The three fast-talking, street wise, budding nuclear physicist, linguist boyz from the hood sons were a stroke of comic genius.

		<fullReview>This movie shows a lot of character. To me it is an instant classic! I feel the same for the movie as much as I liked viewing the "Wizard of Oz"! This movie has a little of everything: comedy, romance, adventure. This movie doesn't overflow with mushy stuff, nor does it have a complicated plot; yet it has a unique (shall I say "corny"?) sense of humor that you expect out of Jim Carrey that makes the movie such a pleasure to watch. The movie seems to flow so elegantly it's like viewing "poetry in motion". Now I understand some people just don't like these type of movies. These are the types of people who are never satisfied. I have read comments before that say how awful a movie was and they were never entertained or got their money worth! I wish people would just come to a movie with an open mind, sit down, relax, and just take it for what it's worth. I know it is bothersome to most if something happens during a movie that doesn't make sense or brings up some negativity from what is happening in your own life and can prohibit enjoyment of a movie. For example, in the movie, Jim gets dumped by his "soulmate" for another guy - a black midget! To some, that may be bothersome. I say just watch the movie because THAT makes the movie so funny! Also, there is some sexual inuendo (did I spell that right?) said that may offend some people but that's just Jim working his magic! I find that mostly guys like this movie. But I have seen women watch this movie and howl with laughter! I own the DVD of this movie and I love watching it over and over. The scenery is sooo beautiful that it makes me want to visit the place, and some of the things Jim does and says is outright hilarious! I do not want to give much away so I'll put it like this: If you liked Dumb &amp; Dumber, then you should like this movie because it has the same type of humor, just a whole different plot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my opinion, ME, MYSELF &amp; IRENE is a pure gut-busting, in-your-face, laugh-out-loud comedy. Charlie/Hank (Jim Carrey) was a REALLY funny guy in my opinion. I thought that Irene (Renée Zellweger) was a VERY beautiful woman. The two characters I couldn't stand were Dickie (Daniel Greene) and Lieutenant Gerke (Chris Cooper). This was because they were pure A*******! The one thing that surprised me was that Chris Cooper from A TIME TO KILL was in this movie. In conclusion, I HIGHLY recommend this gut-busting, in-your-face, laugh-out-loud comedy to all you Jim Carrey or Renée Zellweger fans who have not seen it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jim Carrey is up to his same old style of humor - face twisting, body spasms and so on. The photography and scenes from Rhode Island and upstate NY were beautiful. The story was hum-drum and too silly to believe. The theory behind not standing up for oneself and it manifesting into a split personality was interesting.</fullReview>

It is so funny to see Jim Carrey acting as a man with a split personality. This is another great Farrelly brothers film! I love the Farrelly Brothers' films such as "There's Something About Mary" , "Say It Isn't So", "Dumb and Dumber" etc. this is another brillaint Farrelly Brothers movie!! I give this great film a 10 out of 10!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ahhh, "gross-out" comedy done right.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is definitely one of the funniest comedies of 2000 (that might not be saying much considering crap like Scary Movie was it's competition). This movie is funny because in a way it represents what we wish we could do when life hands us a lemon, take that lemon and stick it to life where the sun don't shine. Jim Carry's character in the beginning gets walked all over by everybody, all he does is bend over and take it. That is, until he snaps, what insues is some of the most funny and cruel things I've seen in a long while. The scene where he is getting revenge on that little girl had me rolling on the floor in laughter. It has sort of a thin plot (most comedies do) but that dosen't stop this. The performance of Jim trying to control his bad side is extremely funny, and is a testament to Jim's comic abilities. My only complaint about this movie is the step sons. They where funny, but their characters seemed too stereotypical, even though the reason they were so vulgar, was because they were allowed to watch vulgar comedians all their life. Other than that this movie is great, and I definitely recommend it to all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite being yet another road movie (can the Farrelly's do anything else?) and having a plot that is all over the place and near impossible to follow, this is the Farrelly Brothers second funniest film, after Kingpin.Jim Carrey is back in gurning, lunatic Ace Ventura mode as a schizophrenic, and gains back some ground lost after the sombre, and in retrospect pointless Man On The Moon. The story and script go way too far in the most satisfying way (Did anyone not love the albino character 'Whitey'?), and on the whole, the film serves up a few great moments. Yes, its slack as hell and feels rushed, but (like Kingpin) the rough edges only make it more endearing. Personally, the two big Farrelly hits, Dumb and Dumber and Theres Something About Mary, do absolutely nothing for me. I find the trailers more amusing, purely because thats where the only decent jokes are. I'm not blaming the trailers for giving away too much; I'm blasting the fact that the Brothers were very careful about only including jokes that almost anyone can laugh at. Being too careful does not comedy gold make (just my opinion).</fullReview>

Not good for youngsters, but is kind of funny. Plus on the DVD is a music video of Foo Fighters "Breakout" which is awesome and funny.

		<fullReview>Jim Carrey is back in the saddle again! He plays a policeman with a split personality and comes to the aid of a woman (Renee Zelleweger) who's paying the price of falling into a bad crowd. One day while escorting her, Jim turns into 'Hank' his alter ego after forgetting to take his medication, and gets into mischief, beats anyone who gets in his way, even the bad guys eventually and falls for the girl. Even though this movie was controversial and had bad reviews from some critics, it was still an awesome Jim Carrey movie that certainly isn't a waste of time if you're a fan like me. It may be politically incorrect, but hey! That's the Farrelly Brothers for you! Me, Myself, and Irene almost didn't make it to the theaters because most believed it was mocking and shunning mentally ill people. Things may not have worked out for Jim and Renee who were dating during the making of this movie, they still had excellent chemistry together. Me, Myself, and Irene is way better than Dumb and Dumber which was made 6 years prior to this one. Me, Myself, and Irene was without a doubt the most funniest movie of last year! May Jim Carrey's comedy career take him to better and new heights! Rent it today! I give it 5 out of 5 stars!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Me, Myself and Irene" is the latest comedy from the Farrelly Brothers, who have given us the comic gems "Dumb and Dumber", "Kingpin" and the unbelievably funny "There's Something About Mary". It is an exercise in grossout humor, but it so skillfully done that it transcends the genre. Yet it received strangely negative reviews.This film is even better than "There's Something About Mary" and I think a lot of the credit goes to Jim Carrey, of which this marks a comeback. After establishing himself as a top actor with the dramas "The Truman Show" and "Man on the Moon", Carrey makes his triumphant return to comedy. There are so many gags spit out at such a machine gun like pace, that it reminded me of Billy Wilder's great "One! Two! Three!""Me, Myself and Irene" also stands out because we have characters we care about. Carrey's schizophrenic Charlie is his most likable character since Stanley Ipkiss in "The Mask". But also standing out is Renee Zellweger, who with this film, "Nurse Betty" and "Bridget Jones Diary" is establishing herself as a major talent. She deserved an Oscar for "Nurse Betty" and she will hopefully receive a nomination for "Bridget Jones' Diary".A typical Farrelly Brothers movie has gags that work and gags that fizzle out. "Me, Myself and Irene" is their most successful work so far. I don't want to give away any of the wonderful jokes, but the first 20 minutes of this film had me laughing so hard that tears were flowing. How much more of a recommendation can that be?**** out of 4 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had to comment because of the whiney nature of the one comment about this movie that I saw posted. It may not be one of the 10 funniest movies of all time, but it is extremely funny and brilliantly acted by Jim Carrey (even if his Hank voice sounds way too much like Dirty Harry.) These guys continue to break new ground in the field of, for lack of a better term, "rude adult comedy." This genre is not for everyone, but who else would not only make a joke about shoving a chicken's head where the sun don't shine, but invest the money in animatronics to actually show the result? While not perfect, this was a very funny movie for those who usually like Carrey and Farrelly brothers movies.</fullReview>

The Farrelly Brothers love to take decent actors such as Jim Carrey and slap their faces on a movie that's gonna hurt their career, like it's a bitter, twisted joke.Well, as usual we have two (arguably three) lead characters that are irritating and flat. There's no character you really root for or care about. If they all died in the final minutes you'd walk out from the film feeling pretty much the same. The jokes involving the token midget, token sex toy and token semen marks are, I'm sure, lost on all but the most mindless telly addicts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've just watched this film for the third time. I loved it even more than I did at the cinema. There, I often found myself laughing, while conscious of a silence from everyone else. But in the comfort of my living room I just let myself go. Jim is brilliant as both Charlie and Hank (especially Hank) Their voices, their attitudes, their expressions, couldn't be more different. Rene, the three coloured guys and "Whitey" also make the most of their roles.The visual and spoken humour is excellent, if not to everyone's taste. Frankly, I think some of Hank's victims (the neighbour, the woman at the checkout, the little girl) deserved what they got. And even if they didn't I found it impossible to keep a straight face.If you're as crazy about Jim as I am, this is one not to be missed. If you're not or if you're easily offended, then I can't recommend it.The soundtrack is good too. (Most of it.)9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing disjointed affair</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jim Carrey used to be a funny man. Dumb and Dumber was sheer class because he played it toned down (for a change!). Every comedy he's made since then he seems to get more and more over the top. Cable Guy had its moments as did Ace Ventura. Liar Liar was just sheer schmaltzy pap. Which brings us to Me, Myself and Irene. Slated on its realise for its poking fun at Schizophrenia the idea in its self is good and seems suited to Jim's manic brand of humour. Jim plays Charlie a cop with a problem for letting people walk all over him. One day he blows his top and decides to take out his frustrations on everybody, in his alter ego Hank. This includes the rather unfunny pretend drowning of a little girl in a fountain for skipping on the road and embarrassing a woman in the supermarket for buying vagina cream. Enter the love interest Renee Zellweger who does a moderate job when Carrey's over the top performance doesn't blast her off the screen. The humour is very childish and you end up feeling rather sorry for Jim's victims as you do for him. The plot is non-existent and the whole film feels like a sad empty shell of a vehicle for Jim to gurn through while doing a silly Clint Eastwood impression as his alter ego Hank. A complete basted turkey! Stick with the serious stuff Jim!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>People need to stop comparing this to THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY [spoilers]</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Critics made the mistake of trying to compare ME, MYSELF, AND IRENE to THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY. That is not the case. Just because Peter and Bobby Farrely made THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY, it does not mean that every other movie they make is going to be as good as THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY. In my opinion, this movie is better than 'MARY' was. I know a lot of people would probably disagree, but I can see why. I did not find 'MARY' to be a great movie and I didn't expect to find it a great movie. On the other hand, I did not think ME, MYSELF, AND IRENE was going to be a great movie and it was a great movie. The movie is a very crude [and very funny] comedy about a Rhode Island state trooper named Charlie Baileygates. When the movie opens we see him getting married to a woman named Layla. Years later after Layla leaves Charlie [and their three triplet sons], Charlie is assigned to take a woman named Irene to New York. Going with the two is Hank who is Charlie split-personality. Charlie knew Hank would be trouble, but what Charlie did not know was that they would both be falling in love with Irene. The movie has another plot of Charlie's three sons going on a mission to find him. Most of the thousands of laughs come from Charlie's sons and their vulgarity while some other laughs come from Hank and Whitey. The rest of the laughs come from the crude and sexual humor which will probably offend some people, making this movie for fans of Jim Carrey, Anthony Anderson, or the Farrely brothers only.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Get the Special DVD edition</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much like There's Something About Mary, this is another Farrellys movie that has a lot more seriousness inside than people give credit for. It certainly is more serious in a lot of places than their other movies and certainly many "F-Bombs" get dropped by certain characters and there are a few of the typical gross-out gags. What really makes the movie work, though, is chemistry between Zellweger and Carrey, which is quite evident. Even though the plot is a little weak as far as certain points goes the main characters get pretty fully developed and the movie works pretty well despite those shortcomings.Anyone who thinks this movie lacks weight should definately check out the Special Edition DVD and watch the extended branching version of the movie... there is one very serious (and very good) deleted scene that may be the best in the film between Carrey and Zellweger. It's unbelievable that it got cut from the final film.</fullReview>

Jim Carrey is hilarious as a peaceful cop in a small town who finds himself succumbing to a split personality when the anger he has suppressed for so long just can't keep itself inside him. Renee Zellweger is the beautiful criminal he is assigned to escort across the country. Guess what happens? Not the most memorable film, but definitely worth some chuckles.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me preface this by stating that I am not a Jim Carrey fan. Usually, Seeing a Jim Carrey movie on the shelves of my local video store is a sign that I'm in the wrong section. If a friend invites me over for a Jim Carrey film, it's oddly enough the same night I'm washing my hair. I continually suggest that people who watch his films are evolutionary throwbacks.But, y'know, I think I may actually be becoming a Jim Carrey fan. I enjoyed him a lot in _The Truman Show_, and I really, *really* liked him in _Man on the Moon_. And I liked him in this film. The guy actually has a lot of talent -- that is, when he's not talking out his rear end.Baileygates, the character Carrey plays in this film, is fleshed out well, and Carrey plays him with enough realism and affability that you soon become sucked into the story. His alter ego, Hank, is insanely over-the-top -- but he's supposed to be. And even at that, Hank is also very likeable. Carrey turns in a great performance in this movie, and he should be recognized for it.As far as the rest of the film... well, the Farrelly brothers are not the Zuckers, nor are they the Coens. They are not envelope-pushing provocateurs; instead, their humour is that of two high-school teens, giving each other noogies and purple nurples in their parents' basement. That being said, there are some genuine laughs in this movie: the limo driver, Hank in his fighting stance, the drum riffs, taking his newspaper back. Still, the Farrellys have not impressed me -- I might change my opinion if they ever go an entire film without "hair gel" or a chicken in a someone's butt.I gave this movie 7 repressed emotions out of 10, meaning that Carrey's performance makes it worth your rental money, even with the cheap laughs. And if you're still a fan of the purple nurple, you might enjoy this film a whole lot more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>same old, same old, but it's still entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I heard good and bad things from everyone who had seen this movie. After viewing it myself, I do have to say that it wasn't by any means a good movie, and on the Farrelly scale, it was hardly even anything new (more Rhode Island comedy with strange people and weird situations with oddly heartwarming portions thrown into the mix). Nonetheless, I never got bored throughout the film.Maybe this is because Zellweger and Carrey did have a never-before tapped chemistry and both of them, although not really creating totally new characters, can make their roles interesting. The caper chase romance comedy with two parties (the concerned pursuants and the pursued) is somewhat unoriginal, but I was entertained by the more minor of the major players involved, like Whitey and Charlie's three sons.My huge complaint is the overabundance of narration weaved into the film. I'm used to seeing minstrels in Farrellyland (i.e. the 2 annoying guys with the guitars in "Mary"), but having an unseen narrator voice over the content every twenty minutes to keep us updated felt unnecessary. The storybook narrator routine was never explained (we never did find out who he was) and I feel that it came off as annoying and amateur. Despite that and the fact that the soundtrack was a little too bubblegum "let's put a song in here because so-and-so paid us so much to do so," I really enjoyed it as a pick-me-up-buttercup feel-good venture with a healthy amount of disgusting potty humor!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>May contain spoilers...This movie is crap. I wouldn't be surprised if it ruined Carry's career. It has very little -good- humor at all. They blow the multiple personality thing so far out of proportion it is just dumb. At one point, the "Hank" personality seems to be getting nice but then reverts back to normal. They even had to give him a stupid "Tough guy" voice.. It's just stupid. And to make up for the lake of humor, the movie attempts to make us laugh at sexual shock humor and excessive vulgarity. They seem to be playing the "How low can you go" game. They have nearly all of the character swear at some point, even a little girl saying the F-word. It is rediculous. And the last line of the movie is, "I hoped you liked our mother****ing movie." Gee, thats a good way to end it..... It's crap. Don't bother.</fullReview>

I hope for thier next flick they decide to rely less on the toilet humor, and try and try to bring it a little bit closer to the humor of 'Mary'. I'm all for controversial humor, but when it's more gross than funny, forget it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is definitely the slapstick comedy that it was made out to be, but Jim Carrey, the master of modern slapstick comedy, makes it work.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had high hopes for Me, Myself, and Irene, but mostly because I am a huge Jim Carrey fan. Clearly, the story of the film did not strike me as something truly ingenious, but it provided huge possibilities for Carrey to work his hilarious magic. While not nearly as good as some of his comedy classics, such as Dumb &amp; Dumber, Me, Myself and Irene was very successful on many levels. (spoilers) One of the things that is seen here (as is seen in many of Carrey's films) is the criminal subplot that actually drives much of the comedy. In some cases, this provides for some irony that is actually pretty funny, but also makes you wonder about the message that is being delivered to this film's target audience (`?somewhere along the line they get the idea that the cops are the bad guys-` BAM!). Well, in this case, the cops really ARE the bad guys. While the majority of the film was very successful as a comedy, I think that some things may have been a little bit blown out of proportion, or a little too childish. The cow, for example, which was `lucky to be alive' after Carrey shot it in the head six times and then tried to wrestle to death, was just too much. On the other hand, this kind of excess is not too unexpected, given the film's directors. Also, Carrey's three vulgar but hugely intelligent sons may have gone a little too far, but in this case, it was still really funny. They also ended the film in a charming way ? `Thanks for watching our motherf**kin' movie!' I can't say that I loved Me, Myself, and Irene, but it was still a good comedy. Renee Zellweger gave a good performance as the object of the affection of both of Carrey's personalities in the film. And she also delivered a good kick to his jaw in one particularly amusing scene. The reason to watch this film is for the hilarious performance by Carrey as the two strikingly different colliding personalities, Hank and Charlie. The breathy sound of Hank's voice gets a little tiring pretty quick, but this doesn't take away from the laughs that are skillfully delivered.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why did they do it THAT way?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film's title derives from a schizophrenic Rhode Island state trooper, Charlie Baileygates, played by Jim Carrey, and Irene (Rene Zellweger), a young lady he has to escort to NY for legal proceedings.Shortly after his honeymoon, Charlie's unfaithful wife bears triplet boys of obviously different race. She soon leaves him and the boys to pursue life with her new flame. From this point in the film, the part played by the triplets can and should have been be dispensed with. But the viewer has to endure their totally unfunny and unnecessarily vulgar dialogue as they grow up.Anyway, the affable Charlie at first deals with his predicament by denying it. In the process, the cuckolded state trooper becomes a local laughing stock and milktoast cop whom no one fears or respects. No longer able to completely suppress his embarrassment and humiliation the other personality, Hank Evans, rears up like a cornered bear. Alternating between nice Charlie and hard guy Hank, the unpredictable trooper combo becomes a management and public relations problem to the police force. To get rid of him temporarily, Charlie's supervisor assigns him to escort an angry, wronged Irene back to NY to face her legal problems. There's more than meets the eye to Irene's situation which involves crooked, on the take cops, who try to intercept her and Charlie/Hank. The movie follows Carrey, whose personality swings back and forth, and his reluctant, but lively, charge through their trip to New York. If you're a Jim Carrey fan, and can be patient through the tasteless black youth jive of his three "sons" (which detract signifantly from the film's humor and the story), your sides will ache from Carrey's antics, facial contortions and hilarious dialogue.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Baileygates boys were the funniest part of the film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's kind of sad when the supporting characters get more laughs than the big stars, but that's what you'll likely be facing when watching "Me Myself and Irene". The Baileygates boys are three... well... ethnically different young men from their "father", Officer Charly Baileygates, played by Jim Carrey. His sons exist as a clever spoofing of the movie concept that all young African American males must be portrayed as foul-mouthed, obnoxious, low class, sex maniacs. The Baileygates boys do drop obscenities, but while debating topics such as hacking into the Pentagon's computer files, how to read a helicopter flight manual in German, the breakdown of subatomic particles in molecules, and given the average size of a chicken's egg (in both centimeters and inches), would one indeed be able to be shoved up someone's ass? These young men certainly steal the show. The rest of the movie follows a predictable madcap zany adventure involving Charly Baileygates, as a Rhode Island police officer with a split personality, and Irene P. Waters, played disinterestedly by Renée Zellweger. Seems Irene is being framed over embezzling money from a golf course, and Charly (and his alter ago Hank) take it open themselves to protect Irene from the crooked agents and confused cops that are after her. One scene in which Charly and Hank "battle" for control of Charly's body, is more fascinating than funny. You'll wonder how many times Carrey had to practice to make it appear that an invisible man was pulling him up, and tossing him through plate glass windows. Overall, the Baileygates boys save this film from complete boredom... if only Carrey and Zellweger could've as well. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The trailers didnt really make me wanna see the film, and after my sister hated it, I decided to wait for video. I am sorta sorry I did. MMAI is a pretty solid comedy, with slapstick, some pretty funny lines (price check on VAGICLEAN) and a passable plot. Some of jokes just die on impact-the much talked about chicken scene wasnt all that it was cracked up to be, the cow scene was too long, the midget guy was trying to be the easily offended, all purpose black guy, but wasnt really funny. Also, there are so many lines stolen from other movies: the movie says Charlie's fiancee was named Layla, after the melody-this one's a dead give away. There is no bigger Big Daddy rip-off to be ever written (unless of course, Jim Carrey got dressed in a kangaroo suit and sang the song) and theres one other joke I remember hearing somewhere else. (I cant remember-I saw MMAI about a month ago) Although more watchable than Outside Providence and the horrible Something About Mary, it doesnt have the overall zany feeling of Dumb and Dumber. There's nothing spectacular about it, and the jokes are really hit and miss. But the great ones you will repeat over and over. (case in point: I cannot get the "Wrong answer, f***face" line outta my head) I'd only recommend buying it to the diehard Jim Carrey/Farelly fan, but for everyone else, you can get by with a weekend rental. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is just one typical Farrelly comedy. Always on the edge of one can and cannot show to the audience. As a result of that some jokes are terribly lame (cow and chicken joke) whereas others are just plain hilarious (hotel joke). I really laughed my a.. off sometimes but I did not think this one was as good as There's Something about Mary. There were lots of reasons for that. First of all this was more lame (think Dumb and Dumber), second of all, some things were terribly predictable plus the acting was lame some times (not Carrey's, but Zellwegers) for instance in that cow scene. All in all not something I would recommend you to watch but neither something you must beware of. Oh yes Anna Kournikova is in this one too and she looks very good (better than on court).

		<fullReview>===== Rating System: ***** Must see **** Very good *** I liked it, but you might hate it ** I hated it, but you might like it * Avoid ===== This is without a doubt Carrey's worst movie, but none of that is his fault. He delivers a powerhouse performance, making the most of a very weak script. The guys to blame here are the Farrely's, managing to achieve neither the shock value nor the sheer likeability of Dumb and Dumber (1995) and There's something about Mary (1998). There is a consistent lack of any good jokes, there is absolutely no chemistry between Carrey's two characters and Renée Zellweger's non-existent character, and Carrey's three black (for no apparent reason but racism) sons manage to utter the word m****rf****r (for no apparent reason but to up the certificate) three times in every sentence. The comedy tries to be shocking but is just pathetic, the situations are as random as a roulette table (dying cows on the road for example) and the coherence between them is nowhere to be found. The only plus points of the film is Carrey's amazing performance and Zellweger's screen charisma, but they don't make up for the Farrely's misjudged direction and a faltering script. Watch only if you really like Carrey, your sense of humor is toilet or you really need to get rid of those $4. **</fullReview>

I think the movie suffered because there was way too much of a plot. I still don't really understand it. Something about the EPA and a golf course...it's not important, but the film spends a lot of time on it instead of trying to make us laugh. If they had scaled back at least a quarter of the time spent on it, I'm sure I would have enjoyed this movie more. But I will say that there are at least three really funny scenes in the film. I don't know, something about seeing a grown man breast feed strikes me as hilarious.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is only so far that extreme over-acting and recycled jokes can take a film. While Me, Myself &amp; Irene does exibit some characteristics of quality Jim Carrey Humor, the majority of the film flops. This is a movie that relies too heavily on a weak plot and foul mouth humor and is an example of a stereotypical Hollywood formula movie. Just throw in a big name star, a sexy co-star, some shock humor, a pointless love sub-plot, and a happy ending and you can't miss, right? Wrong!!! Carey's same physical overacting and the abuse of the English language ruined what could have been a good movie. Jim Carrey as a nice guy who develops an evil alter-ego is a potentially hillarious movie but the attempts at drama and a love story are distracting and poorly done. While I remain a Jim Carrey fan I wish that he would be more selective when choosing scripts, this was worse than Cable Guy. One last note, don't watch this with your kids, this movie sets a new record for use of the "F word".</fullReview>

Not that it's a bad thing, reaching into depths no bigshot director will ever lay a finger on.Again, it's critics who spoil a movie. when will people learn that reviews are not meant to affect your viewing of the movie. in fact, a movie review is just written by a guy just like yourself,yet critics refuse to believe that. Well, on with the review.Charlie Baileygates (Jim Carrey), a mild mannered cop who folds upon his problems, and keeps it down in his mind, develops a split personality, Hank Evans, a Clint Eastwood-type guy who deals with what Charlie is afraid to do but wants to do it.While escorting Irene P. Waters (Renee Zellweger) to Messina, New York, Charlie is instantly attracted to her. But so is Hank. I'll leave it at that.Again, the Farrely brothers touch usually includes handicapped people, acts of racism, and more other things. This time, Whitey, an albino who told Charlie that he was a killer, eventually joins but is left behind. No problem, there are plenty more gags. Jim Carrey gives a great performance that brings up a question everyone should be asking: "How does he stick to the script?"Renee Zellweger was fine as Irene, I couldn't have thought of anyone better. and Jim Carrey's three black sons are foul-talking, but unbelievably smart young men.It's a great movie to watch if you're about 12 or 13 and up.

However, I was very surprised. To hear the detractors, one would think that this was some horrible movie. It was a great comedy. That's all, it didn't need an elaborate storyline, matching each detail in a seamless form. The purpose was to entertain, and judging by the comments from viewers, it did just that. It's truly a shame that outrageous comedies like this get little more than a rememberance from viewers as the years roll on. Remember: Just because it doesn't get the "Big Award" doesn't mean it's a bad movie. Likewise, the heavy drama that wins all the awards may not be your cup of tea. But if you want something that will leave stitches in your side, I highly recommend Me, Myself, &amp; Irene!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jim Carrey is a sweet nerdy highway patrolman whose wife leaves him for a 3 foot tall African-American MENSA-member limo driver...probably you can guess the rest? Well, maybe not guess, but you get the idea.Essentially he represses this trauma and quietly raises his 3 black children (who turn out to be trash-mouthed 400 pound black geniuses) and is stepped on by everyone in his quiet Rhode Island burg...until he snaps one day and his "multiple personality disorder" comes out--his alter ego being a mean-spirited sex-crazed psychopath named Hank. He runs across Irene (Zellweger) who is in trouble and is targeted by the ?mob and a corrupt police force, and he somehow becomes her protagonist. However, Hank is deviously trying to get her into bed (which he eventually does sneakily). After all is said and done, Hank is suppressed and the sweet loveable Carrey character overcomes the bad guys and wins the girl with the aid of his Sugarhill Gang children. Typical Farrelly jokes and ploys. Most enjoyable for those like myself who enjoy this, but perhaps a bit more schtick than many will like (like the cutaway from the defecation in the neighbor's yard as a reprisal for the doggy-doo to the dispensation of the chocolate frozen yogurt--get my drift?)Anyhow, I think it well worth a rental, but am glad I didn't pay the big theater money for this one. Zellweger is delicious without having to show any nudity. An outlandish character "Whitey" (his real name is Casper--an albino fellow) is hilarious).Hope you enjoy!dlc</fullReview>

This movie succeeded big time in that regard.Although not as cohesive as The Mask or as slick as Liar Liar, the movie still comes through as a vehicle for what Jim Carrey does best, physical humor. No modern cinema comedian has ever done it better, including Jerry Lewis or Steve Martin. True, based on its own merits, the movie would have fallen flat without him. With him the movie is above average comedy.If you want pure art with your comedy, then see The Truman Show, but if your a fan of Jim Carrey, physical comedy and gross out jokes, then this movie is right up your alley.</fullReview>

I usually shy away from movies with foul language, but it was used in such a mocking manner that I laughed so hard I had tears in my eyes. Jim Carrie is fantastic. I read that Jerry Lewis was a big influence on him when he was young and it is nice to see that form of physical comedy will die while Carrie is around.This movie simply had me rolling on the ground when I saw the Cow scene. I'm sure there were animal right activist that were horrified, but we all know the cow was animatronic. Besides, I love animals, I really do; but that part was simply hilarious.It did drag a bit here and there, and the plot was a little undeveloped in some areas. But, I wanted to see Me, Myself and Irene for the mindless entertainment it was meant to be. Don't watch it to analyze it, watch it to laugh. Leave behind all adult ideas of good taste and you'll have a great time.V.CanfieldP.S. Some people have gone on about how horrible it is to use behavior disorders as the theme for a comedy. I work with kids in a residential treatment facility and I STILL found this to be hilarious. The movie also poked fun at the black community, white community, midgets, women, men, the police force, albinos, cows, ect. People really need to lighten up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is not funny. Jim Carrey is the most talented actor/comedian in Hollywood, and the Farrelly brothers make some good ass movies, so I just don't get it. I don't think that it has anything to do with trying to live up to their other films like "Dumb &amp; Dumber" or "There's Something about Mary". On it's own, this movie would still not be funny. Jim's talents were wasted, and i just hope that the Farrelly brothers can get back on there feet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jim Carrey saves the day!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not usually a fan of mindless gross out humour that generally targets the 12-16 year old audience. And, as far as the "Farrelly Brothers" go, I dislike their brand of comedy and I absolutely hated "Something About Mary".However, I think the Brothers would do well to cast Jim Carrey in more of their movies. I found Dumb and Dumber to be absolutely hilarious and, once again, he has made "Me, Myself and Irene" a truly enjoyable piece of comedy. Without his fabulous physical performance, this film would be reduced to a string of sight gags and toilet humour which we have all seen before in dozens of other movies. I know that this movie was not exactly embraced by critics which blows my mind. Seeing that everyone completely adored "Something About Mary" - basically all the same jokes without Jim Carrey to pull them off. This movie is not for everyone, but any astute movie watcher and any true Jim Carrey fan will instantly see the uncompromising energy which he poured into his 2 characters. He is truly a wonder to behold and will go down in history as one of the greatest physical comedic actors of all time. Say what you will about the movie, but it really is a shame that the Academy consistently overlooks Carrey's gifted performances. He has proven that he is a talented actor with the range to perform both serious and comedic roles. Gifted dramatic actors are a dime a dozen in Hollywood - I defy you to find a comedian who can do the things that Carrey does on screen and who can make audiences laugh with just a look. A rare gem indeed. I didn't go to this movie expecting a deep plot, beautiful cinematography or an award winning screenplay...I went expecting to laugh. And I did, a lot. Thanks to Jim Carrey. While Zellweger and the 3 actors who portrayed Charlie's sons were entertaining enough, Carrey singlehandedly saves this picture and that is enough for me to give it a "thumbs up" recommendation. Jim's done it again!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The worst I have seen in a while</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was by far the worst Jim Carrey movie I have seen. The story had a good beginning, but was given lackluster treatment. The laughs were mediocre (if the viewer was 7-12 years old, they would have laughed their heads off), and the acting was terrible. The only good thing was that I actually fell asleep in the theatre and didn't (thank God) see the ending. If you haven't seen this film yet, DON'T.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>AKA: Jim Carrey's movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a nutshell, this film would be nothing without Jim Carrey. The Farrelly Brothers have the ability to make an audience laugh. They also have the ability to make an audience yawn, waiting for the next laugh. The laughs here are few and far between. Zellwegger's character is so cut-and-dried, it's really hard to care for her at all. One scene where Carrey's thumb is shot off is particularly bad (you can still see his thumb). The Farrelly Brothers should thank their lucky stars they have capable actors handling their material. Cause if they didn't, this stuff wouldn't even qualify as a National Lampoon installment. Bravo to Jim Carrey, though, for alone making this film watchable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Roll Up, Roll Up.... for the one man "Jim Carrey Show!!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hmmmmm. Dubbed as a "Hilarious comedy" and starring Jim Carrey, how could this go wrong? Well, it kind of works, and then again it kind of bites ass.What we have with "Me, Myself &amp; Irene" is a perfect vehicle for the one-man Jim Carrey Show. If theres ever a case of a movie being made to showcase the talent of one person, this is it. Carrey gets to contort his face a billion different ways, combined with his talent for physical and vocal impersonation. Theres no doubting the fact, and it really is obvious, that Carrey IS a funny guy. And thats why this movie can just manage to stay afloat......just.The film centres around Charlie (Carrey), a mild mannered Rhode Island cop with a split-personality disorder. The disorder has stemmed from a disastrous first marriage where his wife cheated and ran away with the towns negro-midget! As a result, Carrey has been left to single-handedly raise his three black sons, while maintaining his waning police career.Charlie finds himself on an assignment to escort a lady (Zellweger) back to her hometown. During the trip and the subsequent run-around (the usual bad-boy ex boyfriend/ conspiracy/ corrupt local cops etc) he finds himself falling in love. However, and this is where the film starts to stand on its own, Charlies alter-ego Hank has also taken to this lovely lass. The battle to win the affections of this confused lady then takes place: Charlie, an over polite, super considerate law abiding gentleman......Hank, a "Dirty Harry" style, foul mouthed, hyper aggressive ladys man.What follows and really flows throughout the film are a string of absolutely wateringly-funny moments. The "Hank" character really is the sort of person a lot of people wish they could be; he tells it like it is, he's cool, he's mean, and he's not afraid to say whatever he damn well pleases! Most of us at one stage or another can identify with him. You really end up waiting for the "Hank" character to appear. Just like Eddie Murphy's alter ego in "The Nutty Professor", the best moments occur in the after transition period between nice guy and jackass."Me, Myself &amp; Irene" will make you laugh, but to sustain laughs at the expense of a decent story or any other remotely interesting characters is another thing altogether. What starts out as an interesting story about a man who's afraid of confrontation is completely lost when the "Cheap Laughs Meter" starts ticking.If your kind of movie is one where you can aimlessly sit through, laugh at the right places and not worry about anything else... this is for you. If on the other hand you'd like a light smattering of storyline, plot and creativity in a film... well, you've been warned. Leave the brain at home and set your sense of humour to "Toilet"!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Obviously the Farrelly Brothers had a lot to live up to after hitting the mark so well in "Dumb &amp; Dumber" and "There's Something About Mary", not to mention the often overlooked "Kingpin". But this offering seemed a little contrived. The Farelly's were trying to deliver on what was expected of them, plenty of afronts to polite society. But what was missed here was that maybe it wasn't simply the offensive nature of the previous films which made them popular, it was that the audience could relate to them, like regulars in a pub. The scenario here of Carrey as a pushover policeman and father to some kids from South Central was unbelievable and was so ridiculous and far-fetched that the film instantly lost it's credibility and the lame gags didn't carry the movie."Dumb &amp; Dumber" for instance worked on a theme that is classic to relate too, two down &amp; outs ,with hopeless prospects are against the world go on a cross-country road trip to return a briefcase full of stolen money, it had elements of satire, witty one-liners ,appealingly exaggerated caricatures and was sparkled with crude comedy just at the right moment, but now that ethos has dumbed down to this. A highly unimaginative, unrealistic scenario , that tried to pitch in all the right Farelly Elements but failed miserably. Jim Carrey is the schizophrenic with dual personalities that became two characters in the film, but the theme of Schizophrenia is simplified to such an extent that it simply does not hold any ground. So this time the current round of taboos being broken won't be so easily forgiven, as the film probably won't win a lot of sympathy with some people.</fullReview>

For the mindless, it is perhaps funny, but to those of us in the frightening world of reality, it doesn't fly. Those Farelly boys should definitely try their hands and some adult comedy. The only positive thing to say about this film, is that it's only 1 1/2 hrs. and there's no "hair gel" involved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jim Carrey returns to the Farrelly Brothers fold after appearing in their Dumb and Dumber. Between that one and this one, the Farrellys grossed us out with There's Something About Mary."Irene" is not as good as the two mentioned above. It has its moments of gross out comedy that Peter and Bobby Farrelly have made their trademarks. Such as Carrey trying to put a cow out of its misery, Carrey getting his own back on his neighbour who has let his dog foul Carrey's garden and Rene Zellweger telling Carrey's good guy character, Charlie, how she and Carrey's bad guy character, Hank, used a dildo the night before.Let me explain, in case you've been on Mars recently, Me, Myself and Irene is about a Rhode Island cop, Charlie Baileygates, who creates a mean alter ego, Hank, to help him cope with confrontation. Unless Charlie keeps taking his pills, his split personality comes into play!Its going to get to a point soon where the Farrelly Brothers will have no more taboo subjects to confront head on - what will they do then?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'd say that overall, this movie was terrible. There were a couple of small parts in it that really made me lose my composure, quite pleasantly, but there were also long stretches where I found myself looking around the theater. That's never a good sign. Most decent movies I see, I don't even realize I'm IN a movie theater, from the beginning credits to the end of the movie. I rate this one as a mediocre video rental. Luckily, I saw it at the dollar theater.This movie did not allow itself to be held back or impeded by politically correct studio people who were afraid of the audience's possible reaction, which is always laudable; but I did not find most of the shock gags to be that great. It was a case of some shock humor attempts that just weren't that funny. Maybe I'm just not easily shocked.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Given the audience reaction, this is a love-it-or-hate-it movie (about ten people walked out, the rest, including me, howled and shrieked with laughter). Jim Carrey plays a State Trooper with multiple personality disorder. His one personality is a rough, aggressive person, releasing the pent-up feelings of the other personality, a kind, lovable door-mat character. Both of them fall in love with Irene, forming a love-triangle with only two people. The real treat of this movie is Jim Carrey, without whom it would be a fairly limp effort. Not Carrey as the comedian from his early movies, but an incredibly inventive performer - for the second half of the film most of the audience are riveted just to see what he will do next.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, I'm not a conservative person. I support an artist's right to say/do what he/she wants, in the name of artistic expression or free speech. That being said, I thought Me Myself and Irene was ONE OF THE WORST MOVIES I HAVE EVER SEEN! The plot,of course, isn't believable. Hey, no problem, it's a comedy. But it's so weak that no amount of farting will save it. If you enjoy fart jokes, and seeing a dog take a c**p on camera (i.e., if you have the maturity of a 12 year old) you would like this film. I did like the three sons element. I would like to have seen a bit more done with those characters. Renee Zellweger has to be one of the worst modern actresses around. She has one emotion-the squinty-eyed, trying to look serious look. And Jim Carey: He did a nice job in Truman Show, which is why I went to this movie. I thought, with Truman, that maybe he had some acting ability and the ability to pick a good script. But here, he proved me wrong.</fullReview>

And the longer the movie runs, the more it starts to crash on its own weight.That said, this movie also has a definite charm to it (asSOMETHING ABOUT MARY) had that makes it an enjoyable view. The Jim Carrey character is nicely done, and especially the first 15 minutes build up his characterperfectly. Everything about this movie makes you believethat the makers simply had fun making it.

For all it's bad points (Charlie, over-emphasised plot, an over-serious dwarf.) it's good points (the genius loudmouth triplets, Whitey, Hank shows up) just save it. If you come looking for the auteur work of the Farelly's, you'll be dissapointed. It just isn't stupid enough. If you want intellectual enterainment, watch the Coen brothers or Being John Malkovich. If you want a time-filling, pleasing comedy, Me, Myself and Irene does it's job (Like the over-rated There's Something About Mary.) The Farellys are swiftly becoming a one-trick pony. Their next film has to be a hit, or they'll look Dumb And Dumber.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into this movie with high expectations. Firstly, I am a big Carrey fan who has seen all his films, and secondly I loved Dumb and Dumber and There's Something about Mary, so this film was a must see. I was not disappointed. After a slightly low opening and long credit section the action soon began to flow, with great visual gags and some clever comedy devices used throughout. Jim Carrey was excellent, using his exceptional slap-stick and rubber face to great effect. I couldn't have picked someone who could have beat themselves up as convincingly as him. He did not hog the limelight however, as the supporting cast were also outstanding. His three "sons" were very good, and made me laugh on their own, and Irene was very beautiful "girl next door", without super model looks.(I hate that saying as well, but it really does apply here) The plot was weak, but hey who needs a plot when there is poo, chicken and dildo gags aplenty?! Not me, thats for sure.Altogether a great film, and a fun evening out, don't listen to the reviews about the poor plot lines or unbelievable story, just put some laughter in your life for gods sake!!!!Cheers Neil</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crude humour, but good film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The humour is admittedly very crude and the chicken up the a** is only one of the more glaring examples. However, the fact that the policeman said he'd kill their father when he sets eye on him is much more offensive. In contrast to "The Nutty Professor" (one of my "worst ever" films) I didn't feel offended by this film. On the contrary, the Farrelly brothers simply used the subversive power of humour here with a sound ethical edge (unlike the above Eddie Murphy film). The humour that goes with likeable Charlie is totally different to the humour that goes with partly funny, but basically annoying Hank and it's Charlie who wins. I also liked Charlie's boys. This blend of good boys ("Give Daddy a kiss!") and rap artists with foul language which is mirrored in Charlie is quite hilarious. I'm amazed that anyone can read this as "racial slur". I once saw a talk show with a handicapped man (" whatever challenged") who pointed out that handicapped people also make jokes about handicaps (like the Jews themselves had many jokes about Jews in concentration camps). It's usually their official representatives and non-handicapped people who complain. The people who demand PC in such cases, don't understand what humour is all about. Not only what is said is important, but also how it is said, the submerged attitude. I used to not like Jim Carrey but since "The Truman Show" I've changed my mind. There are more shades to his performance than I used to notice.</fullReview>

Some parts of it were funny, but overall it was very disappointing. And don't make the mistake of taking preteens to see this movie -- I saw several families at the matinee showing with 10 and 12 year-old kids, and I have to say I was embarrassed by the crude humor in this movie (the little girl in front of me was giggling at the dildo jokes -- I bet her mother had a lot of explaining to do about that one!)Rating: 4 out of 10, only because Renee Zellweger is in it, and the closing credits are pretty cute.</fullReview>

Cussing, violence and crude sexuality hang loose in this movie, but at a balance which keeps you safely laughing in your seat while gasping from unexpected situations. Even if you yawn at the idea of a chicken-up-the-butt joke, this comes into its own given the right situation (and believe me, it is!).Yet another movie that could only be played by Jim Carrey, and quite perfectly so.Recommended viewing.

I think the start of the film is kind of promising, where you get a sense of the movie taking on a somewhat serious subject in a funny way. But it's mostly downhill from that. I do think the scene with the chauffeur in the beginning is funny, and Jim Carreys three gangsta intellectual sons also has a funny edge. Apart from that I was disappointed.

		<shortDescription>The Curse of the Farrelly Bros.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only reason this movie got a 4 from me instead of a 1 or a 2 is because it features Jim Carrey in all his comic brilliance. Love him or hate him, you've got to admit that this guy is an absolute master of his own body.I have the same beef with this movie as I do with Nutty 2. Both Carrey and Eddie Murphy are comic geniuses--why on earth do they need to resort to bottom-of-the-barrel humor?!? That's for hacks like the Farrelly (sp?) Bros. who couldn't come up with real comedy to save their lives (Kingpin *did* have its moments, though). Liar, Liar was a fantastic film, as was Nutty Professor I. And how about Murphy in Bowfinger? Absolute brilliance! Why oh why do we keep paying the Farrelly Bros. and all their imitators to keep churning out these stomach-churning wastes of celluloid?!? They must have us all under a spell or something. I didn't know Irene was a Farrelly movie, or I wouldn't have gone to see it. I left the theatre that night feeling dirty and disgusted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gone in twenty minutes...Does this movie goes too far?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I seldom ever walk out on movies. I left this one after twenty minutes. I heard that Jim Carrey had a lot of creative input in this one so I thought, "This could be comic genius." I was really disappointed. I think this movie goes TOO far and tries too hard to be funny. So much so that it is awkward, not to mention offensive. It's not only the verbal offense that made me leave, it was the graphic offense: sexual, crude, racist, violent. It's overdone. I got the impression as I listened to the responses of people in the audience that night that most of what I saw wasn't really funny. Things can be terribly crude, but if they are clever, they get a good laugh and are at least appreciated. What I viewed was not clever. It was almost as if the writers thought I was a five year old kid who would start giggling helplessly at the use of the word "diarrhea" . There was quite a bit of entertainment shock value, I guess. But if that's all there is to it, then why not open up the newspaper and have a good laugh at sex, racism, crime, and violence that already exists? It's just not funny. I apologize if I have not done the movie justice, having only seen the first 20 minutes, I don't think my opinion would have changed for the better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Totally tasteless, sledgehammer wit, more stereotypes than you can poke a stick at, politically incorrect .... and brilliant for it.After putting in deeper performances for "The Truman Show" and "Man on the Moon", Jim Carrey obviously wanted a bit of light relief and looks as if he enjoyed every minute. His boys gave a whole new slant on "My Three Sons".Many have thrown their hands up in horror. But they're probably the types who drone on about the brilliance of a 'Tarantino' or a 'Kubrick' just because they think they must, when really they hated every minute of the nasty gratuitous violence or the endless hours where nothing happens. If you want depth and intricate plotlines, don't look to the Farrelly Brothers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Someone has to tell Jim Carrey that simply pulling faces won't wash any more. Here he basically does a 'Mask' without the mask, and it's painful to watch him straining to try to squeeze laughs out of situations which are just not funny. Of course, he's not directly responsible for the crass script and treatment, ('Mary' had its crude moments but won us over with a lovely dash of charm - 'Irene' is as charmless as you could possible get), but I wonder whether an actor with less idiosyncratic baggage might not have been able to carry it off. As for the film per se, well, if you think dildos and anal soreness are intrinsically funny, then this is probably the film for you. Me? I smiled once.</fullReview>

Jim interacts with himself in the most amazing ways and you can immediately tell when he's Hank and when he's Charlie. Only he could pull off this movie. Most people will probably hate it, just like they did the Cable Guy, but the true Jim fans are in for a treat. Even if you don't like Carrey, Charlie Bailygates' three boys are reason enough to see Me, Myself &amp; Irene.</fullReview>

For 2 hours, we are bombarded with racial stereotypes, disgusting language, tasteless jokes and some scenes that would make Larry Flynt blush(i.e.--the price check at the supermarket on a woman's hygiene product.) I wonder how much longer American comedy will aspire to the lowest common denominator for cheap laughs. Perhaps as long as we refuse to acknowledge the superiority of one set of morals over another.

		<fullReview>Ok, I am a huge Jim Carrey fan.. Since he was on In Living Color, and I greatly enjoy his films.. And I think Jim Carrey and the Farrelly brothers are all real talented and have a great gift for comedy. When I saw the trailer for this movie, I thought it would be just as funny (if not funnier) than Dumb &amp; Dumber or There's something about Mary, but the comedy didn't even come close.Sure, there are some funny parts but not enough to actually laugh at loud. I must say that Jim Carrey's talent was so waisted in this movie that the minor characters(especially- The Limo Driver, the three kids,and Whitey) actually held the movie together.All in All- I hope this wont be the last Jim Carrey movie by the Farralley brothers, but I hope THIS IS THE WORST..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a straight, nonsensical comedy starring the master of facial expressions, Jim Carrey. On the same vein as "Dumb and Dumber" and "There's something about Mary" (all of them by the Farrelly brothers), I found this movie to be a humorous "Fight Club". In fact, I liked a lot more how the conflict of multiple personalities is handled on this movie; the ending, actually, made a bit more sense (though it would be impossible to say this movie is better than Fight Club).The Farrelly brothers are to movies what Trey Parker is to animation: both spend most of their time aiming for the limit of what audiences might stand in front of a screen. Personally, I prefer the Farrely brothers, but it is surely a matter of taste (or lack of it). Be sure to go with your best friends, and get ready to laugh yourself silly over this one.

		<shortDescription>Carrey does a good job, but humor wears out fast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, the good stuff: Jim Carrey does a great job in this movie. He's really the only actor who could've played this role. He's a genius at physical comedy which definitely comes in handy in a movie like Me, Myself and Irene. However, he hasn't been given much to work with. Sure, there's plenty of sick jokes to keep the average 12 year old boy entertained (if he can get into the theater), but for everyone else, the humor wears out. It's based solely on shock value, which goes away when you get used to it. The difference between this movie and a movie like There's Something About Mary (the Farrely Bros. last film) is that Something About Mary had heart, in addition to the gross-out humor. It was a movie that could gross-you out, but still had some charm to it. Me Myself and Irene, however, is a relentless barrage of this gross-out humor, with none of the endearing qualites of Something About Mary. And resemblance of a plot gets lost behind sick jokes, chickens up the a**, and other stuff like that. The first half of the movie is funny, but after that, it gets old. It's a shame that a talent as great as Jim Carrey is so wasted in this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a really funny movie. The laughs really come in bunches in this film. The scene where Carrey's character goes nuts and makes a rather risque announcement over the supermarket loudspeaker, then harasses a nine year old who had previously disrespected him, then ends up in a rather weird situation with a nursing mother (don't ask) and drives the car through the window of the barber shop was classical. Also whenever he was talking Ebonics....very funny (don't make me hafta bust a cap). I found some of those scenes with the big black guys mildly offensive and racist though. I don't see why it should be funny just for those guys to talk how they usually do. I mean, they were funny, but to put them in a movie and basically mock them for talking the way they do....I dunno. I was laughing but I was also like, I dunno about this. Still, the movie was hysterical. I don't think it's as funny as There's Something About Mary, but it wasn't far off. And I don't think this is as good as Dumb and Dumber, the Ace Ventura movies or Liar Liar, but it is certainly hysterical in places and well worth the price of admission.</fullReview>

Unlike South Park, which I might see again if I am desperate for a good laugh, I felt that this movie went overboard. For those of you who are wondering what I am talking about, picture a movie with the shock factor of South Park with the nonstop foul language of a black comedy and the mind of a pervert who has this fetish with sex toys...and you have a glimpse of what "Me, Myself, and Irene" is all about. I don't care if it is funny, I didn't pay good money to see 3 minutes of nonstop footage of a guy with a chicken shoved up his rear end. I also thought the foul language was totally unnecessary, especially since most of it came from the three black actors who played the three sons.AVOID AT ALL COST!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Going to the movie I thought knew exactly what I was going to see. Unfortunately, it was worst than expected. There was the obvious typical Carrey comedy, wild facial expressions, and physical humor, but it also seemed there was ALOT of cheap humor. Every other word in the film was "F" this and "F" that just to get a cheap laugh. The movie was not ALL bad, there was the chicken scene (which I never thought would be physically possible) and the cow scene was a plus. Also the 3 sons kept the humor on life support when it really started to lag. My big question is to Jim Carrey.... When is he going to make a film where he doesn't have to rely on the physical aspects of his routine to make a good movie? The Truman show was a good attempt and was heading in the right direction, but just as soon as you see him in a different light,,,,, there he goes, right back to his same old routine.  </fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw this movie tonight, and I was quite impressed. Jim Carrey turned in an amazing performance, one of his greatest since Liar Liar.Carrey plays Charlie Baileygates, a Rhode Island State Trooper who marries, then becomes a father under unusual circumstances, because she has an affair with the black midget limo driver who thinks that Charlie offends him. Then she has three black babies. That freaked me out a little, but I was hysterical!Enter Irene, played by Rene Zellwegger. She is being persued by cops, mainly because of her boyfriend, who is out to get her for what she knows. So Charlie has to protect her.But, Charlie develops "Hank", a personality who fights battles for Charlie, who is gentle. "Hank" doesn't care what he does, and is convinced that he can do what he wants. The only way "Hank" can be controlled is by special pills. But unfortunately, Charlie forgets them in a hotel, and all the fun ensues.The thing I found classic about this film was that Charlie would come back, and not know what happened. If damage was done, he wouldn't understand. Some of his actions as "Hank" were classic Carrey.The scene with the struggle between "Hank" and Charlie for control of Charlie's body were something out of "All of Me," when Steve Martin attempted to control his own body, when Lily Tomlin was inside. I don't know why many people found this film offensive. the portrayl of schizophrenics is not offensive in any way. People shouldn't complain about a movie that's meant to make the audience laugh.I enjoyed this film, and anyone else who saw it would agree. See this movie. Your "friend" will thank you later.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With their lazy, taboo-touching brilliance, the Farrelly Brothers have always been hit the mark. Transposing their oddball characters and clever observations of everyday insecurities onto successful formulaic plots, their every effort has been a winner. So when they swaggered to the top of the table with THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY (after the equally outrageous KINGPIN cruelly bombed), everybody cheered.Unfortunately, ME MYSELF AND IRENE is more EIGHT HEADS IN A DUFFEL BAG than anything they've directed before. That is, it's a Farrelly clone. Time after time they try to offer a new slant on the devices that worked so well in MARY (animal cruelty, disabilities, sexual experimentation), but it feels forced, as if they're compelled to repeat the old tricks, despite previously tearing up the rule book.This film begs for a clever marketing campaign to fool an audience it is worth watching. Gone are the loveable goofs we're accustomed to in Farrelly films. Carrey gets carte blanche to retread tired old Jerry Lewis gags (he beats himself up a la LIAR LIAR), and Zellweger proves she is not a comedy actress. Other established actors like Chris Cooper and Robert Forster have nothing to do at all. Clumsy scenes go on too long, and the times in between jokes seem like an eternity. It raises a laugh from time to time, but so what? ME MYSELF AND IRENE is a predictable cash-in, it's appeal comes in familiarity at best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Farrelly Brothers struck laughter in the hearts of comedy-lovers everywhere with their hilarious debut "Dumb &amp; Dumber" a few years back. "Kingpin" followed soon after, which in this writer's opinion was the funniest movie they have made to date. "There's Something About Mary" guaranteed more laughs, yet was able to change plotlines to include romance without suffering from any loss of humor in context. All three films were hilarious, at times crude, yet from beginning to end offered non-stop hilarity sure to send anyone into fits of laughter."Me, Myself &amp; Irene" is the Farrelly's next attempt, but unfortunately, does not offer the non-stop laughs of the first three films. The jokes are at times very predictable and the script suffers from a shortage of _new_ routines. (We've all seen those same Jim Carrey faces before, and the racial overtones get overtly run into the ground -- fast.) Also, the Carrey multiple personality-disorder routine is only seen by the audience a few times -- with such great possibilities for this funny idea, why is it so limited to scenes which produce dialog that isn't so funny?I was a bit disappointed in this movie. Having had such high hopes after seeing the other work by the Farrelly's, I was very excited, but after watching it, felt as though this movie was _missing_ something. It has a decent enough plotline. The believability of the situations in stretched in great Farrelly style. And, the casting is up to par. So what isn't? The humor. The Brothers tried. Unfortunately, the jokes just didn't seem to be there. Hopefully they'll be back in their next flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having loved (in a rather embarrassed fashion) both "Dumb &amp; Dumber" and "There's Something About Mary", and really enjoying "Kingpin", I must admit I was expecting a lot from this movie. Needless to say, I didn't get a lot. Or even quite a bit. Or much of anything, really. There are two big laughs, they're widely spaced, half the jokes are merely vaguely amusing, and the other half, while not quite dead on arrival, lays there and coughs up blood.Part of the problem is that the usually reliable Jim Carrey spends half the movie playing a character who simply isn't funny; not because of anything so whiny as insensitivity to mental illness, but because it's nothing more than an over-the-top imitation of Dirty Harry. While this might have worked for about ten minutes, it gets old very fast at feature-length.The other problem, curiously, is that the directors famous for going too far seem to take the same tactic as their other work in hitting taboo targets, but they do so rather tamely. If they'd pushed some of this stuff as far as "Mary" did with cripple jokes, for instance, they might have pulled it off. But really, albino jokes? How many people out there are sensitive about albino references?A 5, at best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Me, Myself and Irene is the funniest movie I have seen seen South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut. Outrageously raunchy, but good- natured to the core, Irene is the best thing Jim Carrey has ever done. Carrey is perfect as Charlie, a mild- mannered Rhode Island State trooper who has been so greviously wronged by his cheating ex- wife that he develops a second personality to embody his rage. This second personality is Hank, a violent, sexual and impulsive jerk who acts out against all the people who treat Charlie like doormat.The script to Irene has none of the lulls that many Farelly scripts often have (I found Something About Mary to be very draggy) and instead is constructed so that every wild visual gag comes organically from the story and never feels gratuitous. This film is also the most technically accomplished Farelly film, with good supporting performances by a solid cast. Renee Zellweger is charming as Irene. Many critics have complained that her performance in this is one note, but I disagree. She is beguiling throughout and holds her own with Carrey, scene for scene.The Farrelly's have done something unique with Irene. They have taken the compassionate all- American idealism of Frank Capra and married it seamlessly with the white trash comic excesses of John Waters to make a movie that even your mother could love.Okay, maybe not. But I sure did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazed at the ignorance of parents!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie and found it to be entertaining in an obscene way. I'm sure that you have heard every angle and take on the movie from all the other comments, so I won't waste your time repeating what has already been said. What I will say is that I am COMPLETELY disgusted at the total lack of judgement that parents are using when taking their children to see movies now. I would really like to know what in God's name these people are thinking taking 8-15 year old children to see movies with an "R" rating. I mean COME ON!!!! These movies are rated "R" STRICTLY because the content SHOULD NOT be seen unless you are age 17. People wonder why little children run around now swearing and making vulgar comments all the time. Maybe because parents don't have enough common sense to not allow their kids to hear mother f**ker 25 times in a movie. Like this genius user at the bottom of this page. They had the nerve to take their kids to see this movie, KNOWING it is rated "R" but felt it was ok for their children (ages 9!!!! and 12) to hear the "F" word said a hundred times, several obscene stunts (that poor chicken) and several sexually crude jokes, but the only thing that really offended them was the bit with the dildo. A direct quote:"If that one item had been scraped from the script, then I wouldn't feel like such a bad parent for allowing my nine and twelve year old to see this movie. I could explain a lot to a child, but how do I explain it when my son asks me what she meant by saying "It was for you"? One badly placed prop ruined my evening, my view of Jim Carrey, and my respect for 20th Century Fox."It's just sad when a parent feels that the "F" word every few minutes and several vulgar jokes and comments are acceptable in their minds for their 9 year old child. And then has the nerve to blame the actor and the company that produced the movie. I have an idea....."HOOCH" put the blame where it should be...ON YOURSELF!!! Maybe next time you will have enough common sense to not take your poor 9 year old child to a movie that he/she shouldn't see for another 8 YEARS!!!! Don't blame the actor or the company....you were forewarned that it wasn't to be seen by your kids until they are 17. That's why it was rated "R".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jim Carrey fans maybe in for a shock, in this film he departs from his rated PG, sanitized for families brand of comedy we have all become accustomed to. If you liked "There's Something About Mary or "American Pie" this grossout, slapstick flick will be a walk in the park. Racial stereotypes, sexual innuendos, and a well placed chicken all keep the loose yet wacky plot on course. Renee Zellwegger seems comfortable playing the "girlfriend" yet again, (minus the cute Jerry Maguire kid) This movie was a hoot, no stretch for Jim Carrey, whose physical antics support the script. Personally I think he needed a comedy, I mean, did anyone really like the Cable Guy?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I consider the Farrelly brothers movies a guilty pleasure, the kind of thing you don't want to admit enjoying. They do have a way, though, of amusing small minds like mine, and Me, Myself, and Irene was no different. While the PC commandos will no doubt be out in force (yeah, I know, multiple personality disorder is NOT schizophrenia- give it a rest already, willya?), you can find plenty to enjoy in this movie if you just relax and put your brain on pause for a couple hours. Jim Carrey's contortions are amazing, and almost painful to watch- and for once he doesn't spend most of the movie just mugging for the camera. Renee Zellweger is charming and attractive, in an unconventional way, and the rest of the cast is effective. However, the actors playing Charlie's "sons" stole the show, with their obscenely hilarious Chris Rock/Stephen Hawking vibe. And I also loved the cameos by sports stars Brendan Shanahan, Cam Neely, and Anna Kournikova. I liked this movie- just don't tell anybody.</fullReview>

I was personally surprised to see Jim Carrey in a movie like this; I just thought that he would take one look at the sceenplay and say "no way." I took my girlfriend to this movie, expecting a nice, funny movie (like the trailers seemed to indicate). Instead we got an excess of gross humor that seemed to be aimed at out doing American Pie. There are a few funny parts to the movie, but for the most part it is filled with no-brainer, sick, quick laughs.</fullReview>

I found it embarrassing but I have to admit I laughed at many of the jokes. Some were even borderline pornographic. The triplets did not work for me.

		<shortDescription>What were you expecting? Plot?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I suspect there are a few too many people out there who failed to realise that when you combine the minds behind There's Something About Mary and the talents of Jim Carrey you are almost inevitably headed towards less-than-subtle humour territory. If you were mad enough to go into this film looking for character or plot, you need your head read.There's no doubt that this movie will only appeal to those who are looking for a commitment-free laugh. But if you are willing to stop treating the film like Shakespeare and just roll with the film as it goes, rest assured you will not leave disappointed. Sure the jokes are at times anywhere from gross to silly, but if you're there to judge the film incessantly there's no way you can enjoy it. Sit back, and don't be afraid to laugh at whatever comes your way.Carrey is superb as the schizo Charlie/Hank character - I think it's a real pity we don't see a little more of his physical performance as the two personalities try to attack each other in the second half of the film. He is a truly gifted physical performer. Zellweger was passable, but as others have said the surprise package really is Charlie's three kids. Their scripts are first-rate.Don't let the critics tell you this is a bad flick - they're trained to write about elements this movie neither has nor needs. Just go in to the theatre with the right expectations and you will enjoy yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've read some of the other user's comments on this film, and I think that the meaning of comedy has been lost in their reviews. A comedy is meant to make people laugh, that's all. Comedy's aren't graded on their 'message', or their intricate 'plot line'. Comedies are meant to make you laugh.Also, I think you have to take a movie for what's it is...You don't grade 'Young Frankenstien' along side of 'Citizen Kane'. This is a Farrelly brothers film in case people have forgotten they make movies like 'Dumb And Dumber', 'Something About Mary', &amp; 'King Pin'. Movies That make people laugh.This is also a Jim Carrey movie..he makes movies like 'Dumb And Dumber', 'Liar, Liar', and 'The Mask'. Again, movies that make people laugh. So you have to ask yourself when viewing this film, 'Does it make me laugh?' and 'Does it make me laugh a lot?'I think you will find the answer to both these questions to be yes. I've seen this film twice and both times the audience laughed out loud many times throughout the show. If you like Jim Carrey and the Farrelly brothers I don't think you'll be disappointed. Just don't go looking for a 'social message', or great plot twists. Save that for the Academy Award nominated flicks.Just take it for what it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A lot of people are going to complain about this movie because of the extensive "gross-out" humor. To them I say: poo. This is a Jim Carrey movie directed by the Farrelly brothers, what did you expect? I for one am glad that Jim Carrey has gotten his act together after his Robin Williams-like attempt at real acting.As with most of his movies, the real stars of "Irene" are Carrey's facial expressions. He does an amazing job morphing from Charlie, a nice Rhode Island state trooper, to Hank, his evil side. You can tell he was having a blast. The other actors do an admirable job of trying to keep up with him, but obviously are eclipsed, especially Renee Zellweger, whose character I didn't care about in the least and really doesn't have much chemistry with Carrey here, despite the fact that they're now dating.That being said, I can't stress enough how grossly offensive this movie is, especially if you are a lesbian, a midget, an animal-rights activist, a schizophrenic, an albino, and/or a human being with a sense of right and wrong. It's rated 'R' for a reason. This is not a movie for people under the age of 17. Unless you want to be blushing and fidgeting for two hours, do not bring your parents or children to this movie. Otherwise, leave your morals at the door and have a great time.</fullReview>

Me Myself &amp; Irene is a good movie, a funny movie, but if you're expecting another 'Something About Mary', or are not interested in the Farrelly's humor, this is not the movie for you. You should know going in that it will have bathroom humor, offensive jokes, and all that good stuff. However, the use of these jokes is just not as effective as prior movies. The first 20 minutes of this movie are as good as any 20 minutes in any Farrelly movie. I was licking my chops; i couldn't wait to see the rest of it. It's literally all downhill from there.</fullReview>

For example, "Enrico Fermi would be rolling in his grave!" Worth $4.50 alone. The rest is like Dumb and Dumber in many ways as Carey and Zeilwegger are on the lamb. There are some gross things here, but at this point, if you are surprised by that in their movies, YOUR heads been where that chicken was.

		<shortDescription>Very Funny But Some Jokes Fall Flat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As often as I had seen the trailer over the past eight weeks, I still found it funny each time it came on. The two best jokes from the trailer were not in the movie itself. After Renee Zellweger kicks Jim Carrey and he falls down the hill, he pops up briefly in our sightline once more before continuing his descent. The brief pop-up was cut from the actual film. Another scene shows Carrey asking a small child at a diner, "What are you lookin' at, Four-Eyes?". The term 'four-eyes' was replaced in the movie by an unprintable expletive that made the scene far less funny. In fact, a lot of the humor in the movie was undercut by streams of profanity. The more these words are used, the less funny they become. I think profanity can be funny if used sparingly. There was really no substance here in terms of plot. The film was reduced to a series of very funny set pieces masquerading as a coherent storyline. There was nothing shown as to why Zellweger was on the run anyway. Some illegal shenanigans were mentioned, but that's not really a plot device. This is the main thrust that puts the story in motion and we do not know why it is even happening.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those movies where I'm having a hard time putting my finger on why it didn't work for me. It had laughs, sure it did, some big ones, but it could have been so much more.I'll start with Jim Carrey. This guy is good. Ace Ventura aside, this guy can make me laugh. Hell, Cable Guy is one of my top three favorite comedies, and Dumb and Dumber is probably in the top five. I spent the first half-hour anxious for him to go mental (oops, not very PC of me, eh?), and when his "Hank" personality finally shows up, I wanted him to go back to the nice guy. I guess my problem with Hank is that he isn't so much funny as he is... well... gross and nasty. Not to mention that it took me a long time to adjust to the voice Carrey was doing as Hank. Now, gross and nasty is not nearly enough of a reason for me not to like something. South Park: Bigger, Longer, Uncut, There's Something About Mary, American Pie, I sat through all these movies (next to my little sister, no less) and laughed like hell. I didn't feel any discomfort during those movies, but I did during this one. And when I wasn't feeling uncomfortable at what was happening on the screen, the rest of the audiance was, which, in turn, made me uncomfortable. Does that make sense? Okay, just stick with me here for a minute. The cow scene (that's all that needs to be said for those that have seen the movie). As I was watching it I was laughing loud and hard at the expense of the poor animal, and then I realized, to my surprise, that I was the only one in the theatre laughing. My little sister next to me lets out this little, "Aww...". My point is, there are many of these kinds of uncomfortable silences in this movie, and that's not a good thing for a comedy.Many of the jokes just don't work. I wish they did, but they don't. But at the same time, I laughed a lot during the movie, so I'm torn. I guess I expected so much more form the re-teaming of the Farrely brothers and Carrey. Maybe my expectations were too high. So often it seems like the film makers are screaming at us, "Look at this! Can you believe what we're doing? Aren't we outrageous?", and just being shocking isn't enough, it needs more laughs. This is easily the most offensive comedy I have ever seen (not counting the Pauly Shore collection of gems). That alone should make the movie worth seeing, I just wish it was funnier. 6/10 stars. G'night!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Farrelly brothers movies have always been infantile and gross, but there was always an insistent core of decency. In Kingpin and Mary the situations were extreme, ridiculous, and most importantly hilarious, but the characters somehow felt more "real" than in other comedies. They weren't just there for a gag, to get injured just because it's funny. There was some kind of purpose. A reason for the madness. I don't know how to explain it, but it was always there. Dumb and Dumber was the one Farrelly movie where it drifted more towards the regular comedy style or characters just being funny, and who really cares whether they win or they're happy or whatever. But there still was a hint of that decency. In Irene, you can kiss all that decency and "real"-ness goodbye. There isn't one character in the movie that doesn't feel like a movie character. Y'know, a character in the movie that exists simply to move the movie along. Maybe it was the pace of the movie, that felt totally sped up compared to the relaxed storytelling style of the other 3 movies. It's as if the Farrellys started doubting whether the audience could sit in a theatre for 5 minutes without an obvious joke running by. Too much build up is bad, but not enough build up is JUST AS BAD! I really wish writers and directors would figure that out. A proper build up to a joke makes a joke seem 10 times as funny. And the chicken and the thumb thing were just way too much. On paper the chicken thing would seem like a great idea, but when you actually see it.... it's just not funny. It feels too much like a joke that's obviously meant to shock you. And the gun thing. Why would I think it's funny that the main character of the movie gets hurt? Not just a scrape or a bruise, I mean life-altering hurt. That just did not fit the tone of the entire movie. It came out of the blue, like an afterthought and not like a clever surprise. Renee Zellweger is definitely cute, but they didn't give her much else to do but... look cute. Too bad. Jim Carrey's always funny, but he's always out of control too. Maybe in another movie the Farrellys would've reigned him in a little, but they're out of control in the movie too, so how could they? There are a lot of laughs, so it's worth watching, but I naturally expected more from the movie. The only genuine, unexpected, and satisfying laugh I had was when Whitey was talking about his family. That was a moment of understated, twisted, comic genius. But from the Farrellys I expected more than just one of those. I hope this isn't the beginning of the fall for them.</fullReview>

Dumb and Dumber was the one Farrelly movie where it drifted more towards the regular comedy style or characters just being funny, and who really cares whether they win or they're happy or whatever. But there still was a hint of that decency. In Irene, you can kiss all that decency and "real"-ness goodbye. There isn't one character in the movie that doesn't feel like a movie character. Y'know, a character in the movie that exists simply to move the movie along. Maybe it was the pace of the movie, that felt totally sped up compared to the relaxed storytelling style of the other 3 movies. It's as if the Farrellys started doubting whether the audience could sit in a theatre for 5 minutes without an obvious joke running by. Too much build up is bad, but not enough build up is JUST AS BAD! I really wish writers and directors would figure that out. A proper build up to a joke makes a joke seem 10 times as funny. And the chicken and the thumb thing were just way too much. On paper the chicken thing would seem like a great idea, but when you actually see it.... it's just not funny. It feels too much like a joke that's obviously meant to shock you. And the gun thing. Why would I think it's funny that the main character of the movie gets hurt? Not just a scrape or a bruise, I mean life-altering hurt. That just did not fit the tone of the entire movie. It came out of the blue, like an afterthought and not like a clever surprise. Renee Zellweger is definitely cute, but they didn't give her much else to do but... look cute. Too bad. Jim Carrey's always funny, but he's always out of control too. Maybe in another movie the Farrellys would've reigned him in a little, but they're out of control in the movie too, so how could they? There are a lot of laughs, so it's worth watching, but I naturally expected more from the movie. The only genuine, unexpected, and satisfying laugh I had was when Whitey was talking about his family. That was a moment of understated, twisted, comic genius. But from the Farrellys I expected more than just one of those. I hope this isn't the beginning of the fall for them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ONE OF THE FUNNIEST MOVIES OF ALL TIME! A COMEDIC CLASSIC.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, lets get something straight, this is no Oscar contender or something like that, this is a movie that your not suppose to take seriousely. The point of a comedy is to make people laugh,and this movie does that just as well as any other comedy classic. I'm sick and tired of people knocking comedies like this because it doesn't have an award winning plot or whatever. I went to this movie to laugh and see Jim Carrey. I was not dissapointed in any way, because i laughed my ass off. I have read a lot of the reviews about this movie, both from critics and from user comments, and i have to say that i am dissapointed in their view of the film. If you have a problem with the type of humer that this movie has, that's one thing, but to knock the movie because it lacks a great plot is stupid. To tell you the truth, i am glad that this movie didnt have a complex plot, because i dont want to have to think and figure things out when i go see a comedy. I hope that people stop picking on movies like this and just accept them for what they are worth, and that is grade A comedy. ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Farrelly brothers are now the famous comedy team working in Hollywood. Were Mel Brooks was in the '70's and the Zucker brothers and Jim Abarham were in the '80's, now the Farrelly bothers are for the 90's. Now being the new millennium, the Farrelly's try to keep atop of the comedy list with their new film, ME, MYSELF, &amp; IRENE. And this time, they brought back their DUMB &amp; DUMBER star Jim Carrey for the ride. IRENE is about Charlie, a patrolman for the Rhode Island police. He is a simple kind of man, a friendly and non-violent type. The kind of man who likes to have backyard barbecue and watch Gomer Pyle. Then on his wedding day, his new bride is attracted to the chauffeur driver, and when she gives birth to triplets, all three babies have, well... as one of Charlie's friends put it, "year round tans." Then Charlie's wife leave him for the chauffeur driver, and to take care of the three young lads by himself. Years later, Charlie is the father of three HUGE men, but they still do care for each other. However, most of the people in town take advantage of Charlie's kindness. Causing him to breakdown and have a alter ego, named Hank. Hank is the evil side of Charlie, doing outrageous things that most people wouldn't do. This causes Charlie's cheif (Robert Forster) to plan on letting Charlie go because his schizophrenia is a "walking insurance claim." But befoe Charlie is released, he is to escort a woman name Irene (Renee Zellweger) back to upstate New York for a hit and run accident. On the journey to New York, Irene discovers the true self of Charlie and Hank, while federal agents (Chris Cooper &amp; Richard Jenkins) are after Charlie and Irene, claming that they are dangerous criminals. I have enjoyed all of the Farrelly films. DUMB &amp; DUMBER was one of two Jim Carrey movies that I enjoyed before TRUMAN SHOW. KINGPIN was funny, and underrated. And THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY was also funny, but slightly overrated. IRENE is just as funny as the previous films, but there is gross humor a plenty in this film. I was laughing my head off during some of the scenes, and other scenes were just disgusting to watch. Carrey is the ideal person to play Charlie/Hank. If anybody could play a schizophrenic well, it's Carrey. Carrey distinguishes a good difference between the kind and gentle Charlie, to the roudy and crude Hank. I also enjoyed the three sons played by Anthony Anderson, Jerod Mixon, and Mongo Brownleer. They were hilarious as the jive talking sons of Carrey's character. But what bothered me about IRENE is that where MARY was slow in some parts, IRENE doesn't have a complete plot. The plot with Irene, her former boss, and the federal agents isn't discussed well enough. And it also doesn't come to much of a conclusion. Anyways, this is a comedy, and what the Farrelly's want to deliver is laughs, and that they deliver. IRENE is not as funny as CHICKEN RUN or ROAD TRIP, but it's a lot funnier than BIG MOMMA and READY TO RUMBLE (I should stop critcizing those two films). All and all IRENE is funny, but it does pay with a price of watching disgusting things. **** (out of five)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Three huge laughs, the rest just ok...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me say first off I think Dumb and Dumber, Kingpin, and There's Something About Mary are brilliant. I even read Peter Farrelly's books Outside Providence and The Comedy Writer (which, by the way, if that ever gets made into a movie I'll be first in line). I think the Farrelly brothers are crude, rude, and hilarious. Therefore, I am sorry to say that I though Me, Myself, and Irene was somewhat of a disappointment. As I told a friend, it has three moments of bring yourself to tears laughs (for me: the first Hank sequence, the wounded cow, and Charlie's morning-after trip to the bathroom). The rest was worth a rental at best. Too bad, Jim Carrey's Charlie/Hank acting job is phenomenal, and Renee Zellweger is cute too. I couldn't believe they used a narrator a la Dukes of Hazzard and the three kids annoyed me most times instead of making me laugh. I'm giving this a trepidatious 8 for those three scenes and Carrey's acting. But if you think those three scenes suck, you're going to want your money back.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>********* POSSIBLE SPOILERS ************Expecting to see a movie of Dumb and Dumber quality, I was somewhat disappointed. I'm not offended by any type of humor, no matter how sick as long as it's funny, and the laughs here are just too far and few between. Jim Carey was born to play this role and I'm sure the Farrelly brothers wrote it with him in mind, but the supporting characters and the storyline is so weak it really detracts from Carey's performance.A lot of reviewers say that the trio that play Carey's sons steal the movie...I don't know why they say that. Are black geniuses, swearing funny?....not here. The concept is good, but it wears real thin after only a few minutes. This movie has taken a lot of heat for poking fun at things like schizophrenia and albino's. I don't see what the big deal is here. I would think an adult holding a child's head under water and calling them f***face would cause a bigger furor.I gave this movie a vote of 6 of 10 strictly on the basis of Jim Carey's performance. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first disappointing Jim Carey movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie two weeks ago on a sneak preview showing here in my area. Probably the 2nd most movie I was anticipating for the summer next to the X-MEN release. I left the theater feeling disgusted that Jim Carey had signed onto such a horrible script. As usual, the Farrelly brothers have stooped to an even lower level which, in my mind, has brought even lower or fewer laughs. I personally am not schizophrenic but for those people in this world that are, I feel sorry that they would have to be subjected to being labeled as bad as this movie seems to label the illness. There were some points in the movie that I felt the "Dumb and Dumber" humor again but mostly it was a sad attempt at making audiences roll out of their seats. When the movie was over, there was an eerie silence in the almost packed theater that I was in. I think this movie will remain a good rental a local video store when it's first released but eventually will only be collecting dust in several years in the Comedy section.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely the Least of the Farrelly Brother Flicks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(A COUPLE OF SPOILERS AHEAD!)I didn't hate Me, Myself &amp; Irene, but I thought a lot of the toilet humor, which the Farrelly's usually exploit marvelously, wasn't very well thought out this time (Carrey: "But you said you would eat blubber" - Midget: "She'll be eating blubber when I show her my Moby Dick.") Not very clever. Almost an easy way out. I also resented the fact that I knew about the chicken up the ass before I saw the film. That could have been very funny, but movie reviewers, magazines, fans, and even the Farrellys couldn't keep that a secret. I knew it was coming, and so it had no shock value at all.I thought the best part of the film was Carrey's physical comedy...especially when Hank and Charlie are fighting. That was maybe the most impressive bit of physical comedy in his career as he helped himself into the car. I also believed that his sons, who were M Fing everything were funny, not because they were black and had foul mouths, but because they were smart with foul mouths. "Damn...what the f*** is the muthaf**kin' atomic mass of this element?" "Muthaf**ka...Fermi would be spinning in his grave!" Good stuff there.Anyway, it's definitely worth a video rent in the next few months, but make sure you pick up Kingpin too and enjoy those huge, flopping comb-overs!!!5 out of 10</fullReview>

Charlie didn't have schizophrenia, he had dissociative identity disorder!! Schizo's DO NOT have multiple personalities! What really confuses me is even those who were protesting the movie were against it's portrayal of schizophrenics. Doesn't anybody know the difference??Don't get me wrong, the movie was exactly what I was looking for and more. I loved it! But until the Farrelys can improve the overall quality of their movies, they won't be comparable to great comedic movie makers like the Coen bros.

This gives the movie a bit of depressing atmosphere.

That was a let down, because we have already seen it.

		<fullReview>I laughed at this movie quite a bit, but the movie left me feeling very very, disappointed. A step backwards for both Carrey and the Farrelys who have both been better. What made "Something About Mary" so wonderfully entertaining was the combination of gross humour AND characters we really cared about and liked. The "Irene" tries to give us a romance and sympathetic characters, but it is ruined by one of with the lamest, laziest plots ever. Matt Dillon was a wonderful comic villain in "Mary", here we have the usually good Chris Cooper playing an utterly generic bad guy who seems to have wandered in from an old episode of "Barnaby Jones". Rene Zellweger is OK as Irene, but she does not color the tone of the entire film as Cameron Diaz did in "Mary". And Jim Carrey tried hard as our hero, but I felt that Steve martin already gave the definitive "split-personality" performance in "All of Me". Sorry, Jim, you have to pick your scripts more carefully.AND WHAT WAS THE DEAL WITH THAT NARRATOR??</fullReview>

I still don't understand the whole EPA/golf course/must-kill-the-girl plot -- it was never properly explained.The three kids violate a policeman, steal a helicopter, (and mysteriously appear at the needed time with no way of knowing where they were needed) -- and get off scott-free.The whole albino subplot didn't pay off at all.This film was too ambitious. If they made the plot simpler, but kept the same gags, I would have liked it a lot more, I suspect. "Dumb and Dumber" had the right sort of simple plot, but didn't have as many big laughs.The whole dildo thing means I have to make sure my parents don't see the movie. One or two big "shocks" is ok (like the "hair gell" in Something About Mary), any more than that approaches vulgarity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jim Carrey's long-overdue return to comedy is, well, obviously still coming. "Me, Myself &amp; Irene" teams the Farrelly brothers (the minds behind "Dumb and Dumber" and "There's Something About Mary") back up with Carrey. Unfortunately, "Dumb and Dumber", this ain't. The jokes are recycled from past Farrelly movies, the plot is convoluted, uninteresting and completely unbelievable, and there are more intriguing romances happening right now behind the bleachers at your local high school. The Farrelly's, who have obviously bought into their own "semen hair-gel" related hype, haven't really structured a story as much as they have strung together a bunch of fart jokes and other sordid material. Gross can be funny, but only if there's something behind the crudity to make it work. This movie does get a few laughs, but only because of how well Carrey handles the weak material he has been given to work with. In a couple of scenes, Carrey's gift for performing physical comedy actually saves this film from being a complete disaster, and winds up turning it into something more like an Amtrak derailment, with only minor injuries.</fullReview>

It is the kind of film that uses the same site gags over and over again and hopes that you laugh eventually at them. Eventually the jokes get tired and even some of the performances get weak and soggy after a while.The Farrely brothers, as we all know, are the genius' behind Something About Mary. That film worked because it was non stop hilarity. It invented new jokes, gross out humour and it basically took us in a direction that we had never been before when it came to comedy. MM&amp;I tries to do the same and for the most part it doesn't succeed. That is not to say the film isn't funny, it's just to say that it isn't funny as much as I thought it might be. There are some funny bits involving sexual aids, bathroom humour, and a cow, but where as those come so few and far between, the rest is lame, especially the split personality stuff. The jokes get old and there is only so much that the Farrely's give Carey to work with.Now the funniest parts of the film, in my humble opinion, are the scenes with his sons. When hank was married, his wife gave birth to three black twins. She ends up running off with a black midget that is a member of MENSA, so you figure out if Hank is the real dad or not. But anyway, these three guys love to watch Richard Pryor, use the MF word the way Pryor or Eddie Murphy would, are smarter than most NASA scientists and love their dad unconditionally. Now I'm not sure who plays two of the three "twins" but the funniest of the bunch is played by Anthony Anderson. Anderson has just recently popped up in three movies, including this one. And in all three, he was hilarious, even when the movie was supposed to be serious. His appearances in Romeo Must Die, Big Momma's House and now MM&amp;I should solidify him as one of the rising stars of comedy. I will bet that in two or three years he will have his first starring role. But until that time he always seems to be a bright spot in whatever film he is in, this one is no exception. Along with his two brothers, he is a scene stealer in every way. I enjoyed watching him in here and the film was better when he and his two brothers were in it than when they weren't, and that is quite the praise considering who they are starring with.Me Myself and Irene isn't a great film but it is not a terrible one either. You could do worse so far this summer and you could do better. At least the Farelly's try to make this funny in every scene, and that is more than you can say for many film makers. I guess my disappointment with it is that to me, summer is a time for the great films to come out during the year, not the Oscar caliber films, but the ones that entertain you. So far this summer is one of the worst for anticipated films. This was one of the films that I was really looking forward to seeing and it, just like most of the others thus far, is just okay. The only real good film so far is GLADIATOR. The rest have been pretty bad or just so so. Me Myself and Irene is no exception.It does have some sporadic scenes of hilarity and when you leave the theater, you at least leave after seeing one of the funniest bits in the film.As Anderson and his two brothers are flying a plane, they wave to us, the audience, and say with huge, teethy grins, " Thanks for watching our m****f***** movie. "6 out of 10**** Just a quick side note in defense of the films theme and its "apparent" lack of honesty in terms of portraying schitzo's in a positive way.So what!!!Films like this are not meant to be taken seriously. They are a funny take on a situation and nothing more. It is not a film makers job to have everything portrayed honestly, especially when it comes to comedy. I don't think the Farelly's believe or are trying to say that this is how all schitzos are. To get p***ed off about something as trivial as this is just plain ignorant. Those people are probably the same people that got ticked at DOGMA for dissing Christianity. My advice to all those people is simple. Get a life people. This is Hollywood, not the New England journal of medicine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you're a fan of the Truman or Andy Kaufman Jim Carrey, then give this one a miss, but if you enjoy the Ace Ventura Jim Carrey, then this is a must see. This film offers him ample opportunity to display his frenetic brand of physical comedy and, as is usually the case, these scenes steal the show. Go see it, laugh for an hour and a half, but don't expect much more than that. It's not exactly going to pile up the Oscar nominations ifyouknowwhatImean.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The jokes are broughtforth in the same manner as There's Something About Mary. They are all very Tasteless and Blue. But for some reason I still laugh each and every time. The same rules apply in Me Myself And Irene. I thought that Charlies kids were the funniest part of the movie, and the COW left me on the floor for a good ten minutes. Jim Carrey always brings some thing special to the big screen, and this movie is no exception. Maybe he has an extra cromozone or some thing. Hey it's worth the $6.00, and take a date, it will be that much funnier.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jim Carrey's long-overdue return to comedy is, well, obviously still coming. "Me, Myself &amp; Irene" teams the Farrelly brothers (the minds behind "Dumb and Dumber" and "There's Something About Mary") back up with Carrey. Unfortunately, "Dumb and Dumber", this ain't. The jokes are recycled from past Farrelly movies, the plot is convoluted, uninteresting and completely unbelievable, and there are more intriguing romances happening right now behind the bleachers at your local high school. The Farrelly's, who have obviously bought into their own "semen hair-gel" related hype, haven't really structured a story as much as they have strung together a bunch of fart jokes and other sordid material. Gross can be funny, but only if there's something behind the crudity to make it work. This movie does get a few laughs, but only because of how well Carrey handles the weak material he has been given to work with. In a couple of scenes, Carrey's gift for performing physical comedy actually saves this film from being a complete disaster, and winds up turning it into something more like an Amtrak derailment, with only minor injuries.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A funny movie for people who like to laugh.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everybody who complains about Me, Myself and Irene should not have went to go see it. The audiences reaction was a laugh a minute. I find it very hard to believe that nobody thought this movie was funny. Jim Carrey portrays a highway patrolman named Charlie and over the years he has built up aggression. People the Farrelly Brothers even acknowledge that the script sucks. This movie isn't supposed to be arthouse mumbo jumbo, it's sole purpose is to make you laugh. Charlie raises three brilliant black sons and is seen as a joke in his town. He creates another identity that allows him to do the things he really wants to do. Irene comes along followed by crooked cops and it's up to Charlie/Hank to help her out. Along the way, an albino, a dildo and various other comedic elements fall into place. People please don't hype anything. In todays day and age people are satisfied with anything. BY far the funniest movie of 2000. 2 and a half stars out of 4. The story was weak but watch the movie for carrey's slapstick abilities.</fullReview>

But Jim Carrey, does in this film what he has always done well, make me laugh. As long as you suspend all disbelief, and realize that you are in for 90 minutes of mindless, plotless chicken up the ass fun, you will love this movie. You shouldn't expect a Man On The Moon, but Jim remembers what made him a star, and it made him a star because he is a comedic genius. 4 stars (for an "E-ticket" movie)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To put it simply, I loved `Dumb and Dumber' and `There's Something About Mary.' The Farrelly brothers are fast becoming my favorite directors (ahead of Mel Brooks). Their latest film, `Me, Myself, and Irene,' was not of the quality of these films, but makes me laugh nonetheless. At the start, I was disappointed to hear the voice of a narrator, Hank's first scene was not all that I hoped it would be, and I thought that this movie was sitting squarely on a rating of about 6. However, as the story began to pick up, particularly with Irene finding Charlie in his hotel room (great embarrassment scene), I found myself enjoying it more and more. Also, the scene where Charlie confronts his other personality reminded me of `The Nutty Professor,' which was another great take. By the end, I found it to be a terrific comedy.

I still thought the movie was very good and Carrey should at least get nominated for best actor for the talent that he has to carry on a conversation w/ himself. He played the 2 parts outstandingly. The story unfolds and develops well and keeps you entertained the whole time. Me, myself, and Irene is a quality comedy if you don't mind a lot of strong language and its worth the price of admission.</fullReview>

Some of it was amusing, I'll give it that, but despite a terrific performance by Jim Carrey, this movie fails. It had great potential, but the story was blown apart. Well, the plot was easy to follow but it was so thin, it was bordering on transparent. If you want to see a funny movie, watch "Something About Mary," the Farrelly Bros. previous (and successful) attempt at comedy. This is no "Something About Mary."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I once thought that There's Something About Mary was as far as you could push the envelope before a film became tacky and flat out offensive, yet somehow the Farrely Brothers managed to go even further with Me, Myself and Irene. It really makes you wonder how the had the nerve to actually write some of these jokes down on paper, and for Jim Carrey to act them out. This film is darker than the other Farrely movies, but that really works well, especially with Hank, Carrey's characther's dark side, who probably does some of the raunchiest things seen or inferred in a movie aimed at a mainstream audience. The best part is when he goes off the deep end for the first time. What you see in the TV ads hardly scratches the surface of this movie, although you'll probably never be able to look at a "Got Milk" ad the same way again. I think the only problem with the Farrely brothers movies is that they tend to write rather straight forward movie plots, and load them with cartoonish humor, which works, just as long as you don't think about it too much. This is definetly a movie to see if you liked their previous flicks, but if you're easily offended, stay away.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is generally good for a little laugh. You might want to wait for it to come out to video though. It can be compared a lot to "There's Something About Mary" but is more vulgar, offensive, and gross (It should probably have an R rating). It does have a lot of good laughs though (it's definately funnier than Mary). It's too bad the Farelly Brothers haven't been able to come up with good clean jokes instead of cheap laughs. The plot isn't that great either and this probably won't be one you'll put in your DVD collection. I'd still give it a 7 out of 10 because once you get past the flaws, it's pretty funny.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Me, Myself, and Irene", the Farrelly Brothers follow up to their smash hit "There's Something About Mary" is an entertaining, humorous flick, provided you're a fan of their style. Don't come into the theater expecting Woody Allen-type comedy; the shock value and gross out gags come fast and furious.I enjoyed "Dumb and Dumber" more than "..Mary", so I was excited to see Jim Carrey take a break from his "wanna win an Oscar" stretch. His comedic talents are undeniable and they are on full display in "...Irene". Only Carrey could provide the antics that split personalities Charlie and Hank require.Renee Zellweger does an admirable job as Irene; she definitely has a batter knack for comedy than last year's comedy "it" girl Heather Graham. She isn't there just for Carrey to play off of; she has her own fair share of funny moments.The scenes with Charlie's sons are some of the best in the entire film. The movie does have some slow moments, but that is to be expected. I was surprised at how many people slammed this film here on IMDB. It is NOT as bad as some have made it out to be. I think some of the criticism is a result of backlash due to Mary's success. Go into the theater expecting Farrelly comedy; that is required to enjoy this film. Stay for the entire end credits as well; more awaits at the end of those. Make sure to keep an eye out for a cameo by the gorgeous Anna Kournikova also.Movie Grade: A solid B</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ME, MYSELF &amp; IRENE stars Jim Carrey as a non-confrontational milquetoast highway patrolman who develops a split personality who goes out of his way to provoke confrontations. To complicate things, he's on the run with a young blonde who is targeted by some sort of deadly conspiracy. The plot doesn't make a huge amount of sense. To be completely honest, I'm not a huge fan of the Farrelly brothers; to me, there's more to humour than just grossing people out, though that may be considered blasphemy in light of most late 90s mainstream comedies. Granted, it did have its amusing characters (such as Carrey's three super-intelligent homeboy sons) and its amusing situations (Carrey's two personalities start beating each other up at a train station), but it tended to drag in the middle of the film, and let's face it: anybody can do gross-out humour, but not everybody can show the mastery of wit and timing that separates true comedic genius from the likes of the Farrelly brothers. I'm not saying it was an entirely bad film, but is it just me, or are we dwelling on a genre of comedy that wasn't all that funny to begin with? Two and a half stars out of four.</fullReview>

There's some magnificently gross gags, whacked-out personae including a crazy albino and a genius midget and adorably foul-mouthed black teens. But the villains are uninspiring and staple, and there is never any real sizzle in Carrey and Zellweger's road trip. The emotional core of the story is strong, what with Carrey dealing with ostracism and overcoming his own fears. But it never manages to be cohesively farcical and sweet at the same time, even though each has its moments. For a better comedy on a similar Jekyll-Hyde theme, try "The Nutty Professor".Rating: **1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Me, Myself and Irene s another great film from the ever reliable Farrelly brothers, who have of course brought us those other great comedies such as Dumb and Dumber and Something About Mary.While lacking the quantity of true laugh out loud gags and jokes that Something About Mary had, MMI certainly isn't a slouch in providing the quality ones. The lack of constant laughs may be attributed to its understandably darker subject matter.From the wise-talking, foul mouthed genius kids of our main character, the racially and vertically hung-up limosine driver, and of course the cow, MMI gives one plenty to laugh atCarrey is quite adequate as the dual personality Rhode Island trooper. He does manage to make the two personalities quite distinct and it is a joy to watch. His sidekick, played by Renee Zewelleger, helps form the most bizarre love triangle you are likely to see this year.Don't expect to laugh for the entire duration of the film, but it is enjoyable nonetheless.8 out of 10.</fullReview>

The character Charlie is not a good person. He is a spineless doormat that makes one wonder how he has a job as a state trooper when he can't even give out a parking ticket. 2. Corrupt, wicked, perverted. Fatherhood is a sham, marital vows don't exist, respect is absent with malice in its place and a child is corrupted using vulgar lines. Profanity is rampant and passes for "dialogue". Horror is the category of this movie, and I'm running scared if this is what people aged 28 and under consider normal, good comedy. Those moviegoers are paying to be offended, insulted. They don't appear to know the difference. And the producers of this movie are laughing all the way to the bank. Don't support this display of moral bankruptcy--stay away!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much funnier than "Angela's Ashes"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The early reviews of "Me, Myself, and Irene" are in, and already critics are dismissing the movie as a cheap rip-off of "Angela's Ashes," Alan Parker's 1999 adaptation of Frank McCourt's true-life memoir. These critics fail to realize that Jim Carrey's new movie has absolutely nothing to do with Parker's weighty tale of abject poverty and death. In "Me, Myself, and Irene", Carrey plays Charlie, a timid Rhode Island cop who suffers from a severe case of schizophrenia. When people upset and disrespect Charlie, he turns into Hank, a vengeful man with an attitude. "Angela's Ashes," a story of an Irish family mired in poverty, is a far more harrowing film. Parker's movie depicts many of the tragic elements of McCourt's book--including the deaths of two McCourt children--with brutal honesty and sympathy. "Angela's Ashes" is as touching as it is horrific, but it has nothing to do with the plot or the themes of "Me, Myself, and Irene." How critics can attempt to make this connection is beyond me. Carrey's uproarious new flick is altogether funnier and lighter than "Angela's Ashes."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You ever wanted to see what it's like to be another person or ever wanted to punch yourself well than this is the movie for you. Me Myself and Irene which is directed by theres something about mary writers Bob and Peter farrley. The movie tells the story of Charlie a sad sap who can't even run the law in his own town. Well after being told to p**s off and park a car. Charlie starts to flip out and develops a second personality Hank who is the master of all evil. He does stuff to people and is told that he has multiple personalities. Well he then is told that he needs to take a few days off and go find himself. Well that is were it all goes to hell when Irene who is played by Renee Zellweger shows up in his police station for speeding heres were I will stop beacuse you have to see it to find out what happens next but I will tell you this It is very funny and even though it doesn't have a great plot it shows that Jim carrey knows what to do. Some of the funny parts are with the three black sons of carrey. Don't get what I mean go see 7 and half out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jim Carrey's Great Return To The Comedy That Made Him The Famous Man He Is Today</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We all know the best comedy that Jim Carrey preforms is physical comedy, you can't deny that he is great at that. Even if you do not like the man, his physical comedy is brilliant. Anyway, after some comedy/drama films such as " The Truman Show" and " Man on the Moon" which I still enjoyed watching he has teamed up with The Farrelly Brothers to bring us, what I think, is one of the funniest movies this year. He plays Charlie, a proud man of the Rhode Island State Troopers. Charlie can't stand up for himself and lets everybody push him around like he is nothing, even little girls. Now with all this pent up rage, he unleashes Hank, a man so mean it's funny. See, Hank only comes out when somebody is mean to Charlie, he takes over him and does some crazy things. Then comes Irene(Renee Zellweger) a very good looking women who Charlie must acompany to New York because she is wanted on some charges. Anyway, the rest of the story is them running from the bad guys, a corrupt police man named Joe Sarrasin(Chris Cooper) and Irene's ex-boyfriend Dickie. Another story that comes into play is when both Hank and Charlie fall in love with Irene and Hank tries to take over Charlie for good. This movie is the common Farrelly humor, sick humor but it is great. It will be hard to see a movie funnier then this one this year but we still have a few.</fullReview>

Jim Carrey did a great job; It was good to see him in a stupid movie again. :-) I felt that the movie was a little bit more abrupt than any of the Farrely Brother's previous movies because it had a tendency to cut and imply what happened, but don't let that stop you from seeing this movie. I laughed all the way through. Sure, it's juvenille humor, but if you're into that type of thing go for it. If you don't like toilet humor and are stuck up, just avoid this movie.

		<shortDescription>Farrely Brothers Get Funnier &amp; Funnier!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw a sneak preview of this movie 6 days before its release. It begins in Rhode Island (every one of their movies start there), and tells the story of RI Highway Patrolman Charlie (Jim Carrey), just married to the "prettiest girl in town, Layla." They live a happy life, until Layla leaves him with three sons (of her midget lover). Charlie puts all his anger and sadness deep inside his sub-consciousness, and avoids confrontation with ANYONE. That's where the story begins...when one day, Charlie cracks. Suddenly, he starts to call himself "Hank" and hardly avoids confrontation; in fact, he promotes it. Charlie is diagnosed with a split personality. He is required to escort Irene (Renee Zellweger), a woman arrested for crimes she claims she didn't commit, back to upstate New York to clear up the mess. From here on, the movie gets funnier and funnier...err...sorry...HYSTERICAL! My highest recommendations.Just a note. Those of you who don't find "immature" humor funny and didn't like "Something About Mary" will DEFINITELY not like this movie.--Mimick--</fullReview>

I must say I expected quite a bit as it's a Farrelly brothers movie (The Big Lebowski, Dumb &amp; Dumber), and Jim Carry must be one of the more expensive actors at the moment, but oh, what a disappointment. The movie is built on toilet humor.. and it's just not funny. Sure, there's some funny lines, and one or two quotes that are fun, but that's it. Seen the trailer? Seen the movie. It's 2 hours (!) of more or less boring movie with jokes we've all seen before in one way or another. Jim's voice when he's supposed to be the bad guy is just annoying, and it's quite obvious how the movie will end. Don't see it.. go see dumb &amp; dumber one more time instead.. 3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The script for Me, Myself, and Irene was written well before There's Something About Mary and like Kevin Smith's Dogma, the fact that this is old material is painfully obvious. In Mary, the jokes and sight gags made you laugh in spite of yourself. In Irene, the jokes just made me stare in disbelief. All of the jokes were placed for shock value only and did nothing to enhance or compliment the main storyline. Even the bits that could have worked, such as Carrey's three sons and the albino kid, were funny at the first of the film but grew tedious by the end. The Farrely brothers have fallen so far as to insert outrageously obscene curse words into the dialogue to generate laughs. Instead all they do is generate boredom and waste an inspired performance from Jim Carrey.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Funny Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this at a sneak preview on 6/17, and it is a very funny movie. It was a tad mean spirited. In the Farrelly Brother's "Dumb and Dumber" you love the characters because they have big hearts. In "Me, Myself &amp; Irene" there's no reason given to love the characters...they just aren't that loveable...which makes the things they do a little over the edge. I have no problem with ribald humor whatsoever, it's just a little cliched anymore to have a little girl say the F-word.Me, Myself, and Irene will make you laugh out loud, it's a very simple film, but it works. There were only a few moments toward the first of the film that the audience around me seemed to be a little ill at ease, but the rest of the time they laughed in earnest. The crowd was made up of 18-25 year olds, and it's an audience of Kansas folk.this film will go bonkers this summer, I'm sure it'll be very huge..because it's funny. It's not quite on the level of "Dumb and Dumber" and "Something About Mary" even though it's along those lines.Please check out "Outside Providence", also by the Farrelly Brothers..it's a grossly underrated movie that is very funny.</fullReview>

I still don't understand what the heck she did "wrong" or what the "crime" of the movie was. There was simply NO POINT. This film should make some dough but it certainly won't get the replay value of "Mary" as there were no surprises in the film or plot to speak of. Come on Farrely brothers, you don't have to force the characters to drive cross country in practically EVERY FILM YOU MAKE!! I found the most fun this film generated in absence of plot was spotting all of the "Farrely Favorites" from their films from the past few years. Catch this one on video or not at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw a sneak preview of this film a few hours ago and thought it was entertaining. It's good to see Jim Carrey back with the brothers that really made his career, however this isn't Dumb and Dumber. Carrey does show a lot of talent as the film progresses, especially when Hank and Charlie are both fighting over the body at the same time. Although I thought the first comment on this site for the film was very overexpressed and should be gagged, I must say the film did go way over the top at times. It seems that the Farrely brothers have learned from their on-screen shock value in There's Something About Mary and tried taken it a step to far. From the trailer of this film I was able to tell that, like There's Something About Mary, some of it's great moments couldn't be shown due to it's content. I didn't know how far they'd push the R rating. At times the film would have you laughing hysterically at it's substance and take it a step further, only making everyone in the audiences laughter change to disgust - in There's Something About Mary the joke would still stay hysterical even if it got too carried away with itself. But this isn't to trash the movie, which does stay entertaining nonetheless. I just hope the Farrely brothers learn from their mistakes in this one and do better next time around. **1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Farrelly Brothers have overstayed their welcome with this one. Their idea of comedy, not to mention Jim Carrey's idea of comedy, is to take a joke or funny sequence and beat it to death. And many of the jokes were not funny the first time around. I loved the Farrelly Brothers' previous movies (even the underrated Outside Providence), so I was really looking forward to this one. Carrey brings two of his characters back to life (his characters from The Mask and Liar Liar). They don't work this time. The last moments of the movie show Carrey copying Steve Martin's moves from All of Me.Slapstick comedy is a delicate matter, and the Farrelly's really missed the mark this time. The film's funniest moments are provided by Carrey's three sons, and even they take things a little too far in the end. A big disappointment!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A comedy from the controversial Farrelly Brothers which quickly wears out its welcome</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've known of this movie for several years now, recognizing the star, famous comedian Jim Carrey, and also knowing it was a Farrelly Brothers comedy. Earlier this year, I finally watched "There's Something About Mary", after knowing about it since probably around the time it came out over a decade earlier (when I was a little too young to see it). I was expecting that to be a really funny film, due to its reputation and the fact that "Dumb &amp; Dumber" has made me laugh more than once, but I was SORELY mistaken! I then watched "Kingpin" and "Shallow Hal", both of which I hadn't seen in years, and I found them both to be mixed blessings this time. Before watching "Me, Myself &amp; Irene" very close to the New Year, I figured it could be anywhere from pretty good to fairly lame, and it basically turned out to be the latter for me.Charlie Baileygates is a Rhode Island state trooper who is constantly taken advantage of. As a young man, he marries a woman named Layla after she promises to stay with him no matter what, but then she has an affair behind his back with a limo driver named Shonté, and soon gives birth to triplets. Charlie lives in denial of this affair and seems to think he is the biological father of these three boys, but eventually, Layla leaves with Shonté, leaving Charlie to raise the triplets on his own! They grow up in his household, and he gets a lot of respect from them, but not much respect from those outside the home. After years of taking abuse and keeping his anger inside, the trooper finally develops a nasty alter ego named Hank Evans! Charlie gets medication to stop his second personality and is sent on a trip to escort a woman named Irene Waters to Massena, New York, where she is to face charges for a hit and run which it is believed she committed, even though the culprit is actually her ex-boyfriend, Dickie Thurman. It turns out that hit men are after Irene, so she escapes with Charlie, who leaves his medicine behind and frequently turns into Hank on the adventure that ensues! Jim Carrey did sometimes amuse me here, which is more than I can say about his performance as Dr. Edward Nygma/the Riddler in "Batman Forever", but the smiles/laughs were still very sporadic. Shonté accusing Charlie of attacking his race and dwarfism and getting violent over it isn't funny, and at this point, it already looks like "Me, Myself &amp; Irene" was going to be a lame comedy. Unfortunately, that scene doesn't lie. The scenes showing Charlie and the triplets watching Richard Pryor and Chris Rock can be pretty funny, but those are just two segments. The film continues to be unfunny as we watch Charlie take abuse from people around him, but it also isn't that funny when the character turns into Hank and starts fighting back, and doing things such as sucking on a woman's teat on his first rampage! The dullness in this Farrelly Brothers comedy continues during Charlie/Hank and Irene's adventure on the road, with many people in pursuit of them. I did laugh at the part where the Whitey character claims he murdered his family, but there weren't too many other times when I laughed or even smiled while watching the chaotic road trip.I've watched a total of four Farrelly Brothers films in the past year. Two of these I had never seen before, which were "There's Something About Mary" and this 2000 release, and I thought both of them were pretty lame, even though I'm sure most people who have seen them would disagree with me, especially on the 1998 blockbuster. In between my viewings of those two comedies was when I most recently watched "Kingpin" and "Shallow Hal", and the former showed a significant improvement, since I had previously hated it, and the latter may have improved somewhat as well after my first viewing, but neither of these lived up to my two viewings of "Dumb &amp; Dumber" in 2007. I saw a lot of that first Farrelly Brothers movie for the first time in 1999, but didn't see all of it until 2007. After seeing a handful of their films, it doesn't seem to me that they're among the most talented of those involved in crude, irreverent humour these days, though there are worse comedians of this type. While "Me, Myself &amp; Irene" does have a following, I really don't expect to ever be part of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining at moments but not all that great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are several little details here that inspire a series of awkward plot interventions, the only funny ones being the circumstances in which Hank and Charlie get into physical arguments regarding their love for Irene, at one point showcasing how Carrey throwing punches at himself can drag him away from the wheel of a moving car. Some elements generate stereotypes, such as the perception of African Americans being the only characters allowed in the movie to slur extreme vulgarities, and most others involve the typical traits of any recent major comedy: penis jokes, breast jokes, urine jokes, and even dildo jokes.Laughs are not the only missing link here, however. Though a premise is firmly grounded, the story meanders on and on, giving the writers more of an excuse to unleash even a few more painfully unfunny wisecracks. Likewise, the characters treat each other like illegitimate relatives at family reunions, not to any purpose of establishing their characteristics, but just to serve as a hammer that will force Charlie to crack. The movie just wasn't that funny. It was somewhat entertaining and interesting to watch but really wasn't that good</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Me,myself and Irene is a simply hilarious movie by the Farelly bros.I hope that the Farelly bros.back to this kind of comedy(rude comedy) because it's the last comedy of this kind of comedy directed by them.After this movie they didn't direct rude comedies(Osmosis Jones,Shallow Hal and two consecutive false moves called Stuck on you and Fever pitch).Me,myself and Irene is a very good comedy with hilarious moments.After a serious role on the great movie Man on the moon,Carrey backed to the comedy with this movie.Carrey is simply great on this movie.If you like movies that you laugh every time(from the beginning until the ending)don't doubt in watching Me,myself and Irene,a great and hilarious comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst Carrey movie ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's fairly entertaining... If you're bored as hell that is, but just don't get your hopes if you're planning to watch it.I don't even know where to begin about the problems. First of all the plot is pretty stupid, the villains are completely uninteresting; it's as if they were just thrown there as an excuse for creating the journey of Carrey and Zellweger in the movie. So, it's hard to take them seriously.And that's just one of many clichés, stuff worn out by earlier Farrelly-movies. One other is the three black sons of Carrey. "Haha, they're so ghetto!", is that supposed to be funny? It's so stupid that you're not even thinking about the more serious issue of racism, on a broader level that is.Oh and the whole schizo thing is also a not-so-funny thing that still makes the whole movie. To have almost serious scenes concerned with the two different personas as if they really were two different persons, 'causing all the drama in the relationship with Irene (Zellweger), is so wrong. Has the theme of schizophrenia ever been handled in a more generic way in movies? I don't think so. In the latter part of the movie when this 'causes Carrey to have a physical battle with himself, it just becomes too much. It goes on for about 10 minutes and you're just waiting for the movie to end.And people criticized the Cable Guy! sigh...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unbelievably Bad, for Carrey AND the Farrellys!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film, like so many other Farrelly brothers films, just doesn't work. There must be a thousand attempts at humor here. About 50 of them succeed. Sure, there are some great laughs, especially in the first several minutes, when Tony Cox (a black midget) steals Carrey's wife away, and Carrey's too stupid later to realize why he has 3 black sons! In fact, all the short scenes with the 3 black sons are hilarious beyond belief! Maybe, in some weird way, that is why most of the rest of this falls flat. And yes, that totally includes the "cow" sequence that all other critics said was so funny. Yikes, for me this movie totally tanked, except for what I mentioned above. The humor, for the most part, just falls flat for me. Oh! I forgot to describe the plot, or story! Yeah? Who gives a damn? **</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked Jims acting, but where the hell is the storyline??????????? The part when he shoots the cow six times was pretty funny, and also when he went nuts for the first time, but the humour was sometimes too crude. I'm sorry to all you hardcore fans out there (If you exist) but this movie was a pointless waste of two hours of my life. The dialogue with the limo driver was too stereotypical. One part of the film I really did like was the parts with the kids, "Haw can you eat so much crap and not get fat!" I think that Renee's acting was exceedingly poor, and her emotions just weren't carried across. There was only one serious bit for me in this movie, the part when Hank realises how much he offends people was touching. The funniest parts of the film were mostly at the beginning. Not a total failure, but nearly.Generally, about as good as a hat full of ass.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good script, great Carrey, hilarious film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this film after a friend recommended it to me. He said he knew I'd find it funny. I sighed, heard about the mediocre reviews it got on release and wasn't sure whether or not I could commit myself to sitting through something the world seemed indifferent about. However, I watched it in its entirety.From the off the flaws are easy to spot; an I-can-see-where-this-is-going plot and a script heavily reliant on Carrey's delivery- BUT That's about it. Because Me, Myself and Irene, simply put, is absolutely hilarious. You cannot strip this film of its comedic armour because although many of the jokes are crude, obvious and crass, it is put together for us the viewer so perfectly that it hits the funny bone just at the appropriate point when you fear the gag could fall flat. For me, a lot of effort seems to have gone into creating the right heady mix of nice scenery and open country to blend perfectly into the background of a world where Jim Carrey is allowed to take a dump on his neighbours' lawns and cows won't die after being repeatedly shot. The beautiful backdrop serves up this odd comedy and adds flavour to material that's purposely cute and crude.Any film that gives me indigestion and makes me rewind a frame over 4 times for the same joke is evidence enough that it's something worth seeing. You're not me, but if you find Jim Carrey even vaguely amusing and relish the thought of watching a character flip from one extreme personality to another with altogether surreal consequences, then it's likely to be the best film about a character who flips from one extreme personality to another with altogether surreal consequences you'll ever see.For an all-out assault on your sides, this film is very worth it. It's not Carrey's best film (see Truman Show, Eternal Sunshine or Liar Liar) ? but it's certainly one of the funniest comedy's he's been in. Far superior to the Cable Guy, Bruce Almighty and the second Ace Ventura ? I'd go as far as to say that the film is consistently funny enough to get a sequel with different actors and a smaller budget! And you know you're onto a franchise if that happens?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>very funny.. but.. the funnines comes in the mispresentation of schizophrenia. for starters its disociative identity disorder. I'm doing a media essay at the moment and there is so much wrong with this film in terms of the medical side, that it adds another comedic point to it. Unfortunately the portrayal of mentally ill is damaging as they arnt violent. Just the media's over exaggerated mental illness. It just follows the stereotypical ideologies.Still thought it was very funny though.THis is Carrey at his best, and the black children gag works very well along with the midget joke. What i wonder is how a little man like that can produce such big children!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ME, MYSELF &amp; IRENE (2000) ***1/2 Jim Carrey, Renee Zellweger, Chris Cooper, Robert Forster, Rob Moran, Richard Jenkins, Traylor Howard, Anthony Anderson, Jerod Mixon, Mongo Brownlee, Michael Bowman.Jim Carrey is back and The Farrelly Brothers have him! Not to say that the biggest comedy film star was missing in action, with his last impressive acting displayed as Andy Kaufman in 'Man on the Moon'; just the Jim Carrey his fans want to see! That's right the one who usually talks out of his rear end or lets his rubber face do the talking in the end.Reunited with 'Dumb and Dumber's sibling auteurs of bodily functions, Bobby and Peter, Carrey cuts loose as Rhode Island State trooper Charlie Baileygates, an easy-going, amiable schmuck who sucks in all his pain and anger when confrontations reduce him to a hapless smile. The trouble starts on his wedding day to his lovely bride (Howard) and winds up losing his betrothed to the chauffeur, a black dwarf with a skill for martial arts and Mensa (of which she also happens to be the state charter president!), after a mistaken question ('Do you people take checks?') is taken to the nth degree, leading to his wife giving birth to triplet black boys (in one of the funniest birth sequences on film yet) and good-natured shlub Charlie showing no back bone to question her fidelity only to end up raising the trio as his own even when she leaves him for the chauffeur.Flash forward 18 years later and the pressure cooker of all his pent up vitriol is finally released in one full thrust after a string of insult-to-the self-esteem culminates at the express line in a grocery store. Carrey's close-up of a bubbling burst about to blow under his elastic mug is a thing of beauty and the result of his final straw breaking his psyche is one for the archives.Concerned by his superior officer (Forster), Charlie is diagnosed as having a schizophrenic alter ego Hank who manages to mix his ego, id &amp; superego into a 'Buddy Love' persona of a nasty, shoot-from-the-hip insulting, bully with a serious sexual itch to be scratched when Charlie is instructed to escort the lovely Irene (Zellweger) to Upstate New York in an unsuspecting case involving criminal activity and a crooked fellow law enforcement agent (Cooper) who wants her out of the picture.The road trip to hilarity never lets up as Charlie/Hank battle for identity and ultimately for Irene who surprisingly adapts to the Jekyll/Hyde cop whose accidental forgetting his medication, has her hands full in staying in one piece en route to their final destination.Carrey gives one of his trademark, brilliant performances of dexterous slapstick, Silly-Putty facial contortions (check out his 'cottonmouth' turns) and the ongoing ping-ponging from sweetheart Charlie to reckless Hank (it rivals Steve Martin's 'possession' from 'All of Me'), yet making the film's vulgar, crude and hysterical proceedings all his own.The Farrellys (who co-wrote with childhood chum Mike Cerrone), may not be the most subtle comedy directors but then again you don't want that in a subversive comedy like this which manages to skewer all sacred cows (literally) and other farm animals, little people, albinos, handicap parking and the menacing of small children (all by the way perfectly disposed of here!) The most welcome surprise are the very funny triplets (Anderson, Mixon and Brownlee) who are the top three students in their graduating class thanks to 'good genes' as Irene notes. Their devotion to their loving father, who is framed for several crimes committed in his journey, is heartfelt and hilarious as they attempt to aid him in his time of need.Going all for broke and succeeding in more ways than one Carrey and The Farrellys make a great team and one of the funniest films in recent history that will have you howling!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Farrelly Brothers' Worst...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Me, Myself and Irene" is the Farrelly Brothers' painfully unfunny and inconsistent follow-up to their smash hit "There's Something About Mary." They seemed to be on a roll--"Dumb and Dumber" was a hoot, "Kingpin" was a blast, and "Mary" was outrageous. Now they've sunk into what they so marginally avoided in their previous films--downright crudeness and stupidity.This isn't to say that their previous efforts were lacking crudeness. But what made the films funny were the characters and their good intentions (or bad intentions in the case of Pat Healy). "There's Something About Mary" is a strong R-rated film, no doubt, and the hair gel scene would turn off almost every viewer, I think, if not for the innocence of the characters and our attachment to them--by the time we come around the scene we already cared for them. The characters in "Me, Myself and Irene" are given little background, and when they do it comes off as a very superficial life.It starts with an 18-year veteran of the Rhode Island police named Charlie (Jim Carrey). After his wedding, Charlie gets attacked by a vicious midget--who also happens to be black. The little man is overly-sensitive and very insecure, and so he goes after Charlie with his belt. Yeah, it's sort of funny, but not as funny as it could have been. Anyway, we find out the midget man is a member of MENSA. Charlie's new wife is the head of MENSA or something. Love at first sight.Charlie's wife gives birth to three black children. Charlie realizes that they are black ("They have a tan all year long," says a neighbor) but, being the sensitive and insecure person he is, he simply ignores the fact and tucks it way back in his head. Eventually his wife leaves him for the midget. Years later, Charlie's kids are older. They're foul-mouthed but incredibly smart. Me thinks making them talk very educated would have actually made it a great bit funnier than having their every other word be the almighty F-word, but I won't complain.He finally snaps under pressure and a new personality erupts--Hank. Hank defecates on the neighbor's lawn, sticks a little girl's head in a pool of water and almost drowns her, crashes a car through the front of a building, and so on and so forth.Enter Renee Zellweger as Irene, a runaway golf course attendant being chased by criminals who thinks she knows too much about something. The cops are in on it and so Charlie and Irene run away. Only problem? Hank is about to appear again and wreak havoc.The film resorts to low-brow humor, but it's just plain mean, and not all that funny. "Mary" was sweet and funny and crude and funny and mean and funny. "Me, Myself and Irene" is just plain mean and mean and crude and crude and a bit funny. I laughed a few times but they weren't big laughs. This is a very dark comedy that perhaps portrays the Farrelly Brothers' taste for darkness, but forgets to portray their humor. There's a scene with Charlie trying to kill a cow that's funny, but what's with the ongoing jokes about "Whitey" the albino? I don't really mind the political incorrectness--it's just not funny! They eventually use Whitey as a cheap plot device who becomes their friends, as if they felt sorry for making fun of him. Isn't one of the pinnacles of the Farrelly's humor political incorrectness with no reservations?This movie resorts to something I thought I'd never see in a Farrelly Brothers movie--conventional plot devices. The plot behind the mess is just distracting from the rest of the movie. Everything from Whitey the albino to Dickie the gangster is all so typical. And the film's real problem is that it thinks Hank is funny. Every time it starts to lose steam it pulls out Charlie's alter ego and tries to use it as a last-ditch effort for laughs. Hank is not funny. Now, the possibilities of what Hank could DO are very funny--but the Farrellys only use him as a device for a few laughs, sex jokes, and physical fights between Charlie (both fighting through Carrey's body) that is funny but underplayed. I would have paid eight bucks just to see Carrey fighting himself because he is good at physical comedy--but the movie seems to drag on with the idea of split personality disorder without ever making good use of it.I wondered how much funnier it would have been if the Carrey character, Charlie, had two alter egos who fought inside him. Then there would be almost constant changes. But Hank appears only when the film starts to run out of steam. And sadly, this film is always out of steam.Note: The Farrellys have inserted various cameos in this film. Owen, a mentally retarded man who knew the Farrellys as boys (and yes, the inspiration for Owen in "Mary") can be seen in the background, as well as John J. Strauss, co-writer of "Mary," and Lin Shaye, who played Magda in "Mary," and Pat Healy, the name of Matt Dillon's character, is in the background; and finally, the ending where Charlie is looking for his thumb in the water is the original ending of "There's Something About Mary," with Ted (Ben Stiller) getting hit by a bus. The script called for Mary and passersby to start searching for vital parts of his anatomy (including one major part), but they had neither the time nor budget to do this. When "Irene" came around, they knew it was their chance. It didn't quite work as planned.2/5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not very funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I get the feeling the Farrelly Bros. tried too hard with this movie. Either that, or they simply thought that by casting Jim Carrey it would automatically be funny. For the most part, it wasn't. The potential was there, the basic premise is solid. Jim Carrey is Charlie, a state patrolman who is meek and mild mannered, he endures all sorts of abuse from everyone; his first wife, his next door neighbor, even people in a grocery store. It reaches a point where he finally snaps and develops a split personality. His "alter ego" is Hank, who goes around abusing all the people who abused Charlie and, in general, behaving like a totally obnoxious ass. Like I said, the premise has potential, but it's the execution that falls flat.First off, they made this movie way too complicated. Comedies should have a plot that doesn't get in the way of the laughs. This one does. There's just too much stuff going on and it gets confusing. Also, it's too long, nearly two hours. I distinctly recall a point a half hour or so from the end where I wanted them to wrap things up, but it just kept going and going. Also, too much of the humor seems forced, such as having three rap spouting science prodigies as Carrey's "sons" (courtesy of his first wife's affair with a black midget cab driver who's also a member of Mensa). But the final nail in the coffin is Carrey's character (more properly, characters). In a comedy, it helps greatly if the lead character is someone we can relate to, someone we can like or at least feel sorry for. But "Charlie" is simply TOO clueless, too pathetic, and "Hank" is too nasty while at the same time being too stupid to actually help Irene escape the bad guys. To sum things up, I'd say the Farrelly Bros. swung hard, trying to hit a home run, but the ball went foul.4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A truly mediocre flick. The Farrelly's have never been my cup of tea - they remind me too much of old college-comedies or even Police Academy - but I thought Jim Carrey maybe would be able to lift at least some of this movie himself. He has done it before and seem to have built a career on making movies, where he is funnier than the actual movie itself (Not a lot of actors can do that. Imagine The Truman Show with Adam Sandler...uuuuuh) Me, Myself and Irene has a couple of good scenes in it - I liked the first 15 minutes or so. But all in all, there isn't even enough comedy to make a 25-minute sitcom. It tries to be funny, then tries to be thrilling, and tries to be funny again. It TRIES way too hard. Somehow I feel I should be a Jim Carrey-fan, but I find it hard when he keeps on making movies in the "Cable Guy"-category.</fullReview>

Hate the swearing used by Charlies son's, it was totally inappropriate and spoilt the movie as far as family viewing was concerned. Swearing is OK if suited to the movie. It didn't suit this movie. I fail to understand why so many good potential 'family' movies are polluted with foul-mouthed and minded scripts. The dildo and reference to anal intercourse were likewise inappropriate to script development. Disappointing, as it had lots of potential. The fight scene between Charlie and Hank was very much like the ending of 'Fight Club', which did the whole concept of duel personalities in a much more entertaining and thrilling way. Watch 'Fight Club',to the end, after this movie and you make the decision.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ME, MYSELF &amp; IRENE (2000) Rating: 6/10Is Me, Myself and Irene the disappointing, stupid comedy you've heard all about? Is it really bad? Well, not entirely. While this movie may have offensive content and some very unrealistic plotlines (yep, sure, they're gonna let a schitzo take off with a lady who believes she didn't crash a car, we can really trust him), it is still fun to watch and there is a lot to like. The film is laugh-out-loud funny at times, and totally absurdly stupid at others. But what is important is that you enjoy yourself in this movie, and you do. But only with one viewing, too many times seeing this movie and it'll tire majorly. The movie is too long, but you'll still want to keep watching just for the hysterics. Jim Carrey is brilliant in his two roles, jumping from character to character like a genius. Renee Zellweger is incredibly cute, but it's the guys who play Charlie's (Carrey) 3 sons that win the day. They deserve for their own movie for such natural ability. Much like Charlie, this movie has 2 sides. The one that is totally hilarious and worth watching, and the other that is stupid and offensive. Me, myself, Michael, found it to be a bit of a pick 'n mix situation.</fullReview>

(The chicken thing was not typical of the humour in this film!) Carey's 'inner struggle'/fight towards the end of the film was a real 'tour de force'. He doesn't always get the material - but boy is he one talented guy!Most of the film has an edge to it - and some of the gags are quite gross. (we're back to the chicken thing again....) But the 'what the hell' attitude has led to some great moments.

		<shortDescription>A backward step for Jim Carrey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes, when a film like this becomes a blockbuster, it makes me despondent about the state of our society. This is the very lowest form of comedy. It is coarse, ribald and vulgar, a barrage of tasteless humor that runs the gamut from disgusting to offensive. The Farrelly brothers burst onto the scene with `Dumb and Dumber', another ridiculous film with shallow humor that the masses ate like candy. They began to show some promise with `There's Something About Mary', but then they decided we haven't been insulted enough lately and they produced this tripe.Jim Carrey is a brilliantly talented comedian. After `The Truman Show' and `Man on the Moon', it seemed like he was progressing as a comedian beyond excrement humor. I'm sure this film made him a truckload of money, but it is a relapse into fatuousness and a step backward in his career.There are plenty of funny scenes in this film. Carrey is a funny guy. However, there is also a passel of gross-out and gutter humor, which can only be targeted at pubescent or moronic individuals. The film takes insulting pot shots at blacks, women, and the disabled, and seems to revel in its own poor taste. It is normally easy to get a laugh out of me, and I appreciate slapstick more than most, but the trend toward repugnant humor exhibited in films like this and `Scary Movie' is disheartening. What is more disturbing is how successful they are.I rated this film a 4/10. I don't need to trash it because it trashes itself. Carrey gives us a great deal of terrific physical comedy, but the material is mostly garbage.</fullReview>

The film fails as a romantic comedy, relies heavily on crass shock humor, is devoid of sophistication, has a paper thin make-it-up-as-you-go-along plot, lacks cohesion, runs 30 minutes too long, wears itself out, and makes Carrey's performance look like a bad impression of a young Jerry Lewis.

		<fullReview>For some reason, 'me myself and irene' has been dismissed in America as puerile, uninventive, even offensive, when, of course, it is very nearly a masterpiece. If it's not quite the work of genius that was 'there's something about mary', than that's probably because the narrative isn't tight enough, the quest isn't as emotionally interesting, the heroine isn't Cameron Diaz. But the comedy is frequently inspired, Jim Carrey gives the kind of rich, thoughtful performance snobs can only see in his soi-disant 'serious' movies, and the film offers a vision of America as mythical and ambitious as 'Birth of a nation'.'irene' isn't offensive because the Farrellys' vision is inclusive. Charlie's schizophrenia is a fundamental rupture that afflicts the nation as a whole. It is important that he is a policeman, a servant of that power that needs to be monolithic, recognisably whole for it to function, to exercise control. Far from being this single force for good, the police are as full of corrupt, cold-blooded killers and destructive lunatics as it is naive law-enforcers. This schizophrenia is mirrored in th land - over the opening credits, and throughout the film, we see Charlie passing over bridges or beside water, indicating a constant movement between two realms, two states of mind that are separate and need to be bridged.The Farrellys find that rupture is at the heart of the conservative ethos, and seek alternatives. This again is figured in Charlie's schizophrenia. This is what a bunch of rednecks call his problem - we can recognise something else, the Jekyll and Hyde syndrome, whereby a facade of sociability struggles to conceal darker urges of sex, violence and power. charlie's transformation, in the supermarket, is an affectionate parody of Fredric March's change in Mamoulian's classic film of the Stevenson fable. Just as this film's duality focuses on a figure representing authority, and thereby destabilising that authority, so Stevenson's anti-hero, the very epitome of mental unhealth, was a doctor - Hank's Hyde does what Charlie's Jekyll would never dare to do (the rub is that Hank is as hilariously inept as Charlie).But, though the film seems to be working itself towards some kind of 'cure', a way to make Charlie whole again, it brilliantly doesn't: Charlie's schizophrenia is accepted for what it is; he is no longer demonised by difference, but welcomed back into a social fold, crowned by intimations of marriage. Of course, the Farrellys don't let us forget what happened after the last marriage.This resolution culminates the film's strategy - the presentation of difference as difference, and yet its ultimate acceptance into the group without the difference being diluted. So much so that this group (of schizophrenics, albinos, ditzes, overweight geniuses etc.) provides a breakaway alternative to the dominant group (police, big business), with the latter being the disruptive outsider, through individualism, greed and criminality.. Only the intellectually myopic (hell, you're welcome too!) could fail to see that 'Irene' is textbook PC wish-fulfilment.What rescues this cuddly vision is the wonderfully scattershot comedy. Unlike 'mary', the ratio of good gags to not so good isn't quite that high, but when it is good, it's fantastic and genuinely intelligent - there is a Surrealist desire to surprise and make you rethink that can be found in the editing, the tone of various scenes, in the way a joke develops unexpectedly, in the reactions of character, that is simply beyond the reach of the kind of films routinely acclaimed as superior. Of course, the jokes hit on recurrent male fears, about female sexuality, its links to the bestial, homosexuality etc., but this is an internet age where boys don't even need the social act of top-shelf shopping anymore, where male emotional maturity is in terminal regression. My favourite bit comes early on, with Charlie's troubles with a chauffeur.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>what have you done- Jim?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i haven't heard much about this film. i knew that it is a comedy, and i knew that Jim carrey is the main character there. but, it was enough! i like jim very much, i like his humor, and i think he has proved himself as an actor in his last films. but this film has spoiled all his great resume. it was so awful! first of all, there was no story! i know that it is a comedy, and it is reasonable that once a year, we'll see a funny movie, that we wouldn't think of it after it ends , and without a complicated ideas. well, it was much worse then a funny and "middle of the week" film. the story fits 5 years old kids, and the jokes too. second, the love story- which was the main idea, but was so empty, and so un-built! i think that every one in the cinema, didn't understand why she fell in love with him, and why he fell in love with her. the only element which was funny and i liked his idea, was the 3 boys that appear every 10 minutes in the film, and made me stay in my seat after all. although i find the film as a very bad one, i have to say that the music was great, and the songs were picked up with a big attention- another thing that made me stay until the movie will end. i really don't know what made Jim take a place in this film, or how he succeed to create such a boring and ridiculous film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A hugely disappointing film that uses lazy shock gags.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film crosses the line between clever slapstick and absurdly unfunny shock gags. In one scene, when Carrey's character finally "breaks", he spies a well endowed woman breastfeeding a baby. The next thing you know, Carrey has replaced the baby and is breastfeeding himself. If that wasn't bad enough, after that we see him driving with a milk mustache. If you think this sort of thing is funny, you'll love this film. Speaking of not funny, I guess the director thought it would be funny if Carrey's character were the biological father of 3 large black teenagers with crude language, rapper accents, and Einstein IQs. Wanna guess how he accomplishes this? Pet detective, this ain't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my opinion this movie is on the same level as most of Carrey's movies, such as Ace Ventura 1 &amp; 2 and Cable Guy. Not very funny and pretty stupid. This movie isn't in the same league as Something About Mary and Dumb and Dumber, which were actually funny throughout the movie and can be watched over and over again. If it wasn't for Carrey's black "children" in this movie, it would have been a total waste of time to me. There were moments that I laughed, most of them being the scenes with his kids, but overall its a bunch of thrown together crap.Several times I just said to myself "I can't believe they left that scene in the movie." Most of the audience seemed to agree with me since only 2 people were belly laughing throughout the movie (you know, the kind of people who laugh at anything that's remotely stupid) and the rest were mostly silent except for the rare chuckle.Thinking about his movies it seems that most of the times I think Carrey was funny is when another character in the movie is reacting to something he did, as opposed to just Carrey running around being a retard.</fullReview>

No matter she was paid and you hear more than that at your local school yard anyway. On with the movie; from the start Tony Cox as the Mensa Midget and the father of Jim Carrey's three adorable kids, and to Rene Zelewegger as the hardened criminal Jim Carrey must transport back to upstate New York.

		<fullReview>Travelling with a schizophrenic motorcycle cop doesn't sound like a good time but this film doesn't seem to care. Of course, the Farrelly brothers are known for their peculiarities but making a film about a man with a psychological disorder is doomed from the start. Not that disorders should always be taken seriously, but to give Jim Carrey the disease is like saying: "We give you a green card to be as outrageous as you wanna be".Another problem is that Renee Zellweger, the Irene of the title has absolutely zero chemistry with Carrey. It's amazing to think that they became a couple shortly after because she is so unappealing in every scene she's in. Yes, she is kind of cute but she seems to be struggling with her lines and doesn't have the stamina for this kind of basically male-oriented territory.The non-actor who plays Whitey does well and Carrey's three sons also have their moments. The best part is the prologue describing how Carrey became what he is and the gag with his wife's t-shirts is priceless. The villains are cardboard and it's strange to see Chris Cooper as a total slimeball who pretends to be one of the good guys. The film does deserve an "A" for effort because I think it is better than "There's something about Mary" which got way too serious at the end.When will Carrey make a totally laugh riot like "The Mask" again. Maybe we will never know because he is fast becoming the man who never went further than talking out of his butt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An amazing performance from Jim Carrey...and the Farrelly brothers don't know what to do with it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Final Score: 4.7 (out of 10)It's hard to imagine that the Farrelly brothers could do anything to top their 'There's Something about Mary', a movie just about branded a comedy classic weeks after it was released. If they had a bomb up their sleeve now was the time to drop it and shrink their popularity bubble to a manageable size. So in that great cosmic sense of balance one can forgive the completely pedestrian effort that is "Me, Myself and Irene".The basic premise of the film is an interesting one: a cop with a made-up variation of schizophrenia duels with the good and evil sides of him as they both pursue one women. Premise: check. I've always said the Farrelly brothers were better storytellers than joke-makers. Their movies often force laughter out of the sheer exuberance and good will of the tone, but I really watch to see where they will take an interesting and original idea. As a star vehicle no better actor could pull this off than Jim Carrey. The entire movie is like the court bathroom scene from "Liar, Liar" in which he throws himself around as if he's being beat up by a ghost. Carrey has given both Charlie (good cop) and Hank (the bad cop) distinct personalities and mannerisms. When he changes from one to the next it is seamless and a complete top to bottom transformation. Great work. In fact, his work as Hank ranks as one of the best acting jobs the guy has ever done. His all-to-brief moments as the bad cop find Carrey at the hight of his cool deadpan delivery and impeccable comic timing. In the 3rd act when the two personalities finally meet and duke it out over control of Charlie's body it is a tour de force of physical comedy that, while not necessarily funny, reminds us we are seeing one of the most gifted comedians of our time. Next to him is "damsel in distress" Renee Zellwegger with her puckered-up lips and midriff. Casting and cute leading lady: check.After that we run into problems. As fascinating as it is to watch Carrey and Zellwegger, the movie takes it's premise and squashes is into a simple run-from-the-bad-guys action/comedy/road trip/mobster flick. Those moments of seeing Carrey do his thing are surrounded by long, dead patches of exposition and poorly executed jokes on lame stationary targets. Rumor has it that this was an early Farrelly brother script that they pulled out of a drawer and blew mothballs off after the success of 'Mary'. Not surprising, because the film is written and gags are executed as if we've never seen this stuff before. But it's not necessarily the script that's the problems - some lines are quite good - it's the sheer shoddy direction of the Farrelly brothers that sap out any comedic potential. In one rudimentary joke, Irene walks in on Charlie as he lays in bed with her picture on the other pillow - the camera pans over to the bottle of hand lotion on the dresser and we see Irene's reaction (over and over). While the Farrelly's are not exactly masters of subtlety they have been able to stage similar gags (as the masturbation scene in 'Mary') with far more inventiveness than this. The jokes are so tired, old and delivered at such a base level that it is almost painful to watch at times. As such, "Irene" never achieves the gross-out comedy status it aims for. A gross-out comedy seeks to shock us with it's excesses, but "Irene" just gutlessly retraces mined-out gags. It feels it can just show us something and get a laugh without any comedic effort.It does have it's moments: such as Carrey's 3 big constantly bickering black sons, a narrator straight out of a Disney film strip or a post-coital trip to the bathroom so brilliantly executed it belongs in a different movie. A few chuckles do pop up here and there - so out of place with the idiocy of the rest of the movie it is undoubtedly improving from Carrey (as when he asks a pair of butched-out lesbians "How's it hangin' fellas"). However, any inspired moment is quickly interrupted by a shootout, a scene of Chris Cooper's corrupt lieutenant conspiring or something else the brothers are using to pad this lousy plot. Even in the lamest of Farrelly brother comedies there has always been a sweet natured backbone to the proceedings. Not only is that lacking here , but "Me, Myself &amp; Irene" is actively mean-spirited - particularly to it's lovable goof Charlie.The Farrelly brothers normally get laughs from the many oddball characters and situations they throw into every angle of their films. In this movie just as many plates are spinning in the air, but they seem to have forgotten how to deliver on the gags. By shackling the stars down to this ridiculous storyline it seems like they don't have faith in the talents of Carrey and Zellwegger or don't know that just letting them vamp off each other (as Carrey and Jeff Daniels did in 'Dumb and Dumber') could have driven this movie without the aid of an artificial studio plot. Shame too, it could have been great. "Me, Myself &amp; Irene" is a great idea so poorly done it is a good candidate to be ripped up and remade (or turned into a sitcom) in a few decades.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After "The Truman Show", I felt Jim Carrey had arrived as an A-List dramatic actor, offering much more depth than he'd previously exhibited with his physical style of slapstick comedy. He was now a true actor, capable of opening and carrying a major release. So then, why did he team up with the Farrelly brothers and make this piece of tripe? OK, smack me; he did it for a $20 million payday.But talk about bad choices, this has got to be one of the worst big-budget movies of 2000. Ok, it's a Farrelly brothers movie, so you know the humor will be on the far gross side of good taste. But in their earlier movies such as "Kingpin", "Dumb and Dumber", and especially "There's Something About Mary", the Farrellys cultivated a sense of humanity. The audience had a connectedness with the characters and their dilemmas, which helps make the jokes work. Not so, in "Me, Myself and Irene". It's like a crummy nightclub comic who tries to make his unfunny material funny by telling the same jokes over, and over, and over. I won't go into the plot, it's unimportant to my opinion of this movie. That is, that this movie is an unfunny, offensive waste of celluloid. I can think of no reason to recommend it to anybody.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Me, Myself and Irene: Charlie Bailygates is the classic "Nice Guy"- a devoted father, he is raising his three boys on his own, treats everyone with respect, and never gets angry. Unfortunately, people take advantage of his good nature and treat him like a joke, until one day, his repressed feelings come to the surface and he snaps. Diagnosed with split personality disorder he is given a prescription to avoid future rampages. Soon after, while delivering a prisoner cross-country, Charlie loses his pills and chaos ensues.The Farrely brothers first gained notoriety with "Dumb and Dumber", but it was their success with the over-the-top-gross- out comedy "Something About Mary" that solidified their position as the new wunderkinds of humor. I can only help they're soon dethroned.I will admit that there were a couple of scenes that made me laugh, but in order to understand the level that they have sunk to imagine that in the first five minutes of the movie you get to view a close-up of a Great Dane defecating on a lawn. Do I need to see this? No. Did I find it funny? No - it was pathetic. Other scenes are almost as bad - Carrey pretending to be an infant and sucking on a woman's breast, or the repeated use of a sex toy to garner laughs come to mind. Also, attempts to shock the audience with never ending streams of profanity quickly grow tiresome - after hearing mother****** for the umpteenth time, you become numb. The performances are lackluster at best.No one would argue that Carrey is a gifted physical comedian - I especially enjoyed his work as an impersonator, because he not only got the voices bang on, he transformed into the person. So, why is he choosing such lousy scripts? Carrey spends the bulk of the movie rehashing past performances - once you've seen "The Mask", and his Fire Marshall Bill character (from his "In Living Color" days) this seems like a cheesy rerun.If you are a die-hard Jim Carrey fan, and like anal insertion jokes, go to this movie - at a matinee.Note: this is not suitable for kids, or anyone with an above average IQ or good taste. You have been warned.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the Farrelly Brothers' `Me, Myself &amp; Irene,' Jim Carrey gets to run through his considerable bag of tricks playing a Jekyll and Hyde-type character who, as a Rhode Island state trooper, finds himself escorting a young woman back to the authorities in Upstate New York. Playing a man suffering from a split personality ? one nice, the other psychotic ? Carrey is free to pull out all the stops in terms of mugging, pratfalls and plain old-fashioned silliness. No comic actor working in movies today is more adept than Carrey is at the instant transitioning between seeming normalcy and uncontrolled mania. Yet, for all his hard work here, the Farrellys, who seem to have plateau-ed in this work, have left Carrey pretty much stranded in the script department this time out. Perhaps the shtick is simply starting to get old and, as a result, for all the film's humorous, inventive moments, `Me, Myself &amp; Irene' feels strangely stale. Even Carrey seems at times to be just going through the motions ? picking up a fat paycheck doing what he's done numerous times before while waiting for that next big `legitimate' project like `The Truman Show' to come along.Don't get me wrong. No movie written and directed by the Farrellys and starring Carrey and Renee Zellweger can fail to elicit its fair share of laughs. Some of the concepts are simply so outrageous that they can't help but be funny. But that is a far cry from a fully integrated work of comic intelligence ? a result these gifted filmmakers, working together, have been able to achieve several times in the past (to great box office success, I might add). Regrettably, for all its moments of inspired zaniness and silliness, `Me, Myself &amp; Irene' finds both Carrey and the Farrelly Brothers marking time and resting on their laurels. I think it's time for all of them to move on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Jim Carrey flop!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I won't spend much time on this one. I was really disappointed with this film. Jim Carrey movies are usually pretty good with the a few notable exceptions. This will be one of them. The humor was crass and was poorly written into the script. The script was bad to begin with and the plot was predictable. These two things combined just destroyed the film. Jim Carrey, to his credit did his best but he had no help and the film as a whole, lacked taste.Overall, don't bother (2 out of 10).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What do you do to save a comedy that isn't funny? If you're Jim Carrey and the Farrelly Brothers, you add more lines to the script that end in 'muthafu**ka' or 'up your a**'. This, at least, fills the theater with laughter if there are enough 10 year-olds in the audience.I gave this flick a '2' only because Renée Zellweger is in the cast. Without her, it would rate a 'zer0'. If Carrey stars in any more turkeys like this one, he'll end up in the Home for Forgotten Actors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More stupid, disgusting "shock smut". Even Carrey can't save this one!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was disappointed in this juvenile film.While it had some potential in its concept it quickly revealed itself as a film which tries to get laughs by shocking the audience with disgust and teenage "toilet humour". "Pull my finger" is a classy joke compared to most of this film.It's amazing Jim Carrey agreed to participate in this movie at this point in his career. No matter what you might think of him, he's too good for such adolescent smut. His portrayal was reasonable and was one of the best aspects of the film. Still, however, it was too "stereotypical Carrey" to be noteworthy.There were some funny moments. However they were not enough to fill a 30 minute sitcom repleat with commercials, titles and credits.There was far too much swearing. It was clearly thrown in for more shock value. There also was a very racist suggestion in this movie that black people will use "F" every other word and act like hoodlums no matter how intelligent they are, even if they are raised by an upstanding white state trooper.I can only recommend this film to teenagers and street hoodlums who think that the more shockingly disgusting, the funnier. If you're a Jim Carrey fan, you may want to particularly avoid it so that you can maintain some modicum of respect for his work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me start off by saying I really liked There's Something About Mary, and I also liked Jim Carrey in all of his movies that I've seen (The Mask, Ace Ventura, Truman Show, Man in the Moon). I won't refrain from watching a movie just because some overprotective parents or idiotic congressmen think it's too violent or has naughty words in it or makes fun of the mentally ill. However, this movie just doesn't do it for me.On paper, the casting of Jim Carrey as a man with split personalities is great - the second coming of Jerry Lewis ought to be perfectly able to play two different characters merely by changing facial expressions. But other than the first time he appears, Jim's crazed alterego Hank isn't over-the-top evil enough to be funny. He gets beat up by everyone and even apologizes for being rude at one point. The main personality, mild-mannered Charlie, is put down by everyone in the beginning, but he could have been put down much more, and in funnier ways. Jim Carrey's final confrontation with himself should have been much funnier, but it wasn't because the characters had not been developed enough. It was basically just more of Carrey beating himself up, and that's just not funny anymore.The weak script shows itself in many other ways. It is never really made clear just what Renee Zellweger is doing in Rhode Island in the first place, or just why two crooked cops from New York are allowed to chase them into Rhode Island. There are many slow points in the movie papered over with loud pop music (I counted something like 34 songs in the soundtrack). Having swearing black genius triplets sounds like it would be funny, but for the most part, it isn't here. The narration, which was obviously meant to be funny in the classic Phil Hartman style, is painfully tedious. All of the Farrellys' previous gross-out comedies - Something about Mary, Dumb and Dumber, Kingpin - were really romantic comedies for guys. This movie fails in that respect.There are plenty of people who would not watch this movie just because of the language and shock value, but on top of that I can add another reason - it's just not very funny. The audience I watched it with obviously expected to laugh - many people were laughing in the beginning, even when there was no apparent joke. However, by the end of the movie everyone seemed to be pretty much sick of the whole thing - very few people laughed during the last twenty minutes or so, especially with the thumb incident, which seemed to cast a pall over the rest of the movie. There are some really funny parts in the middle, but they are isolated gags.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a wacky movie! It gets most of the "stars" in the rating here for the entertainment value of the film. As low-brow as it is in spots, you never get bored watching it. In a nutshell, Jim Carrey plays a schizophrenic Rhode Island state trooper. There are lots of outrageous scenes in this film, most of them in the first half. Some, such as with the cows or Carrey taking a poop on a neighbor's lawn, are memorable in a perverse way.Rene Zellweger is too profane to begin with, but she settles down as the story goes on. She and Carrey sure make an "odd couple."We get the PC baloney here of the black characters all being smarter than the white folks. The black kids cannot speak a sentence, however, without some profanity it it. The people who made this film are known for their sleazy comedies.That overall sleazy feel to this dark-slapstick comedy makes me hesitate to recommend it, but if a lot of "language" doesn't bother you - or dildo jokes, believe-it-or-not, this will entertain you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is hard to believe a film as sick and trashy as this could have any admirers, but on the other hand, one person labeling those who would like it as "right wingers" is in itself an indicator of a pretty loony tunes view. And another reviewer thinks "gun nuts" would find shooting a poor cow six times in the head was funny! Are you insane?? I am a gun person and I was sickened by such a thing being humorous to a Hollywood moron. Some reviewers are more on the fringe than the actors who took the roles in this movie. This supposed comedy movie pushes beyond any limit in foul language, mostly applied to black characters, it has Carrey in his usual over-the -top trashy characterizations, the man simply goes way, way too far, every time, unfortunately in this movie there are too many opportunities for him to do so. The crudity and vulgarity displayed throughout this movie is so far out of bounds it stretches credulity. It is sad our out of touch, sick, Hollywood directors and producers think this sort of garbage has any value, any use to further advance or amuse a reasonable decent person in any category. It insults the sense of dignity and humor of all but the most scummy type of person, the ones who can't visualize anything without crudity, who probably can't say a three word sentence without three vulgar words. A reasonable, decent person is getting hard to find judging by the number of people who rated this cesspool above a one scale. To see Renee Zellweger doing this doesn't say much for her either. Carrey leans toward this type of crap, can't ignore his glee in stuff like this. How desperate can an actor be... washing dishes is honorable, starring in trash like this is not. Too bad it can't be rated zero.</fullReview>

The movie did well enough in taking its time to build on the background story of how Charlie unknowingly created Hank. But that's just about it. Besides Jim Carey's awesome performance, there's little more that this movie has to offer. Renee Zellweger did just enough for her parts. The story gets flawed as many of the scenes didn't have adequate transition and instead edited poorly that scene cuts feel strange. Chris Cooper and Richard Jenkins also didn't create believable characters since their screen time is often too brief.</fullReview>

When she had given birth, the children born were black. He keeps the kids as she rides off into the sunset. How he raised the three black kids would have really been hilarious.Instead, the movie goes downhill quickly as Irene, Renee Zellwegger, enters as a young lady falsely accused of working with someone in cheating the EPA. There are corrupt cops and all in this farce.Jim Carrey, our Rhode Island police officer, has a split personality. Much of the film is devoted to his hitting himself as he assumes a double identity. When he is the slick Hank, he sounds like Clint Eastwood with that gravel voice.Then, there is Whitey, a young guy who attached himself to Carrey and Zellwegger, claiming that he hacked his family up.

		<fullReview>The idea is priceless, a sort of anti-psycho. What could be worse than a split personality cop, well perhaps a movie that does such a fellow injustice would qualify. Me, Myself and Irene is not terrible, but I don't recommend it. The quality of Carry's performance is inconsistent, half the jokes are not funny and Renée Zelwegger is useless, as she is in almost everything (Cold Mountain aside).Jim Carrey as a Rhode Island State Trooper is in for the ride of his life, when he becomes escort to a lady who is being chased by the mob and some crooked feds. Is Carrey's split personality gonna save them or get them in trouble.It is not until the climax when Carrey really shows his colors. Up till then, we have to put up with him bouncing back and forth between half geek, half e jerk, and he isn't much good at either until he becomes both at the same time, and starts fighting with himself. If Renee Zellweger was funnier it may have also taken a little out of the tedium of a fairly dull first hour. There is a nice sub-plot gag of Carrey's three adopted black sons, trying to find their dad on the run, during which they have to (among other things) pilot a chopper using the manual which is in German. Perhaps it's just a matter of taste, but Me, Myself, and Irene despite its moments feels insufficient.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe my vote of 1 will lower the average for this dreadful film. Where do you start ? Racist, regionalist, making fun of mental illness and disablement. The old 'gems' about how black people can't speak without swearing, and how they have huge genitals. This political incorrect rubbish from the 1970's must have been enjoyed by right wingers and rednecks all over the world. It was all without any ironic sense, or wink to the camera. Then we have the main plot. The split personality. This appeared ripped off from Terry Pratchett's 'Witches' Trilogy. There the character was a female witch, not a male cop, but otherwise the same. No I'm sorry, Terry's one was funny and witty. The rest of the plot was dire. I actually wanted the baddies to shoot Carrey as he was so horrible in both his personalities. Also I wanted poor Rene's character to dump him as a life married to either personality would have been unbearable. The amount of left over footage hinted at by the stills included in the closing credits, plus the awful continuity which was left in, presumably because the crew were as bored as we were and couldn't be bothered to fix the bugs, really says it all.

		<shortDescription>Schizophrenic Movie !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the movie ended I was saying to myself "what a filthy good comedy that was". And not a "good filthy comedy", since I don't like filthy comedies. But sorrowfully it is one anyway! What made me sick is the beauty of this movie's concept. The talent of this comedy is untouchable. The schizophrenic disorder is such a different subject to produce laughs, and there are some smart points indeed. However they were all immersed, or just about to be, in deep free dirtiness.Pure filth can't be comic anytime. So when you put filthy cosmetics on real comedy, or put real comedy in filth, both ways it will stink.I believe we can't tell the artists the way movies have to be made. Only our criticism towards what they already made, which represents ? in the most objective way ? what could block their main idea or was bad in delivering it.Hence I don't know why (Carrey) had to show his penis for the ladies in the train station. Why to "see" that dog excretes for real in Carrey's land. Or what was the need to watch his thumb getting exploded. And with dildo, masturbation, and vagina unstoppable jokes the whole thing turned into a tale written over a dirty bathroom in a high school with all the urine, excrement and blood too ! What a twisted teenagers that was made for ?! (or What a twisted teenagers the Farrellys are ?!). But this twisted teenager sense of nauseating fun's fans do exist. And whenever there is something with fans, Hollywood's enthusiasm must exist as well ! I was in pain. Not because being sick to my stomach for most of the time. But for the smart points (remember them ?!). Though, it's the Farrelly brother's method of making movies; layer of good comedy, then layer of dirt. You can love it, hate it, or cut out the stuff that attracted you to have the movie you love more, like what some do in youtube's limited 10 minutes of "parts we love from movies".But movies can't be just "parts". It's a whole one piece of art. So according to that Me, Myself &amp; Irene is half comic, real smart. And half disgusting, cheap, easy, and real turn off. Well, even some movies can be schizophrenic too! In a word : I can't watch it "wholly" again. However the painful thing is that I wouldn't find the parts I loved in youtube. Filthy seemed more needed nowadays !</fullReview>

This is a big gamble of a flick, violent even outside the accepted parameters of the slapstick Carrey trades in. One might also notice that it comes shotgun with Zellweger's Nurse Betty, another nervous comedy concerning pathologies and their darker sides.I admire all this (this is a fairly thoughtful Farrelly brothers movie rather than one of the later, lazy, gross-out offense-as-humour effort). I like Carrey very much and I think Zellweger once again finds a sympathetic, marginalised femininity that only indie stars like Chritina Ricci, Thora Birch or latterly Maggie Gyllenhaal have essayed. The film is rough though and the humour doesn't mitigate against the dark stuff - it's not that subtle a satire - but rather plugs in to the peripheral needling of the Richard Prior and Chris Rock stand-up gurgling away in the background. 4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is about a loser policeman called Charlie, and his antisocial and aggressive split personality called Hank.I am quite ambivalent about "Me, Myself &amp; Irene" . On one hand, the first half is funny. It is fun to see how much of a loser Charlie is, and to see him get humiliated all the time by everyone. The introduction of Hank's antisocial behaviour is also funny, light hearted and memorable. It gives a stark contrast between the two split personalities. However, in the second half of the film, things turn downhill. There are some cool moves, such as Carrey dragging himself up by the ear. However, these cool moves become tiring in large doses. In the end, it basically becomes Jim Carrey's one man show. It becomes boring, repetitive and uninspired.Fortunately, Renée Zellweger is sweet and lovely as ever, saving the film from being annoying. I really like the line where Renée Zellweger exclaims that she has no eating disorder. She is one of the few actresses who does not have a size zero frame. It serves as a protest about the body image distortion in Hollywood.I think Jim Carrey needs to move on from being funny by silly facial expressions and weird body movements. He can do better.</fullReview>

It's a good movie, and anyone who doesn't like it has no sense of humor. Come on, a dildo in his OWN azz???? And then he finds out he stuck it there himself??? That was funny stuff. Whether you "admit" you like raunchy dildo humor, or fart humor, or anything along those lines, you HAVE to laugh when he wakes up and pees all over the wall, and then finds out about the dildo being stuck up his azz. And later when Irene informs him that he stuck it up his OWN azz that was funny as hell too. The "fight" scenes by the train, with the "get yer foot long and a bag of nuts" was hilariously funny. The "fight" scene in the Mustang wasn't quite as funny, but that was funny too. Some of the most funny scenes were made with his foul mouthed, brilliant, BLACK "sons." The fact that he never really acknowledged that they weren't biologically his sons, but you knew that deep down he knew it and loved them anyway, it was rather endearing. And come on, the cop with the chicken up his azz, that was funny shite. This was classic Jim Carrey, and a great movie. NOBODY could have played a schizophrenic psychopath who fought with himself, and acted like an azz as well as Jim Carrey. And as for Irene, Renee Zellweger, she played the perfect victim/fugitive. The side plot with them falling in love was a perfect addition. At the end when Charlie "gets the girl" and the whole way in which he has her pulled over to ask her to marry him is great. I'm not a movie critic in any way, but I know what I like and I like this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let it be known that Jim Carrey is my favorite actor of all time and for him to be in a movie with the Farrelly Brothers (Peter and Bobby) that is just pretty amazing (Jim being in "Dumb and Dumber" for them before this would explain why he went back). Another gross out comedy along the lines of "There's Something About Mary", "Me, Myself and Irene" is brimming with lots of fun and great characters. The story goes like this: Charlie Baileygates (Carrey) is a nice guy Rhode Island State Trooper who fell in love with the popular girl (Trayler Howard). On their wedding day, she falls in love with the black limo driver (Tony Cox, in a small role) she gives birth to three black babies: Shonte Jr Bailygates, Jamaal Bailygates, and Lee Harvey Baileygates (Jerod Nixon, Anthony Anderson, and Mongo Brownlee). She leaves Charlie and he is left to raise the three boys. After she left him he became a victim of multiple personality disorder. Charlie goes back to work and his alter ego Hank Evans (Carrey) comes out to play. The State Troopers take in a woman, Irene P Waters (Renee Zellegger) and Charlie must escort her to another location to get her away from her ex boyfriend. Along the way Hank comes out to formally introduce himself to Irene, and chaos ensues. Carrey and Zellegger work wonders with each other and bounce the story back and forth from each other. All in all this is probably one of my favorite Jim Carrey movies to date.3 out of 4 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jim Carrey in another 10-star performance. For a mere 7-star movie.Where one has come to expect simply another mugging, scenery-chewing turn from Jim Carrey, in *Me, Myself and Irene* he surprises elegantly with his controlled portrayal of amiable Charlie Baileygates, a disrespected Rhode Island police officer whose retention of insults, barbs, put-downs and slurs causes a flamboyant, narcissistic, violent alter-ego to emerge, "Hank." While helping a wrongly-accused fugitive (Renée Zellweger) flee corrupt police, Charlie inadvertently keeps reverting to Hank whenever adversity surfaces. At first, the two characters inhabit Charlie's body exclusively one at a time, but as the stakes ramp up towards the chase finale (as it always does in comedies of this nature), the two personalities battle one another for supremacy. Carrey's acting skills are never more apparent than in his constant, convincing switching from, as the slogans say, "gentle to mental." The wealth of nuance and detail with which Carrey fleshes out these disparate personalities is a wonder to behold.With the Farrelly Brothers helming this project, one can safely say it is not for a family audience, with savage forays into the realm of bad taste, black humor and political incorrectness.</fullReview>

Adam Sandler looks like haute coture by comparison; "South Park" (the TV series) classic high comedy. Evidently, the filmmakers here lack the ability to be clever without being so excessively "edgy" that you would never want to watch it with your kids at any age - unless you're the type of parent that thinks you should look the other way when they get into your "stash" and that it's just fine when your 15-year-old gets pregnant. It is most definitely NOT "good fun" as some have phrased it; CADDDYSHACK was good fun, ANIMAL HOUSE was good fun, but this is is so far over the top it is just trash. I notice in the IMDb bio of Jim Carrey that he has one daughter; I wonder how he felt about the idea of her seeing this thing when it premiered? (Then again, according to the bio he was married and divorced three times before the age of 36 - chances are he doesn't know which way is up, anyway.) Seriously, it is a perfect example of how pop culture has gone completely into the toilet over the past generation, with nothing but increasingly rancid manifestations to be expected in the foreseeable future. Were it a stand-alone example it might be easy to dismiss, but instead this sort of thing only represents a new low watermark for others to emulate and even try to "top" in the future. It is a real shame because Renee Zellweger is one of my favorites and Carrey is certainly capable of better. It is a worse shame that stars of this magnitude of both popularity and talent serve to elevate this garbage to the level of mainstream entertainment. When you think of some of the great comedies American film-making has produced - HARVEY, THE SEVEN YEAR ITCH, American GRAFFITTI - where are we going from here? And finally - how do you put zero stars on this thing, anyway?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ha! I Just Kept On Laughing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How can I sum up this movie in one word? HILARIOUS! Jim Carrey puts on an outstanding, comical performance as Charlie Baileygates, a guy who everyone knows is real lenient and never sticks up for himself, he just won't say no, even when he wants to. He develops a split personality, and the other personality is Hank Evans, a guy with a foul attitude. Charlie must protect, Irene Waters (Zellweger) from her corrupt ex-boyfriend, who is out to hurt her. You'll crack up when Charlie suddenly becomes Hank at the worst times and his antics are completely outrageous! There is a lot of language and crude humor in this movie, so you may want to take precautions with younger viewers, but it is definitely one of the most comical films I have seen in a while.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jim Carrey, the Farrelly brothers &amp; a disaster of a film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We all(well, most of us, at least) know Jim Carrey... the master of physical comedy and facial comedy. We also know the Farrelly brothers, who've done a lot of R-rated crude comedies lately, and who directed Carrey earlier in Dumb &amp; Dumber. Now, imagine that these meet, in a movie that's typical for the Farrelly's, with Jim acting the way he always does(which is usually funny, even in bad movies). Sounds great, right? Wrong. Wrong, wrong, wrong. The film has virtually no laughs at all, as it's taken to the extremes and beyond... constantly. The humor tries far too hard to be funny and shocking, and winds up being disgusting and embarrassing. The only laughs come from the three black teens in the film, one of whom being the nearly always funny Anthony Anderson, probably better known from Scary Movie 3. Their characters talk like black rappers or kids from the ghetto(swear words, yelling) but are very intelligent, at the same time. This has a bit of a comedic effect, even though it's just a gimmick and it does wind up getting old, about half-way through the film. Carrey himself has some funny bits, but too much of it is just not him; he's supposed to make funny faces, say funny noises and jump around. That's him at his best. The first Ace Ventura film is a good example of this, as is Liar Liar. However, in this film he doesn't get to use his talent for physical comedy all that much. Half of the physical comedy is just him being beaten up... it was good to see him fight himself, but there was too little of it. And why does half of the humor center around Carrey being humiliated? The director of Ace Ventura 2(Steve Oedekerk) made the same mistake, and look how (un)popular that film was. In conclusion, the only right director for Carrey is Tom Shadyac(Ace Ventura, Liar Liar and Bruce Almighty), at least in my opinion. The plot is daft and poorly paced. The acting is nothing special. The characters are cardboard cutouts and stereotypes. The dialog holds very few memorable quotes, though there are a few. All in all, the film is just bad, by Carrey's and the Farrelly's standards(and all other standards, for that matter). I recommend it only to the biggest fans of Jim Carrey and the Farrelly brothers. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was just too ridiculous and out of line to enjoy- I didnt understand why the writers and director put the big black guys (not even racially-mixed men) in the movie or even wanted us to believe they were supposed to be his children- to start the movie out with his wife giving birth to the 3 babies and running off with that midget guy could of been left out. I really liked the Farrelly Brothers' Shallow Hall since it had a message and was made alot better than this one was. What was the message from Me, Myself and Irene, other than the fact that crudeness doesn't always mean funny? This movie gets **** out of ten, and I'm feeling generous.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jim Carrey is a comedic genius, period. I don't care if you dislike him or hate his guts. If you deny his talent, you are kidding yourself. The Farrelly Brothers obviously realize this. So they did the smart thing, they turned him loose to go absolutely wild. And does Carey go wild. This film deals with a softy cop (played by Carrey) that has been dumped on his whole life. Moreover, everybody in the town treats him like a chump. One day, this softy cop just snaps, and an alter-ego is unleashed. This alter-ego is vile and sick, the complete opposite of Carrey's real character. Of course, like the Incredible Hulk, Hank (evil persona) is brought out whenever Charlie (good persona) is mad. Now, I know why some people dislike this film. Charlie's three African American sons use more curse words than Tony Montana trying to start an old lawn mower. There are numerous scenes with things placed into certain openings of the human body and well, some strong stuff. However, if you accept that this is just a silly comedy, everything is OK. I have laughed out loud all the way through this film, every time I have seen it. So, brace yourself and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jim Carrey was incredible when his two characters fought with each other in the one body!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now you realize before you ever watch a movie like this that you will have to suspend belief in a few things, including definitions of "split personality" and "schizophrenia", so that aside, this is a pleasant comedy that looks at what could happen to a very nice man who never has the courage to stand up for himself, and is always a Mr. Milktoast (even though he is a State Patrolman). The suppressed anger and rage build up in him until one day they errupt, and his rage side comes out whenever he sees something happen that he feels should be corrected, while the person doing it just flaunts it in his face. It turns into a crazy adventure story, in which his two sides alternately come out, and both of them try to win Renee Zellweger's character, as they try to outrun crooked law enforcement agents. It was an enjoyable zany movie, but the absolute standout scenes in the movie involved Jim Carrey's performance, as his two sides decide to have it out with each other, but all while occupying the same body. Carrey is known for being a tremendously physical comedic actor, but this is beyond extreme ultra! I have frank admiration for what he pulled off, and it has to be seen to be believed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Further proof that There's Something About Mary was a fluke.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm no major Farrelly brothers fand but I enjoyed 'There's Something About Mary' a lot, and I think Jim Carrey is a very funny guy (though his movies are very uneven), so this one looked like a must see on paper. I paid my money, I sat in the theatre, and didn't get ONE laugh throughout the whole movie. It was on TV again the other night so I thought I'd give it another try, as comedy is such a touch and go thing. Second viewing, the movie was even more tedious. Carrey as I say is a very funny guy with a gift for physical comedy, but the script for 'Me, Myself &amp; Irene' just STINKS. It's like the first dumb idea that came into their heads was enough - a dwarf with nunchucks, a dying cow, a chicken's head up someone's butt - these are not necessarily intrinsically funny things! You need to MAKE them funny. I couldn't care less about good or bad taste if the gags make you laugh, and they just didn't. The repititious use of the same piece of drum music EVERY time Carrey "transformed", his three overweight black sons' lame and unfunny schtick, these were irritating, not amusing. And seeing great actors like Chris Cooper, and especially Robert Forster getting involved with this garbage was just depressing. I'm sorry, this is just a lousy movie, and further proof that 'There's Something About Mary' was a fluke. One of the worst so-called comedies I've had to endure in recent years. Avoid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has its moments, but like most Farrelly brother movies it has a lot boring scenes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For my money, Dumb and Dumber was the best Farrelly brother movie. It was nonstop comedy all they way through and they maintained it with almost no scenes that didn't have any comedy. This movie has some really funny scenes, but it also has a lot of pointless scenes where no joke was made or if it was it fell flat. Carrey is great, but he is always good in comedy. Rene is okay as his love interest, but for the most part she isn't very funny. This is the story of a guy who suppresses his anger after his wife leaves him for another man. She also leaves him the kids who are obviously the children of the other man. His anger reaches an explosive level and finally comes out in the funniest scenes of the movie. After that he has to escort Irene (Rene), and there are people after them. The jokes after the great coming out scene are hit and miss for the most part. Some of the jokes are great, others not so good. This movie is also a bit to long, another Farrelly brother flaw and this movie really runs ten or fifteen more minutes than it should have. For the most part though it is a rather good comedy to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When this movie was first released, I resisted the urge to see it just on the strength of Jim Currey. Watching it on TV several years later confirmed that it was a correct decision.The Jackle and Hyde situation has been used many times, back to good old Jerry Lewis, or maybe even further. Currey is not particularly brilliantly here. It's interesting to watch only because nobody has done it recently.I was not particuarly turned off by the jokes which many poeple describe as "gross", "disgusting" etc. I simply found them stale, overdone, and uninteresting. I got a laugh here and there but the aggregate of those laughs still do not add up to the admission price. I am therefore glad that I watched it on TV.Currey is capable of excellent work but I guess he makes movie as a job, not as as artist. An occasional slip is normal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Film That Demonstrates the Dangers of A Split Personality!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>[CONTAINS SPOILERS] Charlie Baileygates is an easy-going, modest trooper in the Rhode Island State Police. He has met the love of his life, Layla and the two are soon married and move into a house beside the sea. Now Charlie asked the limo driver, "Do you people take checks?" The limo driver, being an African American midget, took the question the wrong way and thought Charlie was being racist so they get into a fight. Layla sides with the driver, Shonte. The two soon become close and soon Layla is pregnant. She gives birth to three kids: all black, but Charlie doesn't mind. But one day Layla leaves with Shonte, leaving Charlie all alone with his new kids: Jamaal, Lee Harvey and Shonte Jr. They grew up watching Richard Pryor and Chris Rock on HBO so they grew up cursing. Charlie ventured into town one day and is taken advantage of by all. Suddenly, something happens within Charlie and he begins wreaking havoc on the town and calls himself Hank Evans. When Charlie returns, he's diagnosed with having a split personality, or pschitsofrenia (Is that how you spell it?). That day, a frustrated girl, Irene Waters, is brought in the police station. She's wanted for a hit and run in Mesena, New York. The Colonel orders Charlie to take her to Mesena and then take a vacation so Charlie and Irene hop on Charlie's motorcycle and drive north. En route, they find a cow lying in the road. Charlie tries to put it out of it's misery...Most unsuccessfully. When they arrive in Mesena, Irene is interrogated. She learns she's wanted for more than hit and run. She was originally employed by a Dickie Thurman at a golf course. Suddenly, a gunman bursts in and kills the cops but Irene escapes. She runs into Charlie and the two run off together. Jamaal, Lee Harvey and Shonte Jr. are notified and come along with the police. Charlie's alter ego, Hank, makes another appearance and tries to move in on Irene; Lt. Gerke was hot on Charlie's trail. Charlie's boys tried to tell him that Charlie was innocent but he wouldn't listen; pretty soon, Charlie and Irene become down on their luck. They push their stolen car into a lake with Charlie's wallet still in it and Hank told Irene to kick him in the face so they'd get sympathy money, which didn't work, leaving Charlie bruised and bemused. They stop at a diner where Hank insults the Albino waiter, Whitey, who joins them on their trek. They stop at a motel in Vermont. Charlie, Irene and Hank all make love that night. The police arrive but luckily Charlie and Irene were long gone. They excluded Whitey but he decided to follow them on the side. A "friend" in the Rhode Island State Police ratted out Charlie so now they were on Charlie's tail. Charlie and Irene take a train to Rhode Island. Dickie boarded and tried to kill Charlie, but it was Hank to the rescue. When the train stopped, Dickie made off with Irene and Charlie followed, arguing with Hank along the way. Charlie managed to conquer Hank and make him vanish. He acted bravely in rescuing Irene and Whitey took out Dickie. Charlie and Irene were rescued by Lee Harvey, Jamaal and Shonte Jr. who "borrowed" a police helicopter. So, Charlie and Irene were married and lived happily ever after and Charlie's name had been cleared and is still a dutiful trooper of the best damn law enforcement agency in the country: The Rhode Island State Police. This is a funny movie! One of Jim Carrey's funniest! It's directed from the Farrelly brothers who worked with Carrey in Dumb &amp; Dumber, which I hear is getting a sequel, or rather a prequel. Anyway, Reneé Zellwegger, what can I say? I'm not a traditional Zellwegger fan. I don't like anything she'd done, but keep trying, Honey! Now Charlie's sons were FUNNY! Always using bad language and the scene where Charlie tries to kill the cow is priceless! Why badmouth this movie? It's great! I know Jim's been doing serious films lately, but don't despair! Jim will be back to being funny this spring in Bruce Almighty! Until then, I recommend Me, Myself &amp; Irene! And remember that Carrey means Funny!...Probably doesn't, but it should! Because he is!-</fullReview>

The split personality didn't work for me, maybe because it wasn't split "enough". Actress Renee Z. probably didn't assist my liking of the film, I still haven't seen one film I thought she was watchable/believable in, and this one is on the top of that list.I love crude humor and although this was a good effort that started out with good intentions to be crude rude and funny, it eventually falls flat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had resisted for a long time seeing this film for two reasons. Jim Carrey playing Jim Carrey was getting a bit tired in my books, and further more I hadn't heard one good thing about this film. But searching one night for a DVD to rent I decided to check it out anyway ? mostly due to lack of anything better. Well, I didn't regret renting it, which must be a good thing. There were some laughable scenes, and Jim didn't too badly in playing two personalities. The way his kids were portrait I liked especially, as it was such a comic criticism about in which way those sort of characters are generally represented. But the film was weak. It had a strange mixture of seriousness and comedy which didn't work. The storyline was so thin that at times it seemed they were dragging out the scenes. And most surprisingly, even though the material surely generated great opportunities for laughable scenarios, it was reduced to some falling-on-your-face scenes. I enjoyed the beginning and the end, but became bored during the middle. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jim Carrey was unbelievably underrated for his genius performance in this, one of the funniest movies of 2000. many criticized "Me, Myself, and Irene" for being crude just for crudes sake, but at least most of the jokes were original (as in any Farrelly Brothers movie), and again, like in every Farrelly Brothers movie, there's always an underlying sweetness. while it's only the Farrelly Brothers third-best movie (1. Kingpin, 2. There's Something About Mary, 4. Dumb and Dumber, 5.Shallow Hal), they have an amazing track record, with 4 out of their 5 movies being 4 of the funniest movies of all time. "me, myself, and irene" falls into the small category of movies (which include "best in show" and "a fish called wanda") that never fails to cheer me up when I'm in a bad mood, and if you weren't a fan the first time around, check it out again and pay strict attention to Carrey's amazing physical and all-around performance."Did you just refer to yourself in the fifth-person?"- Irene</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like the title says it funny. From beginning to the end. Jim Carrey plays a great Skit-So. Bobby and Peter Farrelly did a great job making this movie. The cast is good as well. This movie is just so funny the whole family would get a kick out of. I give Me Myself and Irene a 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sometimes we need to watch a really bad movie, like this, to fully appreciate the very good ones.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS - About 22 minutes into this film I was convinced that it was a very bad movie when Jim Carrey's character began nursing at the breast of the woman who was nursing her child in public. Of course it was a prosthetic breast, made to look very real, but the scene set the example for "bad taste" (no pun intended) which the rest of the film continued. The several scenes with the life-like dildo. The trash-talking but highly intelligent black triplet sons. Shooting the cow in the road. Crapping on the neighbor's lawn. I actually thought the one where he was peeing on the wall was pretty funny, as juvenile as it was.Normally I don't fault the actors for a bad job done by the writer and director. But here I DO fault Carrey and Zellweger for not having better judgement. The Farrelly brothers gave us zany comedies I really enjoyed - "Dumb and Dumber" and "Something About Mary." In both of those they pushed the humor right up to the point where it became distasteful, but never crossed that line. However, in "Me, Myself, and Irene", they crossed the line early and often, and converted what started out as a good premise into a very bad movie. It is telling that the highest ratings come from "under-18 males", and the lowest from "45+ females." I give it "4" of 10, because I was entertained much of the time, and Carrey had a few good, funny scenes, but overall the movie missed its mark. After all, it isn't as bad as "The Blair Witch Project."The DVD is fine, with a great video transfer and an active Dolby 5.1 sound. The menus and "extras" are very interestingly done. I never considered watching the movie only part way, because we need to watch a really bad movie now and then, to be able to fully appreciate the good ones.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gross but Funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Farrelly brothers movie is gross but funny and it uses its gross humor to tell a story that is basically sweet. Despite its use of tasteless jokes such as black jokes, short jokes, sexually aberrant jokes, a traumatic amputation joke, and several murder jokes, "Me, Myself &amp; Irene" is a lot of fun -- if you know what you are getting into and steel yourself for it in advance. Jim Carrey's rubber-faced acting and his talent for physical comedy coupled with Rene Zellweger's sweet vulnerability make you root for them. 7 out of 10. Recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is basically a funny movie, with some very hilarious moments. Jim Carey is again outstanding, in his usual perverse way, and Renee is terrific. The movie goes over the line, and would have been better if the foul language, crude sexual references, and simply gross scenes were toned down. I don't want to sound like a prude, but this pushed the limits of decency and it doesn't speak well for where our society is going if this is the type of humor people truly want to see. Keep your children away from this one (and Grandma and Grandpa too).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was another highly touted Jim Carey vehicle that failed to live up to it's ballyhoo. You can spot bits of the old Carey talent here and there, but overall, this film just gets more ridiculous by the moment. I kept watching, hoping for some kind of cine-miracle, but alas, it was not forthcoming.Add to this the fact that someone in authority connected with this film, believes that Renee Zellweger is a "talented" actress. Bah! Take a close look at her in the two person scenes with Jim, and you'll see either the 55th take, where the Director couldn't take it anymore,or a truly bad job of acting and direction. In spots, she is actually "terrible", as in not believable at all.I gave the film every chance, but there's little acting substance here, even given the premise that Carey's character is a split-personality type, which would lend itself to zany actions...all well and good,but there is still the "acting" to contend with, and there was precious little of that in this movie.If you're a "total" Carey freak, then go for it, otherwise use your time to some better advantage, like reading the National Inquirer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Me, Myself and Irene is just another gross out comedy which really isn't any good. There have been some great ones, out in the past but over the last few months many of them have been total rubbish. Me, Myself and Irene is one of those movies, where you sit in the cinema and watch the movie, but you just want to walk out. Since, the masterpiece, There's Something About Mary, Bobby and Peter Farrelly have really only made flop movies, like this one and Say It Isn't So. Which is a shame really.This movie stars, Jim Carrey. (I think he's quite a good actor but I have never been to keen on some of his movies.) Here he stars as a man with a split personality. His love interest is played by real-life ex-girlfriend Renée Zellweger, who is really quite boring here, as is Jim Carrey. Even if you're a fan of the lead actors, I still don't think you'll enjoy this movie. I give Me, Myself and Irene a 2/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Me, Myself &amp; Irene challenges viewers with the troublesome politics of its comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Me, Myself &amp; Irene, pushes its comedy in the direction of parody. Populated by a series of extreme characters and a two-faced main character who either tolerates or openly mocks people.Charlie (Jim Carrey) is the laughingstock of the town. An extremely naive and insecure man, Charlie is constantly cheated, used and disrespected, in spite of the Rhode Island state police uniform he wears. Also feeling somewhat of an outsider inside his own home and around his three adopted sons (played by the amusing Anthony Anderson, Jerod Mixon and Mongo Brownlee), Charlie becomes the victim of his own anguish. Suddenly developing schizophrenia, his personality is split between Charlie and Hank, an extremely confrontational egomaniac who may only be appeased with medication. Charlie is challenged when he must follow a request to escort the attractive Irene (Renée Zellweger) to another city and evade corrupt police chief Joe (Chris Cooper) while the irrepressible Hank gains a life of his own. His condition is aggravated when feelings of love and desire enter the scene.Me, Myself &amp; Irene clearly relies on Carrey's physical comedy and on his portrayals of the extremely passive and victimized Charlie and the rambunctious, vulgar and sexually driven Hank. An excess number of scenes which serve to exemplify Charlie's lack of authority and Hank's disregard for authority prove the film's concern with creating a series of laughable tableaux over a well-constructed plot. Me, Myself &amp; Irene pushes its "politically incorrect" agenda by defining its targeted characters --a hotheaded dwarf, a timid albino, Charlie's overweight black sons, tortured animals, and a moronic-sounding narrator-- as laughable representations. Consequently, Me, Myself &amp; Irene exemplifies a degradation of comedy, where the excitability caused by such issues as racial prejudice, disease, animal cruelty, and masturbation is exploited for the sake of provoking the viewer. In spite of those rare moments when the film does manage to create some comic relief without aggression, as in those scenes which expose the common sense of Charlie's genius sons, Me, Myself &amp; Irene suffers its own identity crisis, as it lacks purpose, restraint and overall self-respect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thank you very much for taking the time to read my film review on ` Me, Myself and Irene' starring that sweet funnyman Jim Carrey. This film is about a police officer with a split personality who is infatuated with the woman he has to escort on assignment. Jim Carrey was just terrific and so were the black actors who played his sons. Please see it! I promise I won't lie to you. Oh no!!!! What is happening?????? Hey losers! I guess your lives must be so boring that you do not have anything else to do in your life but to read these film reviews. Maybe since your lives are so empty, you could go see `Me, Myself &amp; Irene' with you, yourself, and I- which are probably the only friends you got. Anyway, there were one too many scenes in this film that were of the same old slapstick variety. As you see, I give a split vote to `Me, Myself &amp; Irene.' ***Average</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The incident with the dwarf wasn't funny, it was stupid. It was the writer's intentions to make it an unusual reason why his first wife leaves him, but this wasn't very amusing. This is one of many instances plaguing our hero (none other than the rubberface comedian who is overpayed by Hollywood), a milquetoast state trooper who becomes fed up with everyone walking on him and forms a mean-spirited other personality to avenge the cruelty inflicted from others. When the tropper gets involved with a organized crime ring case involving a bombshell Golf Course worker (Renee Zelwegger) the plot thickens. This other personality also has its share of adventure. One of those dumb comedies which can be funny if you're in the right mood and not expecting anything special. However, I would recommend "Nurse Betty" over this, which coincidentally has a similiar plot as well as the same actress in the starring role.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Me, Myself &amp; Irene is one of those typically wacky comedies with mistaken identities and mental illness played off for laughs. Except the laughs are about as frequent as they would be for an actual mental patient - in other words, mental illness comedy ain't funny, it's forced.Jim Carrey plays Charlie, a Rhode Island state trooper who is cycling to upstate New York with a prisoner in tow - Irene (Rene Zellwegger), who has been accused of a hit-and-run crime in New York. Charlie seems like a nice guy, except Irene notices he takes pills. Why, she asks? Because, Charlie explains, if he doesn't take one every six hours he feels..... funny. Something about paranoid schizophrenia. Irene gives that old nod-and-smile reaction we've all given to someone before.There are two plots at work here. One is the someone-framed-Irene-and-we-know-who-but-the-good-guys-won't-until-the-end-of-the-movie plot, and the other is the one that tries to set the movie apart. Charlie's schizophrenia, you see, has manifested itself in the guise of Hank, a tough-talking, insensitive, loutish bully who is everything Charlie is not. Naturally, while Irene is in Charlie's custody, Hank comes out at certain times, and hilarity ensues. (Charlie also has three African American kids! His ex-wife ran off with a short-statured African American limo driver - coincidence? - and the three kids, now in high school, feature prominently in this film.)But for me, hilarity does NOT ensue. I found most of the jokes to be forced, even cloying. I found that I pitied Charlie more than I laughed with him. I found his romance of Irene (and don't forget, Zellwegger was his beau at the time) to be a little trite. To me, they didn't quite have the necessary chemistry. Yes, there were a few funny moments in the movie - and the kids were funny at times. I found this movie to be wildly uneven, funny in spots, dull in many others. I don't think Carrey's made a good film in a little while now, and I hope he can turn it around soon before he becomes the new Chevy Chase.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Charlie is a mild mannered police officer raising three sons (that are not really his) after his wife leaves. Years of abuse and accepting demands from the locals makes Charlie snap. Somewhere a plot begins but the humor is the best part of the movie, as 'Hank' terrorizes everyone around him. His sons are also pretty funny on their own. Without Carrey, the movie has no real worth at all and would be a real waste of time without his comic face. There really is no point to this film at all anyway. So if you like films of no point or if you like Jim Carrey, then the movie could be worth the price.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now officially the greatest makers of Hollywood ha-ha comedies since Blake Edwards retired, the Farrelly Brothers are also--though they would barf to hear it--America's Bertrand Bliers and Marco Ferreris. While their movies split sides like no others (Albert Brooks and Woody Allen, look to thy laurels), the Farrellys are also as keen a couple of peerers into the psychosexual microscope as Mr. Brian DePalma or Mr. Dario Argento. In this convulsive farce, the subject is, What makes up manhood?--and the answers are about as unsettling as the ones given in BAD LIEUTENANT.In a Farrellyan riff on THE NUTTY PROFESSOR (Jerry's, thank you), Jim Carrey is a cuckolded Rhode Island copper whose smothered rage sprouts a second personality--a rageoholic named Hank. Where Jerry Lewis' Buddy Love aped Dean Martin, Hank is a handful of Clint Eastwood. But the Farrellys' treatment of the Jekyll-and-Hyde routine far outstrips Jerry Lewis' in daring. In their universe, there are two traps for the tender souls of this world: lower-middle-class culture, and the human body. The brothers' work is a comic paean to the extreme uglinesses of both. (Has there ever been as deliberately, or hilariously, ugly a movie ever made as KINGPIN?) The plot brings in elements of NORTH BY NORTHWEST, but what these characters are vulnerable to is not a sinister international plot, but a more universal one: the vagaries of the flesh. Everything from multiple sclerosis to vaginal smegma is given worshipful focus here; the Farrellys' rendering of the sound of an imploded sinus is like a short, showy piano concerto. All this gunk is assembled not just for laughs, but to add to the vulnerability of the characters. Not all the starts make it to the end of act three with all their body parts intact.Hideous-looking and sometimes clunky, IRENE comes with a cops-and-robbers plot you'd just as soon tune out. But the biopsy into male sexual and bodily anxiety never stops fascinating; Carrey, while still seeming to buck for an Oscar, reveals almost limitless invention; and the brothers have great taste in music. Anybody who puts the final Pink Floyd music from Antonioni's ZABRISKIE POINT next to a cop with a live chicken in his ass deserves, to my mind, an Irving Thalberg Award.</fullReview>

One for home and one in my backpack, just in case I'm stranded. This movie is great. Okay great may be overused, but that's a shame. The overuse of "great" does a disservice to those things of which the moniker "great" should be applied. Like Me, Myself and Irene. Combine the stand-up of Louis CK and Todd Barry and add three African American triplets who believe they are born of a Caucasian American (and he believes they, in turn, are from his loin). And in summation ( I was eavesdropping on a lawyer happy-hour) Hank's take on breast feeding as well as reading the paper on a not-so-endearing neighbor's lawn are worth a rental or at the very least a casual glance.

		<shortDescription>Well, I _almost_ voted "2"..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>They spent 51 million dollars making this steaming pile of excrement? To think how many starving children could've been saved with that sum. Hell, I would've paid Jim Carrey and the Fartelly brothers $51000000 myself so they wouldn't create such a horrific thing that in all fairness doesn't even deserve to be called a "movie".And just to make something clear.. I'm most definitely *not* against toilet humor. But there's a limit to how much insulting moviegoers' intelligence I can stand. Most of the "jokes" are totally forced and pointless, and are the same stuff we've seen for a million times by now. For some reason the "writers" (I use the term loosely) seem to think mentioning a dildo and a man's behind 10 times a minute makes a comedy. Sorry, no.The plot - apart from being quite insulting to people suffering from mental disorders - is non-existent at best. The characters are mind-numbingly one-dimensional even for a comedy, and on top of it all Jim Carrey once again gets to showcase his complete lack of talent. The other actors aren't too spectacular either, and Anna Kournikova's cameo is somewhere between sad and embarrassing.But like the subject says, I nearly gave this movie a 2. (Mind you, I've voted for hundreds of films on IMDb and only a few of them have got a 1 so far) The beginning of the movie actually has some funny moments, and I even laughed at a few points which is exceptional for a Jim Carrey movie. Too bad it all goes downhill after the first few minutes.But the fans of this kind of garbage shouldn't worry.. As long as people pay to see it - and looks like they happily will - they'll continue to make them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Comedy is one of the toughest genres, and laughs are definitely a matter of taste. That said, it's hard for me to comment on Me, Myself &amp; Irene without saying something nasty.I am not sure what kind of actor Jim Carrey sees himself as. I don't think he ever did anything groundbreaking, but on his resume there are a few good movies and performances. Does he think this stuff will really improve his status? Atrocious, childish, and really, really unfunny are the first words that came to my mind while watching this movie. Am I supposed to laugh because he makes noises while breathing? Am I supposed to laugh at the swearing, at him washing his butt in a bathroom sink or at a 2" dildo? Acting-wise (and with the help of the awful script), I hardly found anything interesting about Jim Carrey's role. His split-personality thing was more like an excuse for him to act like a complete idiot. And I don't mean an idiot in a funny way, like say, Beavis and Butthead or -- in a way -- even his character in Dumb and Dumber... an idiot, pure and simple, one that I could feel no sympathy for at all.Renee Zellweger did an OK job, but again, her character was not interesting.Maybe it's just because I don't like this kind of comedy at all, but I can't rate this more than 2/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Farrelly brothers have finally done it--they have managed to make a thoroughly boring and thoroughly disgusting movie. While Dumb &amp; Dumber, Kingpin, and There's Something About Mary were disgusting, they were hilariously disgusting. This movie is just plain unfunny disgusting. There seems to be a general fixation in this movie on the anus and the use of the anus as a bodily opening into which animate and inanimate objects are rammed. I didn't like the story. I didn't like the anal humor. I didn't like the characters (and, other than Jim Carrey, I don't know whether I even liked most of the actors who played the characters). I didn't like the narration (reminded me of The Big Lebowski, another truly bad movie). And I didn't like the soundtrack, except for maybe one song. I should have listened to Rita Sever of NBC's Friday Night who rated the movie "only if you're desperate [to see a movie]". She's usually right on the money with her reviews, but I like Jim Carrey and most of his movies, so I thought I'd check it out. All in all, this movie was a disappointing waste of time and $8.50. It wouldn't even be worth seeing for $1.95 at the local second-run movie house.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see this movie and was not only disappointed, but disgusted as well. I saw the previews and I thought, "Great, some slapstick with Jim Carey, sounds good." What I actually saw was far from what I expected. I am not usually easily offended, and I can enjoy a movie with a little bit of sexual crudeness as long as the jokes tie into the plot and are somewhat funny. In this movie, however, the sexual crudeness was extremely overdone. It appeared to me as though the entire movie was just an excuse to make crude jokes. Jim Carey is a great actor, but he wasted his talents in this movie. Another thing that appalled me was the number of young children in the audience. I know that it is common for parents to bring their children to an "R" rated movie, which is why this movie should be rated "NC-17."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>how low can you go?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To describe how bad this film is, I'd have to use much profanity and vulgarity, but I'll refrain from stooping to its level.Unlike the other offerings from the Farrelly brothers, "Me, Myself and Irene" is a dumb movie that actually ends up being dumb. With the Farrelly's "Dumb and Dumber," for instance, you laughed with it, not at it. At "Irene," I found myself wanting to leave most of the time out of sheer embarrassment. I laughed a lot at the other films, but could barely manage a chuckle during this one. Where did they go wrong?Here the Farrellys combine the gross-out element of "Kingpin" and "There's Something About Mary" with the physical comedy of Jim Carrey. Carrey is as good here as he's ever been, when he's not grossing us out, that is. This guy's one of the greatest performers of all time. Why does he need to resort to potty humor any more? It's only in there because it's what the Farrelly's audience has come to expect. To leave it out would be a disappointment.Leaving it out still wouldn't have been enough to save this film. I do like the premise: Charlie (Carrey), a guy who's been a pushover all his life, is pushed over the edge when his wife leaves him (for his wedding-day chauffeur driver, who happens to be a dwarf). This releases a side of Charlie he's kept locked away inside, basically his id, calling himself Hank. Hank does terrible things. He embodies all of Charlie's frustration and anger, doing things that the ego (Charlie) never would have allowed. Unfortunately, Hank's personality ended up with all the craftiness and brains when the two split. Charlie and Hank both end up falling for Irene (Renee Zellweger), a woman running from corrupt EPA officers. Hank's personality might have come in handy--if he weren't such an impossible-to-deal-with chauvinist pig.Now, had they actually told this story, the film might even have been decent. But the Farrellys seem so determined to take bad taste to new lows with each successive film, they've forgotten they're supposed to be telling a story at all.Grade: D-</fullReview>

After 30 minutes, I got a refund and left. The content is awful-it is racial, sexual (to a major EXTREME), and gross.

		<shortDescription>Not as funny as food poisoning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this film in Shawnee, Oklahoma, while recovering from a two-day bout of food poisoning, hoping that it would cheer me up, and trusting on the brand name of Jim Carrey, who I enjoyed so much in "Man on the Moon" and "The Truman Show". I was wrong. Food poisoning was much funnier than this movie. It wasn't just my reaction alone. To see a laughter craving audience from the heartland of America sit in stunned bewilderment, while embryonic giggles faded into nothingness is not a pretty sight. Nor was this mean spirited movie, which poked fun at everything from interracial offspring, little people, and ghetto speak. I think I may have laughed once, during a scene involving a funeral, but that might just have been my fever returning. Finally I couldn't take it any longer and walked out, sorry that I hadn't opted to see "Chicken Run" instead. The real puzzle is why such a gifted actor and comedic genius like Carrey would waste his energies on such a turkey. Can it be that comedy is so unpredictable that nobody saw this disaster waiting to offend mass audiences? I think it's more simple than that: Carrey's name sells tickets. And that's no joke, either.</fullReview>

You have to be really lucky if you did'nt vomit through this movie or even luckier if you never ever saw it in the first place. Pieces of filth like this movie should be banned. If it was'nt bad enough that this movie was so badly made, it is also extremely juvenile, crude and racist.

I said I was not going to sit through another one of their movies, but when my sister (who felt the same about "Mary") said this one was better and that she actually liked it I gave it a chance on tv of course. Well, the interesting thing about this one was seeing just how offensive a movie could possibly be. It was amazing to witness the complete lack of humor or taste in scene after scene. I never thought they could do it, but the brothers who will remain nameless came up with one that immediately gets placed in the list of 10 worst films ever.

		<shortDescription>Crudity cannot replace laughs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Charlie is a state trooper who bottles all his feelings up inside himself ? whether it be his children being born black or his wife leaving him for their real dad. Years pass and Charlie cracks, bringing out another personality ? Hank, who is everything that Charlie isn't ? rude, violent and aggressive. When Charlie is assigned to take a suspect back to upstate New York he finds that she is involved in more than she knew and is being hunted by killers. As they help her escape both Hank and Charlie fall for her.After a few good hits in the gross out comedy arena, I assumed this film would be more of the same with the same feeling of `I shouldn't laugh but I can't help it'. The film starts well with the directors showing a knack for inventive humour by immediately mixing Charlie's life up with clearly black children etc. However from this point onwards it always tends more towards just crude jokes rather than a consistent run of good jokes.Rather than having a solid plot running through it, the film jumps around from one set up to another. The jokes all come from Hank and Charlie changing places and, while they occasionally got me to laugh, they were generally just crude and `shocking' rather than being genuinely funny. This crudity cannot replace genuine laughs and the film suffers in a bog of poor jokes and increasingly graphic and crude jokes.Carrey has carried some films in the past but here he simply mugs ? he cannot create a consistent pitch across the film and he falls into just delivering crudity. His performance at times is just hyperactive without substance and he just feels like he is part of the general shambolic nature of the film rather than helping to lift the film above itself. Zellweger is OK but has little to do. Support from Cooper, Forster and Jenkins is good but the only support characters that actually seem to be funny are Charlie's three black sons (although this gets tiresome towards the end as well).This is a film that relies almost totally on the gags and the performance of Carrey ? neither of which are up to scratch. The humour is too crude without being funny and Carrey is too hyper and directionless.</fullReview>

Basically two hours of Jim Carrey pulling off various and sundry gross stunts as a schizophrenic cop, it's not a bad movie, but not one of his best either (for gross-out humor with the Farrelly brothers, he reached his peak in "Dumb &amp; Dumber"). Renee Zellweger had only recently come into my conscience when I saw this, but she's done better since. All in all, this movie is harmless, but not one that I'd recommend above others.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Apart from the film not being terribly funny, this film is so crude any parent letting their kids see this should be shot!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>ALERT---CRUDE REFERENCES TO FOLLOW IN DESCRIBING THE FILM. READ WITH CAUTION. THIS IS NOT A REVIEW FOR KIDS.Uggh, did I hate this movie!! In fact, I think this movie is evil--and I am not one to say this lightly.I saw an edited version and was shocked by two things. First, how the film was rarely that funny. The humor was VERY broad and designed just to appeal to very young kids and early teens. Even for a Jim Carey movie, it was dumb and simple-minded. Second, I was enraged because although the film's humor was clearly NOT aimed at thinking adults, the film abounded with some of the most vulgar humor I have ever seen. References to anal sex and showing characters holding enormous fake penises isn't funny and I hate to think of the impact this mess has on kids. I am a school teacher and just recently one of my students used the word "dildö". When asked, it turned out he got it from the film! Any parent that encourages or allows their kids to see this film--even the edited version--is a maniac. This film goes far beyond crude humor and is offensive and unfunny. Avoid this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Me, Myself and Irene</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An interesting idea for a comedy, a man's constant struggle to struggle with schizophrenia. Basically Officer Charlie Baileygates (Jim Carrey) has lived a long while with the loss of his wife sleeping with a midget and lots of other stuff. He has held in a lot of emotions over the years, and now he has had too much put into his head that he has created a new personality in his head. He has created a monster opposite of himself, Hank Evans, who does everything that Charlie couldn't, and wouldn't. Worst thing that happens is that Charlie falls for troubled Irene P. Waters (Renée Zellweger). Soon enough, Hank takes a fancy too. Also starring Chris Cooper as Lt. Gerke, Massena PD, Robert Forster as Colonel Partington and Tony Cox as Shonte Jackson. Two of the most amusing scenes are when Hank is first created, and the battle between him and Charlie, but the rest of the film is just cheese. Adeqaute!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Funny Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an unPC very funny film from the Farrelly brothers which gets off to a very funny start with ethnocentric gags about a black midget called Shonte and then keeps up the pace . As you`d expect from a film like this cruelty to animals and physical handicap feature highly on the laugh list .Perhaps the most surprising thing is Jim Carrey who normally wants me to throw my TV out of a window everytime he appears on it , Carrey is good in the role of the meek Charlie and I can`t help thinking if he toned down his " Jerry Lewis on speed " act he`d be a very accomplished comedy actor in the same vein as Ben Stiller . In fact Carrey is better than just good as Charlie , he manages to bring pathos to the part . Of course as soon as Hank appears Carrey does go OTT slightly but never enough to make me want to kill the television So a good comedy by the Farrelly brothers , not their best ( That`s THERE`S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY ) but it made me laugh , and I`m someone who normally hates Jim Carrey</fullReview>
