		<shortDescription>Definitely underrated!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Rock" combined action, adventure, comedy, romance, special effects and a great plot into one of the biggest worldwide blockbuster action films in decades. Add to the mix, Sean Connery, Nicolas Cage, Ed Harris and a great supporting cast including John Spencer, William Forsythe and David Morse, and "The Rock" is one of the best ways to spend two hours. This film also devotes a great deal of time and effort to character development, something that most action movies neglect. This film is definitely underrated and is worth more praise than it has received.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An absolute classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can I say other than Connery at his best as usual? It's good to see Hollywood remembers the best. It's also good to see an American film portray us little Brits in such high regard.When else would you see a 60+ year old retired SAS agent who's been wrongfully banged up for 30 years and kept away from his daughter, break back into Alcatraz (after successfully breaking out all those years ago), take out an entire SEAL team almost empty handed, save 81 hostages held at gun point and a city of 5 Million held ransom with 15 deadly poisonous VX gas rockets?? Generally excellent acting by Ed Harris as you could expect and an almost convincing performance by Nicolas Cage....and thats just the half of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Rock was an awesome film to see in the cinema. Over the top action, amasing driving scenes, an all round enjoyable film. Excellent casting of Sean Connery and Nicholas Cage, interesting idea, ex-military take tour hostage and threaten chemical warfare. But it's all in a days work for the FBI. Scientist risks life and limb to rescue city while pregnant girlfriend looks on. Sean Connery' character is portrayed as a hard ex SAS spy and Nicholas Cage is the mild mannered Scientist/Chemical Expert. Good film, not too taxing on the brain and overall, very enjoyable! A must see for Action Fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Action Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is all a man could hope for in a movie these days. Action packed, but followed with a meaningful story that relates to today. The harsh reality is, what takes place within the movie is not too far off from what could happen in reality. I feel that if anyone fears domestic terrorism as well as foreign terrorism, this movie is a must see, while it bends the facts a tad for action and interest sake, its central story is compelling and thought-provoking.The best quote of this movie: "This isn't about terrorism, this about justice. It's about reminding you people of something you find politically convenient to forget."-General Hummel</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slick and powerful.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a brilliantly original movie that sees a USMC General out to get justice for the betrayal of fellow soldiers during various conflicts. Sean Connery, Nicolas Cage and Ed Harris are all on top-form in their roles as an SAS former convict (Connery), an easy-going government chemical weapons expert (Cage) and a disgruntled war hero (Harris). The bulk of the movie takes place on Alcatraz Island in San Francisco, where Ed Harris' character has stolen poison gas rockets and is holding the city to ransom. Michael Bay delivers brilliant action sequences with massive enthusiasm, resulting in high-octane scenes. The movie also bosts a powerful and emotional score right from the opening credits. The movie never gets boring or confusing and is dazzling all the way to the final, explosive climax. This is a movie best suited to die hard action fans due to it's loud, over-the-top style. Michael Bay proves to be one of the best action film directors with this movie which is one of the best of 1996.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Rock is one of my all-time favorite suspense - thrillers. Believability - almost always a problem for this sort of film - is enhanced by a very compelling script, sets, and powerful performances by masters Sean Connery and Ed Harris. Like a good work of fiction, it's the quality of the telling that makes it believable, not the likelihood that it might happen. There are no problems with the way this story is told. The acting, editing, directing and visuals do not slip at all. Nick Cage - in a performance which approaches his best work - adds a bit of campiness and humor to this explosive mixture, and John Spencer, Tony Todd, David Morse, and Michael Biehn all contribute substantially to an exciting, fast-paced and emotionally draining film. Any avid movie-goer will be hard pressed to find a single actor in this sizable cast who has not either become a major star or a fine character actor over the last nine years.The plot takes a number of twists and turns along the road, so to discuss almost any aspect of it in detail would require at least mild spoilers. None of the plot twists are unbelievable if you are willing to accept the basic premise. The story begins with Ed Harris - a Viet Nam war hero and field leader who is now a general and has become fed up with the abandonment of covert forces operatives by the US government. To get what he wants, he recruits some of the best officers under his command to take control of and hold Alcatraz Island, holding 70-some-odd civilians hostage and aiming four missiles loaded with deadly Sarin gas directly at the heart of San Francisco.Biehn heads an elite Navy SEAL team assigned to infiltrate and disable Harris' capabilities. Cage joins him as the FBI biochemical specialist assigned the task of disarming the warheads, and the only man who can get them in to do their respective jobs is an aging British intelligence agent who has been incarcerated for 30 years or so by the government that now needs his help. Connery's John Mason escaped from Alcatraz during his incarceration, and for all intents and purpose - is a much rougher, more real James Bond character without the gadgets and the comic-book super-villains. All of the above is established in the first ten minutes of the film and the next two hours is a wild ride, with some very tense moments and some very intense performances.I'm sure a lot of people will pick this film apart for the occasional unbelievable scene, etc, but it's worth while to remember - as my spouse is always telling me - "its only a movie".If you want reality, take a walk outside or go to work! There are no discernible powerful political messages in this film. While it must be acknowledged that the USA does sometimes treat members of its armed forces in an unappreciative and cavalier manner, this film does not really drive this point home in the way that, for example, Saving Private Ryan did. While it is also true that the US government does occasionally cover-up its own illegal activities, or soft-pedal them with propagandistic white lies, these issues are not really the subject of this film. This is made abundantly clear by the oddly out-of-place references to Roswell, New Mexico. The writers either did not want to dignify any perceived political messages by bringing up real-world transgressions and cover-ups - many of which are far more sinister than the secret development of stealth planes. This film is pure entertainment and - at that - a work of art. Treat it as such and you might just have a good time with it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An action packed, high octane thriller with great performances. ***1/2 out of ****.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE ROCK / (1996) ***1/2Starring: Sean Connery, Nicolas Cage, Ed Harris, Jon Spencer, David Morse, William Forsythe, Bokeem Woodbine, and Vanessa Marcil. Directed by Michael Bay. Running time: 135 minutes. Rated R (for strong intense violence, language and brief sexuality)Notes taken while screening The Rock:· The film contains superior character development of both the antagonist and protagonist. Each is clear and well defined. We also learn the characters motives, reasoning, dramatic situation, and premise--all brilliantly introduced within the setup.· Sean Connery provides us with strong character development through John Patrick Mason--although the character is somewhat a rip off of the Anthony Hokins' Hannibal from "The Silence of the Lambs."· It is uncanny how well the movie's visual style works. It propels the film's suspense the extra mile, increasing the tension and enticement. Also contributing to the style is the fitting soundtrack.· Some of the events are excessively coincidental. For example, during an exciting chase scene, Mason dashes out of a building, escaping the clutches of concealing police, discovering a Hum-V seemingly awaiting his arrival. Experienced chemist, Stanley Goodspeed (Nicolas Cage), chases after him, in a high speed Ferrari sitting outside his position in a building. Another coincidence occurs in the high security prison, where Mason escapes a grenade blast by dashing at random into a room, where, of course, there just so happens to be a secure bathtub to climb in. · There is a stolid, aggressively effective cast present. Each actor contributes a taut, penetrating performance, especially Ed Harris as the film's villain, General Francis X. Hummel who demands a moral purpose holding the lives of an urban area at stake.* The character's motives and perfectly defined, especially General Francis X. Hummel. Even as the film's bad guy, he serves an understandable position, thus we empathize with him, unlike most villains witnessed in modern day thrillers.· The standard three act structure is flawless: each scene propels the plot forward. The sequences either create a new problem or complicate a previous conflict, favoring with the later concept. This raises the line of tension even further.· Most of the production takes place in a high security prison, Alcatraz, crafted with a complex, awe-inspiring atmosphere towering over that of most action movies.· Sean Connery handles the complicated role of John Mason with mere simplicity, yet easily torments the audience with a sense of omniscient knowledge of the plot.· The picture is unpredictable and contains several inducing and unexpected twists proving this movie is imaginative and free to surprise us. The conclusion is not fomulatic. "The Rock" is filled with artful design and crafty performances. It is one of the year's best action films.Brought to you by Hollywood Pictures.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fantastically made. Undoubtedly one of the best action films in the last 20 years, Bruckheimer had a fantastic effect on this as his oh so loud impact fashioned this movie into what it is, quite possibly one of the finest in its' genre. Connery puts in a sturdy performance as does Cage but the show is stolen by the one and only Edd harris. His commanding performance carried the movie through small snippets where boredom may have set in, his emotion in the delivery of his lines left nothing to be desired and the role seemed so fitting for such a man, although his height was comic in comparison with the other marines. All round great film with good acting with just the right amount of comic relief when it was most required. thumbs up fellas</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally an action film about its characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Rock" is an action movie, alright, but it's an action move about its characters, and that's what saves it. It has a strong cast and strong characters and therefore the plot, about a militia group taking Alcatraz hostage and threatening to fire bombs into San Francisco if they don't get 100 million dollars, isn't what comes off the best.There are four central characters in this film. Hummel is the man in charge of this hostage takeover. He is a highly-ranked general who is doing this to teach the government a lesson: they've been neglecting forgotten soldiers who died in the Gulf and Nam, and instead of their families being told the truth, they've simply been marked as "Missing in Action." He is played by Ed Harris, who does such a good man torn between duty, conscience, and vengeance, he is the best film villain since Jack Nicholson in "The Shining."Goodspeed is a computer nerd working for the C.I.A. He's never been in combat situations, but because of his advanced knowledge of chemical bombs, they've sent him into Alcatraz with a group of Navy SEALS, and he has no idea how to react in war-like situations. Played by Nicolas Cage, his performance is believable and powerful.Anderson is the man in control of the Navy SEALS on the mission to Alcatraz. Tough as nails, bound by duty, he freely admits he agrees with Hummel's reasoning, but he says those are risks that are part of the job, and Hummel is wrong in his action because he took an oath to serve his country no matter what. He is played by Michael Biehn, who delivers a top-notch performance, and one similar to his role in "Terminator."But the most powerful character in the film is Mason, the only man who has ever escaped from Alcatraz. Tough, cunning, and full of one-liners, he has been caged up in a maximum security prison for years. It's hard to say whether the viewer can trust him or not, and he has many secrets and much knowledge of the facility...which is why he was chosen to go with the SEALS. He is played by Sean Connery, who's performance is perfectly Sean Connery-ish. But who would want it any other way?This film is great, and it is a great character study for anyone who might be majoring in it or just likes to watch films with good casts. Recommended. ****1/2 out of *****.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>With enough energy to generate an entire city, The Rock will absolutely blow you back into the 90s.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 90s was home to a slew of great raw, uncut, action flicks that shot straight for the rated "R," despite the guarantee that it would make less money than the money-friendly PG-13 rating. While Die Hard and Lethal Weapon may have jump-started this craze, the peak of this was during the next decade, when we saw the likes of Terminator 2, Speed, Face-Off, Con Air, Die Hard: With a Vengeance, The Matrix, Bad Boys, Point Break, Under Siege, True Lies, Desperado, among others (Quite a list I accumulated, eh?). The 90s was certainly a good decade for action fans, but few movies of this genre can quite top the powerful, gripping, and edge-of-your seat action blockbuster The Rock. The name alone sounds powerful, and behind it is two hours of incredible special effects, superb acting, great action set pieces, and good dosage of writing, and Michael Bay on top of his game.Few action movies carries as much morality and questionable circumstances as this one. In The Rock we follow a furious general (Ed Harris) leading a group of Marines to take control of Alcatraz Island (along with tourist hostages), a location that used to house criminals. Accompanying them are over a dozen missiles that can spell tens of thousands of innocent lives with every blast. However, he isn't just a trigger-happy man gone crazy, he is a man seeking justice for the dozens of lives he saw taken from warfare without compensation. A villain with a "moral" agenda, yikes. The only hope for the United States is the only man that has ever broken out of that prison (Sean Connery) and a chemical "superfreak" (Nicholas Cage). With the odds obviously against them, the Pentagon is one order away from destroying the entire location regardless of the innocent lives located in the island. Mindless this movie is not, as the stakes are high, there is always a risk of an innocent life going under, and our heroes rarely ever have the scenario under control. It's just enough to make you squeal in frustration.With the tension remaining edgy and the solution never being oh-so-close, we can thank the writers for delivering a slam-bang storyline full of great one-liners, likable characters, and a villain that isn't as simple to figure out as the average evildoer. The writing staff ranges from the writer of the third Die Hard to even Tarantino. A major reason for the film's quality is the casting. Sean Connery and Ed Harris are excellent in their roles and Nicholas Cage albeit a few lines does a good job. The supporting staff helps as well, as we see the likes of David Morse, John Spencer, and Cage's love interest Vanessa Marcil.Unlike Michael Bay's latest films, which run from mediocre to just plain bad, he blends plenty of drama and suspense along with action here. As a matter of fact, the first half of the movie is all suspense, as the situation is developed, and the risks are presented. Disregarding a superb car chase, there isn't much exploding in the first 80 minutes. However, once the protagonists enter the Rock, it all goes on the uphill action swing. We get brutal fights, brutal shootouts, near-misses, double-crosses, triple-crosses, chases, and enough explosions for action fans to sink their teeth into. The funny thing, the two main actors at the time weren't expected to be in such action. Connery was aging, and Nicholas Cage just didn't have the look or the attitude for it. Fortunately for us, they proved us dead wrong.Bottom Line: If you want to see a true action classic, The Rock is a great example. Rising above the average action movie and above the decent ones as well, this is by far Michael Bay's best work and one of the signature flicks of the 90s. Combining tension you can cut with a steak knife with thrills, chills, and plenty of carnage, The Rock has aged well and continues to influence the work of modern action movies and the work of Michael Bay as well. Grab some popcorn and enjoy this ruthlessly clever movie. Recommend to the max, as long as you don't mind a bit of blood spewing onto the screen. They just don't make em' like they used to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Unsung Villains Steal the Show</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is definitely for action junkies. If you enjoy disecting a movie looking for silly dialogue, plot holes, or looking for inner-meaning in a movie, you might want to skip The Rock. This movie is 2 hours, 15 minutes, but the action is almost nonstop and the movie moves briskly. It's typical Jerry Bruckheimer fare, including plenty of action, an implausible storyline, and big stars doing a fine job of acting.Some Bruckheimer characteristic events were obvious, such as the scene immediately after the car chase where Cage stands, and the camera rotates around him. This is reminescent of a similar scene in Bad Boys, another Bruckheimer film, where Martin Lawrence and Will Smith are standing in a similar pose with the same rotating camera view. Also present was the presidential address and accompanying slow-motion dramatic scenes near the end, ala Armageddon. I'm not saying it's bad for Bruckheimer to reuse his old ideas, just that if I was able to spot them, other people probably did as well.Some of the dialogue was way over the top, and tended to get a bit macho and silly. When Mason tells Lomax, "...you're between the Rock and a hard case", I felt like groaning. There was plenty of self-referential comments, such as this one where Mason refers to himself as a "hard case". There were also other comments where the characters would try to "build up" the other characters, such as when Lomax says, "You don't know Mason." I hate it when movies do this. They try to make you believe how tough a character is by other characters talking about him. I would prefer to SEE how tough he is by his actions, rather than be told about it constantly using dialogue. Several parts of the movie, such as the stalemate in the shower, seemed melodramatic and reheased. I couldn't imagine Michael Biehn, in real life, giving the "We spilt the same blood in the same mud" speech to a general that's holding a gun on him, but that's just my opinion.Cage plays the geek very well, with some very humorous scenes. The scene near the beginning where he's difusing the bomb, and finding the Playboy mags and gas mask, and his assistant screaming about the long needle, was darkly hilarious. I love that sort of humor. There were lots of very good scripting, such as the dialogue between Cage and Connery about the difference between winners and losers, and Cage's "Actually, I'm a chemical SUPER-freak" response was a great one-liner.I did feel like there some were plot holes, or at least some weird occurances. For example, when Cage calls his girlfriend and tells her not to come to San Francisco, she yells back into the phone, "Like hell I won't!" and hangs up. Why would she do that? Wouldn't she more likely ask something like, "Why not?" Or at the very least, maybe start accusing him of being with another woman? Of course, this was the perfect vehicle for her to come to San Francisco against his wishes and have to be rescued. It didn't make sense, but it made the story move along. Also, she runs away from the FBI agent when he comes to pick up her. Why? Because the FBI agent refused to answer her questions about where her boyfriend (Cage) is. Why would she run away? I would assume the FBI agent is there to take me to safety or to her boyfriend. But again, by running away this furthers the plot--now she's in danger and Cage can agonize about her fate, and thus he has motivation to disarm the poison rockets. If she had stayed and allowed the FBI to whisk her to safety, he would not have been motivated to save the city. He'd already been shown to be a bit of a coward in the scene where he's throwing up out of nervousness. Of course, in other scenes he's terribly heroic. His character was a bit inconsistent, but you could explain it as him being thrust into the situation and once there, exceeding his prior limits.The incinerator was another weird plot device. It looked a bit unrealistic. It was obviously something dreamed up for an action movie, with moving cogs (wheels) that would turn and have to be dodged by the hero, all the while fire is rushing through the same area. I've seen an incinerator, and it didn't resemble this monstrosity at all. I have no idea if the motion sensor that detected the marines arrival was accurate and if the military really has something this sophisticated, but I thought it was an ingenius idea.You may feel differently, but I actually enjoyed the villains of the story more than the heroes. Most of the lines that struck me as powerful were delivered by the noble villains, Harris and Morse. I found the combination of Ed Harris, David Morris, and Michael Biehn (admittedly not a villain in this movie) a powerful combination. I consider all these actors excellent, and the stalemate in the shower room was especially powerful, as well as the standoff with the villains near the end. These scenes didn't feature Connery or Cage, or the occasional humorous tension breaker. These scenes showed us that all villains are not the same, and that some villains are evil, and some just misguided. This degree of gray, in an otherwise black and white character movie, added a level of complexity to the film. Thus, a film that I would have otherwise said was "okay" became a really good action movie with some characters that I actually cared about.There was lots of violence and profanity, and a brief sexual situation (although no nudity) near the beginning. Despite my problems with some of the dialogue and plot, I found this movie enjoyable and engaging. If you don't mind overly macho acting and some silliness in the dialogue, and you love action, then you'll probably love this movie. If seeing serious characterization and motivation if more your style, you might want to check out Steel Magnolias and leave The Rock at the video store.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favourite movie ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS***While The Rock is essentially an action flick that most of the time doesn't take itself too seriously, its perfect blend of all the ingredients required suffices to make it an enthralling experience. With more and more movies actually failing to know what the term 'Action' really means (don't ask me how such a thing is possible, but it seems most producers have forgotten how to make a simple movie nowadays), The Rock definitely stands out as the best action movie, even 8 years after its release. The only other movie that actually manages to be somewhat on par with it in the genre is Broken Arrow, which was also released in 96.Bashed by many for unrealism and choppy dialogues in some instances, The Rock is still an awesome film. I could point out that the flaws listed by the other reviews plague all action movies without a single exception. Instead of looking for flaws you are certain to find in a movie, and a mere action flick at that, wouldn't it be better to like the movie for what it goes out of its way to provide? And by this, I'm referring to the excellent acting with even the minor roles being beautifully played (David Morse and Micheal Biehn spring to mind), the pumped-up action scenes, and the nice touch of humour. The movie's real asset however is Ed Harris, even beyond Sean Connery. His portrayal of a disgruntled general who's fed up with the way his men are treated by the Pentagon definitely ranks among his best roles. He simply wipes away all the actors, although I do need to stress on how this movie has a truly astounding cast. David Morse is also excellent as Major Baxter who's dedicated to Hummel, and all of the ex-Marines do have that military feel about them. On another note, I was particularly pleased to see Micheal Biehn as SEAL leader Commander Anderson, although it is a shame how he was killed off so quickly. You don't get to see a whole lot of him, but like all the actors, he is superb in his role, and I do get the feeling he would have been ever better had he been given a role that required more time on-screen. However, his death does serve a purpose, and shows how ludicrous the US Government's behaviour really is as far as fallen soldiers are concerned.Of course, as far as plot goes, The Rock is pretty average, but even then it has some nice touches other action movies would love to steal. The character development is particularly surprising since that's not a thing I would expect in an action movie. Hummel's stance on the mission is the biggest point in the story, and, upon seeing how he reacts and how he will not kill innocents, it's no surprise he's everybody's favourite character throughout the movie. His refusal to dispatch the rockets is perhaps a tad predictable (as Connery himself points out to Cage), but it results in my second favourite scene of the movie where the mutiny starts and Hummel himself is killed.Another intense scene, and my favourite by far, is the shower scene where the Marines wipe out Anderson's team. In addition to the intensity and viciousness of the scene, we also catch a first glimpse of Hummel's real character. Likewise, several scenes have a unique feeling to them, and this is one of the few movies where the filler doesn't seriously detract from the movie as a whole.The Rock is also a movie with terrific music; my favourite soundtrack, composed by Hans Zimmer and Nick Glennie-Smith, with Harry Gregson-Williams and Don Harper doing some additional tracks. The result is truly awesome, and really shows what Zimmer can do with good material.More importantly, The Rock will always stand out as the movie that so superbly combined the music with the images. As an example, the first 5 minutes of the movie, which are accompanied by 'Hummel Gets The Rockets' and are actually synchronised with it, totally blew my away. I had never seen images and music so expertly combined while flowing so smoothly and with impeccable transition, and yet, The Rock managed to do that. Add to this all the pros of the movie, and it's no wonder The Rock is still considered as a turning point both in the action genre and in Hans Zimmer's career (though not as big as Crimson Tide).Because of all these, it is not only my favourite action movie, but indeed my favourite movie ever, its main advantage being that it's a flick I can watch over and over again without getting bored. And that's also where its asset of being a mere action powerhouse effectively jumps in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:As a movie reviewer, I have different normative parameters for different genres. I agree with the criticisms but this action not drama. Please, you thought Commando was realistic? I have just one axis for action; the inherently lobotomized genre: Is it entertaining? Like Armageddon, this premise is equally silly, let's just ignore it. Connery gives one of him most memorable performances; you have to go back to The Man Who Would Be King to find this level of brilliance. After the SEALS are wiped out, it is just Goodspeed and Mason. Connery carries the movie from here to the ending. The movie is non stop action and suspense; of course, if this were epistemology, I would give it an F, but who cares? Did you think Raiders Of The Lost Ark was a paragon of verisimilitude? The movie laughs at itself often, I love the haircut from Hell, with Mason getting some payback against Federal Boy. This has always been the most maligned of Bay's films, but really, was it exciting? I cannot see how anyone could be bored during this movie. The scenes with Mason and Goodspeed have great dialog where the warrior has to endure the science lab geek. Hey, it even threw in a great quote from Oscar Wilder,"Patriotism Is The Virture Of The Vicious." I gave it one star, just for that piece of educative brilliance. Michael Biehn is always such a joy to watch. He has a little part here, as the SEAL team leader, but he does it so well. Harris has always been an excellent actor with wide range. Morse shows here, like he did in The Green Mile, why he is the 21st century version of J.T. Walsh. Unlike Walsh, he usually plays good guys not rats. The movie has several action set pieces that are breathtakingly well done. The car chase for Mason is worth owning the movie for. Please, if I turn my brain on, I would have to throw all my action movies into the garbage. The only great sin an action movie can commit is to be boring like Bullitt. Believe me, once this movie starts with Harris and his marines seizing Alcatraz and holding San Francisco and some hostages captive, it is go go go. Bay always puts close calls, loss of life by the good guys, in his films. This really is not Rambo: First Blood 2 where he takes out a hundred guys without getting a scratch.Goodspeed almost gets killed several times, like you would expect from a science geek; Mason bails his dumb butt out many times. The thematic success of their mission derives more from Harris changing his mind about genocide than testosterone hyper manly attacks. The only painfully bad scene is where Goodspeed jams that ephedrine heart needle into his chest and then gets back up: trust me, that would not happen. A treasure of adrenaline pumping action with great acting, writing and pacing. Try to remember, this is not Barry Lyndon. A Great Movie</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To sum up the Rock succinctly is fairly easy: it is a buddy film. This is a movie that brings all sorts of clichés together, but achieves the difficult success of making them seem like they're original and apt.In short, The Rock doesn't have an original bone in its body, but this isn't necessarily a bad thing. Michael Bay, the film's director who is somewhat notorious due to his penchant for mindless action, clearly hadn't learnt many of the bad tricks he's picked up in more recent offerings. Most impressively, for Bay, rather than spending genuine hours with over the top car chases, helicopter action, foot chases and just about everything else we've all come to loathe in 'A Michael Bay Film' the director succeeds in turning in an extremely tight, well paced movie which thrusts you into the top notch action almost immediately, but doesn't fail to show you the human side of the protagonists. Nicolas Cage is excellent as the lab rat, Stanley Goodspeed, a man who would probably call himself a geek. He's happy, drives the epitome of dull vehicles, has a gorgeous girlfriend and usually lives a very boring life. However work in any department of the FBI during a Michael Bay film is seldom going to be prosaic and it's not long before good old Stanley is disarming bombs, getting sprayed with poisonous gas and finding out unfortunate, ill timed, wonderful news... But that's all in a day's work. What is unusual is when Ed Harris, wonderfully straight laced and sincere, steals a number of rockets armed with a chemical capable of eradicating an entire city in the time it takes to breath in the gas... Harris', or General Hummel's, choice of target is San Francisco and what better choice of venue to launch a battery of VX poison gas, a compound that exists and is genuinely as horrible as described, than Cisco's most famous penitentiary? Hummel turns up with a bunch of 'can do' type marines who all agree that America, particularly the Pentagon, has been screwing the Special Forces for too long... it must stop! Naturally, as a bona fide patriot and all round good army guy, Hummel reckons the best way to achieve this is to take several dozen tourists hostage on Alcatraz, aka the Rock, ring up the director of the FBI and demand $100 million dollars, most of which will be given away in a fairly hefty act of altruism. The fact that none of this rings untrue is the central tenet of the movie and is all down to Harris, whose lined, worried face manages, with almost no overacting, to portray a wide range of emotions. These vary from impassioned orator to reluctant villain and he does it with a wit and skill that Michael Bay might well not have asked for. Regardless, having such an excellent central bad guy is what pulls The Rock away from the pack.It's also helped by Cage's comedic foil in all this, Sean Connery clearly relishing the part he receives and probably amazed that someone decided that he could genuinely be Scottish in at least one major role! With a mixture of twinkly eyes, physical brawn and his typical slurred delivery, big Sean comes away with the lion's share of the good lines and the humour, his best moments coming when he's face to face with Harris or nattering with Cage.The two leads work very well together, the hyperactive, fidgety Cage inhabiting Stanley with just the right mixture of nervous fear and 'let's do it!' attitude. Connery smirks his way through the entire piece, loving every wet, dark, dank moment while Harris is clearly on another plane of acting, imagining himself as the devil's advocate rather than another, bad as sin, Michael Bay villain. All in all, the film cannot be faulted for its three principles, the pacing, the script, the one liners, the quality of acting, the suspension of disbelief or any of the things that have grated, on me at least, with films like Bad Boys (1 and 2), Pearl Harbour, The Island and so forth. This is a tightly wound action thriller that achieves both goals handsomely, throwing in the comedy and happy ending without detracting from anything.That is not to say there aren't faults. One personal bugbear is Hanz Zimmer's awful use of panpipes to indicate moments of emotional growth. There are occasions when Cage's wide eyed mania gets a little annoying and the standard continuity problems are present... how does Connery's John Mason get from hanging upside down on a wrecked mining cart to poised delicately above a pair of marines who are travelling on an entirely separate vehicle? However, these problems are usually over before they've started and seldom detract from the feeling of fun and excitement. Other standouts are the supporting cast, John Spencer on fine, waspy form for example, the limited, well crafted car chase (not chases), including one of the most legendary lines ever committed to film from Cage and the rest.In short, this is as perfect an action film as you're ever likely to see, creating an overall product certainly the equal of, if not superior to, the sum of its parts. I'd advise any fan of action flicks who hasn't seen this movie to buy it, not just see it, at the first possibility. However, there's unlikely to be that many of you!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely superb action movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just the beginning of this movie is quite awesome, with that powerful song while the soldiers walk and the choppers go through the sky. Beautiful American military spirit.It is Ed Harris best performance- no doubt about it. General Hummel is a former Special reckon Marine, and we already know how tough these guys can be. They go from one mission to another serving their country with outstanding stamina. They are elite and deserve the highest respect and gratitude from all.But one day, Gen. Hummel goes mad about a betrayal operation in Baghdad resulting in several Marines being abandoned under enemy fire after serving the cause of freedom with indomitable honor. This is when Hummel decides to stomp in and try to change things in a terrific way. Another great American actor, Nicholas Cage is the Chemical expert who can stop a group of crap mercenaries who threaten the beautiful American city of San Francisco with chemical weapons that could kill the whole population. Sean Connery is a perfect complement for this excellent action movie where Michael Bay shows how brilliant director he is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun little action movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first thing I must say is that I love Michael Bay movies. Even Pearl Harbor. (will be awaiting flames for that) I have not seen all of his movies yet, and this is the most recent of his that I have viewed. I used to think that Transformers was his best film, but all of that changed when I saw The Rock. This is a great movie all around. The chemistry between Sean Connery and Nicholas Cage is great, and Ed Harris is great as a villain. (He also does a great job in Enemy At The Gates) Sure there is some cheesy dialog, but then again, what is an action movie without a little bit of cheese? Some of the action is over the top. But once again, that is what you would see in your normal everyday action movie. The only things I can say bad about this movie is the fact that there is not enough of it. Oh well, what can you do about it? 9 stars out of 10, due to the fact that there is not enough of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Rock" rocks!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every time I see "The Rock," I'm reminded of why I love action movies. They just can't seem to get any better than this. I may get slammed by others for proclaiming such strong admirations for such a movie, but it's squarely my opinion. But to remove myself from opinion and move in the direction toward known fact, "The Rock" is an essential action film for any action-film fan.Three years ago I bought the last remaining Criterion Collection DVD at my local video store and I can see now beyond the horizon that another edition of this masterpiece probably isn't coming any time soon. It is squarely the best film ever done by music video champ-turned-big-budget-Hollywood-music-video-director Michael Bay and the last film ever produced by the Don Simpson/Jerry Bruckheimer duo (Simpson died shortly before "The Rock" was released and the film is dedicated in his memory).But "The Rock" is all about one thing: entertainment, and nothing else. It's a hell of a ride from start to finish with plenty 'o explosions, humor, car chases, and one-liners supplied in a dynamite script by Douglas Cook, Mark Rosner, and David Weisberg (that also contains un-credited work from Quentin Tarantino). Even after this praise, you are, naah, you're not, still interested in seeing why "The Rock" is so essential, are you?To put it like this, the action begins with General Francis "Frank" R. Hummel (Ed Harris) having a vigil at his wife's grave and tells her that he is about to make a haste decision in the name of the many men who have died under his command and were consequently forgotten by the American government.So he and his men stage a daring heist at a military depot and make off with 16 rockets loaded with deadly V-X gas, which in the words of one of the film's characters, "Is one of the deadliest substances known to man." Their next move is to make a point that they aren't to be toyed with anymore. So Frank stages a hostage takeover at Alcatraz prison in San Francisco Bay. He tells the kids that are part of a tour group to head back to the boats while the 88 hostages are held in the prison's cells.Hummel demands the government make restitutions to the surviving family members of every man who has given his life for this country and if they aren't met, San Francisco will be reduced to nothing but a giant cloud of poison gas. The Pentagon and assorted officials know the score: they know that Hummel knows he isn't to be messed with and they take his demands seriously.A plan is put into effect: a SEAL team is dispatched to try to retake the island, but there is one catch. No one alive knows the inner workings of Alcatraz prison. No one knows, except John Patrick Mason (Sean Connery), the only man known to have escaped the infamous island and lived to tell about it. But he's under maximum security incarceration because in the eyes of one F.B.I. Director John Womack (the late John Spencer), he knows all of America's most "intimate" secrets (including who really shot JFK) and allowing Mason to be on the loose would be a pretty bad idea.There is a third prong: an F.B.I. lab rat with no field experience, Stanley Goodspeed (Nicolas Cage), is also assigned, and with Mason in tow, they'll accompany the SEALs to Alcatraz to try to dismantle the rockets and Hummel. Of course Goodspeed is reluctant but because a baby is on the way with his longtime girlfriend, he decides he has no choice but to go.From then on, you know the game since any attempt to further describe the plot would be an exercise in futility: lots of people get shot, firefights, and breakneck pacing that's trademark of one Mr. Bay and any film produced by a certain Mr. Bruckheimer. What keeps this boat afloat is the dynamic and unlikely partnering of Connery and Cage, who both know their roles well and play off one another, add to the other's performance like old friends as they navigate through Alcatraz's labyrinth of dark tunnels and sewers. Ed Harris is even given a third dimension in his villain role that elevates him above the typical action-movie bad guy. He's a soldier with a chip on his shoulder and his argument is quite convincing (I almost bought into myself). But his true motives later become the subject of a rather colorful and inventive plot twist late in the film."The Rock" is why we go to theaters for action in the first place. My view: "The Rock" rocks, big time.Just check it out to see.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest action movies ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is awesome! This is truly one of the greatest action movies of all time brought to you by Micheal Bay, the director of great action movies like "Armageddon", "Bad boys", and "Pearl Harbor" and the Jerry Bruckheimer, the producer of such movies like "Pirates of the Caribbean" and "Crimson Tide", and "National Treasure". I am not a big fan of Micheal Bay's movies because "Pearl Harbor" sucked. But this is clearly his best movie. There is a great story, a great script, great acting, great special effects, its funny, and its dramatic. The music is also great. I think its the same music used in "Pirates of the Caribbean" but as a good thing. Its good music. Over all, this is truly a great movie. I don't want to give anything away. This is a great movie. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Geeky biochemist Stanley Goodpseed (Cage) and highly educated ex-SAS killing machine John Mason (Connery) have to infiltrate Alcatraz, where renegade US General Hummel (Harris) plans to use missiles armed with nerve gas to massacre the entire San Fransisco Bay area (and a host of unfortunate hostages) unless...You get the idea: it sounds ludicrous, it actually IS ludicrous... But this is truly inspired nonsense. A script which 3 different writers have worked on to cram in as many one-liners and explosive situations, an epilepsy-inducing shooting and editing style (circular travelings, sunsets and filters abound)... these are not promising ingredients, especially in retrospect. And yet, a smart dosage of the above and solid commitment from everyone involved make "The Rock" far better than it had any right to be.If you can get past the silliness of the premise, not only is this an endlessly fun film to watch, it also has many very noteworthy components: Hans Zimmer's score is often rightfully celebrated as one of the most inspiring and bombastic of any action film, the San Fransisco car chase is among the most energetic of all time... Less commonly for a Bruckheimer/Bay production, the actors also pull their weight successfully: Nic Cage cements his action man potential, Sean Connery displays more fierceness and charisma than any star half his age, and best of all - undaunted by clunky lines - is Ed Harris as a surprisingly likable antagonist.This is the jewel of the Burckheimer/Bay crown. the pinnacle of silly explosive cinema - with a twist - done expertly right. For those of you who consider cinema to be only about art, this might even be worth a short glance. For anyone seeking entertainment, "The Rock" delivers in spades...One of the best action films of the 90s.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Rock" is a film that borrowed from other movies. That said, director Michael Bay does a wonderful job in this action packed picture that has the viewer at the edge of his seat. Of course, a lot is asked from us in accepting things we know can only happen in the movies, but if we indulge the makers of "The Rock", we will be rewarded to an almost two hours of pure, unadulterated thrills.The story at the center of the film involves a renegade Marine General who wants to have the government compensate those people that have given their lives for the country without being properly compensated. His way of doing this is to "hijack" Alcatraz, the notorious former prison in San Francisco and stage his revenge from that strategic point. The only thing is, that in doing so, he and his men take hostage the unsuspecting tourists that have come to see the place.Meanwhile in Washington, all the powers that be, have to deal with the threat General Hummel presents. Someone remembers a man that has been imprisoned thirty years before for doing the unimaginable: he stole secrets from Edgar Hoover. That is how Mason, an Englishman, is asked to help the people that are trying to infiltrate Alcatraz, since he served there and escaped from it, and knows all its secrets.There is also a scientist who understands the chemical danger of the equipment that Hummel, and his men, stole illegally. Those missiles are now in place in Alcatraz and Dr. Stanley Goodspeed is commanded to get to San Francisco to help in the operation. Goodspeed, whose girlfriend had just told him he is going to be a father, has no way of getting out of the mission.Although one knows how everything is going to come out, there is not a dull moment in the movie. Director Bay stages with flair all the action, which involves the typical car chase in the streets of San Francisco. David Weisberg, Douglas Cook and Mark Rosner contributed to the screen treatment. The story defies all logic, but all the films of this genre are like this. John Scharzman's cinematography enhances the film and the action.The film works because of the chemistry between Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage. They make an odd team, who are great together. Ed Harris is Gen. Hummel. His anger is real and he gives another vivid portrait of a man that is seeking justice, if even going beyond sanity to claim it. Other great actors in the film include, David Morse, John Spencer, William Forsythe, Claire Forlani and many others too numerous to mention."The Rock" is entertaining and it is highly recommended even for a second viewing thanks to what Michael Bay did with the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Actioner, efficient and predictable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're in the mood for an implausible but reassuringly familiar action flick, this should do the job. I don't know that there is a single original thought in this flick. It's all been done before in one guise or another, but it's done about as well here as anywhere else.Car chases of course are de rigueur. This one involves a Ferarri and a dozen cop cars chasing a Humvee up and down the steep hills of San Francisco. There are multiple smash-ups with flying glass everywhere. The Ferarri knocks down a row of parking meters, spilling thousands of pennies. A telephone pole collapses across the street. Cars do one-and-a-half gainers in midair. A streetcar is blown straight up and comes straight down. And so forth. The chase itself is without point.I lost count of the number of bodies that crashed through glass windows in slow motion, or the number of deaths by slow-motion exploding squib charges. Bodies fall through glass ceilings or are impaled on some kind of pointed spikes. Is all this beginning to sound familiar?There is one novel note -- the labyrinthine underground of Alcatraz. Who really knows or remembers what's down there? What we see is a jungle of twisted and rusting iron, crusty gratings, burnt orange bursts of flame that come out of nowhere and accomplish nothing, over-sized rotating cogs, small railroad tracks with small carts on them, caverns, sewers, lots of water, pipes emitting plumes of steam (where is the steam coming from and where is it going?). But -- well, why not? Nobody knows or cares what's really down there. It could be the hanging gardens of Babylon for all anyone knows.That's about it for originality. Sean Connery and Nicholas Cage and Ed Harris are good, as usual. The production values are high (all those smashed cars). The script is sprinkled with wisecracks, like a Schwarzenegger movie, in order to warn us against taking all this too seriously, as if warnings were necessary. The car chase is punctuated by the expectable imprecations -- "Hope you have insurance!" and "Sorry about that!"It must have been a bad idea to turn the Marines into heavies, so in the finale, the movie makes General Harris the only man of principle, however misguided that principle may be, and turns the others into nothing more than money-hungry mercenaries. The plot is so disarticulated that after Ed Harris is offed, another Marine has to become the chief heavy and he has a jaw like King Kong and a haircut like Hugh Grant or Hugh Jackman or whoever it is that has his long hair parted in the middle. You can tell all the bad guys anyway because they have bulging eyeballs that glow with lunacy, or they have sneers that radiate contempt for all the good things God has blessed us with in modern life, like Brittny Spears. Ed Harris, the Marine of principle, had to die a noble death. His evil successor has to be made to swallow a poison pill the size of a tennis ball and then melt on screen. The others, the "phony soldiers", to borrow a phrase, are just in it for the blackmail money. This is a common device used to avoid offending anyone in the audience. It can't be the REAL Marine Corps, so it has to be a loony splinter group of thieves. In "Patriot Games", it's not the real IRA but a splinter group. In "Air Force One", it's not the real Russians but a splinter group. In Clint Eastwood's "The Enforcer," it's not even the real "People's Army" because the "people" in the audience might take it personally, so it's a phony band of greedy gangsters posing as a populist army. Yes. If you like to see cars doing grand jetes and exploding fireballs and ugly guns, this is your movie. Cage and Connery work very well with one another and seem to be having a lot of fun. They have just solved the problem and ended the threat, but can they call off the air strike that is seconds away from being unleashed on them? Guess.My biology is long behind me and I know nothing of VX, but if it is a cholinesterase inhibitor, isn't it similar to, or the same thing, as black widow spider venom? And if so, what does it have to do with melting your skin?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've often heard things about Michael Bay, about how terrible his movies are, and how he couldn't direct himself out of a paper bag, and so on. Now, I was content to not confirm this theory, since I haven't heard a good thing about most of his movies, and cheap over-produced action movies are not generally my cup of tea. But, then the opportunity to watch The Rock presented itself, and I figured I might as well see if Mr. Bay was as bad as some people said.Oh, yes, he most certainly is.See, The Rock is the explosion filled wet-dream of an ADD addled teenager. Chases are often inexplicably overdone, with the characters aiming FOR people and objects, with enough cuts to make the whole thing an incomprehensible mess. Character development is forced, and crammed between the obligatory action sequences so haphazardly one wonders if any thought at all was put into it. Many shots don't make sense in context and look developed for the film trailer, and there are often massive errors in scripting - though many are late in the film and I don't want to spoil anything. Often the film also goes for cheap, emotional moments which simply don't work, especially since the characters are never presented as remotely likable and relatable - in spite of the haphazard "development".This film has a rating of 7.0 here, yet I found it almost completely unwatchable. Not only is it bad at being an action movie, it also happens to be overly full of itself. I'll even go so far as to say the more recent Catwoman was better, at least it knew it was crap.</fullReview>

In many films the action scenes can be a bit boring, but in a film directed by Michael Bay, the action is mostly pretty good. Some shots in The Rock are really beautiful. But I'm not going to go in detail. Just watch The Rock, you won't be disappointed!There's still 1 thing I want to say: I don't care what many other people say, I like Michael Bay.

		<shortDescription>It's exactly what the title says. THE ROCK rocks!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Take: Michael Bay is on the right track in this thrilling, violent and witty non-stop thrill-ride. First we had SPEED, about a mad bomber planting a bomb on a bus, which must speed through heavy traffic and jump gaps or it blows up. Then, it is followed by other action movies including DIE HARD: WITH A VENGEANCE, EXECUTIVE DECISION and BROKEN ARROW. And now, we have THE ROCK, which is the latest of these long line of "Mad Bomber movies". I bet you know what "Mad Bomber movies" are. Those are the action films which concerns a mad bomber who plans to blow up a bomb until his demands are assured, and the hero/heroes, usually sent by the government, attempt to stop him. THE ROCK is just like that.Here's the setup, this time, our mad bomber is Brig. Gen. Francis Hummel, a well-decorated military officer for the Marines who also happens to be a Medal-of-Honor winner in Vietnam. So why does he want to do away with the country? Well, during the war, his men, who should have received honor, were abandoned without recognition. Now, Hummel demands $100 million to be given to each of the soldiers' families and threatens to launch a rocket containing biochemical weapons, while in the meantime, also holds hostages of tourists in Alcatraz. The government, who wouldn't want to risk too much with his demands, dispatches their own team to infiltrate The Rock, including Biochemicals expert Stanley Goodspeed (Nicolas Cage) and a former British spy-turned convict (the only man ever to escape Alcatraz alive) named John Mason (Sean Connery, bringing in a tougher tone from his heroic Bond hero performance).After an escape and car chase scene along San Francisco, which can be summed up as a deluxe version of the chase scene in BULLIT, which is bound to blow up once in a while. After this car chase, upon arriving at The Rock, we are served up with more action and stunt scenes including some wild shoot-outs, a mine car chase (ala INDIANA JONES &amp; THE TEMPLE OF DOOM), near-misses and a climax involving jets and a green flame.THE ROCK is directed by Michael Bay and produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and the late Don Simpson, which might suggest where the robust action scenes have come from. Bay, a director who fancies a lot of explosions (including excess), manages to keep every sequence a show-stopper. THE ROCK borrows bits from a lot of favorite action films, and that's why, I think, it's so good.Bay also directed Armageddon which was released then later, which was also an even louder picture than this. Although I did like that picture, I still liked THE ROCK better, since it wasn't only another loud action picture, but also a very good movie. The performances, especially by Connery and bad-guy Harris, are terrific. Cage offers his own charisma as in his other films including CON-AIR (also Bruckheimer/Simpson production). In the case of summer movies (series of films I really love to defend), THE ROCK delivers what it is intended, and a little extras.Rating: **** out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stanley was almost an exact replica of my mother</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having won an Oscar for "Leaving Las Vegas", Nicolas Cage shifted to action with "The Rock". Portraying renegade Gen. Francis Hummel (Ed Harris) taking over Alcatraz, necessitating a rescue mission, the movie takes an interesting look at everything. We get to learn the story behind every main character, and even the car chase turns out to have a purpose.What was especially interesting about Nicolas Cage's character Stanley Goodspeed was his similarity to my mother: being a Beatlemaniac and desiring a beige Volvo. But this is Sean Connery's movie all the way. As ex-con John Mason, he creates a character with whom we feel that we can sympathize no matter what. Even if he tears up San Francisco in a car chase.There are some scenes about which I feel that I should warn you. You see, the movie partly focuses on these balls that release a chemical. This chemical melts your skin, among other things.But overall, it's a pretty good movie. Believe it or not, Michael Bay actually directed a good movie. I can't say the same for his work since then ("Armageddon", "Pearl Harbor"). Stick with this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can you say about this movie? This is action at is best. Oldtimer Sean Conery as good as in his best Bond movies, OK maybe not that good but how cool can a 65 year old man be, i think you can say like this!My absolute favorite actor, not just because I do look at lot like him, Nicolas Cage is so cool and good looking as always. His great feelings for Beatles is a great reminder for us guys that we sometimes need to keep our "small" habits for our self. I believe the most of us have something that we spend money on that our girlie's don't know about. It is this small things inside the great action that also makes the whole picture. Well this is a big action with some humor in it, all of the characters is there and the queries we are all asking is if a human body can whieperise, can it??</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brigadeer General Hummel (Ed Harris) has had his fill with government cover-ups in war, and after the death of his wife decides now is the time to act. He recruits a team of Fine US Marines (now mercenaries), and takes over Alcatraz which is now a tourist attraction, so he has no shortage of Hostages, and with stolen chemical weapons at his disposal his threat is very real.CIA Chemical weapons expert Stanley Goodspeed (Nicolas Cage), a man short on combat experience, but the only man with expert knowledge of the Chemical Weapons at Hummel's disposal.Comander Anderson (Michael Biehn) is the leader of the US Navy seals Strike team, charged with the task of infiltrating the island of Alcatraz.And Finally John Patrick Mason (Sean Connery) an Ex SAS operative and former resident of Alcatraz, and the only man in history to ever escape the prison. Mason was caught stealing the most closely guarded secrets of the US Government and was consequently deleted from existence by FBI Director Womack (John Spencer) until now.Mason and Goodspeed, led by the seal team enter the siege and the battle commences, a battle of extreme skill, wits and power, that is awesome to witness.A Clever balance of Strong, believable characters, action and a strong plot, makes this movie both memorable and very enjoyable.Highly recommended to anyone who wants too see a good Action Thriller, there are not many that are this good.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you like good action movies, here´s one you should see!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First things first: This is a movie from a past era, when the idea of terrorists threatening the U.S. with mass extinction weapons was a thrilling but rather remote possibility, and when those terrorists still had a face, a heart, and yes, a conscience.But still, if you like good action movies, here is one you should see, and for several reasons:1. The plot makes sense. It really does. And it´s not as predictable as some people have said. I for example was certain that - PLOT SPOILERS!!! - I´d see Mason sacrifice his life in the end for the good cause. But that was only after I realised he wouldn´t go over to the other side, which seemed to me the obvious thing to do.2. The average dialogue is longer than it takes to change a gun magazine. Plus it´s generally really witty.3. The big villain (a fantastic Ed Harris) doesn´t have a foreign accent, and loves his wife sincerely, and come to think of it he´s not really a big villain at all.4. You get to see a person with a Ph.D. in natural science (a really fantastic Nicolas Cage) handle a gun, and if you´re female like me, you´ll spend 2+ hours happily wondering what makes him sexier, the Ph.D. or the gun or the combination of both.5. The other chief protagonists (an absolutely fantastic Sean Connery) has a Scottish accent (ok, I´m biased there), but even without it he´d still be the sexiest man over sixty on this planet.6. The music alone should be a good enough reason to watch The Rock. In fact it is so good it would have deserved to crown an even better movie than this one.7. The Rock is full of the usual and well-established action cliches, but at the same time freely admits to it and mirrors them ironically. Let me explain. We look at the events through the eyes of Stanley Goodspeed, a man who, in his own words, "leads a very uneventful life", like you and me. The situation he finds himself in is utterly unreal. Throughout the Alcatraz mission, he constantly reminds us that this isn´t exactly the way he spends his average working day. This makes the characters´ emotions and reactions very human, and very believable (even if what actually happens to them is just as unbelievable as in any other action movie) - I mean, have you ever before seen one where the protagonist responds to his upcoming mission by throwing up violently?There´s also a lot to be learned from this movie.1. Serving a 30 year prison sentence doesn´t automatically qualify you to run for president.2. Never turn up your nose at people who drive beige Volvos. They´re heroes.3. Some people appear to break out of maximum security prisons for the sole purpose of attending Led Zeppelin concerts.4. Never quote Oscar Wilde at an angry patriot.5. You must never hesitate. Especially not to watch this movie. I give it 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why don't they make movies like this anymore?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the past, many summer action movies were geared towards adults (at least in theory) with R-rated violence, and a lot of intelligent plot twists and good characterizations. Some examples were the "Die Hard" movies, "True Lies," and "The Rock." Sadly, those days are gone, with today's summer action movies being dumbed down and neutered to get every kid from the target audience into the theater (the fact that movies make a ton of money if they are good no matter what the rating still hasn't occurred to the producers)."The Rock" represents a farewell to this kind of movie. It's very violent, but for the most part not very heavy. The story is compelling, and it has plenty of original ideas and characters that are actually intelligent. The actors do terrific jobs, and the action sequences are tightly done. There are some one-liners to be sure, but not enough to make the movie an action-comedy. It's one of those movies that is the definition of what a summer action movie is supposed to be.The story formula is familiar, but the creators do enough with it that it seems fresh and alive. An angered general takes Alcatraz hostage and aims missiles armed with deadly gas at San Francisco. The US government sends a team of Navy Seals in to take them down. Joining them are a "chemical weapons specialist" and the one man who escaped from Alcatraz.With names like Steven Segal and Arnold Schwartzenegger, two of Hollywood's most notoriously wooden actors (Schwartzenegger's "True Lies" being an exception), being some of the most famous poster-boys of the summer action movie genre, it would be sensible to guess that like most other action movies, acting is not a plus point. On the contrary, acting one of the reasons why this movie works so well. Every actor is believable in his role. Nicholas Cage, fresh off of his Oscar win for "Leaving Las Vegas," is perfectly understated in the fish-out-of-water role. He's a self-described "chemical weapons super-freak," but he's grounded enough for the audience to sympathize with him. John Mason may be a character that many talented actors could play, but after watching this movie, it's hard to imagine any other actor than Sean Connery playing it this well. I guess it makes sense for the original James Bond to still be doing this halfway into his sixties, but clearly age hasn't taken its toll on Connery at this point because he performs the role with a slick wit and the capability of firing a gun without reading glasses (haha). Probably the most important role here is that of General Hummel (Ed Harris). Though he's a villain, the way Harris portrays the character is key to the movie's success. As villainous as Hummel is for doing what he does, Harris plays Hummel with such passion that the character comes to life and he believes every word that he is saying. This is key because it makes the situation that much more serious, and it sets the tone for the rest of the movie. If you can't believe in what the villain is saying, than who cares? The supporting actors are great as well. John Spencer, William Forsythe, the vastly under-rated Michael Biehn, and a charming performance by Vanessa Marcil (why she doesn't get any big roles is beyond me, cause while not the best actress, she's certainly a lot better than many of the more popular beauties out there).Bruckheimer favorite Michael Bay is returning after directing "Bad Boys," which while not bad, it pales at the likes of "The Rock" (then again, not much else can match up to this movie). Armed with a better script and a more compelling story, Bay makes it clear that when it comes to directing action movies, he is a force to be reckoned with. He knows exactly what he's doing. Every action sequence is expertly choreographed, and the pacing is perfect. Though the end has a distinct lack of intelligence that's not present in the rest of the film, I am more than willing to forgive because it's still tremendously exciting anyway. It's hard to imagine a movie that's more exciting or suspenseful than this.As I said before, "The Rock" represents the last of its kind: the summer action movie for adults. Though few would disagree that the MPAA is notoriously easy-going when it comes to rating a movie based on violence, even the MPAA knew it couldn't get away with giving this one anything less than an R. There's a lot of violence here, and a lot of it is intense. Some of the scenes are hard to watch. I would definitely recommend at least previewing it first before showing it to anyone under the age of 15. Though this limits the target audience, this is a good decision because in order for suspense and excitement to take place, what happens on screen has to get our attention, and the in-your-face approach that an R rating allows accomplishes this. Additionally, the audience has to buy the premise, preferably within its own context. Sometimes this can be rather disturbing in some sense, but that makes the action believable, which is key for suspense. An action movie like this with a PG-13 rating loses that intimacy, which inevitably reduces the excitement level. This is a shame because some movies with the potential to be really exciting have been ruined by producer neutering (Jerry Bruckheimer has completely "sold out" by doing this for EVERY movie that he does now-"Pearl Harbor" would be a great example of this).Fast-paced, relentless, and terrifically exciting, "The Rock" is probably the best farewell to the adult-oriented summer action movie genre that one could hope for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Rock - the way to make an action thriller movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are negatives to the movie, including some stilted and corny dialogue, and some believability issues, but the acting, the rest of the script, and the action, all sells it.The best part of the movie is the way the plot twists and turns in all the right places. Not simply for shock effect, but in a believable manner that places the characters in tense, suspenseful, and powerful situations. For example, when the Navy SEALS are all massacred, it sets up the villains as a formidable threat, while leaving Goodspeed and Mason alone as an odd pairing against unbelievable odds to save the day. That is a great plot point.The movie itself is a thrilling ride, and though it uses previous action clichés and movie tropes, it pushes it in a fun, polished, and unpredictable way. The tension just gets amped up each act, in ways where you really wonder where the movie is going to go.For instance, when the deadline passed and the Marines launched a VX rocket at San Francisco, I was thinking, No they didn't! It was crazy! The threat was real and you had no idea what was going to happen. It made perfect sense in terms of the story that these hardened Marines would actually make good on the threat, and then finally Hummel in a move that fits the character diverts the rocket into the ocean.The movie did a great job amping up the threat of the VX chemical to a dangerous point. Other thriller directors like Hitchcock would simply have used the VX gas as a MacGuffin, and a looming threat that all the characters are fighting over. But Bay in this movie actually uses it in the final climax, and the audience is on pins and needles wondering the effect of this hyped up threat. This happens when Goodspeed is fighting for his life after disarming the last rocket, and he smashes the VX in the sadistic Marines' mouth. A great moment that just blows the audience away.The scene then leads to Cage stumbling because of his obvious exposure to the gas and managing to stick a huge needle of atropine into his own heart. Bay just took Tarantino's Pulp Fiction moment and just amped it up considerably. What a great dramatic moment, where else but in the movies are you going to see something as crazy as that.Then all the while the threat of complete obliteration by the thermite plasma is looming on the horizon, and so Cage in his delirium after doing all that needs to save the day again. In some great stylistic shots by Bay, Cage remembers that he needs to light the green flares to show the mission accomplished, and the way he pops them and stumbles outside holding them up while kneeling was just a great iconic moment. That's just a dramatic picture at its best. "I see green!" "Abort!, abort!" True action thrillers like this that take a big premise and are actually able to execute it too good effect are rare. Though Bruckenheimer and Bay have been criticized for their over-the-top blow 'em up action style, you can't deny the excellence of their specific genre craft. Besides the excellent actors and the script, the production values also made this film a true summer blockbuster, that's been imitated many times since, but have yet to be surpassed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sean Conney and Nicolas Cage deliver the goods!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Rock is the first of Nicolas Cage's action "trilogy" and it is by far the best. Not only is it one of the best films with Nicolas Cage I have seen but it is also Michael Bays best film, no contest. The style and goal of the film are clear from the beginning. The style is adrenalized and the goal is entertainment pure and simple and it delivers in the best possible way. People who say that this film is a mindless action film need to wake up and take a closer look because the film may be an action film but it is an action film about its characters.The main character is Nicolas Cage as an FBI science rat and he is actually as believable if even more so as a dorky kind of character than a fully blown action hero as in the other films of the "trilogy" (the other films are of course Con Air and Face/Off). He seems twitchy and nervous and he does a good job of it (he uses this nervous energy in one of his best performances in Matchstick Men). Ed Harris does a good job as always and brings his usual energy to the character who seems to genuinely believe in his cause. The rest of the cast is good as well. Michael Biehn is almost criminally underused but the best performance in the film is of course Sean Connery's. He brings his undefinable something to his character who becomes almost instantly likable. He has the Bond wit combined with an older man's wisdom. However, the character is more complex than that but telling about it could be considered as spoiling the film which I have no intention of doing. Suffice to say Sean Connery is brilliant.The action and effects of the movie are top notch even now almost 10 years later. Everything is of course overblown but somehow it still manages to stay within the confines of semi-believable unlike Face/Off, which is also a good film but just too far out. Connery seems believable even in his old age as an action symbol perhaps much more than any other actor could have been except perhaps Harrison Ford who until recently was also a fairly believable action star. Cage is also pretty good as is the rest of the supporting cast in the action scenes.Aside from a few preachy moments the film is pure entertainment which can be watched again and again simply because of the high quality of everything in the film.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining, action packed movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Rock" honestly is one of the best action movies made over the last couple of years. It has everything a good action movie needs; gun fights, explosions and a villainous plot that could kill thousands of people. It's a non-stop entertaining action packed movie.The movie already begins really good and features one of the better movie openings ever. After that the movie never loses its pace and its basically one spectacular action sequence after the other. The movie features some professionally made action sequences that work very well thanks to the nimble cinematography by John Schwartzman the good editing from action movie specialist Richard Francis-Bruce but mainly thanks to the spectacular movie score composed by Nick Glennie-Smith, Hans Zimmer and friends and of course also thanks to the directing of action movie specialist Michael Bay, who always (well, almost always) knows how to create an entertaining action filled, blockbuster movie.Difference with most other action movies is that this one features some good and well known actors. Sean Connery shows that he can still handle action roles despite his age and although Nicolas Cage probably wouldn't had been my first choice for the role he plays his role and alright and believable enough. The main 'villain' is played by the always excellent actor Ed Harris. The rest of the cast consists out of other well known actors such as; David Morse, John Spencer, John C. McGinley, Steve Harris, Michael Biehn (in a typical Michael Biehn role) and uncredited roles played by Xander Berkeley and Stuart Wilson. Some amazingly great casting if you ask me, especially for a type of action movie like this one is. Action movie fans will simply enjoy this movie. Its filled with 'over-the-top' action sequences featuring lots of gun fights and plenty of big explosions and one memorable car chase scene through the streets of San Fransisco. Everything is almost all of the time very over-the-top but its all done so beautifully over-the-top that it is no complaint.Simply sit back and enjoy!8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The apex of the Bruckheimer action pic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If 'Top Gun' is the film that defined the Bruckheimer formula, 'The Rock' is the movie that uses all the elements to best effect, before things got too out-of-hand (and too loud!) with Armageddon (and don't ask me what happened with Pearl Harbour...). Everything is there - slow-mo shots of people looking heroic, wailing guitars, big explosions, seemingly impossible task.For an action film, all the main characters are surprisingly well developed, and none of the actors waste the opportunity. Ed Harris is the perfect choice to play the fallen hero baddie, and it was an inspired move to cast Sean Connery as basically an aged James Bond - he seems to enjoy himself too. But the film belongs to Nic Cage, who not only delivers more hilarious lines than i can count, but also comes across as a likable, believable character. The interactions between him and Connery are better than can be found in 99% of 'buddy movies'.The balance between tension and all-out action is about right, and both are well executed. The chase through San Francisco deserves special mention.Personally, i marginally prefer 'Top Gun', but that's in a kind of semi-ironic way, since it's so cheesy. The Rock is an action film i'm not ashamed to say i like.</fullReview>

Also, about 20 blatant abuses of Lord's name in vain didn't make it attractive for me, either. Who do the script-writes have doing the blasphemy: the supposed "good guys," the government agents and bigwigs. Of course, in Hollywood the cops are usually the bad guys and the crooks are the heroes.If you like mindless action, and very little credibility - especially in the last 30 minutes - this movie is for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest film ever made (sort of)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, so it may not be the greatest film ever produced, but it sure is up there with the most fun. Sometimes a film is just perfect. Or, to be precise, it's absolutely perfect for what it is. No, 'The Rock' will never be hailed up there with such greats as Citizen Kane or The Godfather, but it is the perfect popcorn-munching action film.Nicholas Cage (back when he still starred in decent films) plays a self-confessed FBI lab-geek who specialises in defusing explosive chemical weapons. And, by one hell of a coincidence, an insane ex general (Ed Harris) only goes and steals a load of explosive chemical weapons and sets up his hollowed-out volcano lair (well, sort of) on the disused prison-site of Alcatraz. Guess what poor ol' Nic's going to be getting up to today? Unfortunately, he's not much of a soldier and doesn't stand a snowball's chance in hell of defeating Ed's band of hired marines. However, that's where the only man ever to have escaped Alcatraz comes in ? retired (and imprisoned!) British Secret agent, Sean Connery (his character probably has a name, but ? like every film he's in ? Sean Connery basically plays Sean Connery). So, as the tag-line says... in a prison where no man has ever broken out, two men must break back in.I hope whoever wrote that tagline got well paid. It really does say it all. You really don't need to know much else about the film. You only need to enjoy action films. And, when I say 'action films,' I mean action films that are actually quite fun, rather than the dark and depressing style we've been treated to in recent times. The Rock never tries to be 'gritty' and 'realistic' ? it just has great action, numerous explosions and a plot so over-the-top it will envelop you completely and let it take you along for one hell of a ride. If the sheer joy of the chemistry between Cage and Connery isn't enough to entice you to watch this film, it's actually worth noting that Ed Harris' villain isn't actually as villainous as you might expect, being one of the only evil bad guys with a conscious whose point of view you can also emphasise with.Also, don't let Michael Bay's name put you off. It was made 'pre-Transformers' where he actually made some decent films.Don't think about the plot. Just love it for what it is ? the perfect action film that really sums up the nineties (oh, that line could also be applied to 'Speed' ? that's pretty damn awesome, too).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure action bliss with a top notch cast.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Bay's The Rock is one of the quintessential action films of the 90's (many of which Cage has starred in actually), and a blast of rousing energy and adrenaline that careens along in bang up fashion for two plus hours. From a breakneck car chase through the streets of San Francisco, to a furious missile raid on Alcatraz island and all manner of shootouts, fistfight and one liners in between, it's classic stuff. When bitter renegade General Francis Hummel (Ed Harris giving nobility to one of the most brutally relatable antagonists in the genre) hijacks several warheads containing deadly weaponized nerve gas and threatens to launch them from Alcatraz to the city, the powers that be scramble to find a solution. Hummel wants countless unnamed, Dead veterans to receive the accommodation owed to them by a callous, corrupt government. FBI honchos Womack (a snide John Spencer), and Paxton (sympathetic William Forsythe, excellent as usual) recruit rookie chemical analyst Stanley Goodspeed (Cage) to enter with a team of mercs to neutralize Hunmel's forces. They also dig up forgotten British secret agent John Patrick Mason (Sean Connery) from prison, since he once escaped from Alcatraz and knows the layout. Connery, cunning, genial and deadly when he has to be, is an absolute joy in the role, playing up the banter and swashbuckle with obvious shades of Bond. His dry wit and laid back, nonchalant nature together with Cage's squirrelly, regular joe exasperation lead the film forward with a momentum based in character as well as fireworks. The a nice turn from Michael Biehn as an intense SEAL Commander in charge of the assault on the island, Tony Todd is scenery chewing glory as evil Captain Darrow, and there's nice work from John C. McGinley, Claire Forlani, Stuart Wilson, David Morse and Bokeem Woodbine too. Set to a thumping score supplied by Hans Zimmer, eye boggling camera work from John Schwartzman and sleekly tied together by Bay's unbelievable ambition and opulent eye for staging crazy action, it's one of my favourites of the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hard-packed action classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Rock is generally considered to be one of the major Nicholas Cage films and one of the better Sean Connery films as well. And for a reason. It's a classic 90s action film from an era where the plot lines have started to become a little darker, but where the heroes still believe in human ideals and doing what's right.The Rock rises above its peers mainly because of its main actors. Both Cage and Connery are well-suited for their roles and their quirks and charisma hold the cheesy plot together. Not that I have anything against cheesy. On the contrary, I prefer my action movies to be at least slightly removed from brutal reality, and this movie is simply goldilocks.It also helps that the script is clever enough to keep us guessing until the very end. The basic premise, that of Alcatraz prison tourists held hostage, is enough to arouse our interest and from there the main players are introduced and allowed to work off each other. They're all distinct enough and memorable enough that you'll care what happens to them and you'll be pleasantly shocked when some of them do something unexpected. There are plenty of twists to keep you interested and the whole story does not have a lull moment in it, as it should be.That being said, the story as a whole is a bit clichéd, even by 90s standards, and while some of the twists are surprising, the main story arc is rather predictable. I'd claim that it's a professional take on old story traditions, but some might argue that it could have been more original with some effort. Personally I don't mind all that much, but it's a theoretical flaw.The Rock is a treat for all fans of action. It's one of the more well-known action films for a reason and is sure to thrill all those that decide to give it a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Rock is a action fans dream. It has action from basically beginning to end, a never ending supply of big guns, corny Nicholas Cage and Sean Connery lines that really only they can get away with. Add in Ed Harris and all the other amazing actors that were chosen to play in this movie and it really is the total package! What I believe makes this movie better than other movies similar to it is the depth that each character brings to the table. It's unclear at times who is truly the "bad guys!" That makes this movie so much more interesting. The movie came out in 1996 which I believe is around the real turning point in graphics and such. The blood looks like real blood and the explosions look realistic not exaggerated. All in all, I very much enjoyed this movie and it is definitely one that belongs in any action lovers collection!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alcatraz Island has been taken over</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Story/Plot - Alcatraz Island has been taken over by a group of marines led by General Francis Xavier Hummel. They also have taken 81 tourists who were on the island as hostages. He is using these hostages as his leverage in his bid to make the government pay benefits to those who have lost loved ones in secret military operations. His wife died recently and this pushed him far over the edge, hence the hostage taking.An FBI biochemist whose partner has just announced that she is pregnant gets the call that Alcatraz is now under terrorist control. His name is Stanley Goodspeed. Stanley discovers that the general has a selection of deadly warheads containing a gas called VX. The general has threatened to use these nukes on American soil unless his demands are met.Luckily Stanley nows how to disarm these nukes. The only down side is that he doesn't know his way around Alcatraz island.This is where John Patrick Mason comes in handy. An ex MI5 or 6 operative, John is the only person to have ever escaped from Alcatraz so is the best suited man for the job. Although John is currently in prison for supposedly stealing the personal files of ex president Hoover. However John even though he would love to see the FBI fail he joins forces with Stanley to put an end to the generals terrorism.Together John and Stanley enter Alcatraz island with a team of highly trained US Navy Seals. As the move through the prison facility the seal team are killed, leaving John and Stanley to finish this themselves.Will they reach the hostages and free them, will they neutralize the bombs and take down the general and his men??The answer is .........................watch the film to find out.My verdict - Nicholas Cage as Stanley and Sean Connery as John make a perfect pair. The explosive match they have is perfect to this film. This is such a great film and is one I personally could watch over and over again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredibly Entertaining Nonsense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ostensibly, "The Rock" ranks as Sean Connery's last memorable motion picture. This supercharged, high-octane, but improbable shoot'em up concerns renegade Army General who takes civilian hostages, occupies Alcatraz Prison with a small force, and threatens to fire poison rockets with deadly VX gas at San Francisco if the government refuses to bow to his demands. The FBI assigns Special Agent Stanley Goodspeed (Nicolas Cage of "Con-Air") to the case, and he receives help from the only man who successfully escaped from Alcatraz. As it turns out, this brilliant individual is former British secret service agent John Mason (Sean Connery of "Zardoz") who has been buried in the U .S. Penal system because he got his hands of all of America's top-secrets. FBI Director Womack (John Spencer) fears Mason. He sends in Goodspeed to negotiate with Mason. Naturally, Mason demands a trip into San Francisco, a meal in a sumptuous hotel, and a haircut. Eventually, a reluctant Mason leads Cage under the island, and they set out to disarm the rockets. Our heroes face a deadline as they battle their way through bowels of the prison. The Navy plans to obliterate the island if Mason and Goodspeed blow it. The first obstacle that our heroes encounter is a massacre in the prison showers when Hummel's men wipe out a squad of Navy Seals. One of the best scenes concerns a chase through the streets of San Francisco with Connery driving a Hummer. The script bristles with great lines. The music is terrific. If you watch closely, Cage's character learns how to lie during the course of the action. Michael Bay never lets the pace lag. Composers Nick Glennie-Smith and Hans Zimmer enhance the spine-tingling suspense with atmospheric music.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That headliner line is not about the film - it is one of the funnier lines spoken by Nicholas Cage in this knockout movie. Almost twenty year old, this film - THE ROCK - remains one of the most entertaining and powerfully performed and produced action films in cinema history. Re-examining It today finds it still as fresh as ever - a film that keeps you on the edge of your seat with a solid story (David Weisberg, Douglas Cook, and Mark Rosner) and pitch perfect direction from Michael Bay. Yes, there are many special effects (pyrotechnics, underwater fighting, the recreation of the bowels of Alcatraz, etc), a dialogue that allows the intervention of comic relief in a situation that seems impossible to find humor, and some very fine performances by a huge cast of actors. It is an 'escape movie', both for the audience and for the story.Dr. Stanley Goodspeed (Nicholas Cage, in one of his better roles), who lives in Washington D.C., is a biochemist who works for the FBI. Soon after his fiancée Carla Pestalozzi (Vanessa Marcil) announces that she is pregnant, Stanley gets a call from FBI director James Womack (John Spencer). Womack tells Goodspeed that San Francisco's Alcatraz Island has been taken hostage, along with 81 tourists, by marine General Francis Xavier Hummel (Ed Harris) who, for years, has been protesting the government's refusal to pay benefits to families of war veterans who died during covert military operations. The death of his wife Barbara Hummel on March 9, 1995 drove General Hummel over the edge, and now he's holding hostages in order to get his point across. Goodspeed is needed because General Hummel has stolen some VX gas warheads and has announced that he will launch them onto San Francisco unless his demands are met. Goodspeed knows how to disarm the bombs, but he needs someone who knows Alcatraz well enough to get him inside and that someone is a former Alcatraz escapee James Patrick Mason (Sean Connery). The wise and experienced Mason and the nerdy brainy but intimidated Goodspeed make an odd couple but head to Alcatraz in an attempt to foil Hummel's terrorist scheme.The large supportive cast is populated with such actors as David Morse, William Forsythe, Bokeem Woodbine, Danny Nucci, Claire Forlani, Jim Caviezel, John Enos III, Richard Conti, Raymond Cruz and Philip Baker Hall. It is a bit long but never fails to keep your interest. A good old-fashioned Hollywood blockbuster action flick! Grady Harp</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A perfect symphony of cliché and stereotype that Michael Bay's been trying like hell to recreate ever since. Literally every single shot dips liberally from the well of overuse, culminating in an early car chase with a little old lady, a roving gang of bicyclists and a dozen diving pedestrians in the road, no less than five instantly-combustible parked cars and a Lamborghini that leaps through a plate glass window. Nic Cage and Sean Connery, no strangers to this type of picture, freely toss away their inhibitions and embrace the cheese from word one and, along with a straight-laced performance from Ed Harris, somehow validate the whole thing. The dialog would have been deemed too unrealistic for a Hanna-Barbara cartoon, but through sheer force of will (plus a few blatant winks at the audience) it works too. Top of the mountain for the 'insanely stupid action flick' boom of the mid '90s, it's wildly fast-paced and thoroughly enjoyable in spite of itself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What does one need to know about The Rock? Well, it's one very entertaining and thrilling film, but there's not much else to it. Still, I think it's one of the best action films of the 1990s. At times it's somewhat dumb, at times it's inconsistent, the whole package however is so appealing that you can watch it again and again and not get tired of it. It features some breathtaking San Francisco scenery. The performances are memorable, especially by the three leads. Sean Connery, Nicolas Cage and Ed Harris are very good in this film. The scenes on Alcatraz are exciting, and the prison was filmed very well. Michael Bay, however, is not a great director. The jokes and action are impressive but tight filmmaking this is not. Bay relies too much on quick cuts and snappy dialogue instead of trying to build truly impressive scenes. The story too is hardly anything to write about. Bay can deliver the visuals though. The score by Hans Zimmer is another strong point. Most of all The Rock is a feel-good film. It's by far my favourite film by Bay, and I recommend seeing it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sean Connery must have the patience of Job. He has spent 30 years in isolation on account of secrets he knows and skills he possesses. He has even successfully escaped from Alcatraz...something that general knowledge states could not be done. After all of this, the ones who have screwed him around turn out to be the ones who need him most when the island is taken over by dis-gruntled soldiers and a past General of the Viet Nam war who have taken 81 hostages. Nick Cage is called in as a chem-weapons expert. He knows that field, but knows little else, as he has never seen combat, and it has been years since he had any weapons training. There's no problem for an audience to adjust their radar to see Connery in a cloak and dagger situation...and one that has high energy. But...with Nick Cage..he seems to be cast some what over his head and out of his element. There is some measure of a modern day "Horatio Alger" character to his performance, but to my view the film could have been made without him, or his role could have been reduced. He actually bogs things down because he needs to be rescued a bit too often. And Cage is not the only problem with this film. The twists and turns of this plot defy reality at some points. There are a few entertaining and exciting moments in the film, but these are outweighed by the gaps in credibility of the plot and of some of the characters, especially the General who changes co-ordinates on a weapon of destruction, and claims he was only bluffing, and tries to call off the whole incident. Of course, the people that he has recruited are PO'd to a fare-thee-well. But, plot dysfunctions such as this take the steam out of the sails of the film, and it's hard to take the film seriously. That would be enough to chase off the critical thinkers, but not enough to turn off the thrill-seekers who want to be entertained...and that's probably the only reason this piece of celluloid has any legs at all. Because the film has mostly entertainment value of a destructive sort and does not seek to engage the audience, it fails to deliver. I have given it 5 stars, which I consider to be quite generous. I cannot recommend it, and I would not care to watch it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The island known as " The Rock " is the one prison where no inmate has ever managed to escaped from. The fact is, one escape was successful and the vanished prisoners have never been caught. Immitating history, this incredible movie too has escaped the enormous accolades and noteworthy praise it should have received. Not only for the sheer star power is contained, but for the incredible excitement it generated in audiences across the country. The story is of a remarkable and dedicated but now renegade U.S. general (Ed Harris) who has managed to obtain some extremely dangerous and definitely lethal toxin. Together, with the help of a loyal group of U.S. Marines, is holding some civilian hostages on that imprisoned island. The general demands The F.B.I director (John Spencer) and other U.S. authorities to pay $100 million dollars in reparations to the dead soldiers's families who have never been told how they died or even recognized for their ultimate bravery. Unable to admit their country's deception, the authorities instead send in a S.E.A.L team to destroy the general and his men. Accompanying the SEAL Team is a former inmate (Sean Connery) of Alcatraz and a chemical weapons's specialist (Nicolas Cage) to rescue the hostages. The movie is a vivid action packed thrill ride filled with high drama and suspense. The excellent cast and splendid car chase scenes, together with jet fighters and a fiery explosive finale makes for a true Classic. Easily recommended. ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Connery and Cage save the world</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was a little surprised at how ridiculous "The rock" is. It's about a group of rebellious marines, led by Ed Harris, who take Alcatraz by force and then threaten to fire a massively lethal gas upon the population unless they get one million dollar each as a compensation for the oblivion that they feel the American government has condemned all killed military to. Sean Connery is a member of the British Intelligence who is still held in prison, and was the only person to ever manage to escape from Alcatraz; and Nicolas Cage is a FBI chemical expert. They both end up being teamed up to save the world.The whole premise, at least the way it is purported here, is completely ridiculous, and things are made worse by Michael Bay's direction, because he films the whole thing in his usual video clip style. I also found Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage to be a very unlikely hero duo -Connery's role perhaps a little parody of his 007 impersonation? There also aren't real serious villains, those that you love to hate until the heroes of the show take care of them; or any mind-blowing action.All in all, "The rock" is, at best, one more action flick that you can watch and immediately hopefully forget.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I have yet to see a more recent film that is better than The Rock.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To describe The Rock in the most reassuring terms: Almost as sensational as Die Hard. That is the calibre of action movie we are looking at here. The production of The Rock was blessed with a $75 million budget, a hard R rating and a veteran movie producer and director Michael Bay has utilised those three assets to their full potential. The Rock is one of the wildest, most breathtaking action movies you will ever see.The Rock shows us the two most beautifully established characters in an action movie since Lethal Weapon. Of course, being an action film The Rock has less dialogue driven scenes than your average movie but that doesn't even matter because the dialogue is so truthful about the characters. The movie also puts a very original spin on the Hollywood terrorist plot. In the end, the main bad guy turns out not be to half as crazy or hypocritical as it first seems and his vicious Cronies turn out be the only real bad guys.So, the plot of the movie: General Francis Hummel (Ed Harris) is angry at the government for their disrespectful treatment of combat veterans who fell in battle and their families. He doesn't like the fact that their families are not compensated and are told lies about what happened to them. He and his Platoon of Marines seize control of a Naval weapons Depot and steal a cache of rockets full of extremely deadly poison gas. Hummel and his Marines then seize control of the former prison island of Alcatraz, take 81 hostages and place the rockets there, pointing them towards San Fransisco. He phones the head of the FBI and tells him that if the US government does not give him $100 million dollars within 24 hours to disperse among the families of all the Marines that he commanded who died in battle and his own men who he brought with him on the mission, he will fire the poison gas missiles at San Fransisco, killing millions of people. The leaders of America's armed forces meet to discuss how to confront the problem. They decide to send in a Navy Seal team to infiltrate the prison. Along with the Seal team they send in the FBI's best chemical weapons expert, Stanley Goodspeed (Nicholas Cage) who knows how to disarm the rockets and imprisoned British SAS agent John Patrick Mason (Sean Connery), who was held for some time in Alcatraz for stealing a top secret FBI microfilm and not giving up its location and is the only man to have ever escaped. He logically knows how to break into the prison. The team of Navy Seals barely make it inside the prison when things take a dramatic turn for the worse. They are surrounded by General Hummel's Marines in the prison's shower room and mercilessly massacred, but Connery and Cage survive the encounter by staying hidden in the tunnel below. They have less than 15 hours to disarm all the rockets and set up green flares to signal for evacuation before the US Airforce bombs the Island into oblivion.With the exception of a fairly routine car chase, the action scenes in The Rock are all inventive and unique. One of my favourites is when the rogue marines corner Connery and Cage at the end of a mine cart track and they must use all their wits and limited resources to defeat their deadly pursuers. The movie's last handful of bad guys are taken to hell in a spectacular fashion involving such methods as a sphere of poison gas and a rocket. The movie climaxes with what has become one of the most iconic scenes of 1990s action cinema, as our hero played by Nicholas Cage, races out of the lighthouse with his two green flares in a desperate attempt to save himself and the hostages from being blasted into oblivion by an imminent air force carpet bombing.While not achieving the classic status of Die Hard, The Rock is still remembered and respected 13 years on as an elite action movie, one of the finest examples of great action cinema. Coming from someone who has seen plenty of highly praised, "Important","classic" movies from Citizen Kane to Pulp Fiction, let me say that The Rock is one of the best damn movies ever made.</fullReview>

This one is probably my favorite Bay film.Now, I know this movie is on the borderline of ridiculous, but that's why I like it. I've accepted that. Its funny, smart, and action packed.On the "good guys" side: Sean Connery gave an excellent performance as John Mason, the aged former inmate of Alcatraz. Nicholas Cage gave a comical performance as Dr. Goodspeed, the wimpy, cocky chemical expert. John Spencer was annoying as FBI Director James Womack but I think he was supposed to be. William Forsythe was good as the tough FBI Agent Paxton. Michael Biehn was convincing as Anderson, the commander of the Navy SEALS team. And Danny Nucci was annoying as Lt. Shephard, oh well I won't cry about it.On the "bad guys" side: Ed Harris gave the best performance as Brigadier General Frank Hummel, leader of the Marine team who takes over Alcatraz. David Morse was really good as Major Tom Baxter, the second in command. John C. McGinley was really good as the obedient Captain Hendrix, who endlessly searches the tunnels for the SEALS. Tony Todd was really good as Captain Darrow, the mercenary team member who wants to be paid. Gregory Sporleder was really annoying as Captain Frye, the annoying mercenary who just gets in the way and is really annoying. And Bokeem Woodbine is OK as Sgt. Crisp.Over all, a cocky movie but thats what makes it great.9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Rock is a favorite action, adventure and suspenseful film of mine. Some of my favorite players-- Sean Connery, Nicholas Cage, and Ed Harris-- stared in the movie. Hummel (Ed Harris) played an evil villain. Dr. Goodspeed (Nicholas Cage) has knowledge of chemical warfare and so he arrives sent to Alcatraz with some Navy Seals because he works with the C.I.A. The Rock keeps you on the edge of your seat because of chemical missiles threatening the city of San Francisco, California. Nicholas Cage, the scientist, risks his life to rescue the city, while his girlfriend comes to the city when he tells her not to.One of my favorite scenes is the scene where the Marines wipe out Anderson's (Navy Seals) team. Another scene I enjoyed was the scene with Goodspeed near the beginning, when he is diffusing the chemical bomb. The agent trainee with him didn't know when he squeezed the doll it would send out explosive, poisonous gas. I enjoyed the suspense as I watched the movie again and again.The most powerful character in this movie is Mason (Sean Connery). He has many secrets and an extensive knowledge of maximum security prisons, since he is the only man who has ever escaped from Alcatraz. For this reason he was chosen to go with the Seals. This movie has characters with action. The cast is strong; the film has just the right comedy mixed with suspense. This film is my favorite action movie. I never grow tired of seeing this movie over and over again.</fullReview>

They work so well together that you feel Goodspeed's struggle with picking up a gun and protecting his partner. Ed Harris is at the top of his form here giving a great performance as General Hummel, a man who wants the corruption in the military public, but doesn't want to hurt anybody in the process.

		<fullReview>This was a fantastic film that should be seen by all. I am an action-film fan, and this was by far one of the greatest action films I have ever seen. With great special effects and action, great acting, and a comic-book style story that is intriguing in all its aspects, "The Rock" should be seen by all. Ed Harris plays an angry, determined ex-General from the U.S. military who fought in many wars and was respected by many people from high positions in the government. However, he has radical views and believes that the U.S. government never supported American soldiers who fought overseas and returned home and received no rewards for their sacrifice. To prove his point, Harris directs a group of former Marines who steal several chemical missiles from a weapons depot and plant them in an isolated spot that would be hard to invade: Alcatraz Island! What better place for a base of operations than a deserted island with an unused prison? Harris and his thugs threaten to launch chemical missiles at San Francisco Bay (which could kill hundreds of thousands instantly) unless he and other former marines are paid $100 million by the U.S. government. Since when does our government bow to the demands of terrorists? Whether global jihadists or angry domestic troublemakers, negotiation with the enemy is not an option...Nicholas Cage is a young FBI chemical-weapons expert who is sent along with a group of soldiers as well as Sean Connery (a life-long prisoner who is sent in with the soldiers because he knows the layout of Alcatraz, having been the "only prisoner there to ever escape"). They plan to stop Harris from firing his missiles but they are met inside the prison by an ambush of heavy fire (remember, the "terrorists" here are well-trained, decorated former U.S. soldiers) and many are killed. Alone and planning to save many innocent lives, Cage and Connery plot to fight until they win over the prison's occupiers and save America from bowing to terrorist demands.... This film was fantastic and was a great action film, running along the ranks of "Air Force One" and "Face/Off"... Please feel free to email me with any questions or comments...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Viewed as an action movie I would have to put this among the top 10 of all times. The story is kind of... not unusual, but the actors make this movie really great. There is NO better man to play an officer with a conscience than Ed Harris. Period. Contrary to the awful Colonel Trautman (Richard Crenna at his... well, usual level, I suppose) Harris acting is flawless. Then there is Nicholas Cage who is always good in this sort of role, the guy who is stronger than he thinks, and shows courage when it really counts. Sean Connery is of course great as he always is, but sad to say, the scriptwriters gave him some really cheesy comments, such as "winners go home and f**k the prom queen". I mean, that's not the line you'd like an actor like Connery to deliver. Really. Just as we would not like to hear Jean-Claude Van Damme read lines from some play of Shakespeare. Anyway, I have to correct myself. A little. Along side with Ed Harris, Michael Biehn is the perfect guy to play an officer. I mean, do people think of him as ANYTHING else? No, don't think so. Aliens, The Abyss, Terminator, Navy SEALs, the guy is a soldier! He plays the role really good, as always. And the supporting roles of William Forsythe, among others, is also good. Well, enough about the actors. The music gave me goose bumps. Perfect action movie music. In my mind only met by Alan Silvestri's music for "Predator". I am from Sweden, and like most of my countrymen, we aren't to keen on flag-waving movies , of which The Rock is a great example, along side with Armageddon and Independence Day. The Americans save the world! Sometimes we get the notion that you guys forget that there are other countries that are just as technologically advanced as you. Well, I had to put in a little criticism in here! Other than that, I give The Rock an 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid as its namesake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When ex-military General Hummel (Ed Harris) takes 80 hostages at Alcatraz prison and threatens to kill the population of San Francisco with nerve gas if their ransom money is not delivered, the US government rushes into action. They deduce that the best way to sneak in undetected is a minimal attack force led by a high profile chemist (Nicholas Cage) and a wily convicted criminal, (Sean Connery) the only man to ever successfully escape from Alcatraz as an inmate.When a movie bears the name Michael Bay, we have now come to instantly associate that movie with ACTION. Fast moving, very thinly stretched plots, pounding rock music, tons of car chases and, of course, lots of explosions are sure to follow. But The Rock is, in my opinion, Bay's best film to this point (we'll see if this summer's The Island will surpass it) because it never attempts to be anything other than one it is - a Michael Bay action film. None of the disgustingly sappy American patriotism of Pearl Harbor, nor the offensive, borderline racism of the Bad Boys films is present here - just a good, solid action movie which never attempts to be anything more profound than entertaining.Sean Connery is perfectly cast as John Patrick Mason, the contemptuous criminal, enlisted to help save San Francisco by the government he despises so, and he fills the screen with his indomitable, natural charisma. Nicholas Cage gives a decent performance as the shy chemist who is finally called on to be a hero. (although he seems to have difficulty determining the difference between loud and dramatic in tense scenes) Contrary to most action movies, Cage's Dr. Stanley Goodspeed and Connery's Mason are actually given some basic character development: Goodspeed fearing throughout the whole movie, not only for his wife's safety, but for the fact that she is worrying about him regardless of if he succeeds or not, and Mason in a subplot involving his long lost daughter. Finally, Ed Harris is also a good casting call as the bitter general, demanding retribution for years of maltreatment during his military career. He is also given some decent character development - almost immediately, we find that despite his bitter attitude the General is a good man, not really intending to fire the nerve gas, and avoiding a body count at all possible occasions. David Morse also stands out as Hummel's intelligent and loyal second in command.So overall, The Rock is just your basic no-brainer action film, made better by the strong performances from the good cast, and Bay's steady directorial hand throughout. It's worth seeing, and doesn't even have a dimwitted enough plot to insult your intelligence! Just keep in mind that even though The Rock requires more conscious thought than the average action movie, it is still a Michael Bay movie... so prepare for explosions.-8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly Bay's only good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this movie amazingly good for a Micheal Bay project, however outside of that it's not "amazing". The cast was very nice, even though I'm not a big fan of Cage, I don't dislike him. In short it's worth a rental, a very good movie all in all, and if you hate Micheal Bay, watch this. You may find a bit of respect for the man.Sean Connery did well, as usual. It's been a good bit since I've seen the movie, and I don't want to ruin it for you, so go out and rent it, it's not a bad film by any means.Much better than Pearl Harbor.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie rocks! Pardon the pun. It's what cinema should be about - a pure adrenalin, non-stop thrill ride! Connery and Cage are great.The direction is superb, as is all of Bay's work. You can see he really knows how to use the camera for the greatest effect. He combines great visuals and a music score that really drives to story on and keeps us glued. The characters are about as rounded as they could be for an action film and the exposition is minimal.The script is tight and the editing real slick. This is one of my favorite movies of this genre. The climax and other set pieces are extremely well devised and executed. Bravo!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of Sean Connery's Best Films Ever !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sean Connery has always been one of my favorite actors,and three decades after letting go of the James Bond label,he proves that he still can do leading roles in action movies.At the age of 66,that is by no means something ordinary.In this film he plays British S.A.S. operative John Patrick Mason who has spent thirty years in prison in the U.S..He is also the only one who escaped from the high security prison Alcatraz,also known as the 'The Rock'. General Francis Hummel,played by Ed Harris is a disillusioned General who decides to take over Alcatraz with a band of loyal Navy Seals and hold its visiting tourists to ransom,in exchange for a hundred million dollars that he believes are due to the families of soldiers killed in action-a fact that has been conveniently overlooked by the government. He threatens to attack San Fransisco with chemical weapons if his demands are not met.The military decides to move in to capture the General,and they call upon Mason to lead them into 'The Rock'. Thus Hummel and Mason clash,and the consequences are fatal.Nicholas Cage is the chemical weapons expert Stanley Goodspeed sent along with Mason into the prison to disarm the rockets set to be launched by Hummel.This of course is an action film,but it is Connery's treatment of his character that makes Mason a lot more than a senile Rambo.He is a ruthless man,but with a golden heart inside him that makes him stand by Goodspeed when the latter's life is in danger,though he could easily seize the opportunity to escape.He is also a doting father who yearns to see his daughter after thirty years.Cage is at his best here,playing the shaky but committed good guy who doesn't hesitate to put his life on the line for his country. Ed Harris does a good job as the erring General,and his failure and death proves the old adage 'violence begets violence'.But it is Connery who towers head and shoulders above everyone else.Whether it is shooting down mercenaries or tearing through the streets of San Fransisco with a Hum-V,this great Scotsman is always in his element.This is his show all the way,and an explosive one at that.A fantastic action flick with a fantastic leading man !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alright, I'm a fan of action film and this started it. The Rock (Referring to Alcatraz) is under new management by the famous, Vietnam Vet General Frank Hummel (Ed Harris). His cause is to avenge the men he lost in Vietnam while the government stood by and watched. With him are three or four squads of Navy SEALS, 81 hostages, and extremely dangerous poison gas missiles aimed at San Fransico. A squad is assembled but a guide is needed and a scientist to diffuse the missiles. John Mason (Sean Connery), the only unknown escapee of the infamous prison is to lead nineteen Navy SEALS into the prison to stop the madness. Along with them Dr. Goodspeed (Nicholas Cage) is called in to assist. Soon the SEALS are gone, having been slaughtered, and Mason and Goodspeed are left to deal with the situation. The story for an action film is pretty good and the acting is solid. Connery, Harris, Cage, and Morse make up an excellent cast. The film is more focused on the characters then most action flicks and the outline of the actual prison for the location was pretty fun to watch. The film is loaded with violence and language but is needed at most parts to keep the flow even though mothers won't approve. The Rock. Starring: Sean Connery, Nicholas Cage, Ed Harris, David Morse, John Spencer, and William Forsythe.3 1/2 out of 5 Stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exhilarating action.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Rock is an exceptionally well put-together action film that leaves you completely breathless. It's not high art, but it may be one of the more evolved examples of the 80s/90s action blockbuster, and it's certainly a lot of fun.The whole plot is merely a mechanism to buddy up Sean Connery as a grizzled but still tough ex-antiterrorist operative and Nicholas Cage who plays (tongue in cheek) a lab-bound FBI agent. Ed Harris makes a terrific bad guy as the mad general armed with some really icky chemicals. Why does he choose to take over a prison instead of, for example, hide a VX rocket under a populated street and threaten to trigger it by remote control? Well, because it's in the script! Now carefully add the set pieces. A crumbling old fortress full of lots of pieces of twisted metal where bad guys can impale themselves on. A mine car run obviously designed by the same LSD-tripping mining engineer who designed the one in Indiana Jones. A furnace that belches flame and swishes various sharp metal implements at you every few seconds. (This is the most fun!) If The Rock was a video game it'd be Doom II. Still, it's very exciting to see Connery back in his old form, and Cage bringing up the rear. Every scene crackles with tension and suspense, but you get the feeling it's not totally serious, as there's a comic edge to a lot of the film, especially the dialogue.This movie could only be made in the Clinton era. It disdains politicians in that oh-so-familiar Hollywood way, but it carries a certain amount of venom toward the military mindset as well, portraying Marines as homicidal testosterone-flushed automatons. I can't see a Hollywood producer getting near a script with that kind of subtext today. But, overall, The Rock is a good time, cheap harmless fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie, specially cause there is no real "villian" in it.(of course apart from those mercenaries that go berserk near the end). Its more of good against reality, where decisions have to be made that wouldn't necessary turn out to be "right" at the end. Michael Bay is an excellent director when it comes to keepin the movie on an up-tempo till the end of it. Also must emphasis on the music...awesome ! The script was cool as well and sean connery and nicolas cage does a fine job with it. One thing i got to know after watching was that Ed Harris is an ideal match for playing a a military leader. (E.g; The German sniper in Enemy at the Gate) He should focus more in playing such roles. This is one of my all time favorites !!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intense action movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With this movie Michael Bay has proved to us that he can be a good action director. His first project Bad Boys was junk, but it led to the making of this movie and this is one AWESOME MOVIE! Great action scenes include and awesome car chase with a Hummer and Ferrari, explosive shootouts, and a very good musical score. The music really carries this movie and is woven expertly into the on-screen action. That alone is a noteworthy achievement. The performances are also surprisingly good for a movie of this type. Ed Harris gives a very good performance as the rogue marine general and that really puts this movie above the action film crowd. Most films in this genre tend to quickly introduce a bunch of cardboard cut-out characters and then turn to ridiculous action and violence. Action-wise this film is pretty ridiculous (come on, it's a Hollywood movie), but the characters and music and general good production help give it the sense most other films of this type lack. Also Sean Connery never fails to impress with his wit, which almost echoes James Bond. 8/10Rated R: strong violence, and profanity</fullReview>

McGinley, Bokeem Woodbine, Anthony Clark. Action packed high octane machine of a movie with disgruntled ex-Marine hero Harris taking a group of tourists hostage at Alcatraz with a band of mercenaries and a group of poison gas equipped rockets aimed at San Francisco with only two men capable of thwarting him: prisoner Connery, a former British spy incarcerated since his escape from the infamous jail and goofy 'super freak' FBI chemist Cage (the best thing about the film by the way) teamed up to infiltrate and dismantle the weaponry PHEW! Breakneck paced editing and some wicked sequences added with the right amount of cocky humor. Cage's reluctant every-man FEEB is memorable, particularly witnessing a nasty dispatch of one of the villains: 'Well, yeak OK , that's just about the most awful thing I've ever seen.' Smartly directed by maverick Michael Bay and the last film produced by the dynamic duo of Don Simpson (who died during production) and Jerry Bruckheimer.</fullReview>

The movie is packed with shooting and explosions, so if you kind' a like that - I would recommand this movie!

		<fullReview>`The Rock'The film that solidified Nicolas Cage as an action star and Sean Connery as?well?a guy who uses the F-word a lot, `The Rock' never ceases to slow on the action; its plot is, of course, ridiculous, but I'm not looking for an Oscar winner in an action movie.Cage plays Stanley Goodspeed (weird name number 1), a chemical specialist whom disarms chemical bombs and such.Ed Harris plays Himmel or Hummel or something like that (weird name number 2), a respected General who one day decides, `What the heck!' and takes Alcatraz prison hostage; he demands respect for dead marines from the government, or he will release some ba-a-a-ad gas on San Francisco. Enter Cage, who must, with a pack of government marines, enter Alcatraz from underneath (under water) and take out Himmel/Hummel. That's where Sean Connery comes in as John Mason, the only man to ever escape Alcatraz unscathed. Connery `agrees' to help them enter the prison the same way he escaped.`The Rock' is pure, unadulterated fun. Nothing less, nothing more. It delivers everything you want in an action film: Explosions, guns, special effects, and more explosions. If you can't have fun watching a movie like this, you can't have fun watching a movie. Period.The acting in `The Rock' is nothing to scoff at. Nicolas Cage is great in this role, as in other action roles. The thing that is different here, however, is that Nic doesn't know how to use weapons much; he is a chemical expert, not a trained FBI agent. So, it is more than humorous to see him running around defenseless; especially seeing that it is Nicolas Cage, who usually plays action roles where he is the master of the weapons.Sean Connery is perfect for the role of John Mason; he blends wisecracks, action and?well?Sean Connery.Ed Harris is also very good as Himmelhummelwhatever; he seems a bit held back at times, but overall, his acting is as good as ever.The direction style in `The Rock' reminds me very much of other Nicolas Cage films, like John Woo's `Face/Off' and such. It is gritty, dark, and exciting. It adapts to the characters' emotions.The first thirty minutes or so of `The Rock' are nothing special; I almost stopped watching at one point. But once they get to Alcatraz the action picks up and never slows down. Explosion after explosions after gunfight after stunts, leading to an explosive ending (literally) that may be predictable to a certain degree, but nevertheless lotsa' fun.All in all, `The Rock' is the kind of movie where you sit back, turn off your brain for two hours, and have some slam-bam fun.4/5 stars ?John Ulmer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>wonderful action film, funnier than you'd expect (SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the first twenty minutes, two separate rooms must be evacuated because of two potential explosions. And we don't get to relax much between the two events. We don't get to relax much at all. Even the slow-paced scenes will generally keep you on the edge of your seat.Nicolas Cage is the FBI agent who solves the second problem, and he is at home relaxing when his girlfriend announces she is pregnant and wants to get married. Meanwhile, a group touring Alcatraz is locked up by a bunch of bad guys in camouflage uniforms (this is actually sort of funny). The head man (Ed Harris in a compelling performance) threatens to release poison gas in San Francisco (enough to kill a million people) unless the government gives him enough money to sufficiently compensate the families of numerous men who served under him in several military actions. The general has a war record that brings to mind the song 'The Twelve Days of Christmas,' yet he is now a traitor who considers himself to be like one of the Founding Fathers.Cage is called on to be a part of the team that will take back Alcatraz and defuse the situation, though he has no combat experience. His girlfriend wants to come along to San Francisco when Cage assumes he is being called for a training exercise. Later, she refuses to stay behind after he tells the truth. Only one man can make this operation work: He is so dangerous he has been behind bars for over 30 years, and he is the only man ever to escape from Alcatraz, though the government will not acknowledge his existence. When working for British intelligence, he uncovered secrets connected to Roswell and JFK but didn't do what he was supposed to.Lots of good acting performances here. Where to start? At first Cage did not remind me of other characters he had played, so that was enough to make his performance a good one. But he was occasionally funny as would be expected, especially in the scenes where the Alcatraz expert is first released and being interviewed. Sean Connery is good as usual, thoroughly evil at first when he gets out of prison, but also funny; he wants a penthouse suite and the best of everything if he's going to help these people. Later he is mostly tough but also shows a tender side, in one scene with his illegitimate daughter and in several good scenes with Cage. Cage's boss in this operation, who I believe is now on 'The West Wing,' was also quite good. The best purely comic performance: the apparently gay barber who cuts Connery's hair (yes, he has hair, quite long at first). I think every acting performance was good, even right down to the people with one or two lines.You like car chases complete with wrecks and explosions? This movie has a good one. And it's funny too. Lots of funny stuff in the first half, despite the serious nature of the situation. The second half has some comedy but is much more serious and quite violent. The first half is violent too. And the language was probably quite graphic as originally shown.SPOILERS: Connery ran away three times, the first time in that car chase when he was searching for his daughter, whom he had never met. The second time, he returned to the operation out of concern for his daughter. The third time, he came back so Cage's child would have a father. He did have a heart. And the ending was funny: a pastor chases Cage out of a church Cage damaged in order to take possession of...THE SECRET TO JOHN KENNEDY'S ASSASSINATION!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The scene where the Navy Seals are surrounded by marines in the shower room is one of the best action scenes of all time. The Seal Team Leader, tells the general that he agrees with what he is fighting for but, like him he swore to protect the USA from enemies foriegn and domestic. This scene is pulsating with potential action until the pivotal moment when all hell breaks loose. After the gunfire begins, the dramatic music takes hold and all you can do is watch Seal after Seal, go down. This scene makes so feel proud that we live in a nation where people will sacrifice their lives to protect the innocent people. After all the bullets are fired, the whole seal team is dead. The one moment that will forever make me love this movie is when the general says to the camera I did not want this...damn you for forcing me to make this decision. It was a great moment in the movie because it shows that even though they had to kill them, Ed Harris still thought of the seals as fellow brothers who went down in combat. I rated this movie an 8-10 just for the shear greatness of this scene.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is really a well done movie with a terrific cast (Connery, Cage, Harris, Morse, Biehn, beautiful Claire Forlani). Ed Harris gave it all as General Francis Hummel making this one of the best performances I've seen (perhaps I'm exagerating a bit but I liked it anyway) and that he's done (see also God wannabe Cristof from Truman Show). Besides of what the script and the characters thought and said of Hummel (a good man after all) I was really simpathetic to him to the point I regreted his death a lot.Good props and uniforms and locations too, and an excellent score with that particular tune that is played on every Bay/Bruckheimer film.Although there was nothing really bad with the script, I was actually sorry for those SEALs that got screwed as soon as they entered the Rock, which anyway was good to the plot. Only complaint is that it seems to be too inaccurate about technical stuff sometimes. All in all, one of the best (strictly) action films ever made, if not the best.......... 9/10</fullReview>

The acting, the story, the directing, the humor, the action...EVERYTHING! I can honestly say that there is nothing I don't like about the film.Michael Bay, in my book, is without-a-doubt one of the best directors that have come along in quite some time. I've loved every single one of his films so far and he did not let me down wit this film. His style of directing is SO COOL to me, everything looks crisp and clear and just PERFECT!The story in this film is absolutely great and there is a reason for every plot point in this film. The characters in this film are fantastic as well, every single one of them is likeable (not necessarily a likeable person, but as in the character is done well).The acting in this film is excellent and every cast member does a great job with their roles. Nicolas Cage pulls off one of his best performances and Sean Connery does a great job, as always. Ed Harris is a highlight in the film too, his character is done VERY well. There are so many great cast members in this film I'm not going to go through all of them, but they all did a fantastic job! Although I have to mention Claire Forlani and Vanessa Marcil, these women are just absolutely inrcedible!If I haven't talked-up the movie enough, please go see this movie!

		<fullReview>This is the best film ever made. It is my favorite movie ever. I liked it because it was a long movie. I don't enjoy short movies because they all of a sudden end just when they become good unlike this movie. When this movie starts to become good you can look at the case and say there's still another hour left of action packed excitement. I especially enjoy the car chase. After I watched it a few times I noticed that The Fast and the Furious nabbed their final stunt, when Vin Diesel hit the semi and did a corkscrew, out of the car chase in this movie, when an FBI agent hit a parked car and did the full corkscrew. Overall I give it a 10 out of 10. It was well-made, full of violence, and creative dialogue.</fullReview>

Very good production, the movie is super realistic, you don't get those weird technology devices shown in other pictures just to blow you away, the equipment is what the marines and seals actually use on their daily job. The suspense is backed up by the music the kind that was also used in movies like Under Siege and Gladiator. A must see and a must have, is the only one I actually have on DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is the best action movie I have ever seen, or probably will see. It's got great music, made by Hans Zimmer, Harry-Gregson Williams and Nick Glennie-Smith. This is THE action-score in my book! Great performances, good writing, character development, humor, and one of the best car chases ever. Great cinematography, great editing, great sound, the list goes on! Buy the Criterion Edition-DVD of this movie NOW! 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome action movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sean Connery and Nicholas Cage give very cool performances as an ex-con and a scientist who them and a group of soldiers go to Alcatraz to thwart a person's attempt to send a nuke to destroy some major damage. Ed Harris plays the bad guy and he was cool as him and I enjoyed him very much. The action in this was too cool and some stuff got me queezy but most was just awesome. The coolest part ,no doubt, was the guy sent off by a rocket. That was really cool. All sorts of other parts were cool too. The directing was great. Everything was great.Overall I love this movie and I found no flaws in this and I recommend this to anyone who likes action. Rating 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A surprise of a lifetime for action movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie surprised me like no other. I read reviews, I saw how it did in the box office, and so I didn't expect too much. Turns out, I got what I would have never expected. I came across something big. Big enough to be one of, if not, the best action movies I have ever seen! Ed Harris made a perfect patriotic bad guy. Nicolas Cage and Sean Connery made a perfect match, and it made me laugh. Cage played the wimp, and Connery played the tough guy, and it worked perfectly. This movie based around a hostage situation, any hostage type story always drives me into it, but doesn't always end well. This one did. I enjoyed every moment, and that's why I gave it a rating of 10/10. If I had any complaint for this movie, it would be to get rid of that white, hair-slicked-back, mustache guy. That dude was annoying and really didn't need to be in this picture. A better actor for that part might have helped.</fullReview>

Everything about the film is great from the awesome action sequences and stunts to the musical score. It is the perfect fun filled movie.

		<shortDescription>THE ROCK</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you go into THE ROCK expecting to see a drama, you've got it. Action film? Definitely. Comedy? A good bit of it. THE ROCK has just about everything you look for in a movie.THE ROCK begins as a team of renegade U.S. Marines, led by Brigadier General Francix Hummel (excellently played by Ed Harris), infiltrates a U.S. missile silo and steals 15 VX poison gas rockets. He then takes over Alcatraz Island with 81 civilian hostages and threatens to launch the gas at San Fransisco if his demands aren't met.To stop this, the FBI gets biochemical lab rat Stanley Goodspeed (well done by Nicolas Cage) to disarm the rockets and 60-year-old convict John Mason (excellent performance by Sean Connery), who escaped from Alcatraz in 1963, to get them in. They go into Alcatraz with a Navy SEAL team to stop all of this.Harry Gregson-Williams delivers a good score with several outstanding moments - namely the opening and a scene in the Alcatraz shower room where all of the Navy SEALS (excluding, of course, Goodspeed and Mason) are brutally killed in a massacre that General Hummel tries desperately to stop. That is also one of the most gripping and emotional scenes, especially seeing a traitor General trying to stop his own men from killing the enemy.There are some cheesy lines ("I'm only borrowing your Humvee!"; "Actually, I'm a chemical SUPERfreak, but I still need a gun"), but there are many witty ones. I recommend anyone over 13 to see this (effects of VX poison gas are quite disgusting, and the shower-room massacre isn't for young children), but really it's your decision to make.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The BEST action/drama movie I have ever seen. **** 4stars!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Besides Black Hawk Down, The Rock and Armageddon are my favorite Bruckheimer movies. The reason is because of Micheal Bay. The guy is brilliant with that camera, and he let's his actor's make you care about them by getting the most out of them. Unlike most action movies, where they tend to focus on explosions and the extra ammo, This movie had me caught up in all the drama as well. Nothing compares to the Rock because it has a lot of everything in it, Romance, Humor, Action, A Car chase scene, a top notch script, and the best soundtrack I ever experienced since Rocky!! Phenomenal acting by Connery, (He should still be agent 007!!) at his age proves he can still be an action star. Nicholas Cage was good as well playing an FBI bio-chemist who was sort of a wimp but proved otherwise. I actually cared about the characters and the story was awesome. I heard this movie was underrated, It's too bad, people really don't know what they are missing in The Rock. Easily my favorite action/drama of all time. It's not considered a war movie, even though it involves conflicts between our Government and ex US Marines. But this flick qualifies as a masterpiece, and whoever disagrees needs to go have their heads examined.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An action flick with all the trimmings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Action movies are a lot like fast food. You know: you're not in the mood for something complicated, you just want to satisfy your appetite. You certainly don't want to think too hard during or after the experience. And you want to know what to expect. So you go to Mickey D's, or Steven Seagal--same diff.But every now and then, you get surprised. The fast food joint has a monthly special and it's better than their usual fare. You get what you came for (fast pacing, clever lines, things gettin' blowed up real good), but you get something extra. In the case of The Rock, you get a LOT of extras: top-notch performances by A-list leads (Connery, Cage, Harris) and by some of the best supporting actors around (Morse, Biehn, Forsythe, Spencer, Todd, McGinley); a setting, the decrepit bowels of Alcatraz, that's a visual feast and almost a character in the movie itself; character development (!!!); and an action flick that ain't afraid to quote Oscar Wilde.Granted, it ain't Filet Mignon, or Schindler's List. But it's better than what you expected, yet still exactly what you were in the mood for. The Rock is one of the very best in a genre over-populated with mediocrity. Michael Bay still hasn't equaled it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael Bay's masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although i have seen many of Bay's films and enjoyed most of them, nothing is in comparison to this 1996 bay area based action film. I am just curious why it is not as popular or well known as it should. Dont get me wrong, granted it is a familiar film amongst most people yet it never appears in their top ten? Currently this film sits at number 5 on mine. I felt this film carried the most wide range of cinema aspect that any action film can carry. There was a mixture of minor romance, drama, and comedy which is why i am pleased to see that the criterion collection values it. Apparently the AFI probably wont but what do they know, the most action based film they would even consider is Saving Private Ryan which was also a good film but it seemed to be more of a Drama than action even if i reconsider the opening seen. What I think Michael Bay does best it simply put, he makes his stuff cool. He chooses the right angles to show the right section of what every he is filming. You can shoot a navy seal rising from the water in many different ways but his straight on established shot as the seal so rises up and pans his weapon from left to right was amazing. It is the small things like that which eventually amounts to a great film. He doesnt only focus on the big action scenes but the minor ones as well and it work wonderfully because it keeps us all tuned for the duration of the film. It is a film that any action enthusiast would enjoy over and over again. If your considering on purchasing this on DVD, remember to shell out a few more bucks and get the Criterion Collection version, the extra money will be well spent once you see Ed Harris re-doing his takes. I must also give the writers of this film some credit because or it's several directions they went with the script while keeping action the main subject. I mainly focus on action films (although currently in film school i am considering on doing dramas) and from all the ones i had ever seen i think this film is surely the best overall, not my number 1 favorite but the overall best pick for anyone to see and i truely believe that is someone doesnt enjoy this film regardless of age, gender, etc. you have problems and something is wrong with you. And for all the people who have seen this film, i would like to ask ou to reconsider this film's greatness for what it deserves. ENJOY THE ROCK!</fullReview>

It has everything you could want from a big-budget action film :- Great story, excellent cast (Sean Connery, Ed Harris, Nic Cage, Michael Bein, David Morse), amazing action sequences, well-integrated comedy moments, and SUPERB direction. The battle scene in the shower-room on Alcatraz is one of the most touching and poignant battle scenes ever filmed, and leaves you close to tears (especially as Mr Harris "damns" the Government powers responsible for causing the slaughter of the heroic Navy Seal Crack Insertion Team).

		<fullReview>Some people think that this is a terrible movie. People say that the point of the car chase was to destroy things. Of course it was! The Rock is an *action* movie. You are supposed to see thing blow up, people shot, cars being crashed. As for the fact that the director changes camera angles often: it adds to the action. It's a boring action movie seeing one shot of an explosion. You want to see the thing being blown up, and then the people's expressions as they run away.To sum up my thoughts: It's an action movie, not a drama.

		<fullReview>This film is SADLY Underrated. An explosive thrill ride. Captivating from beginning to it's end. This movie easily could have been another action movie thrown together to make money. Every aspect of 'The Rock' shines; The performances are phenomonal, Hanz Zimmer's Composing is amazing(I highly suggest going to downloading the main theme off any file sharing)the direction is good, the charactors are well developed, solid, unlike a hulking retard who walks around aimlessly with a huge machine gun such as rambo...Any American will feel compassion about American soldiers losing their lives and not being honored or remembered Which is a the cause of the action in the film. General Hummel "Possibly the greatest battalion commander of the vietnam war". A great military leader who was very successful in his aray of missions. For the troops that died under his command during blackOps missions (blackops meaning secret, planned and prepared by the US Goverenment, but never made public) were never given medals, money to their families "These men died for their country and weren't even given a military burial." Hummel puts together his own team of troops and takes over Alcatraz with 81 hostages and 14VX Gas Warheads and demands the money from the U.S. Government. Brilliant job to everybody involved in the production. 'The Rock' is my favorite movie of all time. Hats off Connery, Cage, Hans Zimmer, Micheal Bay, David Morse, andDON SIMPSON!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow! The Rock is one of the most rewatchable films I own. I've watched it countlessly, and it seems to have the quick, energizing effect of a good song that we love to play again and again. The dialogue is at times funny, always fresh, and sometimes intelligent. This film shines as an actioner that actually has a great, plausible plot, with some characters we wouldn't mind following on a journey. (I really liked Sean Connery's character; maybe a sequel with "Mr.John Mason"?)And then there are the heavyweights in acting, a rarity in action films. Ed Harris, Sean Connery, Nic Cage, and a few others are so talented in reading their lines in a unique way, one can see that these are truly great actors. I loved Ed Harris' character, since it was not the standard black &amp; white type, but a complex person. Who would've thought I'd be saying "complex" in an actioner? Well, that's how The Rock surprises you, like a vicious left hook to the face. Oh yeah, the Hans Zimmer score is a knockout, as always.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite action movie of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first glance and especially according to it's trailer The Rock appears at first to be the generic shoot-em-up, explosion laden, Swiss-cheese plot, mindless action film. Fortunately, why there is no shortage of action, the film spends enough time with it's characters that is also a half way decent movie. Nicholas Cage is an FBI chemical weapons specialist. Sean Connery is the British SAS officer who once escaped from the famed prison. Ed Harris is the Marine general who is tired of his men being ignored by the Pentagon. (possible spoilers ahead) Major Hummel (Harris), with the aid of some Marines, hijacks a bunch of chemical weapons rockets which he then places on Alcatraz island with the cover of a large number of tourist hostages. Stanley Goodspeed (Cage) is called in for his expertise and John Mason (Connery)is given a reprieve from his 30 year prison sentence due to his extensive knowledge of the island prison's inner sanctum. From here the story moves through mason's short escape from custody, but just long enough to visit his long-lost daughter. Michael Biehn, my favorite underrated actor, makes an appearance as the leader of the SEAL team sent to free the prison. Even though the SEAL's are predictably wiped out it is done quite plausibly and Mason and Goodspeed become a mismatched duo that is all that stands between Hummel's rockets and San Francisco. The rest of the movie is Goodspeed and Mason running around fighting off Marines and disabling rockets. While we don't agree with his methods the audience (and even the SEAL commander) sympathize with Hummel. All in all a fun movie with great action sequences that manages to maintain plausibility and a decent plot."Gentlemen, you can't fight in here! This is the war room!"</fullReview>

The editing, the dialogues, the characters, the soundtrack and sometimes even the plot appear in every single action movie that is out at the theaters today...

You got Cage, Connery and Harris as the leads. Then you got Morse, Biehn, McGinley, Todd and Forsythe in minor rolls. These guys are great! This is about as big a "guy movie" as you're gonna find. This movie and Leaving Las Vegas are what rocketed Cage into superstar status. Oh, he was always a star, with plenty of work, but after the critical acclaim he got from Vegas and the box office he delivered in The Rock, in '96 he became a star people actually wanted to pay to see on the screen. Good for him. He does a god job here as the guy who's in way over his head. He gets to be eccentric and a little heroic as he battles the bad guys (and Sean Connery, who makes him look like schoolboy).Connery pulls it off, i have to hand it to him. This guy is old, but I had no problem believing him walking into Alcatraz and gunning down a hundred soldiers like he was Sly Stallone. I guess that's saying a lot for the old Bond.Harris is intense, but isn't he always? This guy gives a glare that could give Clint Eastwood chills. I love watching this guy, and I sympathized with his plight. He's not a villain, but he's not quite the patriot he thinks he is, and he learns it the hard way. The scene with him and Connery is very fun to watch.Is Michael Bay a good director? My thinking is... yes and no. He packs this movie with a lot of interesting shots, but doesn't linger on one of them for more than two seconds at a time. Is that insecurity or just his music video pedigree? It is an neat effect at first, but it gets frustrating. I give it a 9/10 stars. G'night!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lots of action, little intelligence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you like action you will like this film.But I miss the intelligence. E.g. all rocket guidance chips are destroyed as soon as they are found (good thinking by Connery) except the last one!? Why take that risk? Furthermore, imho, the micro film spy stuff of Connery is completely unnecessary for the film, so why mention it?I also don't like the 'romantic' sub plots. Pregnant girlfriend of Cage and long-time-no-see daughter of Connery. Why spent time on that? I'm sure that if you remove these 'romantic' parts, including the action packed but ridiculous car chase in SF, and spent the time on more character building, the film would have been better. Just stick to the "How to take a heavily defended fortress in 24 hours?" plot line.The main actors are ok. I liked the performance of Harris who turns out to be a 'good' one after all. Connery, as always, plays very well.All in all I give it a 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Dream Cast, but still just a decent movie :(</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a knock-em dead cast: Sean Connery, David Morse, Nicholas Cage, Michael Bien, and Ed Harris. This was some incredible acting, but I'm biased as David Morse and Ed Harris are two of my favorite actors. Unfortunately, the movie is mostly a slug-fest, with Cage throwing out lots of lame-o humor in his disguise as a chemical nerd working for the FBI. Sean Connery got the biggest part of the glory in the movie, as he usually does, and I'm left yet again wondering why everyone is so crazy about this guy. A few good scenes and some great acting elevate this less than intelligent action flick to a 7.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How is this movie rated so highly?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't understand how so many people can say this movie is great. I thought it was terrible. This is the kind of movie where cars blow up for no reason and create unrealistically huge fireballs. Not only that, but the dialogue is cheesy, with typical one liners like "I'm too old for this." The plot is reminiscent of one of the not as good seasons of 24, but not as developed. As stated by other users, the villain was the best part of the movie. Perhaps I'm biased because this movie had been hyped up to me for so many years, and when I finally watched it I was extremely disappointed. But regardless, the movie was bad (although there are plenty worse out there). I probably would have rated the movie lower, but it was entertaining enough that I was able to get through it, despite being tempted to turn it off several times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Easily the worst movie of the year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I mean, I started with titling this review as "The worst movie ever made" but then changed it since I realized there are indeed much worse movies. So, alright, it is probably not the worst, probably not even the bottom, eeh..., 100, but it's still pretty bad. I'll list all the "bads" in the order of, well, badness:1. The score - horrible, absolutely sordid, I actually had to watch it with subtitles and Pandora on the background 2. Editing - sloppy at best, like that one scene where a certain humvee hits a road pole, head one, and in the next scene the same humvee happily plows through the crowed of bedazzled bystanders. There's many other enjoyable scenes like that when the cutting floor obviously had a party 3. Directing - well, it's not bad in the when it's present 4. Cinematography - they got a lot of grand wide-angle shots but again they spent like $70 mill on it. 5. Nicholas Cage 6. Nicholas Cage is the main character 7. Nicholas Cage survives till the very end 8. Script was just hilarious, I mean, it was probably written for 5th graders 9. Gives you a certain generic feel of distressful creepiness - like, realizing you've been eating a product labeled "made from natural ingredients" which was actually made of ground beef. This movie gives you a similar feeling, it is kind of made by people who claim to be filmmakers who in the end turn out to be snake oil salesmen. Kind of like watching good porn, it's almost admirable in it's naive, almost childish attempts, to look like a legitimate film, even though we all know it's all about the double-up scene towards the end.Alright, I admit, it's been pretty mean up to the point, so, I'll mention the good now: 1. They got Sean Connery 2. Sean Connery says: "I pershonally shink you're an idiot!" 3. Nicholas Cage almost gets blowen up off the face of the planet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael Bay Can Normally Suck Hocks In Hell, But This One Is Actually Pretty Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like Nicolas Cage. I like Sean Connery. Good start. We've got two great actors bouncing off one another.The plot is not paper thin, and Michael Bay leaves room for action, but doesn't make this film a completely mindless shootfest. The fact that Ed Harris is not a psychopath also adds depth to the film, as it is not a simple matter of good versus evil.Special effects and stunts are very well performed. As far as non-CGI action goes, this is a wonderful film.What makes this film? Two things: the actors, and the action. The script works well because of the actors, and the film works well because of the thrill ride that the audience is taken along for.Michael Bay is not normally a good director, so it looks like he stumbled upon a decent film when he made this. Most of his films are tedious, patriotic to the extent of pukefests, and edited so quickly, that it's like watching a hard-house music video most of the time. For once, though, he's done alright. I'll probably never say or write this again, but nice one, Michael Bay. You've made a good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welcome to The Rock!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's Die Hard on Alcatraz this time, ladies and gentlemen. It seems that now everybody's trying to do a hostage situation in certain movies after the first Die Hard made an impact on audience lives from Cliffhanger (Die Hard on Rocky Mountains), Speed (Die Hard on a bus) and now the 1996 movie "The Rock" directed by Michael Bay, who more or less is known for making high octane action movies with a plot for people not to think about. Here Michael makes an attempt to make to mix action, cool characters and an edge-of-your-seat adventure with an all-star cast.The film's premise has General Hummel (Ed Harris) robbing nuclear weapons and using Alcatraz as a base filled with members of a tour where with the weapons he could melt half a city after a big impact and asking the government a heavy ransom before releasing a missile. The F.B.I. brings in chemical specialist Stanley Goodspeed (Nicholas Cage), a neurotic agent who doesn't say bad words and knows everything about every chemical ever made. Goodspeed gets a partner, a convict by the name of John Mason (Sean Connery), an ex-agent for the British Intelligence who doesn't know that his deal of being released is being cut by an old rival of the F.B.I. while serving as the only hope to save the people in the old prison.With this being a Michael Bay movie, expect high action from every direction from a spectacular chase sequence in the San Francisco to the bad guys shooting the good guys with high power machine guns and unexpected surprises with emotion. One of the main reasons the film works besides the action is the relationship between Connery and Cage where despite their character differences in the film, somehow they depend on one another to save each other in certain situations and seeing how there's trust.Overall, a very good action movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael Bay Can Keep on Making Movies...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Goodspeed (Nicholas Cage) is a chemical weapons specialist for the FBI. So when a rogue general (Ed Harris) overtakes Alcatraz island and has a variety of rockets with VX warheads, he is called in to stop the general. But first he must subdue his new partner, lifelong convict and criminal genius Mason (Sean Connery). (I'm tempted to ask why the government has illegal VX warheads... something the movie never discusses... but I won't bother.) Some people (such as Trey Parker and Matt Stone) give Michael Bay a hard time for making flashy movies with little substance. And usually I'm right there with them. As I type, "Transformers" is coming out and it looks to be a horrible film in every possible way. But I think Bay really did a decent job here combining action with characters the audience can love.Let's talk about the action and characters. The action is undeniable: explosions, gun fights, and other such goodness (maybe not on the level of "Die Hard" but still pretty good). And there is an extremely memorable car chase scene through the streets of San Francisco. Probably the best part of the film. So the action is nailed done firm.The characters are also well done here. Nicholas Cage's character is pretty decent, though he suffers from outbursts that make no sense. Ed Harris plays his general role very straight and is quite possibly "the rock" the title refers to (besides Alcatraz, of course) because he holds the film together. And then Connery, who is always good. Connery's character might have been poorly scripted at times (he, like Cage, suffers from unusual outbursts) but this is also a very deep character (though once his secret is revealed, I found it a little disappointing). Quentin Tarantino allegedly did some writing on this one... I have no idea what parts.The romance is played done, and luckily Claire Forlani has a really small part. My friend Eric loves her, and I love "Mallrats", but I'm sorry.. she's almost as bad as Minnie Driver. Actually, no, she might be even worse.I am not an action fan, and I'll be the first to admit it. So I grade them a little harsh at times. But look, this one fared alright... and I think if you're going to watch an action film, you can do a lot worse than this one. Great actors, an interesting plot (overtaking Alcatraz? brilliant). And the focus on the interaction between Cage and Connery rather than the bigger action of the terror plot paid off -- they have a chemistry stronger than any VX warhead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before Armageddon, before Con Air, before, Enemy of the State, before Coyote Ugly, before Pearl Harbor(which Sucked), before Kangaroo Jake(which Kicked Ass), there was Bad Boys, but after that there was the Bruckheimer/Bay masterpiece "The Rock". Sometimes a beige Volvo driving Cage has to steal your ferrari to chase down a Connery in a Humm-V, but C'est la Vie. Sometimes you've been taken down by the government because they don't want to reveal confidential information, maybe about Kennedey or something really important in American history, and you have really long hair, but you can crack a window with a bent quarter, and your daughter has never met you, and you get a new hair cut and look pretty decent--almost like a James Bond type character. Perhaps this Bond man can navigate through the infernal exterior of a Ed-Harris/that-guy-who-always-plays-the-military-expertise guarded perimeter to penetrate the most highly regarded landmark of American lockdown security(besides the max-security prison that Castor Troy is held in). Wait, was King Arthur any good, no one I know saw it. John Spencer is the best actor to ever get thrown off of the side of a building whilst administering a hair cut. I'm sorry that I got off track, but this is just the beginning of the V-X filled thriller that is "The Rock." If you are not enthralled yet, just remember that there are chicks, explosions, Connery, car-chases, Cage, Airplanes, Jail cells, bitches ocular cavities being manipulated, French kisses, horses jumping through fiery hoops, cowbells, Tin-Cup, and manginas. Love, Bruckheimer-Fan-32.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well what can I say? I was going to mention the good and bad points but the small flaw to that plan is there are no bad points! So I will mention the good points for starters the level of acting is superb. A rather tetchy first moments with Mason (Connery) and Goodspeed (Cage) round of to a brilliant complementary duo up in the same league as the original Batman + Robin, no better! The action is not mindless like in some films but witty and has a point to the destruction of fellow human beings.(in very graphic ways such as one of the opening deaths due to a deadly toxic nerve gas) there are many aspects which lift this film to what I believe to the greatest of all time, such as the accelerated pace, the fast action chase scene, the humour between Cage and Connery, the hilarious hair dressing scene, the tension, the action, the violence, the danger, the thrill and the adrenaline of the legend that is the THE ROCK!The Actors give this film its fantastic edge. Such as the bitter hatred between Mason and his Nemesis (FBI Director James Womack). The Cast of actors include Nicolas Cage as Dr. Stanley Goodspeed a chemical weapons expert who has an obsession with the Beatles. He has never really seen any action, but he gets called into service by the FBI Director to diffuse rockets laden with the deadly VX nerve gas. The part is play brilliantly making the character Goodspeed believable and making him a pleasure to watch. Sean Connery as the X SAS agent John Patrick Mason sent to Alcatraz when it was a prison. He was sent there for discovering America's deepest secrets. Such as the Kennedy assassination and the truth about Roswell. Then being rejected by the very agency that he worked for the British. The FBI now needs him as he is the only man to ever escape the rock. Sean Connery displays probably the greatest acting as John Mason I have ever seen together him and Nicolas Cage make this film awesome. Ed Harris is the Hero turned Villain Brig. Gen. Francis Hummel he has decided to avenge his comrade's deaths and demands a ransom to compensate the families of the fallen men he once served over. He has stolen 15 canisters of the most deadly nerve gas VX Gas. He is ready to launch rockets laden with the gas into San Francisco and kill millions on innocent people. But hero to villain is a change too large for Brig. Gen. Francis Hummel a man of honour. John Spencer is Mason's nemeses, FBI Director James Womack the man who originally sent Mason to Alcatraz. Now needs Mason released to get his men into Alcatraz a task of which he dose not agree. Especially after Mason throws him of a building. David Morse is Maj. Tom Baxter, Hummel's right hand man and would follow his word to the end. The Story Line Probably the Greatest story to be invented the basic story is a brigadier General has decided to compensate the families of his fallen Comrades and get money for his team and his self. His team steal 15 rockets and loads them with the most deadly nerve agent ever, VX gas. He then holds San Francisco hostage the FBI get Stanley Goodspeed a chemical weapons expert along with a crack team of navy seals to disarm the war heads and capture Brigadier General Hummel. The team is lead by an X SAS agent John Mason imprisoned by America after discovering their biggest secrets. He was originally imprisoned in Alcatraz but was the only man ever to escape from the top security prison he is now needed by the FBI to get the seals and Goodspeed into Alcatraz. Over View Michael Bay has aspired to produce the greatest film ever. With elements of almost every Genre. With a excellent host of actors, brilliant effects and action and suspense beyond anything seen before. He has combined these to create the most momentously superb film. I salute him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Action Film That Shares the Spotlight With the Actors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Rock" is an adrenaline rush of a movie that was one of the big hits of 1996. The actual film deals with a crazed Marine (Ed Harris) who has taken over Alcatraz and holds 181 people hostage in order to get $100 million to benefit fallen comrades from U.S. wars. If he does not receive the money, he will launch chemical warheads on San Francisco and likely kill thousands. Enter FBI scientist Nicolas Cage and former inmate Sean Connery who are sent to the island along with Michael Biehn and a special missions corps to save the day. The film is not short on action, in fact you will find yourself trying to catch your breath during several moments. However, the characters are all three-dimensional and interesting. The three primary characters (Cage, Connery, and Harris) in particular are all well-developed. All in all this is a good film to fill time in one's day, but it is not for those with a weak heart. 4 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Renegade Marines. The concept is almost an oxymoron. Yet the premise of this action film is that a rogue marine general Ed Harris, steals some rockets with nerve gas and then takes over Alcatraz island which is now a tourist attraction and threatens to launch strikes into the San Francisco bay area unless his financial demands are met.After a Navy Seal team is massacred in trying to take the island back it's up to an aged ex-convict named Sean Connery and a chemical weapons specialist Nicholas Cage to save San Francisco from the USMC albeit a very renegade bunch of them.The Rock is strictly for action junkies who don't care about plot or improbable situations. In fact the film should have been familiar to the first James Bond of the silver screen. Sean Connery had some more realistic situations in those films than he does here.Of course fans of Sean Connery will pay to see him in anything and I'm certainly one of them. Nicholas Cage tries his very best to give the dialog a little meaning.If I had a favorite in this film however it's the Navy Seal commander Michael Biehn. It's a good, sincere performance in a Thanksgiving Day special of a film.For fans of the players above only.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In an attempt to get the US Government to pay for soldiers lost on secret missions General Hummel and a group of soldiers steal biological weapons and take control of Alcatraz, threatening to launch on San Francisco if their demands are not met. Running out of options the FBI take Mason out of prison as he has a knowledge of the island, being the only man to have escaped from there. Mason and bio-chemical expert Goodspeed join a group of Navy SEALS to enter the island and destroy the weapons before they can be used. However the death of the whole SEAL unit leaves Mason and Goodspeed to use stealth to avoid the terrorists and destroy the weapons.This is nothing more than a big summer blockbuster that relies on plenty of big bangs to get it's audience. It relies on the usual Die Hard set-up of "one man (2 men!) take on heavily armed group in set location". However here the plot is a little iffy - Hummel isn't a terrorist, in fact his stance is almost sympathetic. This makes it all a little funny morally but the film turns it round at one point to go back into traditional good guy/bad guy roles so that the audience don't start to think too much! The action is very good - plenty of bangs for your buck! Even though it's all pretty OTT (like the car chase at the start) the mood of the film is such that it's all a great deal of fun.Connery is really good in the lead and is funny and rather dashing! Cage's character is not as good and is too weedy at the start and some of his dialogue is grating. The support cast is deep and really good - usually big budget action movies have some well known support actors but this has tonnes! Check the names - Ed Harris, David Morse, John Spencer, William Forsythe, Michael Biehn, John C. McGinley, Bokeem Woodbine - the list goes on!Overall, if you hate big, dumb summer movies then you'll hate this. I'm split down the middle but the sheer sense of fun that this brings combined with a great cast makes this a winner in my book!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unbelievably bad film. Nicholas Cage's character is required to constantly defer to Connery as Sean never lets up with the subtle insulting put downs. He even punched Cage in the stomach and poor Nick had to double over as if he had been nailed by Mike Tyson. As usual, Sean pronounces all his "s's" as if they were an "sh", so I'm glad he didn't walk into a restaurant and ask if he could just sit anywhere. The scene where Cage has a car chase with a Ferrari was unbelievably badly directed and edited. It just seemed like a series of closeups of Cage's strained face and unrelated clips of cars in various positions. Cage shoots a huge missile point blank at one of the bad guys. Instead of going through him like a blowtorch through butter or just vaporizing him, it actually carries the guy around a hundred yards at about 30 mph before he slips off and becomes impaled on a fence. We hear him go, "aaahhh" as he falls. Unbelievably dumb. Then, a huge bomb explodes near Cage and he is blown hundreds of feet into the air and lands in the bay, face down, unconscious. Old man Connery naturally shwims to his reshcue and shaves him. Without any form of first aid performed by Connery, we see Cage running along the shoreline with his bald, white-bearded antagonist. Connery manages to insult Cage again as soon as he regains consciousness. Ed Harris was good as the villain. Other than that, trash.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great action movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this film, San Francisco will be threatened by a general with an important arsenal of chemical weapons hidden in the old prison of Alcatraz. Directed by Michael Bay and scripted by David Weisberg, it has the participation of Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage.Alcatraz is one of the most famous and feared prisons in the world. During decades of work, virtually no one could escape from there and tell the story. Now a museum, still retains its charm, and that was wisely used in this film. The wards of the old prison gave excellent scenarios for the film, filling it with a rusty and decadent beauty. The cast is good and the participation of Sean Connery and Ed Harris (the villain) stands out. Nicolas Cage has also played well, despite being erased by the two older actors. Nevertheless, this film is not usually considered one of the best in Connery's career (always pursued by Bond in people's mind). Ed Harris was surprisingly positive and managed to humanize his character. We see that its a man with feelings, acting in accordance with his conscience, despite the ends don't justify his means. The script is interesting, covering a topic rarely seen in action movies: chemical/biological terrorism. It contains several plot twist of great quality, becoming more unpredictable in more dramatic moments. The end is quite good.The film has some problems when using some very common action clichés such as putting Mason as a "lone hero" or that mediocre car chase full of accidents, too sensational to be credible. There are movies where the use of these clichés is good because it manage, in some way, to innovate or to look different than we've seen. But this was not achieved here.</fullReview>

The action is handled in this typical Bay style there are explosions and jokes but the film knows what it's doing and it's definitely on the great action movies of all time list my favorite character was easily John Patrick Mason the man was clever as hell especially with that big chase scene where he tries to run away from the cops and meet with his daughter.

		<shortDescription>Kick-ass and entertaining movie from Michael Bay. Even Hideo Kojima tried to emulate this into his "Metal Gear Solid" games.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now I am not a big fan of the director Michael Bay, but this movie is kick-ass and is his best film. Sure, it still has the Michael Bay trademarks with chases and explosions, but it's integrated quite well into this movie. And actually has a cool plot, and stylistic emotions to go with it. It isn't the most intelligent plot but it does get the job done. Sure some parts might be a bit exaggerated, but for a action movie such as this, it works. It isn't a action movie that should be taken too seriously, it's suppose to be a kick- ass action flick. And like I said just about everything about this movie works. Especially when it comes to the entertainment department. From the action, to the passable dialogues and music it just melds together into a fun action ride. What really stood out about this movie while re-watching it, was how it was so obvious Hideo Kojima took notes and borrowed elements from this film. Especially when it comes to the style, action and characters. And how Hideo Kojima incorporated some of the ideas and tries to emulate it into the "Metal Gear Solid" franchise. I remember when this film came out and how it was one of the biggest action movie of the 90's. As a matter of fact this film and "Face/Off" is my favorite action movies from the 90's. When I saw this movie in the 90's I was just blown away by how cool it was. It is probably the movie that I could remember where I saw Sean Connery in action for the first time. And at that time, I thought he was the most badass old guy I have ever seen on screen. Even Nicolas Cage's freak-outs actually complimented this movie. Overall, this movie is a blast and I highly recommend it to just about anyone. Especially people that are fans of the "Metal Gear Solid" franchise or people that are into action movies in general. Sure it has it's flaws when it comes to the narrative because of few plot-holes. But it's not all that distracting and sometimes it actually compliments this film somehow.10/10</fullReview>

We all know Michael Bay is an awful director, or now he is; but I always wondered how he could make such an awesome movie. Now I'm starting to think the cast of actors make this movie. Maybe all the amazing actors willed this movie to be better than it should have been. Whatever the case, it is a fun movie. The shaky cam close-ups is annoying but that's Michael Bay for you. Whatever, it is a fun watch and I'm sure I'll watch it a million more times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest film ever made (sort of)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, so it may not be the greatest film ever produced, but it sure is up there with the most fun. Sometimes a film is just perfect. Or, to be precise, it's absolutely perfect for what it is. No, 'The Rock' will never be hailed up there with such greats as Citizen Kane or The Godfather, but it is the perfect popcorn-munching action film.Nicholas Cage (back when he still starred in decent films) plays a self-confessed FBI lab-geek who specialises in defusing explosive chemical weapons. And, by one hell of a coincidence, an insane ex general (Ed Harris) only goes and steals a load of explosive chemical weapons and sets up his hollowed-out volcano lair (well, sort of) on the disused prison-site of Alcatraz. Guess what poor ol' Nic's going to be getting up to today? Unfortunately, he's not much of a soldier and doesn't stand a snowball's chance in hell of defeating Ed's band of hired marines. However, that's where the only man ever to have escaped Alcatraz comes in ? retired (and imprisoned!) British Secret agent, Sean Connery (his character probably has a name, but ? like every film he's in ? Sean Connery basically plays Sean Connery). So, as the tag-line says... in a prison where no man has ever broken out, two men must break back in.I hope whoever wrote that tagline got well paid. It really does say it all. You really don't need to know much else about the film. You only need to enjoy action films. And, when I say 'action films,' I mean action films that are actually quite fun, rather than the dark and depressing style we've been treated to in recent times. The Rock never tries to be 'gritty' and 'realistic' ? it just has great action, numerous explosions and a plot so over-the-top it will envelop you completely and let it take you along for one hell of a ride. If the sheer joy of the chemistry between Cage and Connery isn't enough to entice you to watch this film, it's actually worth noting that Ed Harris' villain isn't actually as villainous as you might expect, being one of the only evil bad guys with a conscious whose point of view you can also emphasise with.Also, don't let Michael Bay's name put you off. It was made 'pre-Transformers' where he actually made some decent films.Don't think about the plot. Just love it for what it is ? the perfect action film that really sums up the nineties (oh, that line could also be applied to 'Speed' ? that's pretty damn awesome, too).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic, pure action film, top of it's genre.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Rock, directed by Michael Bay (Pearl Harbor, Armageddon, Transformers) is what simply be described as a classic, pure action film, top of it's genre. Though not appreciated by the critics (66% in rotten tomatoes), it got one Oscar nomination the time that action movies where still considered as b-movies by the Academy and won several minor awards (like best actor and supporting actor in Blockbuster Entertainment Awards). It features great performances by Nicolas Cage (a very versatile actor), Ed Harris and of course Sean Connery. As even the rotten tomatoes critics admit "For visceral thrills, it can't be beat.". Or better put, it can only be compared with the best Denzel Washington films (Training Day, American Gangster, Unstoppable). In a nutshell this movie intended to be a perfect action film and that's exactly what it is, managing to keep your nerves tensed for 136 minutes.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael Bay's best movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Bay is well-known for making bad movies like Pearl Habor or Armageddon or the Transformers movies but I have to say this is one of his rare action movies that are actually good and worth-watching. One of the main reasons is because it has two of my favourite actors, Nicolas Cage and Sean Connery team up together as Stanley Goodspeed and John Mason. Sean Connery (who was 66-years-old when he did this movie), really showed that despite his age, he's really great and badass in The Rock. Nicolas Cage was kind of corny at times but I still think he did well and he and Connery were a very good duo. In fact, it was probably Sean Connery's best duo since he teamed up with Harrison Ford in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.The story is good, but nothing special though and the acting is generally done well as well and the dialogue is entertaining. And the action sequences tremendous and have you at the edge of your seat and it's not too overdone or over-the-top. Ed Harris did great as well but I think he was more of an anti-hero than a villain. Also I wish we could've seen more of Michael Biehn because his character was killed off too soon. But I'd say any fan of Sean Connery or Nicolas Cage or action movies in general will love this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Action Flicks of the Decade.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the 1990s Sylvester Stallone, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Steven Seagal, and Wesley Snipes were some of the hottest action stars that came out with mindless but very cool violent movies. Occasionally, there would be an action movie not starring a 90s action icon. Furthermore, there would be an action movie that had all the right stuff that would make it stand beside Die Hard or Terminator. The Rock may not be at their level, but it is better than most action movies you see.The biggest hit for The Rock is its general premise: after locking down and taking over Alcatraz, a vengeful marine (Ed Harris) and his crew steal a lethal poison and place it in missiles and threaten to destroy San Francisco unless his fellow comrades get royalties they much deserve. Only an FBI chemical weapons expert (Nicolas Cage) and Alcatraz escapist (Sean Connery) know how to save the day. Sure it may sound like just a general hostage story, but knowing Harris' motives really set this apart from other hostage movies. I actually rooted for Harris to make it out alive and/or align with Connery and Cage after all hell breaks loose. He is so sympathetic and steals every scene he is in. He and Sean Connery are the deepest characters in the movie. Although they appear to be bad at first, your mind soon changes. Nicolas Cage is his usual flamboyant self who is not quite as likable as Connery or Harris. John Spencer, David Morse, and William Forsythe are the forerunners and they each help raise the quality of chemistry and plot development. Of course, an action movie has to be fast-paced and well choreographed in order to pass. And by-golly this does! Many awesome gunfights and explosions that cause the stakes to rise and plot to advance. Tremendous!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings from Lithuania."The Rock" (1996) is one of the very best movies from Michael Bay. This is action movie with great actors doing their great jobs. Cast is superb and everyone here plays it straight. Action scenes are amazing, still this day. Chemistry between Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage is the driving force and Ed Harris creates one of the most memorable and sympathetic villains in movie history - without them this movie wouldn't be this great. Story is simple yet script is very entertaining. It is also very funny at the times, with best lines coming from Sean Connery - his "seen it all" character creates a great contrast to Nicolas Cage's character.Overall, "The Rock" is a bad-ass action film with superb performances and great action scenes. Movie works because reliable actors create these characters we do care about. Soundtrack is also great. All in all this is a must see action film from the 90's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Rock (1996): Dir: Michael Bay / Cast: Nicolas Cage, Sean Connery, Ed Harris, Claire Forlani, Michael Biehn: Electrifying action film with a title that symbolizes Sean Connery whom no one is sure of but must rely on. Ed Harris leads troops into an isolated prison and holds everyone hostage. He demands money for reparations to the families of the American servicemen killed in covert operations. Nicolas Cage plays a chemical expert sent to disarm the missiles and Connery is the only convict to escape the prison. Deadly gas missiles are aimed at San Francisco where Connery's daughter lives. Fine concept nearly derailed by a mindless chase scene and several shootouts. Director Michael Bay handles the action but the story is merely a parking lot for those scenes to locate and explode. Cage fares well as a chemist under pressure, while Connery is excellent as an unstoppable force. We know where this is all headed because films of this sort need to end nicely after a massive mess. Ed Harris is a refreshing surprise after standard footage becomes altogether shifted in motives. Claire Forlani appears as Connery's daughter who will eventually have to come to mends especially since he wrecks havoc in a senseless car chase to locate her. Michael Biehn plays a fellow soldier who plans to go through with the whole threat. Exaggerated action with rock solid stunts. Score: 6 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This explosive action movie rocks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Rock is one of the few action movies with a plot that is excellent from start to finish. Definitely one of many excellent action movies from the 1990's and deservedly one of the top movies for 1996. Michael Bay has never been better and this movie was also notable that this was the last movie that producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer worked on together before Don Simpson's untimely death. Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage made a great, if unlikely, on screen partnership and Ed Harris was top notch as the lead villain. The Rock also started a new era for Academy Award Winner Nicolas Cage as an action hero who would go on to appear in such hits as Con Air (1997), Face/Off (1997) and Gone in 60 Seconds (2000).The Rock begins with United States Marine General Francis X Hummel (Ed Harris) who orchestrates the theft of several deadly VX rockets from a military base. The following day General Hummel along with several renegade US Marines including his second in command Major Tom Baxter (David Morse) plus Captain Hendrix (John C. McGinley) Captain Frye (Gregory Sporleder), Captain Darrow (Tony Todd), and Gunnery Sergeant Crisp (Bokeem Woodbine) take over Alcatraz prison and take 81 hostages. Their intention: to launch the rockets with VX gas onto San Francisco and kill the hostages unless the US government pays $100 million from a military slush fund, from which General Hummel will distribute to his men and the families of Recon Marines who were killed in action on clandestine missions under his command and whose deaths were not compensated by the US Government.The FBI call upon chemical weapons specialist Stanley Goodspeed (Nicolas Cage who has never been better) who is brilliantly intelligent yet is barely experienced in the field and counter terrorism operations. His fiancée Carla (Vanessa Marcil) is also pregnant. FBI Director James Womack (John Spencer) and Special Agent in Charge Ernest Paxton (William Forsythe in a rare role as the good guy) spearhead the operation to take down General Hummel and the renegade marines along with ensuring the survival of the hostages. Director Womack is forced to release a federal prisoner who has been imprisoned for three decades. Former British Intelligence agent John Patrick Mason (Sean Connery) who once successfully broke out of Alcatraz prison is called upon to assist the FBI with his inside knowledge of Alcatraz prison in exchange for a pardon. As part of the covert operation, a team of Navy SEALS led by Commander Anderson (Michael Biehn) as well as Stanley Goodspeed's knowledge of chemical warfare and John Mason's knowledge of Alcatraz prison, the team successfully gain access inside Alcatraz prison but its not before long the operation goes horribly wrong and its up to the unlikely heroes Stanley Goodspeed and John Mason to prevent the launch of the rockets on San Francisco as well as take down the renegade marines and save the 81 hostages.In a stroke of brilliant casting, Nicolas Cage as the nerdy lab rat Stanley Goodspeed is excellent. Here Stanley Goodspeed is thrust into the middle of the action and is relied upon to save the lives of the hostages and many innocent civilians in San Francisco, as well as disarm the VX rockets. Sean Connery might be into his 60's, but he definitely still cuts it as an action hero. The former James Bond plays John Mason, an honourable man who has been wrongly imprisoned but must work and use his inside knowledge of Alcatraz to help Stanley Goodspeed take down the renegade marines and save the hostages. Ed Harris as the lead villain General Francis X Hummel starts off with good intentions for his former soldiers who were killed in action, however he goes about it the wrong way by stealing the VX rockets in order to use against San Francisco as well as taking hostages in Alcatraz in order for a $100 million ransom to be paid to be distributed to the families of his marines killed in action as well as himself and his fellow renegade marines. Although General Hummel is not seen as a cruel person unlike his fellow renegade marines, his intentions are still seen as ruthless and immoral.This was Michael Bay's second movie after Bad Boys (1995) and he later has a mixed career with Armageddon (1998), Pearl Harbor (2001), and the Transformers franchise (2007, 2009, 2011 and 2014). The Rock is definitely one of Michael Bay's best movies to date. Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer who were responsible for blockbuster movies such as Beverly Hills Cop (1984), Top Gun (1986), and Bad Boys (1995) have struck gold here with this explosive hit.The Rock is definitely a brutally violent movie that has encountered many censorship issues particularly in the UK and Australia.The Rock is definitely one of the few action movies with a great plot, great action, as well as well rounded characters, compared to the various action movies that ignore the plot in favour of one dimensional characters and large action sequences. The Rock was definitely one of the surprise packages of 1996 and years later, is still a popular action movie that has aged very well. If you love action movies and if you haven't seen The Rock, you are missing out on an excellent action movie.9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>James Bond - The Sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Rock is arguably one of Nicholas Cage's best films and Sean Connery at his absolute best, almost reprising his Bond role. This film is a good action packed watch. Typical of Director Michael Bay, and you can see elements of many of his other films in the camera action ie Bad Boys. The music is typical of Hans/Zimmer (see Speed and Pirates of the Caribbean for similar themes) and packs an exciting punch.The pace of the film is fast, not mentally taxing but it has stood the test of time and stands up to repeat viewings. For a film that is almost twenty years old (and I've seen it countless times) it just doesn't age and is still completely relevant. The premise is believable and superiorly acted by Ed Harris as General Hummel protesting the deniability of black ops military by the US government when they are killed in action... An issue that could quite possibly come true. It's a protest that the viewer understands and can see that the General is a good man, wanting to do a desperate thing for a sympathetic cause. You immediately take to the General, but see that his self imposed mission is more than what it appears to be, and his men - some of them - are barking mad. The FBI calls on their chemical weapons expert Stanley Goodspeed (Cage) who's a field rookie to go up against some of the best military men in the US. Michael Biehn convincingly plays Commander Anderson - leader of the Seal team on the "good" side but you can see his empathy with the General and his respect of him. Lots of military pomp and hierarchy - a great film for military action fans - and the entire story and execution of it is almost faultless. Acting was believable for the most part - many superb performances - with a few "comic relief" moments. The action is a little OTT sometimes and a car-chase that is pure Hollywood (complete with lorry carrying water bottles) but a joy to watch. Cage brings some of the one liners and comedy with his over-acting funnies, which lightens the mood sometimes when it would otherwise be quite a dark film.An entirely enjoyable watch, realistically rated 15. Some bad language but it's not unreasonable, and plenty of back-story/human interest surrounding the action and gung-ho machismo. John C McGinley, John Spencer and Vanessa Marcil as good other characters in the story, with a brief appearance from Claire Forlani. Lots of familiar faces, lots of strong characters even in smaller roles and totally engrossing cinema. Excellent action film well worth the watch. Not disappointing at all.</fullReview>

Hummel (Ed Harris), who threaten a nerve gas attack from Alcatraz against San Francisco.This is a fast-paced movie from start to finish, combining good acting (for the most part), drama, witty comedy, adventure and incredible special effects that make this an exhilarating and unique film. Though full of action, which can get very graphic and gory at times, the plot also relies on a large amount of suspense and character development, which gives the picture a perfect balance of adventure and substance. Overall, it is one of the better action movies from the 1990s and a good one to spend a slow night with.Grade B</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ultimate Movie Review! - http://tss5078.blogspot.com - @tss5078</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, there was a time when Michael Bay made movies that actually had a plot to go with the explosions, and some, like The Rock, were terrific. I had never seen The Rock from beginning to end, having just caught glimpses of it on TV, but watching it in it's entirety proved what I'd long suspected, it was a great film. A Marine General, upset that his lost soldiers never received the compensation they deserved for their secret missions, takes control of Alcatraz island, and aims chemical weapons at San Francisco. The FBI is at a lost as to what to do and decide to go with an unconventional idea to try and stop the general. A team of Navy seals prepare to take the island back, lead by the only man to ever escape from Alcatraz, now in his sixties, and a chemical weapons specialist who has never been in combat. Sean Connery stars and even though he was nearing the end of his illustrious career, he gives a truly great performance, that reminds us of just how great his movies were. Connery was the premiere action star, in a time before special effects had been computerized. He really gives an old school attitude and feeling to the film, which helps The Rock stand out from it's competition. Connery is paired with Nicholas Cage who is always terrific, especially when he's playing some type of law enforcer. Cage adds humor, unintentionally, with his inexperience, and winds up doing some pretty amazing things. While I don't like to mention specific scenes in a film, I'd be remiss not to mention the incredible chase scene Cage has through the streets of San Francisco, in the beginning of the film. It was reminiscent of the great car chases of the Lethal Weapon series, and really stood out to me. The Rock is a terrific story, featuring a cast in which old school and the younger generation collide, and to top it all off, it has that Michael Bay spin and over reliance on special effects. It's a terrific action film which sadly is rarely seen anymore in the world of computer generated effects and muscle headed action stars.</fullReview>

He intends to use the money to pay the families of the soldiers under his command who the government has disavowed over the years. In order to disarm the rockets, the FBI is sending their chemical weapons expert Stanley Goodspeed (Nicolas Cage). And they're digging up a mysterious British agent prisoner John Mason (Sean Connery) who once escaped from Alcatraz. When the team sent in to take on Hummel is decimated, Goodspeed and Mason must disarm the rockets on their own.This is Michael Bay audacity to bring his heart pumping action style to bear. The action is big time bombastic joy. And for the best effect, he allows the actors to have fun in between the action. Nicolas Cage brings a lot of his manic energy and a bit of his crazy humor. And Sean Connery brings the Bond gravitas to the action. Plus the Cage Connery duo is a lot of fun, and they have great chemistry together. This is the best kind of popcorn movie-making.</fullReview>

The mysterious spy wearing amazing smiles, the young chemist with a brave heart and the general who loved his country very much but had to fight against it for his soldiers. In this moving story, there was no bad guys but only patriots. Besides, the music of the Rock was the best among all the movies I've ever seen! The background music was really exciting and intense. Without Hans Zimmer's great composition, the Rock will lose 5/10 of its attraction. The Rock is the best action movie in its age and it is still one of the best in this day in spite of the rapid development of film industry. I really think this movie is underrated by we viewers. In my mind, it is an eternal classics and always worth me watching for one more time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The bombastic director Michael Bay impressed the world with Bad Boys(1995) then to continue with the much better The Rock, with good action, high tempo, Sean Connery and an amazing theme by Hans Zimmer. A group of US marine mercenaries takes over the prison island of Alcatraz, aka. The Rock near San Fransisco. They are led by General Hummel(very good performed by Ed Harris), who threatens to launch chemical missiles on San Franssico if the government do not pay the families of his dead troops, whose deaths were not compensated. The government calls Stanley Goodspeed(Nicolas Cage, when he still was good in the late 90s) an expert at chemical weapons. Because the mercenaries have total control of the island they need a covered way in. They release the only man who managed to escape the prison called John Mason(entertaining played by Sean Connery). There is good chemistry between Nicolas and Sean that follows. This movie is unlike other action movies very entertaining, the atmosphere around the plot works very good with the action that follows and also the story. The movie becomes more thrilling when Goodspedd, mason and some Navy Seals(including Michael Biehn) gets inside the prison. The acting does not contain a lot of deep emotions and moral questions but like always Michael Bay thinks the actors are in the way and goes on with the action tempo. Still a very entertaining blockbuster movie worthy to be re-watched again!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Action Movie if you can suspend your disbelief</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was produced and directed by the same guys that made Bad Boys. I realised the similarities with the absolutely beautiful cinematography that made Bad Boys such a great movie. The cinematography is superb and as such this movie, in this way, becomes a work of art. In fact, this is Don Simpson's last movie as I believe he died sometime during its production. The dedication at the end is to Don Simpson, and it is always sad to see such a talented person, or in fact any person, die, but that is the nature of this corrupt world.A bunch of highly trained marine terrorists take over Alcatraz, secure hostages, set up missiles carrying very nasty diseases, and demand that they receive recognition and that the families of their dead receive proper compensation. The FBI are called in along with Godspeed (Nicholas Cage) to try and diffuse the situation. They then go to Mason (Sean Connery), the only guy to have ever escaped from Alcatraz, to get back in. As Godspeed is the only person who can neutralise the gas, he is also sent in, much to his protestations.The one thing I thought about this movie when watching it was that it was somewhat unbelievable that such a thing would happen, and if it did, there would be very little the authorities could do without instigating a plan of acceptable losses. I am not saying that the world is a rosy place - far from it - but the nasty things that happen usually are mass shootings, and the occasional fanatical cult, such as the Branch Davidians (at least in the United States).The actions were simply to be recognised. The troops in this siege were special US operatives that simply do not exist. When one of them dies, the truth is covered up and the reply is that they were killed in a training exercise. No compensation or anything is paid to the grieving widow. When people sign up though they generally are told of what they are going up against and agree to such clauses. As such these people should have known what they were going into.In another way it must be frustrating for the relatives of the deceased as they know nothing about what their beloved are involved in as it is top secret. Such things may not work well in a family, but then there are lots of confidential matters flying around everywhere so one cannot really complain.All in all, this is a great action movie if one is willing to suspend their disbelief, which we all must do in the long run. There are unbelievable aspects to this movie, but one must understand that it is one of those movies that give the viewers that false hope that our problems can be solved with the brave actions of a single man - and in essence that is truth as Jesus was a single man as he did indeed solve all of our important problems.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Rock is an unashamedly absurd and over-the-top action thriller, and I loved it. I loved the fact that it made no pretences at maintaining a believable plot line and focused entirely on edge-of-the-seat action.Nicholas Cage is superb as the nerdy chemist turned action hero, while Sean Connery puts it a deft turn as the cool British ex- spy.The movie hits you with sequence after sequence of fast-paced action and edgy encounters that keep things ticking along at a nice pace.My only criticism is that the final sequence, where Cage and Connery have to diffuse a series of rockets, could have been ratcheted up a couple more gears. I'd have liked to have seen more evidence of why Connery's character had such a feared reputation, while more could have been done to instill a sense of mortal danger from the chemical weapons.But this is quibbling. The Rock is a excellent movie that I'd thoroughly recommend. Pure, mindless entertainment at its best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Rock is an absolutely brilliant film which is jam packed with excitement, humour, tension and it also contains characters with plenty of depth.The film begins with General Francis X Hummel (Ed Harris) at his wife's grave apologising to her saying that he 'is sorry and that he has to do this'. Hummel is the leader of the US Marines and we see in the beginning that he gains access to Alcatraz to steal biological weapons under the pretence that they are carrying out a security check. Once they have the weapons, this then sets up the second act where Hummel and his men seize control of Alcatraz by appearing to be on a tour of Alcatraz with a group of civilians. Once inside the prison, Hummel and his men take their opportunity and hold the civilians and the tour guide hostage. Hummel makes his demands to the FBI and the government and demands a substantial amount of money within 40 hours otherwise he will unleash the biological weapons onto San Francisco Bay.What makes the Rock stand out as a good thriller is that this isn't just a case of a lunatic just holding people hostage for no apparent reason? We get to learn that Hummel and his men all feel cheated by the government - members of their platoon lost their lives with seemingly no acknowledgement from the government. They are also angry as there was no compensation from the government for the victims of those men who lost their lives. This sets Hummel and his men up sort of as 'vigilantes'. So whilst what they are doing is wrong, in a way they feel that they are on a 'moral crusade' - they don't see why they should value other people's lives when the government clearly didn't care about the lives of any of their men that were killed. This not only gives the story depth, but it also gives the characters depth too.Due to the intelligence that the Marines have, the government and the FBI know that they need to send the 'best' that they have in order to infiltrate the Marines and free the hostages. They feel they need a chemical weapons expert Stanley Goodspeed (Cage) in order to disarm the bombs, but in order for the weapons expert to be able to disarm the bombs they'll need someone who knows the prison inside and out and thus they also send in the only man to ever escape Alcatraz John Mason (Connery) who has been incarcerated for over 30 years. Mason is reluctant to help at first and only agrees to help in order to get a pardon - a lot of fun in the Rock comes from Mason's numerous escape attempts (which are usually quite creative). It is also amusing to see the 2 men constantly trying to 'out do' each other.Another thing that I enjoyed was the 'tongue in cheek' approach that Michael Bay has taken when making this film. Not only have we got a film with a strong plot and good character development, but it is clear that both Bay and the cast had fun when making this film. There were so many funny moments and great one liners that I just can't remember all of them. Then we come to the acting. Sean Connery is one of my favourite actors and he always seems to bring that little something extra in any film he appears in. I predicted before I started watching the film that he would have some of the funniest lines and I was right. Nicolas Cage is a bit of a hit and miss actor in my book, but I thought he was great in this as well. I felt that him and Connery played off each other really well. This is an outstanding film with lots of tension, plenty of funny scenes, good plot and is packed full of great characters and is definitely not to be missed!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Rock opens with a military funeral, intercut with explosions, and with Hans Zimmer's dramatic score in the background. Yep, it's pure Michael Bay: just about all of the man's films feature huge, overblown action scenes, big fiery explosions, energetic car chases, silly humor, and a hyperactive style. It's made for a rather shallow experience for some of his films, but in his second full-length feature film, all the excesses align perfectly, crafting one of the purest and most thrilling action movies of all time. You can certainly expect lots of action: the shootouts are loud and intense, there is one awesome car chase, and there are quite a few major explosions. Characters often exchange witty lines throughout. And when the bullets aren't flying, the film still maintains furious momentum with its suspense and political intrigue. It's a perfectly loud and explosive picture, but without being too overblown (especially not as much as Bay's Transformers trilogy).Thankfully, The Rock is not all about endless gunfire and pyrotechnics. The film utilizes pretty common elements of action movies: terrorists take some hostages, good guys have to rescue them and stop the chemical missiles from causing widespread death. The Rock offers some clever variations though, especially by having the terrorists take over Alcatraz, turning the titular prison (and in some parts, San Francisco) into a massive action setpiece. Above all, the characters propel the film into above-average fare: the protagonists are an unlikely pair, sharing entertaining chemistry, and each one has likable traits and personal stakes attached to them. The villains are especially noteworthy, because they're not just mindless nameless bad guys: they have a patriotic motivation, and they show surprising humanity at times. The plot overall is pretty well-built and evenly-paced.This film has solid photography, which includes a lot of cool-looking camera angles and movements. It gets really shaky during the big car chase, but it's far from unbearable. Editing can be fast at times, but once again, it's not too unbearable. Acting is solid: Nicholas Cage dishes out a lot of humor, but he's appropriately serious when he needs to be; Sean Connery is at his most badass here, and Ed Harris really nails his role. Writing is pretty good. This production uses some very cool and real-looking sets, props, costumes, and special effects. Hans Zimmer's music score is the essence of action-movie music.In fact, the movie overall embodies the essence of an action movie. Recommended! 4.5/5 (Entertainment: Perfect | Story: Good | Film: Very Good)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another sort of mission film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Honestly, there is no surprise, no suspense, no heartbeat moment for me at all. Just like the other million of gun movies showing on every year, two agents here become our heroes.When I saw Sean Connely, there were some feeling that am I seeing 007 series. After knowing that he plays a British agent in the movie, I am definitely sure that the director shows us the prisoned James Bond. However, if you want to see the acute fight scene of him in this pic, it will be a little disappointed, after all he is an old man, how can we expect him to do well in the things belonging to youngsters. I think he has already done his best in this performance, gets to the level where an old actor should be.Here I do not want to talk about the plot, as it is a stereotype, gets nothing to tell. There are some words for our main male actor Nicol, his performance is not as good as our old man. Sometimes you can see the scary he expressed in this film seems like not real enough. Of course, some deficiency of the film can not be his responsibility, such as a professional biological chemistry expert can unexpectedly put the most toxic weapon in the sewer. Maybe I can understand if I were in his situation, but I am still feel bad about some details. To my surprise, a platoon of marine can be easily killed by an old man spending half of life in prison and just coming out.Anyway, if I get time and want to see some movies without brainstorms, this one would on my list.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great action/thriller movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As far as I am concerned this is a great action/thriller movie. The fact that one of my all-time favorite actors, Sean Connery, plays in it is of course a good start. Despite Nicholas Cage having done quite a few crappy movies I still like him as well. At least when he plays in decent movies.I first watched this movie sometime around when it came out. I did not watch it in a theater though so it must have been on VHS or TV. I thought it was a great movie already then. When I re-watched it yesterday onW9 HD I did not find any reason to change my opinion. I was surprised at how much action, especially the blowing-up-cars kind of action, there are in this movie though. I did not remember those parts but more of the stealth and breaking into Alcatraz parts. But then, considering that it had Michael Bay as director I guess this one have to be considered quite moderate in the blowing-things-up department after all.The story is actually not too unbelievable and the bad guys are not so ridiculously freaked out as they are in many movies of this type. Sean Connery is great as always but the acting in general is of high standard throughout the movie. The dialogue between him and Nicholas Cage as well as other people in the movie is definitely entertaining. The action, as I have already partly mentioned, is great and not too overdone either.It is an action/thriller movie though (maybe with some more emphasis on action than thriller) so do not expect to be intellectually stimulated. The movie is meant to entertain and that it does with flying colors. Despite it being 136 minutes long it certainly did not feel too long. Actually I do not know why this movie is not in my DVD/BD collection. I think I will get it even though I have just seen it on TV.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Action at Alcatraz</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some time after the untimely death of his wife, vengeful Vietnam veteran Ed Harris (as Francis X. Hummel) and his gang of disgruntled Marines bust unto the legendary prison Alcatraz. They want reparations for unrecognized service. "The Rock" (also known as Alcatraz) has been closed since 1963 and is presently a tourist attraction. Taking 81 visitors hostage, Mr. Harris plans to hit San Francisco with weapons of mass destruction unless his demands are met. The US government doesn't want to pay Harris and the Marines. Instead, they assign two men to break in to Alcatraz and disarm Harris. Yes, it's a daunting task...First called is Beatlemaniac and chemical weapons expert Nicholas Cage (as Stanley "Stan" Goodspeed), notified while simulating intercourse with top girl Vanessa Marcil (as Carla Pestalozzi). Second called is thick scraggly-haired Sean Connery (as John Patrick Mason), the only man to have escaped from Alcatraz. Released after 30 years in prison, Mr. Connery cleans up well. Producers are careful to show many of Connery's innocent victims survive otherwise certain death. Connery knows details about Roswell aliens and the JFK assassination. Michael Bay's direction is action-packed. It all ends in an orgy of violence...Of the sprightly supporting cast, William Forsythe (as Ernest Paxton) deserves special mention; he is credited twice during the opening credits. This error (or, perhaps not because Mr. Forsythe is very good in his role) can be seen in the print being shown to "Charter" customers in the Los Angeles area. The first credit seems to be on screen more briefly. After a relative long pause, William Forsythe is credited again. Maybe he'll receive a double residual check during this showing...****** The Rock (6/7/96) Michael Bay ~ Nicholas Cage, Sean Connery, Ed Harris, William Forsythe</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Bay is actually one the most underrated director, many peoples don't like him, maybe because of the second degree scenes in a serious story. "The Rock" contains some funny scenes and the movie becomes a bit less good than expected. The movie itself is good but the first hour is a bit ridiculous for example with the complaining of the citizens about Sean Connery when he is chased by Nicolas Cage in the streets of San Francisco. The second hour is better and more serious scenes are present, the second degree is till here from time to time though. Also, some peoples criticize the fact as this movie is available in DVD for The Criterion Collection, which is a DVD collection famous for includes classic movies and foreign ones. It's pretty weird to see this film there, but it probably means as they liked too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There was a car chase in this movie for no reason. I don't like it when directors abuse their budgets. Besides being half an hour longer than it needed to be, it also had the typical amount of exploshuns for a Bay film. At one point Sean Connery throws a knife and there's a P.O.V. shot based on the knife. If that's not terrible, I don't know wh--Oh, and there was this one time a bad guy got skewered by falling on a barbed wire fence pole. Wait, don't forget that there's a bad guy who is wearing a hairnet. Yep. (Word to the wise, if you throw a grenade at somebody, make sure they're not able to throw it back at you.)I also can't forget to mention that at one point there's the line, "he knows the truth about the alien landing at Roswell, the truth about the JFK assassination." No, these things are not permitted in movies. Take your conspiracy ish somewhere else.Despite all that, I loved the score, and I can tell that Hans Zimmer borrowed a lot from this for The Pirates of the Caribbean. It's not a bad movie, but there's just so many parts that suck. Probably best if you don't pay close attention and instead focus on Sean Connery's accent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Bay is not my cup of tea. Not to disparage the man, he just doesn't usually make my kind of movie. But "The Rock" is fortified with such an ironclad cast and an abnormally (for Bay movies) decent script that the usual Bay idiosyncrasies (the histrionic 360 degree slow pan, the larger-than-life low angles, etc) didn't kill my overall enjoyment of the piece.Connery, Cage and especially Harris were exceptionally cast, along with a list of supporting players that's nothing to sneeze at. And the script keeps us moving through one huge set piece after another (mercifully spending minimal time on a lousy romance).Aside from a car chase that was better left deleted (a dizzying frenzy of whip pans with no sense of geography is no way to cut a chase scene), it's certainly Bay's most substantive contribution to the action genre.Also, I have to admit: Connery's "Welcome to The Rock" moment was pretty badass.7/10</fullReview>

This movie focuses on an FBI chemical weapons specialist and prisoner who join forces to stop a renegade general from from bombing San Francisco with missiles filled with VX poison gas. And he also is holding people hostage on the Alcatraz prison. Nicolas Cage puts on a fine performance as the young FBI agent assigned to prevent the catastrophe from happening. Sean Connery was absolutely brilliant as the prisoner released to help infiltrate the Alcatraz and help stop the bombs from destroying the city. And hands off to Ed Harris for his role as the rogue general. If you like movies filled with lots of action and explosions, this is the film for you. It is a must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is quite a decent film. It is unusual in its inclusion of an American actor playing a baddie (although one with honour). The one thing that spoils it is the incessant and rather annoying soundtrack throughout. At times you can barely hear the dialogue due to the background music. Could it be as a diversion from the dialogue itself? If only the film could be re-mastered without the annoying music, it would be so much better. Nicholas Cage does a good job although Sean Connery's role is rather 2-dimensional. It has the usual mix of predictable elements, with the saving of the world / San Francisco coming down to the last few seconds.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This one is Rock-solid!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the only Michael Bay film I've ever LIKED, in fact. Despite it's over-the-top action, THE ROCK is one solid action flick (yes, this IS one of those movies where the good guys can somehow magically outrun explosions, never break bones when they fall and never seem to catch a stray bullet from automatic rifles). The action is a lot of fun, although its truly outrageous examples of 'movie-physics' often threaten to re-qualify it as fantasy movie.Sean Connery is wonderfully gruff (and paternal) as former Alcatraz 'resident'/MI-6 agent John Mason; who is pulled out of prison to help nerdy, 'chemical weapons freak' FBI agent/surrogate son-figure Stanley Goodspeed (Nicholas Cage) and a squad of Star Trek-styled 'red-shirt' Navy SEALs to retake Alcatraz from former Marine general Hummel (Ed Harris), who's gone rogue with a platoon of mercenaries who are holding the island, it's tourists, and the city of San Francisco hostage by threatening to hit it with really NASTY chemical weapon warhead rockets (the grisly effects of which are illustrated very graphically in several key scenes). Goodspeed (ridiculous name, by the way) comes to understand that Mason was wrongfully imprisoned by the CIA because he dug up too much dirt on the United States covert ops during his MI-6 service; only to have Her Majesty's Secret Service disavow any knowledge of his actions. Despite the thumping, jingoistic, oftentimes ridiculous, over-the-top action sequences (which are still very well done, by the way), there is a great father-son, 'Quint/Hooper'-styled relationship between Connery and Cage that really keeps the film working where it could've easily failed; they have a terrific, almost palpable chemistry together. And Harris' Hummel is at times, surprisingly sympathetic for a militaristic terrorist; less villain, more misunderstood patriot (in his own way). His goon squad lackeys, however, are as subtle as a sledgehammer; yet act as a nice counterbalance to his 'good man gone astray' performance. Harris is also aided by his sympathetic comrade-in-arms 'Maj. Baxter,' played by the reliable David Morse.The action scenes are exciting and extremely well-choreographed; but honestly? This is not the kind of movie where one nitpicks over the physics. Just relax, turn up the surround sound, grab the popcorn, and enjoy the wonderful chemistry of this terrific cast! Kudos to Cage, Connery and the terrific, subtle performances of Harris and Morse (subtle for a Michael Bay movie, anyway). The movie is an absolute blast (yet with a surprising amount of heart as well). Call it a guilty pleasure, but this is the ONLY Michael Bay film I can really sink my teeth into and ENJOY! Hopefully, you will too!</fullReview>

It stars Sean Connery, Nicolas Cage, Ed Harris, David Morse, William Forsythe &amp; Michael Biehn.When a highly decorated army general (Harris) decides that he's had enough of his men dying, and not getting the credit they deserve; he commandeers Alcatraz prison with a crack unit of Mercs. The plan is to hold the government to ransom or unleash from the prison biological rockets to bring Armageddon down on America. Enter chemical weapons expert Dr. Stanley Goodspeed (Cage), who is forced to team up with the only man ever to escape Alcatraz-the mysteriously incarcerated in secret John Patrick Mason (Connery)-to break into the Rock and thwart the plans of the Mercs. So Cage as a chemistry expert who possible holds the fate of the world in his shaky hands? Connery, aged 66, as a tough prison escapee sporting a "Grunge" haircut? And Ed Harris, surely a bastion of patriotic Americana, turning bad and wanting to unleash hell on the Stars &amp; Stripes? To expect nothing else but a berserker Michael Bayhem picture based on these facts is surely folly? He certainly has a varied CV does Bay, as do the leading actors on show here. But when on form, with writers prepared to put blood into the characters, Bay can deliver high octane entertainment if it features a cast clearly in tune with the material. Such is the case here. It's no award winner. Naturally. But it does have some political smarts in the script. And if you want explosions, shoot outs and quips aplenty? Then this really will serve you well for a couple of hours. 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What do you get when you combine a Michael Bay film, produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and Don Simpson, and partially written by Quentin Tarantino? A high testosterone, explosive, funny action film, that puts other action films to shame.The thing I really love about "The Rock", is the fact that it's got a really clever and original plot, greatly written dialogue and touching characters, yet we are still entertained by the countless thousands of bullets and enormous explosions that put Hiroshima to shame, that are unleashed within this film. Events unfold from the word "go" here. We instantly know something is being planned, and are hooked to the screen within minutes. Not a dull moment goes by where we aren't on the edge of our seats, admiring spectacular scenes of suspense, and most importantly, the story is plausible and cleverly chronological, with two great subplots and amazing twists.We are presented with characters who we can all sympathise with them, whether they're baddies or goodies! (Sorry to use Childish terminology) Every character has a reason for being there, and we learn their histories through the film. The writers have most importantly kept the characters Human! It's too easy when writing Action to throw characters into the film that have no heart or emotion what so ever. However in this film, we even see guilt and remorse from the baddies. This really gets us thinking ethically about who's side we are on, as we know the baddies have a very good decision for their "terrorism" but what they are planning could, in some people's eyes, be worse. It's very cleverly done.Some great emotions and facial/vocal expressions were bought faithfully across by a brilliant cast, including Nicholas Cage and Sean Connery. Perhaps there is a small bit of over acting from Cage, but there is nothing wrong with that. It's better than underacting. Thanks to amazing directing my Michael Bay, each cast member knew his character very well.Accompanied by an epic track by Oscar-winning Hans Zimmer, the spectacular array of brilliant sound effects, well crafted dialogue, and brilliant directing is weaved tremendously together with clever and sharp editing. I had enormous fun watching this, and I'm sure you will too! This is action at its best!</fullReview>

When making films that don't require the viewer to think, but just sit through Top-Rate Action, Explosions, Chase Scenes, then "The Rock" fires on all cylinders. Mix in some terrific performances John Patrick Mason(Sean Connery) and Stanley Goodspeed(Nicholas Cage) and you have 136 entertaining minutes. Connery and Cage deliver Tour-De-Force performances that you have to see to believe. Connery, after many disappointing films comes shining through with dead pan deliveries and throw away lines that will have you rolling in the aisles. His focus is dead on.As a convicted ex-British Army Military Personnel, Mason is released from prison conditionally to help defeat Gen. Hummel(Ed Harris)and some rogue Marines, who have stolen Hi-Grade Biological military chemical weapons and threatens to use it on the City of San Francisco if his extortion demands are not met.Cage and Connery are frick and frack. Cage the out of the water Bio-Tech FBI Agent, and Connery the wily veteran who wants only to escape, and reunite with his daughter.To defeat the General, they must go to Alcatraz Island(The Rock), kill the General and his men, disarm the weapons, and release the hostages. Almost non-stop action once on the "Rock." Top-Notch !This film is highly addictive and infectious.

		<shortDescription>Between a Rock and a Soft Cage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was teeter-totting back and forth between 3? and 4 stars through this recent viewing of 1996's The Rock, a movie: A&gt; I haven't seen in a long time, B&gt; Always loved and in fact, C&gt; I originally gave it 4?/5 stars.Well, time's a changin'. Or maybe I have. Or maybe Bruckheimer/Cage's enormously inferior follow-up Con Air kinda drove the following point to light.It would be a huge surprise (disappointment) if this film got an endorsement from the large gay community in the very area its set in. And they thought Basic Instinct was bad.I only point out the few, but extreme, scenes of homophobia because, well, it's just not right. (They elaborate in ridiculing homosexuals in Con Air, but that's another story/review.) It's not right, because it teaches the core audience, teen boys to mid 30s, that making fun of gays (or blacks, or any creed) is not only an acceptable practice, but funny! It's not and I digress? The other problem I had was Cage. Over! Under! Acting seems to be his moto. Too bad "Good" isn't part of his forte. Man, he was distracting! Thankfully, not only did Connery act circles around him, but went beyond Cage's performance to balance out the film.Get past the two negatives, and Action and Movie fans rejoice! There is, in fact, a way to combine plot with leave-your-brain-at-the-door action. But, I hate to say, they might have overshot it a bit. There was just too much.Suffice to say, it's a Hannibal Lecter (Actually, Mason, played by Connery) story in which Goodspeed (unoriginal and inconvincibly played by Cage) takes on the aid of "The Prisoner with No Name" to break into "The Rock" when he was the only one to break out due to some treasonous/mercenaries who are threatening San Francisco with toxic green balls. And not from The Hulk.Oh, there's a lot more: a distraught daughter, a confused and stupid and pregnant girlfriend, a dead wife, dimwitted military bozos who should be dead or discharged, soldiers on this side, that side, all with ulterior motives and much, much more. Sure, it's my quest to get intelligent action (SEE: The Bourne Trilogy, or The Dark Knight) but enough's enough.That said, it's a fun movie. Connery makes it really worth wild even though he doesn't show up until the movie got going. But, unfortunately for him, the director, writer or idiot, kept him running around in circles, literally, in the final act. I don't blame Connery for that; I think he was just given poor direction. Sure, his character was supposed to be the iffy hero, but they had him trotting around like a buffoon until he did what we all knew he would.Spoiler alert, the ending? Could it be any more Shawshank? If you can get past the homophobia (please do,) the enormously bad acting from Cage and oh, lest I forget, the far-too-many (director Bay's favorite) slo-mo scenes, the extensive action alongside Connery was good enough for a recommendation. It's always refreshing to re-visit pre-CGI movies. Don't call me old-fashioned. I like movies that took more time out of the computer room and into realism. With heart. Sorry, Avatar fans, we're still not there yet, so make action look real.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a quiet day in San Francisco. There are 81 civilians on a tour of Alcatraz, the prison famous for the fact that no prisoner had ever successfully escaped. During one of the tours, marine General Francis Xavier Hummel takes the civilians hostage, with the help of other marines. He has 15 rockets of deadly V.X. gas at his disposal, ready to launch at San Francisco. His reason for doing this is simple: he has seen Marines under his command get killed in combat without a military burial or benefits to their families. He makes a threat to the FBI: give the fallen Marines recognition or he will launch the V.X. rockets. After learning that one rocket is enough to take out sixty or seventy thousand people, the FBI sends for their top Chemical Weapons expert: Dr. Stanley Goodspeed, engaged to his pregnant girlfriend. While trying to figure out a countermeasure to the current situation, the FBI is forced to resort to John Patrick Mason, an ex-con who broke out of Alcatraz in 1962....it's a great movie to start with, if for some reason, you want to study the movies of Michael Bay and Simpson and Bruckheimer. To sum it up in one sentence is easy...Die hard on Alcatraz.But it's so much more than that. the characters are human, rather than macho hulks and all have their own specific weaknesses. Connery obviously has age against him, Cage is an action virgin and his girlfriend is pregnant, and Harris, as the main 'villain' shows hi human side a lot during the film, much to the pity of his crew.As expected from the producers and director, it's slickly made, well edited and had some of the best lines and set pieces that featured in a film released in 1996.Most important is the chemistry between Connery and Cage, they make the film so much more than just your standard actioner, they bounce off each other with ease, and when they are on screen together, it's an absolute joy to watch.It's a silly film, but then who cares, it's exciting and fun, and is still one of the better action movies released in the last twenty years.An essential action film, and Cage still had two more fantastic action movies up his sleeve..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's all too easy to dismiss action blockbusters as this as lowbrow, unsophisticated entertainment but that would be inaccurate and unfair in the case of "The Rock"In "The Rock" are assembled a wealth of talented, but more importantly highly watchable actors who have a witty, involving script to work from. Connery is excellent, as are Ed Harris and the occasionally polarising Nicolas Cage but they are supported by strong performances from the likes of Michael Biehn, William Forsythe, David Morse and others.Unusually for a film of this type the characters are sufficiently rounded allowing you to empathise with even the antagonists. The plot is fun and entertaining if a little far-fetched. Performances and script aside there are more than enough action set pieces and special effects to provide excitement and the score is very well done, understandable seeing as Hans Zimmer and Harry Gregson-Williams had a hand in it. All in all, "The Rock" is a well made, well acted, blockbuster masterpiece and deserves wider recognition.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Rock is a perfect example of a Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay film, simple popcorn action. A lot of people including myself have been critical of some of the films they have made and been criticised for dumbing down plots for simple profit.Brigadier General Francis Hummel (Ed Harris) is a highly respected special forces general, who ends up being disillusioned with the American Government, when they dismiss the deaths of special forces soldiers, and not give families the money or the respect they deserve. He takes up extreme action to achieve his goal: with a special force team he steals a stockpile of VX from the US military and then takes hostiles on Alcatraz. Hummel threatens to fire the VX over San Francisco if his demands are not meant and the American government has limited options. The American government only option is to try and send in a special forces team, with a chemical weapons expert Stanley Goodspeed (Nicholas Cage) to disarm the weapons. The problem is that there is only one man who knows how to get into Alcatraz, John Mason (Sean Connery). The thing is, Mason was a former MI6 and SAS soldier, who was arrested by the American, and well unhappy of his arrest, and a now a man in his 60s.Some critics and film fans believe that The Rock is Michael Bay's best film, seeing it as simple summer entertain that is not being pretentious. I disagree, I believe that The Island and Transformers are better films. However the Rock is Michael Bay at his best and worst. There are very good action sequences, especially the military based action. He is not reliant on massive CGI sequence like he is in his later films. Bay could make a good film about special forces. Bay also shoots the film with the aim of an R-rating, and not playing it safe like he has done. Bay also ensembles a good cast, this was when Nicholas Cage was at the height of his career. Sean Connery is in one of his better roles outside Bond, though his part has to be Scottish because he can't do any other accent: if his character was Russian it would have been a bit more believable. Ed Harris was the strongest performer in the film as a the villain, who was made to be a complex character who had a noble cause unlike some villains in summer blockbusters. Bay was also able to fill smaller roles with talented actors, like John Spencer, John C. McGinley and Michael Biehn. But there are a lot of problems that are common with Michael Bay films. Bay has no clue how to reign in his films and like Transformers, Armageddon, etc... The Rock is too long. Bay needs a good editor who can make his films more tort and well more watchable. With this sort of film where the plot is very simple then making it long really affects the film. Things could be have easily been cut, like the car chase in San Francisco. A problem with the film is tone. When the script is written it aimed to be very serious, whilst the re-writes and the direction by Bay wanted to make it more light hearted and comedic. This shows with the different performances, with Sean Connery and Nicholas Cage almost being like a buddy pair, whilst actors like Ed Harris and John Spencer were more serious in their roles. As well there are some script problems, where the film explains too much details to the audience, and not respecting their intelligence. The script also has plot holes, like wouldn't the media question why people were missing or couldn't get to Alcatraz.In a film like this I describe Michael Bay as Oliver Stone with more explosions. This is a film that references at some conspiracy theories and American secret actions, like the locking up of Mason. A more political director would have flagged this issues up more, but a more political director possibility wouldn't have done this film. The theories involving Hoover and the microfilm wasn't needed at all.There are enjoyable action scenes, but there are problems with this film.</fullReview>

The plot centers around terrorism, a wrong idea of patriotism, marines and their politics, bio-chemical terrorism, friendship, and more.Connery and Cage form an impressive on-screen duo. Ed Harris, John Spencer, William Forshyte, and Tony Tood deliver great supporting roles.The action is non-stop, breath taking, filled with spectacular action sequences that are extremely well done mainly because of the flawless direction and the right amount of f/x.The dialogs are really interesting and fit with the action tone of the film. The rest is history; I mean, you can't expect a better action film than this.The plot is the perfect compliment in most action movies, but this time it plays a huge role while creating a certain atmosphere.This is a classic action movie that should be considered amongst the top 10 in recent history.WELCOME TO THE ROCK!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Needless to say, this is not the most realistic film out there, but that does not matter with a movie like this. This movie was made because it is a very entertaining story with a lot of edge-of-your-seat suspense and has the interesting pairing of Cage and Connery. Connery is very cool in his role as an ex-criminal and inmate of the notorious prison known as "The Rock". He somehow escaped and now must help the US Marines reverse escape in.Cage and Connery sneak and fight their way through the compound and manage to destroy the guidance systems in the missiles, making them useless.I think Cage and Connery did a very nice job with their characters. This is not the type of movie where they would get any sort of Oscar nod for it, but I think they did really well. The scene in the end where Cage is just barely able to give the sign to the pilots that he is okay is a very memorable one. It really gets you on the edge of your seat and almost makes you want to stand up and cheer."The Rock" is an awesome action flick with a very solid story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welcome to the Rock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've heard one reviewer say about Michael Bay that he is aggressively untalented. This may be true, but as much as we all love to hate him, I cannot deny that he has made a couple of solidly entertaining movies. The Rock is one of them. I think this is his best movie and also one of the best action movies of its decade. With good performances from a sensational cast and rousing action, The Rock a worthy watch.We begin the story with general Frank Hummel, who is angry with his country. He feels that that families of his dead war comrades did not receive proper compensation. He steals sixteen warheads and holds a Eighty San Francisco civilians hostage in Alcatraz. He then gives the American constitution two days to pay (I forget how much money) or it's boom time. The FBI turns to one extraordinary individual for help. John Mason, is the only person ever to escape from Alcatraz. For reasons unknown to us, he has been locked away for thirty years, only released now to help. He is angry and unwilling, but eventually he cooperates. With the help of quirky FBI scientist Stanley Goodspeed, Mason takes a team to Alcatraz, to try and sabotage Hummel's plan from the inside. Is it gonna work?The story may not be super smart, but it holds together solidly, except for one silly plot twist which starts the climax. It has to do with the character of Frank Hummel, who is one of the more interesting bad guys in Hollywood blockbuster history. The script fleshes him out to a fairly large extent, and Ed Harris's performance brings a certain warmth to the character. It was not until A History of Violence came out when I realized that Ed Harris can play a really dirty villain. Compared to that movie, he seems about as menacing as a boyscout in the Rock. Sean Connery plays his role well, and unlike Harrison Ford, his age does not interfere with the character. Nicholas Cage is extremely funny as the typical nerd scientist, but at times he goes a little too far over the top. Regardless of where the characters have occasional flaws, you end up having too much fun with them to care.This applies to the Rock as a whole. It has its idiocies, but it does just about everything that a good action film should. It is almost the Die Hard of the decade.</fullReview>

The recent Bourne movies have proved that effective action films don't have to treat their audiences like they're retarded, but Bay apparently hasn't yet gotten that memo.And there's always something vaguely homoerotic about movies like this. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that we're always watching a bunch of sweaty men playing with their big guns.Grade: C+</fullReview>

Along with its talented cast (Sean Connery, Nicolas Cage, Ed Harris), The Rock has a good story and a fast pace, which keeps the audience wanting more. The reason I think Michael Bay is one of the premier directors, is for his vision for action sequences, he hardly uses CGI, unless it's almost unnoticeable or he is doing Sci Fi. The Rock is totally old school and realistic when it comes to the action and you have to appreciate that. All in all this film set the bar high for action films for this generation and future generations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sean Connery carries this movie. If any actor besides Connery was tried to star next to the Charisma Destroyer (Nicolas Cage), he would've failed.Despite Cage I actually really enjoy this movie. It has an interesting lead villain, great performances by Ed Harris, Sean Connery, and John Spencer; a good plot, and good special effects.It is a "Turn your brain off" action flick, but the motives of the villains are actually interesting to think about (to me anyway).There is some stereotyping, but overall the movie is extremely entertaining...EXCEPT FOR NICOLAS CAGE!!! HOW DOES THIS MAN KEEP FINDING WORK!!! I HAVE YET TO SEE HIM ACT IN A FILM!!! Whenever he utters a line, I want to scream "Shut-up Nicolas Cage!!! Leave!!! I want to see what Mr. Connery's doing!" (i.e. "It's you. You're the Rocket Man..." - Worst... delivery... ever.) Thankfully, the movie doesn't focus on him all the time. There is sufficient diversion with the villains, the other actors, and the special effects to distract from Cage's performance.That said, Cage in a starring role automatically adds a -3 modifier.6/10. Good action, interesting lead villain (Harris), good performances by most of the cast, worth a look if you ignore Nicolas Cage, which you can easily do with everything else going on.A NOTE ABOUT NICOLAS CAGE - The -3 modifier will disappear if I see a film where he engages in the art of "acting." I don't know him, he could be a nice person, but I would like to see actors... act... or try to act... in a movie.</fullReview>

This is Michael Bays best film to date (as of now Transformers 2 has not come out, so we'll see if that changes). The cool thing about The Rock is that it manages to win over many who don't care for action movies. It spends plenty of time developing its characters and doesn't rush into things too quickly. The payoff is more than anyone could ask for and there is a decent amount of comedy that doesn't get in the way of the intensity. The Rock is not meant only for the action fan bases but for anyone interested in a quality adrenaline rush.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fourth Best Action Movie Ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, seriously, though. This is the fourth best action movie ever. Bruckheimer has nothing else that compares to this, except maybe Con Air, and, no, it's not a coincidence that Nicholas Cage is in this film. It's obvious that Raising Arizona and Face/Off are his best flicks, but this is unbelievable. So, here's the top four: 1. Raiders of the Lost Ark, 2. Die Hard, 3. Point Break, 4. The Rock. So, the Rock comes in at fourth, but how can you beat an archaeologist(directed by Spielberg) fighting Nazis for the Ark of the Covenant, Bruce Willis fighting Germans to save Nakatomi Plaza, Johnny F---in' Utah fighting bank robbing surfers (with Gary Busey), etc. But honestly, he drives a volvo, beige. This movie takes what Spielberg did with Last Crusade (a wisened Sean Connery) and made it Alcatrizazed to your mother's c--word. I mean, sticking a needle in your chest is hardcore for a non-heroine addict. Okay, Honeymoon in Vegas was good (so was 3000 Miles to Graceland), but aside from Pirates of the Disney World ride, Bruckheimer took some Bad Boys to the edge here and made one of the most exciting action flicks ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Standard action picture for the popcorn generation, with a more exciting plot and classier cast than most.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For his second film (following on from the noisy no-brainer "Bad Boys") director Michael Bay gives us "The Rock". This pounding, pulsating action flick is full of plot holes and implausible action set pieces, but has terrific energy and a handful of engaging performances which make its flaws forgivable. It is a film that will never win any awards for subtlety, but it is effective in doing what it sets out to do - that being to fill two hours of screen time with spectacle and entertainment. Bay is a director whose work I generally tend to dislike but with "The Rock" he has, for once, done a good job (aided in no small part by the excitingly silly premise and the game performances of Connery, Cage and Harris).Disgruntled American war hero General Francis X. Hummel (Ed Harris) and a team of heavily armed mercenaries seize the San Francisco island-prison of Alcatraz. They imprison a group of tourists and set up a series of missiles at various points around the island. Each missile contains a lethal chemical which, when released or exploded, has the capacity to kill hundreds of thousands of people in the vicinity. A team of soldiers is assembled to get onto the Rock, led by Commander Anderson (Michael Biehn). Also sent along for the purpose of disarming the missiles is inexperienced chemical weapons specialist Stanley Goodspeed (Nicholas Cage), a guy who would rather be cuddling up to his pregnant wife than tackling a bunch of impeccably-drilled renegade marines. The only problems is that none of them have any idea how to get onto Alcatraz undetected, so the Government agents have to reluctantly call upon the one man who can help them. Ex-SAS soldier John Mason (Sean Connery), who has been locked away 30 years for stealing a government microfilm and is the only man ever to have escaped from Alcatraz, is temporarily "freed" and instructed to guide the raiding party into the underground tunnels of The Rock. The raid goes awry and nearly all the would-be rescuers are captured and killed, leaving just Mason and Goodspeed to evade the bad guys, find and disarm the missiles, and save the city!!"The Rock" is very much a packaged, polished film. Nothing raw, edgy or unpredictable here. It's a film that plays safe and delivers the requisite thrills and spills in much the same way that a roller-coaster does. As usual the bad guys can't shoot straight, and the good guys can always think of a witty remark at the very moment they dispose of a villain. The action filmed in a dizzying, lightning-fast style with whizzing pans of the camera and furious cross-cutting of camera angles. This makes the action come across as fast-paced and exciting. Hans Zimmer's score is suitably frenetic and adds to the drama. As you would expect there are predictable scenes, moments that require total suspension of belief, chunks of corny macho dialogue, and every cliché in the book (including a wholly irrelevant car chase - but hey! What's a film set in San Francisco if it DOESN'T feature a car chase?!?) In spite of all this "The Rock" is a lot of fun and if you watch it for what it is, you'll find it an entertaining slice of escapism.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my favorite action movies and I'm normally not a fan of these kind of films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying that I'm absolutely no fan of action movies. I find most of them ridiculous and try to avoid them as much as possible. That's of course not a good start when you are about to watch a movie like "The Rock". But before you think that you know where this review will go, I also have to say that this is probably one of the few action movies for which I'll make an exception. That's right, I really like this one and there are many reasons for that. But let me start by telling you what the story is about.General Hummel has spent most of his career carrying out covert operations. Over the years, he has lost many men, because they got killed during one of these operations or because they had to be left behind. Since these operations were secret, those men or their families have never received any recognition or compensation. After trying to get them that through normal channels, Hummel now decides that it's time for drastic measures. Together with a group of renegade marine commandos he seizes a stockpile of chemical weapons and takes over Alcatraz, taking 81 tourists hostage. If the government doesn't pay 100 million dollar, he will launch 15 rockets, aimed directly to San Francisco and carrying deadly VX nerve gas. As time is running out, the Pentagon sends in an elite SEAL team, together with an FBI chemical warfare expert and a former Alcatraz escapee...So even though I'm not a fan of action movies, I must say that for this one I'm glad to make an exception. I like it so much because of the very good acting, the good character development, some fine special effects, the believable action and the unexpected twists in this well-written story. I know that's a lot to discuss, so let's start with the acting. With a top cast like this one, including people like Sean Connery, Nicolas Cage, Ed Harris, William Forsythe... you can't expect anything less but some top-notch performances, but that doesn't mean that you'll get it of course. Too often you'll see some good actors who don't seem to belong in a certain movie or who just seem to have a day that nothing works. Not in this movie. Every single actor has done a very fine job, which of course is a pleasure to watch. The fact that they had some interesting and believable characters to work with will have helped them with that of course. Think for instance of Dr. Stanley Goodspeed (Nicolas Cage). He is no superhero who will just walk in through the main gate, shooting every bad guy with his eyes shut and rescuing all the hostages at the same time. No, this is a man with no decent military training, good at working with chemicals, but afraid to be confronted with the enemy. The same for John Patrick Mason (Sean Connery), he's no superman either. He's a retired SAS commando, so he knows how to kill a foe, but he's also an old man who has spent most of his time in a prison cell. And it's the same about the other characters. No-one of them is just good or just bad and that's what I like so much about this movie. The characters have a certain depth, which is a rare thing for an action movie.Next to the good acting and the interesting characters, I also liked the action and the special effects. Of course there are a lot of explosions and yes there is a major car chase to be seen in it, but then again: this is still an action movie. If it isn't allowed in this one, where can you use it in then? And it has to be said, it is sometimes a bit much and too prominent, but it is never completely unbelievable like in so many other action movies. The fact that it all looks so good and that it all seems believable also has a lot to do with the nice special effects. Even though this movie is about ten years old now, it doesn't look dated at all. It adds a lot to the tension and the suspense and it feels like it was made only yesterday and that's something that you'll not find in every movie.So now I'm only left with the good story and the unexpected twists. I'm not going to give too much away about it of course, because that would spoil all the fun for those who haven't seen the movie yet. I just want to say that the story is a nice mix of action, drama, laughter and suspense. It's one big whirlpool that will probably suck you in and will not let you go until the end. I really liked that and that's why I give this movie a 7.5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rarely do I find a movie where logic takes a back seat that I actually enjoy. The Rock is one of those dumb action movies that I did find enjoyable. Nicholas Cage has turned out to be quite the action actor, able to sustain a borderline-nerd character into a kick ass James Bond-esquire action star (Stanley Goodspeed is his name in the movie). Not bad, especially since he's staring in the same movie as James Bond himself, Sean Connery. The Connery character is actually intriguing. He plays John Mason, an ex-British spy who's been locked up by the FBI for years, holding him without ever charging him on anything. We find out later that he found out buried secrets about America's past, so the FBI had to silence him before he spoke. The only problem with that plan is they put Mason in Alcatraz, and Mason became, at least according to the movie's plot, the only resident of the prison to escape. Fast forward to the movie's present day, and a team of Marines, lead by Ed Harris, have stolen VX gas (real stuff, highly poisonous stuff too) and are threatening to launch missiles filled with the gas from Alcatraz over San Francisco. The plan is to have navy seals enter Alcatraz, with help from Mason, and disable the missiles, with help from Goodspeed. The movie plays like a cat and mouse game between the good guys and the bad guys through the bowels of the prison, ultimately ending in grand fashion. The movie is well paced, director Michael Bay knows just when to slow down the pace and when to speed it back up. The special effects and the acting are solid, especially by Harris who plays a tough guy Marine until the moment of truth approaches. The Rock is solid entertainment, even if you have to shut your brain off at times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alright, i just got it from the trades that William August (a.k.a. Mr. Paul Todd from "my big fat obnoxious boss") has a cameo role in "The Rock." He plays the leader of the squadron of pilots who are in charge of bombing Alcatraz! YEAH!!?? The guy who gives them the instructions! I can't believe those loser contestants on the show didn't recognize him. Just when you think you've seen it all right? For some reason the sight hasn't updated him on their web page yet because he was also in "Anchorman" and they don't have that listed. We definitely need to contact the server. Also, there's some good shots of Mr. Todd playing b-ball in euro league back in the 80's. Finally, the only problem i see with "the rock" is that sometimes when I dream that I'm Stanley Goodspeed, I wish I had had more than three weeks of weapons training.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A solid action movie, but it's not Bay who's to be thanked for that.*MIGHT CONTAIN SPOILERS*The actors carry this movie. Sean Connery, Ed Harris and Nicolas Cage deliver good acting performances which give this movie something extra to lift it above the mass of similar movies.Direction and continuity are sloppy, camera work is good, except for the nervous zooming in and out during the car chase through San Francisco. Furthermore, to fully enjoy this movie, you should realize it's pure fiction, especially the locations. 90% of "Alcatraz" as portrayed in the movie simply doesn't exist.Just sit back and enjoy the ride.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Slam-bang high-tech action-thriller stuff. Ed Harris, as a much-decorated combat commander of legendary status, deploys a hand-picked squadron of elite renegade Marines to take over Alcatraz. He holds hostage not only a civilian tour group, but the entire city of San Fran, at which he's aimed 15 tactical missiles armed with the nastiest nerve gas in the universe. His goal? To get the US government to acknowledge, with posthumous honors and compensation to family members, about 100 men lost -- and unacknowledged -- in covert operations ranging from Vietnam to Desert Storm.Here come the Feds: they send in a team of SEALs led by Michael Biehn (in a reprise, basically, of his role in "Aliens"). Their ringers: Nicolas Cage, in a rather John Cusackish performance as a lab-wonk toxic-weapons expert, hilariously short of combat experience; and Sean Connery, as a long-held secret prisoner of the US, a Brit agent who has all the dirt on the FBI. He knows all the secrets from Roswell (!) to the JFK assassination, and he's the only man ever to escape from Alcatraz. The scripter's inclusion of the presence in San Fran of people who are near and dear to both these characters is more than a little contrived. It has MOTIVATION written all over it in the case of Connery's character, and UP THE ANTE in the case of Cage's. But what the hell: this isn't drama, but melodrama, essentially an hyperbolic mismatched-buddy-cop movie, and the pace, the action, and the stars' charisma are equal to it. An enjoyable cliffhanger, if wildly improbable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is your average, wham bam thank you ma'am action movie. But it works, unlike the cesspool of boring, embarrassing action flicks out there. Ed Harris is an honorable but disgruntled General who seizes control of Alcatraz to meet personal demands (don't worry, they are actually honorable and humane). Sean Connery, a former Alcatraz prisoner who knows the map, and Nicolas Cage, a chemical scientist, team up to bring Harris down and stop any threats. The action is nonstop, there's plenty of killing, plenty of explosions. You get the picture. Oh, and mind the horrible attempts at humor and one liners.

So you could call it a test of manhood (yeah, I did get that from Braveheart) if they like the movie, at least you know they're not turning into femmy guys. However, this movie is not just for guys, there are girls who like it too (not many I know), but it is aimed more towards the male audience."The Rock" has pretty much everything that a guy could ask for from a movie: Sweet cars in fast paced-chase scenes, great action sequences, a girl, stunning special effects, tense amazing music, and of course, Sean Conery. Throw in some comedy, and you've got a super-sized platter of Steak du jour.The Plot is great, no, it's classic. I could not think of a much better plot for a movie, or how I could make this movie better, I wouldn't want to, classics should be treasured in our hearts!If you are a guy who has not seen this movie, shame on you, you've failed the gender. if you are a girl, maybe you should watch this movie to better understand your man. if you are confused about what you are, watch "The Rock" and if you like it, I can bet good money on it, you're a guy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fast-paced thrill ride is marred by silliness and occasional blurry editing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>7 out of 10Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer are responsible for some of the most hated movies of the past five years. But before every critic started pouncing on their collaborations, they gave us The Rock, arguably the best film of Bay's career and probably the most efficient example of the Bruckheimer formula, which is basically to put thousands of people in danger, having a ticking clock, and watch stuff blow and get shot up real good. At that, The Rock is a success, moving at a lightning pace that's guaranteed to entertain you from beginning to end. There's shootouts, car chases, and fisticuffs; all the action's directed with energy and flair. There are, unfortunately, some big letdowns. Bay's obsession with quick cuts renders the San Francisco car chase into a big blur. The script is stupid (take, for instance, the scene where virtually ALL the Navy Seals pile up in that one room, all strung up for one big massacre) and Cage is as annoying as he is amusing. Standout performances from Sean Connery and Ed Harris, as usual. This is an entertaining thrill ride, too bad Bay and the screenwriters had too much coffee.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you want an entertaining movie, "The Rock" will do. Sean Connery plays a James Bond character, and Nicolas Cage gives his usual performance. The setting is great and San Francisco is a nice back drop. I did have a few problems with the film. In the age of Ebay, Cage's character buys the Beatles "White Album" for way too much. The Ed Harris character really cops out when he and his men decide to launch a missle. They take hostages, kill several people, and risk all to see their demands met. When the opportunity arises, they bluff and do not carry out their threats. If they were not prepared to pull the trigger, why go to the extreme in the first place? Nicolas Cage also has a bad acting habit of emphasising the last word of every sentence. He does that in about every movie. Lose that, Cage. This is not a great movie, but don't be too hard on "The Rock". There are enough standard car chases, explosions, and mayhem to keep me entertained.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An incredibly exiciting,captivating Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think a fair way to sum up this film would be in one word:Brilliant.However, I think it, and you, the readers of this review deserve a slightly more comprehensive description than that. Firstly, a quick summary of the plot,without revealing too much: Ed Harris (Apollo 13) plays Francis Hummel, an ex General who wants to get back at the armed forces, because of the way they treat the kin of killed officers so poorly, and other things of similar sorts. To do this, he takes control of Alcatraz and keeps the visiters there hostage, threatening to also launch poison missiles at San Francisco. Two men, in particular, are relied upon to break into the Island and stop him. Firstly, chemical weapons expert Stanley Goodspeed, played by Nicholas Cage(Gone in 60 Seconds,Face/Off). His job is to disarm the weapons. Secondly, John Mason, played by Sean Connery(The Untouchables,Entrapment). His job is too break in because he is the only man to ever have broken out.Of course, chaos ensues and what unfolds is a couple of hours of great action that is made even better with the special effects and expert production and direction. Produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, who really is a genious with other titles like Armageddon, Enemy of the State,Top Gun and Gone in 60 Seconds to his name, pulls off another great, with the help of Don Simpson, who he worked with on Enemy of the State and Crimson Tide. Micheal Bay is once again very good as the director, as with Pearl Harbour and Armageddon, where he also worked with Bruckheimer. These three people, together with the cast already mentioned, have created a unique film that is very entertaining and great to look at, in terms of effects, and scale. The soundtrack is very dramatic and fitting as always with a Bruckheimer film. All in all, a wonderful film, that I don't think got all the applause it deserves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't let appearances fool you</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the face of it, this just seems to be yet another action movie by Jerry Bruckheimer, with big muscles, and bigger guns. However, it is in fact a pretty good movie, thanks mainly to the fact that the main character, Stanley Goodspeed (played by Nicolas Cage) is not a gung-ho, all American hero. He does not relish being in his position (stuck on Alcatraz with a bunch of crazy SEALS and crazier marines armed with big fat missiles), and has some dry lines which he uses well. I won't reveal the plot, but its not up to much anyway, so no loss there... Sean Connery as usual, delivers a James Bond performance - the only kind of role he can pull off - as an ex-SAS, ex-MI6 agent, who was imprisoned on Alcatraz and escaped. (By the way, isn't it funny how all the British guys in action films seem to be SAS soldiers or spies - you'd think we were trained to trained to whip up a Vodka Martini from birth!) Anyway, the best bit of the movie in my opinion is when Connery says: 'losers always whine about their best. Winners go home and f**k the prom queen'. The only problem I had with the movie, (and it is seriously minor), is that one of the marines punches Sean Connery, and says, 'f**king English prick, did I ever tell you my father was Irish?' Sean Connery is SCOTTISH!!! What an ignorant thing to say! The Irish have got absolutely no problem with the Scots, and it is typical Hollywood attitude to classify all of the UK as England. Next thing we know, they'll be saying that Europe is one country! Anyway, sorry for nattering on; in conclusion, The Rock is an above average action film, and well worth renting out.</fullReview>

Ed Harris is in a role that suits him like a glove. David Morse is in his usual role of the "best friend, second in charge, right hand of the hero/antihero", at which he excels. The soundtrack by Hans Zimmer is simply amazing. One should run and purchase it right after the end-titles. In spite of this all, 8/10, due to:a) the plot and dialogs being too ridiculous even for an action movie,b) as I have mentioned in the beginning, it is too long.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE ROCK and CRIMSON TIDE are arguably Bruckheimer's two mini-masterpieces. (CON AIR was just too over-the-top!) The film is given an extra boost by the presence of Sean Connery, who even in his late sixties would STILL make the quintessential Bond (are you listening Sean?)As John Mason, a wrongfully imprisoned British Agent who simply knew too much, his services are required now to assist a bunch of Navy Seals break IN to Alcatraz where former war hero, purple heart and majorly p***ed off General Hummel, is threatening to eradicate a few million San Franciscans if his demands to have Uncle Sam pay the families of his men killed in action are not met. (Not often you come across an honorable extortionist!) Mason's expertise being that he remains the ONLY person to have EVER successfully escaped from The Rock!Cage too is out of his tree as Dr Stanley Goodspeed, a chemical engineer dragged along for the ride, his job being to neutralise some extremely unpleasant biological weaponry Hummel plans on lobbing downtown. He and Connery work together a treat - you will rarely see two actors spark off each other so charismatically.Even with stalwart commando, Michael Biehn's gung-ho contribution, it remains totally Sean Connery's film who acts everyone off the screen. Even his one face-to-face with Ed Harris as Hummel, yields up perhaps the best and most appropriate line of the movie. David Morse is excellent as Hummel's 2IC and Tony Todd ("Candyman") plays a mercenary just on hand for the big payday! The action is relentless and coupled with a literate script and top of the line production values (except maybe for the curiously unrealistic low-level bombing raid at the end) this is the ultimate action/feelgood flick. No one on their right mind could walk out of this film claiming they were bored. Easily the benchmark by which other action flicks will be measured. Take Connery out of the equation though, it would simply have been a "good film."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is definitely a great movie. Yes, the action is great, but the performances are more a reason to watch this movie.Nicolas Cage, coming off his big Oscar win at the time, is Stanley Goodspeed, a bio-chemist for the FBI. He's pretty much a regular, goofy guy, without any combat experience, which shows throughout the movie, and leads to some funny scenes.Ed Harris, Hummel, is the maniac in the movie, not as typical as you may think as the movie goes on. He's employed some of his marine friends to help with heist, taking over Alcatraz and taking hostages, while threatening to launch rockets with VX gas at San Francisco.Sean Connery puts in a great performance as Mason, the wrongfully-charged prisoner, who was put in jail without a trial. He's rightfully pissed, so obviously it takes a little to get him to guide the Navy Seals through The Rock, to overtake Hummel and his men.The movie consists of many action sequences, that do not seem pointlessly thrown in like in other movies, but flow with the plot. The story is pretty cool and is executed quite good. Michael Bay really shines as the director, excellently using his low-angle shots, really showcasing what is going on in the scene. Definitely a must-see for action movie fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you only see only one Jerry Bruckheimer movie, let it be The Rock. It is proof that if the team of Bruckheimer and Bay can get their hands on a decent script, they are capable of making some great stuff. The dialog was suprisingly intelligent and nothing was corny. The humor was well timed,hilarious, and didn't mess up the course of the movie unlike Armageddon. The character development was excellent. The film successfully showed why we should care about them. Although some characters were more developed than others, it is still enough to make to make you feel for the characters who got killed, unlike movies like The Mummy which basically made "expendable characters" who's sole purpose was to get killed sometime during the film. What i really liked was how the movie portrayed Ed Harris's character, General Hummel. Unlike most action movies, the villain wasn't portrayed as a heartless ogre, but rather a normal person with good intentions but is trying to get them the wrong way. Harris's performance almost makes you want to root for him. Sean Connery was great, as usual. Although i think Nicholas Cage is a great actor, he can't play a tough guy. I don't know why but he doesn't convince me that the character he is playing is tough and comes across goofy. Fourtunately, he didn't play one in The Rock, he played an FBI chemical who had no combat experience which was a perfect part for him. But he later got type casted into playing tough guy roles like Con Air, Face Off, and Gone in 60 Seconds. The supporting cast was great as well. Michael Biehn did a great job in the few minutes of screen time he got (His argument with Ed Harris right before the shower room shoot out was one of the most intense parts of the movie). David Morse, who played Ed Harris's assistant, had the most underrated performance. The action is intense and the special effects look very realistic.Overall, The Rock is an excellent action flick and arguably the best action film of the 90's. 5 out of 5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What more can you honestly say about Jerry Bruckheimer and his team of loyal film experts, they're amazing! This is definitely one of my all time favorite films, a non-stop action packed blockbuster which leaves most of it's kind far behind. There is just something about the way that Bruckheimer makes his movies, whether it be his passion or skill; all of his accomplishments speak for themselves. Top Gun started the ball rolling in 1986, and since then we've seen nothing but fantastic movies come out of his studios, We've seen the birth of Beverly Hills Cop, then Days Of Thunder, Bad Boys, Con Air, Armageddon etc. etc. all of which stand out as some of the best action and adventure flicks ever made.... 'The Rock' not only takes you on a Rollercoaster ride of one-liners and expensive stunts that Bruckheimer is renowned for, it co-stars Sean Connery (James' Law, any movie with Sean Connery is worth seeing) and Nicolas Cage, two of the worlds best actors by far who light up the screen in their duo! Bruckheimer also successfully sneaks in an underlying plot with Sean Connery's character 'James Mason' derived from his early James Bond roles, which I'm sure any Bond fan will love.If you're going to hire any movie this weekend, let it be The Rock, even if you have seen it 10 times before, one not to be missed.

		<shortDescription>A First-Rate Action Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`The Rock' effortlessly achieves what most action movies can only dream about ? it's paced so well, and has action scenes and characters so good, the weak spots in the story really don't matter. Story quality is one of the major components behind making a good movie, but it's certainly not the only component, and `The Rock' demonstrates that to great effect. With great direction from Michael Bay, and with outstanding performances from the cast (especially Ed Harris), what might've been a standard, mediocre film in other hands is instead a fantastic action movie.The premise: `The Rock', or Alcatraz, as it's more commonly known, is taken over by a bunch of military terrorists led by General Francis Hummel (Ed Harris), an American war hero. Instead of issuing the usual comic-book demands of typical terrorists, Hummel wants the United States government to pay compensation to the families of American soldiers who died in covert, officially unrecognized missions ? in the amount of one hundred million dollars. Failure to pay as per Hummel's demands will result in the obliteration of San Francisco with bio-chemical weapons.Enter the geeky Stanley Goodspeed (Nicolas Cage), a FBI bio-chemistry expert, to be part of the team needed to get onto `The Rock' and defuse the weapons. He's paired with the renowned spy John Mason (Sean Connery), who's supposedly the only person ever to successfully escape from Alcatraz ? the FBI figures since Mason knew how to sneak out of the prison undetected, he'll be able to sneak back on. Together, Mason and Goodspeed travel to Alcatraz to thwart General Hummel's plansThe action is phenomenal and paced perfectly; director Michael Bay manages to keep a tense, frantic edge throughout most of the film, but seems to know just when to stop or slow things down so that the audience has a little time to breathe. Many of the action scenes seem to be cribbed from other films ? a car chase scene through the streets of San Francisco is nearly lifted perfectly from `Bullitt', for example, while a three-way armed standoff is highly reminiscent of any number of Sergio Leone westerns ? but they're conducted with such joyful enthusiasm, that doesn't matter. Individually, these scenes might seem like nothing but cheap knock-offs of other films, but they're brought together with such skill that the overall film looks great. Connery is great as Mason, the spy who's seen more than any normal man should ever see, and Cage is pretty convincing as the bumbling Goodspeed, who's more comfortable with a calculator than a handgun. Both imbue their characters with enough depth to make them a cut above typical action movie heroes. Ed Harris steals the movie, though, as the gritty, weary Hummel ? you wind up caring about him and his band of patriotic renegades a lot, and since he's technically the villain of `The Rock', it adds whole new dimensions to the standard action movie formula, dimensions that both Michael Bay and the screenwriters took the time to explore. Ed Harris' portrayal of Hummel literally makes `The Rock' an outstanding action movie on his own. With different actors, would this movie have been as good? Maybe . . . but I doubt it very much.Are there problems with `The Rock?' Certainly. Hummel and his men, for example, don't seem to understand the concept of `secured radio channels', allowing Goodspeed and company to overhear vital plot information almost at will. The tunnels beneath Alcatraz are apparently bigger than the Lincoln Tunnel, and better lit to boot. The list goes on, but these are minor issues that only slightly detract from the awesome ride that is `The Rock'. Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Rock is a superb action movie, and I think, the best ever made! This movie is all action. In it's 135 minute length, only about 15 minutes are not action!. The cast is superb, especially Ed Harris as General Francis X Hummel of the United States Marine Corps. Sean Connery also stands out as ex SAS captain John Patrick Mason.

		<shortDescription>My favorite action movie of all time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've watched this movie too many times to count and I'm always ready to watch it again. It combines everything that makes a great action movie. The three top-billed actors do an extraordinary job of taking on the roles of Stanley Goodspeed, John Patrick Mason, and General Francis X. Hummel. We are offered Nicholas Cage in one of the few action roles that he triumphs in, as Goodspeed. He may not be the typical tough skinned action hero, but he responds to the threats with a realistic amazement. Add Ed Harris in an uncharacteristic action film role as Hummel and it gets better. We are given a United States General as a villain which leaves us asking, "Why is he doing this?". Like many action movies, one would think that this is where the action simmers down and a bit of drama takes over. In this case, it does turn dramatic, but with the great work of Harris, each line is delivered with fierce conviction that the action truly never stops.Finally, we are given Sean Connery as ex-SAS operative, John Patrick Mason. It could have been a role with no more than one dimension, but that's not what you'll find here! He is a mythical character who accompanies Goodspeed, and as they take on the evil element, they find that they learn a little bit more about themselves thanks to each other.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Forget what you read in other reviews. If you like action, suspense and some great stunts and camera work go rent/buy The Rock now! I think the opening sequence alone (where we see the cemetery and Ed Harris putting his uniform on) is amazing alone and the opening "battle" is one of the best made in any film. The whole thing about the film is great; the music, the camera work, the stunts, the explosions.of course, no film is excellent and The Rock's story is a little bit dodgy (one thing i hate is the people who do "funny lines", i.e. the black woman with the dodgy hair in the cells at the start and the barber in the lift when mason escapes).But they don't bring the movie down and i think that Connery and Cage have a large amount of chemistry between them.Not as good as Bad Boys or Armaggeden (Michael Bay's two other movies) but it's still an amazing movie!10/10 - TOP MARKS - LONG LIVE MICHAEL BAY!</fullReview>

Sean Connery was fantastic in it, even using some lines that were puns on him. Nicolas Cage, who was, at the time, just making a name for himself as an action star, and was fresh off his oscar for Leaving Las Vegas, is also great as a highly intelligent, but kind of geeky chemical wizard forced into a "combat situation". I would recommend this movie to just about anyone, because there is something for everybody to like about it.</fullReview>

From the first second I was thrilled by the great actors, the wonderful scenes, and most of all; the music. Hans Zimmer did a great job when he put together this masterpiece of a soundtrack.

		<fullReview>These reviews are truly ridiculous. Four and a half out of five stars? Really?! Half a star away from being an all-time CLASSIC?! THIS movie? THE ROCK?! Other people are raving about the plot, the script, the character development... Puh-lease. It's your simple, standard action movie. The characters are given just ENOUGH depth to make it rise above a few other action movies, sure, but make no mistake: THE ROCK is about explosions, car chases, and choreographed cartoonish fighting. The plot is BEYOND unrealistic, the dialogue is overwrought and often just plain ridiculous, and the shaky camerawork may induce seizures (okay, it works on NYPD BLUE, but two plus hours of it is way too much...)And, if you're a film student, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do not go to THE ROCK for a character study (as someone else suggested), go to THE BROTHERS McMULLEN or CAUGHT or DRUNKS if that's what you want. Any film student watching THE ROCK better be taking a mindless break from studying, not taking careful notes. It's an okay popcorn movie, but, for pete's sake, do NOT give THE ROCK more credit than it deserves. Out of five stars? Two and a half, maybe three... and I'm feeling really generous today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well here is part two of a great director's, work. This is a truly great film (almost perfect!!), among the best ones ever made. Good cast, story, effect, laughs and so on, but what really struck me here was how great Michael Bay is. This film made me almost cry several (5) times. Bad Boys and Armageddon made me almost cry to, well I even did during Armageddon and that is rare in an action flick. This almost cry ?thing' is due to Michael Bays directing style of course (colours, slow motion) plus the great sound he uses during the scenes. Almost cry scenes in this film were: the shower ? room, Hummel' s speech at the beginning and the green flares. Michael Bay and The Rock ROCK!!!! Michael Bay is going to get gigantic over the years I SWEAR and he will be someone in the lines of Spielberg someday. Why am I so sure, well I downloaded the Pearl Harbor Teaser (due out Memorial Day 2001) and I almost cried, it was great, brilliant. This one will follow Michael Bays other successes: (Bad Boys (1995): $ 140,8 Million World - wide, The Rock (1996): $ 330,5 Million World ? wide, Armageddon (1998): $ 554, 6 Million World ? wide and Pearl Harbor (2001): $ 750 Million World ? wide????? (WHY???, because every movie in this line ? up adds about $ 200 Million to the box ? office result of the movie before)), but not only in the box ? office field (Bad Boys (1995): 0 Oscar nominations, The Rock (1996): 1 Oscar nomination, Armageddon (1998): 4 Oscar nominations and Pearl Harbor (2001): will win 1 Oscar and be nominated for ??? others (WHY???, I don't know, just guessing!!!!!))RENT IT!!!!!!!9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, I enjoyed this movie. As usual, if I had directed it, it would certainly have been better! The actors give very good performances, and the action scenes are exciting, and well shot, even if the locations are a little unbelievable. (Is there really a vast abandoned mining complex beneath Alcatraz? Why do all furnaces have unnecessary cogs and pulsed flames, like the crusher in Galaxy Quest?).My main gripe is with Ed Harris. Why on earth does he give the government so much time? They could effect an electronic transfer in minutes, so 4 hours would have been ample. Mind, this would rather have shortened the film!On a technical note, is that really how chemical weapons are constructed? BAN THEM NOW: THE RISK OF DISASTER IS TOO GREAT!

		<fullReview>putting aside all other opinions that i may have, this is one of the best action movies, ever. an awesome movie directed by an awesome... uhh... director is, well, awesome. :)the plot: here we see a rather unique, but predictable, story. in short, hummell (played by ed harris,) who is an ex-army general (or something high-ranked,) has decided to steal a whole bunch of rockets with some nasty stuff in them because his men were not reimbursed for the stuff they suffered. he puts all of the rockets on the rock - alcatraz island - and maintains base there. enter the government. they decide to use (cheesy) the only man who's ever escaped: john mason, who is played by sean connery. with mason is goodspeed, who is played by nicholas cage. together, and with other guys, they have to disarm all these bombs before hummell fires them off.character development: the three main characters - hummell, goodspeed, and mason - are rather well developed. from the beginning of the movie, we see hummell's reason for doing this, and we feel some form of compassion, as if it's something he has to do. and we see goodspeed's relationship with his girlfriend and how he puts work above all, and yet he has a fear of needles. finally, we see mason's struggle because he's been in jail for the longest time because he stole a microfilm. everything in the movie has a purpose, and in time, we see the purpose.the action: what's a bruckheimer movie without action? one of the greatest action sequences in this movie is the shower-room scene. hummell's men have the advantage of height, looking down on a now-infiltrated shower room. we see the bloodshed and the loss of men, and then we see hummell's reaction - he is ashamed and angry because of what has transpired. without giving away more of the movie, we see some very cool deaths for the characters we grow to hate.the music: i love a good movie score. in fact, i hold the soundtrack in my hand right now. hans zimmer did an incredible job when he wrote this - the recurring notes we hear throughout the movie are reverberated and pounded into our heads. the music is action-packed and keeps the audience into the movie.all in all, this is one of bruckheimer's greatest movies. he has put together a masterpiece, and i am incredibly glad for having seen this movie. and if you see it, you'll feel the same way.</fullReview>

They should stop meeting like this.The action is fast and good.The story is much gripping, and the director of photography provide us with much excellent shoots. Very entertaining.Claire Forlani (if I'm not mistaken)steal an act as Connery's daughter. She shines bright because his face suites the scripts and situation.

		<fullReview>This film was made when Don Simpson sadly died, so you can guess that he will want it to be special......and it IS!!! this is quite possibly the best action film i have ever seen! (and i'm not just saying that because Nicolas Cage is my favourite actor). It has everything, fast cars, cool action music, evil bad guys, hi-tech weaponery, dark locations and a plot that will just blow you away!General Francis X Hummel (Ed Harris) is a pro. He is evil but he's a pro. He is also sick of the lies that he has lived on his entire career. Now Hummel has a plan to make the lies stop - he is going to take over Alcatraz Island and threaten to send a bunch of missiles armed with VX poison gas on to San Fransisco and wipe out the whole city. while he is doing this he has also taken 81 hostages in the process.Now...here comes the catch, the FBI believe that nobody has ever escaped the island...that is except the Director of FBI Womack (John Spencer) he knows exactly who has escaped...that person is John Mason (Sean Connery) of Her Majesty's Secret Service. Womack can't believe that the only hope they have is a 60 yr old convict. But he has no choice but to let Mason out.Mason is teamed up with Dr. Stan Goodspeed (Nicolas Cage "My favourite actor YEY") a chemical specialist for the FBI. together Mason and Goodspeed team up with a couple of NAVY SEALS (headed by Micheal Biehn) to stop Hummel and his band of merceneries.I would have to give this film 10/10.

There were too many contrived situations, characters whose actions didn't quite fit with situation or background, omissions and such.*** MILD SPOILER ALERT ***The idea that a general would be overcome by righteous indignation, and be driven to blackmailing the Government with a "bluff" (his word) is a bit far-fetched. But to think that this same General (who we find is indeed an honorable man) would actually poise the rockets at a city of millions of civilians is utterly unbelievable.The idea that Mason (Connery) would know all of the premises as well as he did, AND REMEMBER the tunnels where he spent three days "in the dark" in such detail, is also beyond belief.The actions of Hummel's cohorts in the last few scenes is also unbelievable.Well, I could continue, but in summary the film could have been much better, had it not lacked so much fundamental credibility.But all in all, worth the $.99 rental cost...</fullReview>

Director Michael Bay always gives the audience too much to digest at once like in "Armageddon" but here he gives the audience just enough. The car chase through the streets of San Francisco is one of all time best car chases it is amazing. This film also features strong performances from an A-list cast including Sean Connery, Nicolas Cage, and Ed Harris. This film shows it's humane side in the characters actions.

		<shortDescription>Who was dill enough to hand such good material to Michael Bay?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I won't say the script is perfect. Some of the dialogue clunks - that corny speech the president gives! I mean, really: `How does one weigh eighty lives against five million?' One counts. -Or my favourite (no doubt I paraphrase a little): `We can't risk letting him loose. He's an escape artist.' It's funnier than `You can't fight in here, it's the war room,' but I suspect the humour was unintentional. And however over the top the action may have been, it all seems much sillier when we're casually informed that John Mason knows all of the FBI's secrets: `The alien ship at Roswell, who really shot J.F.K. ...'; I was surprised they didn't add, `... and the truth about the Cottingley fairies.' These clunky lines eat away at the script's solid foundation like acid. It's particularly bad to watch how keen the film seems to be to undermine its two main characters, Mason and Goodspeed. Sean Connery (Mason), and to an even greater extent, Nicholas Cage (Goodspeed) are frequently called upon to drop out of character in order to deliver some tough-guy sarcastic comment; it's never worth it. The most jarring moment comes when Connery says, `Your BEST? Losers always whine about doing their best. Winners go home and hump the prom queen.' (Actually, he used a different verb; but - and I strongly disapprove of this censorship regulation - the IMDb won't permit me to reproduce it here.) Not only is this not the kind of thing Mason would say; nobody from outside the United States would ever, in any context, utter the phrase `prom queen'.But these departures from character at least show us that Mason and Goodspeed had characters to depart FROM. This is something, surely. In fact it's a good deal. The characters actually survive the corrosive process the writers have put them through. There are a lot of ideas - plot and character ideas, I mean - in `The Rock', and they're mostly rather good ideas. (Okay, ONE of the ideas is, `terrorist threatens to destroy city unless his rather silly demands are met' - an oldie, but a goodie.) The story is well built and it feels satisfying however much the fascist military sentimentalism sours the palate, however many of Michael Bay's damned music video montages we have to sit through, however the rapid cutting tends to confuse rather than enlighten us as to exactly what's going on during the action sequences. A good story triumphs - at least to some degree - over poor execution.NB: Not once but twice a character sticks a syringe into his own heart. I find this kind of thing MUCH more disturbing to watch than most of the things people complain about seeing in the cinema; I suspect I'm not alone, and I feel it's my duty to warn others. Notwithstanding this, or anything else I've said, it's an enjoyable movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Rock is a fast-paced powerhouse of an actionthriller!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Rock is a perfect actionthriller. It has three brilliant actors: Sean Connery, Nicolas Cage and Ed Harris. Some war-veterans under the command of general Hummel(Harris) steal some rockets containing VX-gas. One of these rockets are able to kill 70000 people, and the soldiers occupy Alcatraz alias "The Rock", and they take 60 tourists hostage. The terrorist want to launch their rockets if their demands aren`t met. Mason(Connery) is a prisoner, who has vital knowledge about Alcatraz, and how to get in there, because he is the only man who has been able to escape from the Rock. Goodspeed(Cage) is an FBI-agent, who is really good with chemestry, and it is his mission to disarm the rockets. However, the team which is sent in to take out the veterans is soon wiped out in a bloody shoot-out with the veterans. Only Mason and Goodspeed survived this slaughter. The Rock has interesting characters, and spectacular actionscenes. The extra ice in the cake is the magical soundtrack composed by Hans Zimmer, which creates a perfect atmosphere. Buy or rent it now!! 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From my favorite action director, Michael Bay, comes my favorite action movie. Ed Harris, Sean Connery, Nicolas Cage, and Michael Biehn make up this movie's excellent cast and all give great performances. Not only does this movie have top-notch acting and directing, but the musical score rocks. I loved the music during the Cage/Connery chase scene. The SEAL slaughter scene also had great music. I thought the plot was a little far-fetched, however. Don't get me wrong, it was a -good- plot.. just not very believable. I high recommend this movie not only to action fans, but just about any movie fan out there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great cast makes this cool action-flick exceptional.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is easily one of the most satisfying action flick of all time. The plot was decent, action was intense (it's got one of the most memorable car chase scene), and the music is one of the coolest ever. But the real reason why I give this movie a perfect score of 10 is its wonderful cast.The rather far-fetched motive of General Hummel was so well rendered with conviction by Ed Harris that the audience won't care that it's the lamest excuse anyone has ever come up with to hold a whole city hostage to a deadly chemical weapon. I mean, the cause itself is noble, but threatening to kill millions with the VX gas?? Even for a bluff, it was pretty lame. But did I care? Ed Harris is so overflowing with authority and charisma that I might follow his orders even without the promise of million bucks pay.And the chemistry between Nick Cage and Sean Connery is magical; you just gotta love the dialogue between the two. All the one-liners and witty comebacks that could sound extremely cheesy by lesser actors are delivered to perfection. And that little remark about John Mason (Sean Connery) being trained by the best -- the British Intelligence -- brought back the memories of James Bond. Gotta love it.Even the supporting cast was wonderful at their roles. The mercenary marines were especially cool in their crazed bloodlust. And Commander Anderson, played by Michael Biehn, was simply amazing. I mean, there wasn't a single lame actor who took me out of my suspended disbelief.It ain't a movie that'll make you cry or think or whatever. This is a pure entertainment movie. A great action movie cooked to perfection. Action flicks don't get much better than this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good action movie with a great performance by Ed Harris</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Rock was a sometimes overdone action movie which was nonetheless well made and superbly acted. Connery, as the only man ever to escape, is in fine form here. Cage provides a humanizing portrait of a reluctant action hero. He's excellent, but for his best work in an action movie, check out Face/Off (with a much more complex set of characters). The standout here is Harris' outstanding performance as the conflicted General. Harris gives Hummel a passionate conviction that he is doing the right thing, combined with a genuine desire to resolve things peacefully (witness the confrontation with the Seals where he tries desperately to save his enemies' lives). Because Harris is so good in the role, the movie's ending is a letdown as it shortchanges the fascinating character he has created.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting "OCCULT Background" behind THE ROCK</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, I should correct what was said in a previous comment : Stanley Goodspeed (N.Cage) was a an agent of F.B.I. not C.I.A.Second and most important thing :Many people know that the FBI was directed (before "James Womack"!) by a curious and famous figure: John Edgard HOOVER.Of course, many books tried to describe his life, especially his fantastic-VERY LONG-Director-Career (from 1920's until his "death" in 1970's !).Many of those books maintained that he was the "Real Master of Puppets" behind the "presidents" of USA (maybe one refused, and his tragic and enigmatic 'End' could have been answered by Goodspeed-in the french version:"Cherie! Tu veux savoir qui a tue KENNEDY!?").Also, it was known that JOHN E.Hoover was a member of FREEMASONRY,Scottish-Rite (Sure that this "word" is very STRANGE for many of our "compatriots"... however they should ask about its meaning!); the member of this Institution (or Secret Society??) is called a "mason" .... Mason ?! Is it not the same like JOHN MASON ?! (who was Scottish!)So Now I can ask you :"Hey, Darlings! Do you know What Was OCCULT Behind the "ROCK" !?!"Maybe the answer will be in "ROCK2" .... Who knows ?!?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rock On!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw The Rock when I rented itjust after it had come out on video, cos there was nothing else to watch on TV. I thought it was really cool at the time. It was on TV a few days back, and cos I hadn't seen it for such a long time, I'd almost totally forgotten what it was like. Seeing it again, I was reminded of what a great action film this is. Nicholas Cages' Stanley Goodspeed is a very refreshing action hero, because unlike most macho heros, he is actually terrifed of going into combat, and finds himself crying at the sight of a dead soilder. His character is totally belivable, moving and funny at the same time. Nic Cage is a great actor, and as for Sean Connery, well, he's fab too, but after all, what else can he be? The two of them have chemistry and it's great to watch how their relationship develops. Ed Harris and Micheal Biehn, who I both think are undderated, are brilliant in their roles too. It's action packed, funny and exciting, a brilliant film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Rock is a first class action experience, that keeps you in suspense through out the entire movie.The Plot: General Frank X Hummel(Ed Harris), and a bunch of marines breaks in at a top secret chemical weapons storage facility, to steal the extremely lethal VX-Gas. He now takes over "the Rock" or Alcatraz island, and threatens to launch the VX-gas against the San Francisco bay area.The goverment sends out a Seal Team along with Stanly Godspeed(Nicloas Cage) &amp; John Mason(Sean Connery). Now 80000 lives depend on a "lab-rat" and an ex-con to find and defuse the rockets loaded with the VX.This movie delivers it all: action, thrills, kills, humor and the brilliant actors. Ed Harris who plays General Hummel, acts so beliveble, that you almost takes his side.Rarely seen such a classic: 9?/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great story. Another contribution to the "corrupt government covering its corruption" theme (vis-a-vis Outbreak).Ed Harris is awesome. His character for me is the most complex. He is a true sympathetic not-so-bad bad guy (like Gene Hackman in Crimson Tide AND Extreme Measures; they make you not only understand, but almost to root for them...almost. Harris here is about the closest).Connery is standard excellent. Cage gets on my nerves with his whining voice. I can think of several other actors who could have played this role without getting on my nerves. But, anyways...I love when movies like The Rock make us question our assumptions; when they challenge us to reconsider ethical dilemmas, what is right or wrong in life.Plenty of action. Very significant scene when the soldiers squared off.I'd love some more development of why Hummel's team fell apart as it did. I study social psychology and could write a paper on why, but the movie didn't supply enough info to make it plain enough (or, it did but I must have missed it).One shortcoming -- we never saw the hostages again after they were first locked up during the tour. They were referred to in the presidential soliloquy (which I hated; the portrayal of the president in this film was critical to the dilemma value in the movie; contrast this presidential portrayal with what we see in Air Force One, or, better yet, Independence Day) but we never see them again; how can we feel for them? (Perhaps this was what made it so easy for the prez to make the decision he made, above and beyond the fact that to admit wrong was politically out of the question).Loved it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie rocks. (no pun intended)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you haven't seen this movie, run to your local video rental place and pick up a copy right now! The Rock is hands down one of the best action movies of this decade.The situation: A Disgruntled General from the marines, Francis X Hummel (played by Ed Harris) takes over Alcatraz Island and takes 81 tourists hostage.Sean Connery plays a 60-year-old convict, John Mason, the only man who has ever escaped from The Rock. He reluctantly agrees to lead a Navy Seal team into Alcatraz.Nicolas Cage plays the nerdy but brilliant Dr. Stanley Goodspeed, a chemical weapons specialist for the FBI, a man whose daily life mostly consists of sitting around his desk wasting time. He is assigned to accompany the Navy Seals to the rock, to defuse 15 Guided VX Gas Rockets.This movie not only gives beautiful action sequences, but delivers genious character relationships and drama. Stanley makes a steady transition from being a wimpy nerd to being a "tough guy." Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage's scenes of back and forth dialogue are gold.The other thing that makes this movie great is, it's a movie about Alcatraz, yet the producers still found a way to incorporate a spectacular chase scene, including a HumVee a Ferrari, and several cop cars!Did I mention that the movie is produced by the 2 best names in hollywood? Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer are in the commander's seats, making sure this movie didn't stray from excellence.I give it 10 our of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the smartest action films made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Rock" stands out as one of the best action films made. A film that not only contains the big explosions and quick shootouts, it's faithful to it's storyline. The plot follows marine Frank Hummell, a fed up general angry at the government for ignoring the covert operations he was in that claimed the lives of his men. Frank, along with his faithful group of marines steal 16 rockets from the government. These rockets contain a very deadly toxin that could wipe out humans in mere seconds by literally disintegrating them. Teaming up with a group of ex-marines intent on getting back in the action, they seize Alcatraz, make the tourists hostages, and threaten to launch the rockets at San Francisco. A worried group of military officials and FBI men enlist the help of an uptight FBI chemist named Stanley Goodspeed and an incarcerated British spy named John Mason who has been behind government bars for years with a knowledge of Alcatraz (a former inmate/3 time escapee). The two embark with an FBI crew that is later wiped out leaving the two of them to stop the general and his band of marines. "The Rock" manages to deliver the goods with spectacular car chases (an intense daylight car chase through the hills of San Francisco that results in utter mayhem and destruction with a wham bam finale) to excellent performances by the cast, Ed Harris as the disgruntled general, Sean Connery as the wise and wisecracking spy, and Nicolas Cage as the seriously uptight chemist. Other notable performances include David Morse, Michael Biehn, William Forsythe, Tony Todd, John Spencer, and Gregory Sporleder. One of Jerry Bruckheimer's best films. I seriously recommend "The Rock" to anyone looking for a hard core action movie. Incredible action sequences are a major plus in this excellently crafted film.</fullReview>

Sean Connery got the biggest part of the glory in the movie, as he usually does, and I'm left yet again wondering why everyone is so crazy about this guy.

Be assured, the reactions in tries to evoke are both base banal.A condescending chuckle here -- yep those haristylists sure are gay!

That is: if you're an action movie, then ACT like an action movie, without complexes or pretentions. Not so with The Rock! It pretends to be more intelligent than typical action movies. They try to make the Bad Guy Good(trying to avoid one-dimensional characters?). The injected humour (trying to put things into perspective?) seems totally out of place at times, which makes it difficult to care about what's going on.This one doesn't even reach the ankles of Die Hard....</fullReview>

Michael Biehn(navy seals) and William Forsythe also appear as the guys trying to stop Harris and his terrorists which includes Tony Todd(candyman).The story is great-Harris is an ex soldier who feels that the widows of soldiers that died in Vietnam and The Gulf were lied to so he captures The Alcatraz Prison(now a tourist attraction) and demands recognition for the soldiers and, of course, money, or he will destroy San Francisco.All the leads give grand performances and the characters are, for a change, three dimensional.

And with Jerry Bruckheimer as the producer I knew it would be like taking a ride on a roller coaster. And it was. If you spend your money on a Bruckheimer production it is of no importance who the director is. They are all made from the same formula. And that is not such a bad idea when you look at the guy's track record.And with this track record in mind I have to say that this is one of, if not the, best Bruckheimer production I have ever seen. In total I counted two sequences I could have been without. That is very descent for this kind of movie.It is not an all-round classic. But it is an action classic.</fullReview>

He is a an army officer who is dissolusioned with the military because of the way it has treated soldiers under his command. The only real "bad guys" in this movie are the governmental bureaucrats who have essentially, lied to all of the principle characters in some way or another and a few soldiers who are essentially, mercenaries. Nicholas Cage and Sean Connery are excellent as the team who is chosen to go to "the rock" and disable the nuclear weapons the the renegade soldiers have pointed at San Fransisco.All in all, this movie is as exciting as films get.</fullReview>

Movies with loads of varying characters, exciting action scenes, many different locations, cool settings with loads of possibilities, interesting villains, lots of yelling, one-liners that make you crack up, wickedly cool music, a bit of sex, car chases, helicopters, two-way mirrors, stand-offs, mutinies, hostages, rockets, love, VX gas, revenge, cigars and a bomb disguised as a baby.THE ROCK has it all. Not only do you get two very different heroes for the price of one, there is also one of the most fascinating bad guys I have ever seen in Ed Harris. His intentions are not evil or greedy or sadistic or pleasure-seeking like most other film villains but instead, General Hummel merely wants to honour the memory of his forgotten comrades who were killed under his command in Vietnam. As we are shown in the pre-title sequence, he has tried again and again to get the government to take back the lies told about their deaths to their families and give them compensation. So, General Hummel is not an evil man. His intentions are justified. However, what he does next is not so wise. By taking 81 tourists hostage on Alcatraz Island and threatening to launch poison gas into San Francisco Bay unless reparations are paid, he does not make too many friends. But the real nasties are his awful henchmen who would like nothing better than to launch the gas and so kill millions of innocent civilians. One of the best things about this movie is Ed Harris' performance as the troubled General who battles with his conscience. He is well-balanced by Gregory Sporleder and Tony Todd as the two evil captains who are the real bad guys of the story.So, as well as villains, as I mentioned above, we also have two heroes. They are Nicolas Cage, as the intelligent but weedy Stanley Goodspeed and Sean Connery as the highly dangerous 60-year old convict John Patrick Mason who somehow find themselves in The Rock with the task of stopping the rockets from being launched in time. Connery and Cage make a superbly funny double act who always seem to be arguing and taking the p**s out of each other while depending on the other's skill in a certain field. Goodspeed's is diffusing the rockets, Mason's is killing the bad guys.The set up is nicely rounded off with a brilliantly watchable array of supporting characters. Angry FBI director Womack, cool agent Paxton, strict Commander Anderson, loyal Major Baxter and Goodspeed's beautiful girlfriend, Carla.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Top Notch Action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terrific. This has got to be my favorite action movie of all time. Director Michael Bay has out-done himself, and it shows. From beginning to end, the movie is filled with non-stop entertainment. This is definitely Cage's most likeable role (his new stuff is just crap), and Harris/Connery both do wonderful jobs playing their parts. Although far fetched, the plot is easy to understand and makes for lots of action. The car chase and end scene (shootout/bombing) are two memorable scenes in my opinion and alone make the movie worth watching more than once. But the best part about this movie has got to be the MUSIC!!!!! This movie's score is the best action score to date. Although I expected alot coming from 3 very talented composers, I was overwhelmed. We get more then 10 excellent cues (not joking!) and they all fit their scenes perfectly. Anyways, if you have not seen this movie, go do so! You will not be disappointed. 10/10P.S. - What's with Cage and Marcil having sex with their underwear on?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Action Movie of the 90s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Bay is quickly establishing himself as a director of some standing in the Summer blockbuster market. The Rock is his second feature, the first being the hugely enjoyable if not particularly intellectual Bad Boys. He has since also gone onto direct the similarly enjoyable if completely brain dead Armageddon. The Rock however, is light years ahead of either of those two films. Not only is the action fantastic but unusually for this type of film, the characterisation is well explored and to some extent believable. I'm a great fan of all the main actors, Nick Cage, Sean Connery, Michael Beihn and particularly Ed Harris who is on great form here. Harris is the villain we can identify with and to extents feel sympathy for. He is an honourable man who firmly believes what he is doing is right. The real villains here are the politicians. Alcatraz makes for a wonderful setting and the sets are atmospheric while keeping that claustrophobic feeling.With the Rock, Michael Bay can stand comfortably alongside that other master of the Summer blockbuster, Barry Sonnenfeld.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm getting sick of all this needless complaining about how "The Rock" is just another action movie. I'm sorry, [] one and all, but I must step outside my usual neutral stance to one of sheer defiance--"The Rock" is anything but another action movie. For starters, it gained TONS of critical praise, not only for the edge-of-your-seat action sequences, but also for its unique slant on the characters-- from Nicholas Cage's believable turn as a computer geek to Sean Connery's hard-edged view of life (I did love that "f--k the prom queen" line, by the way) to Ed Harris' amazing performance as the tortured villain, General Hummell. If you want to complain about a generic action movie, go see something like one of the Rambo sequels, or maybe some undeniable crap like Iron Eagle.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie really rocked me. It has thrilling fast-paced action and music really is great (I got the sound track shortly after) though people in my country are abusing it in all sorts of commercials and programs.This movie details a bunch of navy seals lead by General Hummel (Ed Harris) that take control over Alcatraz, otherwise known as The Rock, so they can force the US government to pay benefits to all the families of the soldiers who died in the wars. Now it's up to another team of navy seals lead by ex-con and the only one to escape Alcatraz, Jhon Mason (Sean Connry) and the "Chemical super-freak" Dr. Stanley Goodspeed (Nicolas Cage) to stop them. So the team gets in (quite marvelously) and all hell breaks loose when everyone in the team is killed except Mason and Goodspeed, so now they have to resolve the situation on their own.I have a classification for all sorts of media that I call "Cosmic Meaning", where something impacts me on many levels. This one didn't got in very high but it surely got in. It's a great action movie and if I am not mistaken it's Cage's first action flick, and he does a great job, I tell you.Sean Connry does great as a prisoner who needs to get them into The Rock and so does Nicolas Cage considering this is his first action role. I recommend this movie to all action freaks, they'll love it, but not only them, I'm sure this will turn any action-hater to The Dark SideT.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sean Connery is one of those men (like Ricardo Montalban) who ages like a fine brandy. For his presence alone I'd forgive a lot. But fortunately, there's not a lot to forgive. The Rock is an action pic -- plausability in retrospect isn't the issue. It just takes you along for the ride, and with one of the sexiest guides ever to grace the screen. (This may explain why women seem to like The Rock more than men do.)Nicholas Cage is endearing as a bungling geek-type who should have been issued a new pocket protector instead of a sidearm. His perpetually stunned facial expression fits the character.The Rock isn't War and Peace, but it's great entertainment. Enjoy.</fullReview>

The action sequences are ABSOLUTELY SPECTACULAR, you have to see it for yourself to believe it. Schwarzmann´s camera and Smith´s music make this piece even better. If you want to see the #1 action movie, your choice must be The Rock. If you want to see two EXCELLENT action movies, go for The Rock and Face/Off (another "Nic-powered" masterpiece).

		<shortDescription>Very entertaining, but the action scenes are disapointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a huge Con Air fan, I was looking forward to The Rock. And I was pretty disappointed. I was expecting something very similar to that movie, with the added bonus of Sean Connery and Ed Harris. The result is less of an action film than an action-heavy thriller. Cage is superb, as always; hilarious yet believable and he makes some great lines up as he goes along. Ed Harris is excellent as a very human villain, and his heavies make some very nasty opponents for the good guys. However, Sean Connery doesn't even have a character. Perhaps the director wanted him to use his natural charm, but....at first we see Connery in jail, and we are supposed to be in awe and afraid of him. After he is released, he is an extremely nice guy doesn't even really mind being stuck in Alcatraz will a bunch of blood-thirsty soldiers on his trail. Luckily, the chemistry between him and Cage works, and they make a cool team.The other problem is the action scenes, which are much hyped but shot in Joel Schumacher style - meaning extremely fast cuts and extreme close-ups so you can't actually see what the hell is going on. This only really works in the car chase scene, and even that is not really very exiting.Overall, The Rock is very entertaining but it's no way near as good as Con Air.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the best acting on behalf of Sean, great stuff from Nicolas too. Although a little exaggerated (a US general deserting?!) the story holds you tight in front of the TV. The common way of mocking the FBI and the US defense authorities is nothing new, but presenting Alcatraz is spectacular. Dialogs are great, (maybe not as good as in True Lies for ex, but it worth listening :) ) specially when between the 2 main characters. To enforce the action on Mason and Godspeed, the script slaughters a whole SEAL squad, which I consider highly unnecessary and violent, but suppose the writer just couldn't find any other way to do it... Puting it all together, it is a great movie, everything adds up correctly, nothing too much, nothing missing. You better book a place in a movie close by ASAP... :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is absolutely my favorite movie, from my favorite director Michael Bay, starring some of my favorite actors. Sean Connery gives a unique performance reminiscent to his Oscar-winning role in Brian De Palma's "The Untouchables." He plays John Mason (Another in a long line of action-movie "Johns"), the only man ever to escape from Alcatraz. He's grouchy, and he curses a lot. Nicholas Cage plays a role in which he improvised many of his lines, such as "Okay, that's just about the most awful thing I've ever seen," and, "This ISn't HAPpenNING!" He plays Stan Goodspeed, a music-loving chemical weapons specialist who just found out that his girlfriend is pregnant. He is enlisted by the FBI to disable the chemical rounds in a number of guided rockets that terrorists are using on Alcatraz. Ed Harris, also in one of his best roles, plays Gen. Frank Hummel, a justice-seeking military commander who has stolen the guided rockets to use unless the Pentagon pays him 100 million dollars. He won't keep the money for himself, mind you, but distribute it to the families of the soldiers who have served under him. This is a unique villain role, because it's hard to declare him as the villain. The scenes are well choreographed, including a spectacular car chase sequence between Connery and everyone else. Since Connery and Cage are both driving expensive cars, every crash is a tragedy. Nicholas Cage delivers a great performance as a regular guy in a series of dangerous situations. It really helps you to imagine what it would be like if YOU were there. This movie has everything you could ask for. A great cast, interesting characters, edge-of-your-seat action scenes, heart-pounding suspense, everything. Michael Bay's best movie yet.</fullReview>

The action is real edge-of-the-seat stuff, but it doesn't do to think too deeply about the credibility of it all. I've never been totally convinced that Goodspeed/Cage really needs to remove the nerve gas capsules from each of the missiles in order to disable their guidance systems, and even though I didn't tour the subterranean parts of Alcatraz when I made my own visit to The Rock, I'm sure I would not have found an Indiana Jones/goldmine-style railroad in the caverns. And just exactly what is that fire-breathing entrance that Mason/Connery crawls through? Enough quibbles, sit back and enjoy the action, the music, and the best car chase since Bullitt. Actually, it's probably even better than that, apart from the one weak sfx of the whole movie, when the cable car is blown into the air. Oops, another quibble.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On the surface, "The Rock" seems like one of those formula action movies with the big budget($80 million), big stars (Connery, Cage, Harris), big explosions (I only counted 2), and big fun (you have to admit it was entertaining). In actuality, I believe "The Rock" to be a new kind of action film. It has bad guys who want to do good and a good guy who used to be bad. During the film, I was unsure who to root for.Michael Bay (Hollywood's soon-to-be most sought after action director) has crafted a truly incredible piece of action filmmaking. His use of the moving camera and the close-up are perfectly choregraphed in such away that his footage is an editor's dream. From Bay's previous experience with music video, he has attained the knowledge and foresight necessary in creating a very busy film that works. Cut after cut soar by so seamlessly as you watch the film that you don't realize the incredible planning put into each individual shot. His film is so visual, so full of imagery that you feel the patriotism of the "bad guys", you feel the intensity of the action, the emotion of the conflict.You absolutely love what you see, you love what you feel, and you leave the theatre knowing you enjoyed yourself. A film needs to pull you in to be fully successful. With the collaborative efforts of the entire crew you are able to feel the film working. "The Rock", with its face-paced musical score, its machine-gun editing, its tight story and its devoted and amazingly talented director, is the most thoroughly entertaining and well developed film of 1996.</fullReview>

Jerry Bruckheimer and Don Simpson have produced some of the best films in movie history, and when they join forces with the director Micheal Bay it can´t go wrong. The soundtrack is the best of all of my 21 year old life, beacuse that it fits like a glove on the hand. There is not one song like other great movies that make it good, but the whole CD.

		<shortDescription>The best movie I have ever seen!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite the fact that I have seen "The Rock" approximately 40 times, I still love this movie every time I see it. This movie has everything, a lot of action, great acting, good special effects, and a great plot. Nicolas Cage did a wonderful job playing the dorky scientist who ends up being the cool scientist in the end. Sean Connery made a great come back as the repentant prisoner who realized the right thing to do. And, Ed Harris, the wrongful, renegade marine who realizes the right thing to do after it's too late. Overall I would give "The Rock" a 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

Everything from the plotline to the character choices were awesome, as the script makes this event almost believable - something rarely obtained in action movies. The cinematography performed by Mike Bay is outstanding, and some of the shots leave you saying "that was cool." Hanz Zimmer and his crew provide much of the heart thumping music, which is in itself a feat. all in all, this movie was incredibly enjoyable, and mixed together the right amount of action, seriousness, comedy, and even a little romance...******* out of ***** stars - not too shabby!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sean Connery and Nicholas Cage team up for one of the most brilliant and explosive action movies of all- time! you It was accompanied by a stand out performance by Creep Show alumni Ed Harris. Now many would feel that all action movies have an unmotivated "bad guy" this film however showed true to life "villain." Harris is holding SF and most of the East coast for ransom. Why? Because he feels that America has forgotten the dead war heroes families. Sean Connery was put into the Alcatraz because he was the only one who ever escaped the Rock. An elite team lead by Michael Bien, The Terminator and Tombstone, to save 50 hostages and take out Ed Harris and his henchmen. Cage was put on the task force to dismantle 4 bombs pointed at the East coast. The movie was suspenseful, daring, humorous, and witty. Again a four star performance to Ed Harris in one of the most memorable villains. if that is what you call him, of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Rock is a great film, with non-stop action from the hilly streets of San Fransisco to the twisting tunnels and cellhouses of Alcatraz. The story itself was no less superb; Francis Xavier Hummel (Ed Harris), a renegade general, fed up with the lies and treatment that the government has been giving to its people and its soldiers, recruits some of his best men to help him rob a naval weapons depot. Having been ignored on several occasions by his government, he steals 15 rockets armed with a tremendously destructive material(VX gas) in order to get their attention. Hummel indeed gets the government's attention as they receive a ransom demand from his makeshift base on the rock: a large amount of money to compensate for the lives of the soldiers that he claims were abandoned by their government, or he deploys the rockets and incinerates the whole of the San Fransisco bay area. The government then calls on an unlikely superhero, Stanley Goodspeed (Nicholas Cage), a frail FBI field agent who's speciality just happens to be chemical weaponry. John Mason (Sean Connery), supposedly the only man who has ever escaped from Alcatraz, is also recruited to help navigate through the tunnels he knows so well. The characters are all very well developed, with fascinating sub-plots to each of them. Whether its Stanley and his pregnant wife waiting for his questionable return from the dangerous mission, or Mason and his long lost daughter, or Hummel and his valiant fight for justice, the characters alone make this movie worth watching over and over again.P.S.- In addition to this gem of a movie, the soundtrack is also excellent.</fullReview>

Their leader, a former highly-decorated U. S. general, demands $100 million to be paid in ransom, as restitution to families of soldiers who died in covert operations and were thereby denied compensation. Otherwise, he is threatening to launch 15 rockets carrying deadly VX nerve gas into the San Francisco Bay area. An elite SEAL team, with support from an FBI chemical warfare expert (Stanley Goodspeed) and a former Alcatraz escapee (John Mason), is assembled to penetrate the terrorists' defenses on Alcatraz and neutralize the rocket threat before time runs out.Michael Bay, the director has done three film and they are all produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and they all ROCK</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm sick to death of action movies with chase scenes, big guns, weapons of mass destruction, and huge bodycounts. But this movie has all of those things. So why did I enjoy it so much? Because the director Michael Bay managed to take all those elements that make up an action movie and polish them to a gleaming shine.When I watch this movie, I get a sense of excitement that is rarely found in movies today. There are lots of movies out there with just as much, if not more action than 'The Rock'. But for some reason, 'The Rock' is by far more exciting and entertaining than all those other action flicks. And the villain is great. He's bad but not too bad. I hate it when I see a villain who so evil, that you almost know what his next move is going to be. If you know what he's gonna do, where's the suspense?I also like Sean Connery and Nicholas Cage as a team. They make an interesting combo. We have a nerd who specializes in chemicals who is a major wuss and then in the end is a hero, and then we have a hardass who is also a genius who gets a little soft by the end. They could fight crime!!It also has its funny moments. Every movie needs a funny moment. If it doesn't, the movie will get boring, because there is no break from the violence and action. A movie sometimes needs a little humor to break the ice.In the end, this movie is near the top of my list. It has a serious plotline and is very exciting during the action scenes, but is also a lot of fun when things calm down. It's one of my favourites. We'll probably never see a movie with as much excitement ever again. Oh well. Looks like it's back to old family vacation videos.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best action movie in a long time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is definitely one of the best action movies of all time. True, I am a bit biased because Sean Connery is my favorite actor. I thought Nick Cage played a wonderful innocent little bio-chemist who always works in a little couped up room with his chemistry set. So when he is actually put into a violent confrontation, you truly believe he is terrified. One of the best scenes is when Nick was forced to shoot and kill one of the mercenaries in order to save Mason (Connery) from being killed. The excellent blend of slow motion and music during this scene leaves the viewer excited, yet almost startled at the same time because this is the first time Cage has ever harmed anyone! A sensational piece of filming. Truly worthy of all the praise in the world, and it's funny too!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Greatest Action films of all time.......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was the mid-1990's and that decade plus the 1980's were perhaps the only times when films had action plus real characters and a real story to go along with it. When it became the 2000's the action genre got dumbed down into 80-90 minute shoot 'em up's and things were never the same.But at least we have multiple films to remember the era when action/thriller films were at their prime, and The Rock is a perfect example to define that.Nowadays, people always criticize Michael Bay for making unwatchable garbage (Pearl Harbor, Armageddon)....but this is before he screwed himself up big time, although 2007's "Transformers" wasn't that bad either....but anyway, everything about The Rock is so freaking cool and likable. The casting of Nicolas Cage and Sean Connery couldn't have been any better. Nicolas Cage has usually been getting a lot of flak for being a "performer" rather than an "actor" meaning he's always been acting goofy and over-the-top. But it's that exact reason why it works so well, 'cause his character is basically a chemical weapons geek, and that's what the stereotypical nerd is like. For example, "''I just wanna find some *rockets*!''".....Cage puts in some perfect facial expressions and mannerisms in here.Connery is great and believable as the tough former British spy and frequently verbally abuses Goodspeed (Cage) during their mission on the island. And that makes some pretty good tension which is a great thing to add in a movie along with the action. Also, Ed Harris is great as the moral General who sees using a major threat as being necessary to avenge the forgotten memories of his own former soldiers, and who knows? You might find yourself to feel sympathy for him.SPOILERS- The car chase scene in this one might remind a lot of viewers of the one in "Bullitt" 'cause of all the ups and downs.....but since it's the 90's it's a lot more enjoyable. And the action also has some emotion to go along with it, such as the bathroom scene when all the Navy SEALS get slaughtered with all the slow motion and soft music...and the part when the President of the United States gives a heartfelt speech to himself before ordering the attack on the island.I've enjoyed this movie a lot and I'm sure you will too. Right now, I have it on DVD and I consider it a staple in my action film collection. Watch it and be forever amazed.....</fullReview>

OK, sorry big names and the potential for a Where Eagles Dare-style chain of set pieces really does offer something for the popcorn-muncher.This is a mess though. The problems come fairly early with a San Fransciscan chase sequence so obviously greenscreened it could have been done as a college project. I could have sworn that bits of Bullitt are used as backdrop - whatever their provenance though it's certainly a film that, lacking any self-generating interest, pilfers other films for ideas, asides and even lines. The final showdown on Alcatraz is reasonably handled but really, in the up and down career of Michael Bay this is pretty dreadful. 3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saved by some imaginative casting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Renegade Marine Corps General Francis X Hummel and a troop of former marines seize control of Alcatraz Island and threaten to attack San Francisco with chemical weapons unless their demands are met. They are also holding hostage a party of tourists, so the authorities are reluctant to order the Air Force to bomb the island. Instead, a crack unit of Navy SEALs is ordered to retake the island, but they are ambushed by the marines, and all but two of the party are killed in a firefight. It is down to the two survivors, Stanley Goodspeed and John Mason, to try and save the situation.The above plot could have been the basis for a very dull shoot-anything-that-moves film starring somebody like Steven Segal as Goodspeed and Jean-Claude van Damme as Mason. It is saved, however, by some imaginative casting. I have never regarded Nicolas Cage, with his lanky figure and long, lugubrious-looking face, as one of the cinema's most natural action heroes. The casting directors of films such as "Windtalkers" and "National Treasure" obviously disagree with me, but the casting director of "The Rock" presumably agrees. Cage seems to have been cast here precisely because Goodspeed is an unlikely hero.He is only on the team because he is the FBI's leading scientific expert on chemical weapons, and has spent his whole career in the laboratory, having never had a chance to practise the very rusty combat skills he learnt many years ago at the FBI academy.Mason is an equally unlikely saviour. Although he is a former member of the British SAS, he is now sixty years old and has spent more than thirty years in prison after being arrested in possession of American intelligence secrets. He has, however, never been convicted of any crime, but has been detained for the whole of that time without trial. The reason for his detention is not so much to punish him for his espionage activities but rather to prevent him from revealing what he knows about the CIA's most embarrassing secrets, including the truth about the UFO landings in Roswell and about the Kennedy assassination. He is on the team because he is the only man to break out of Alcatraz (he was recaptured soon afterwards) and therefore presumably knows how to break back in: he has been promised a presidential pardon in exchange for his cooperation.Mason is played by the original James Bond himself, Sean Connery. Connery was happy to be rid of the role of 007 after "Diamonds are Forever", but he later had second thoughts because he returned to it in "Never Say Never Again", and has continued to play Bond-like characters in action films. His most recent film, "The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen", was one such example, and "The Rock" is another. Like the Bond films, it combines action with tongue-in-cheek humour, especially during the car chase sequence. (Ever since films like "Bullitt" and "Magnum Force" in the early seventies, car chases seem to be obligatory in action films set in San Francisco).One thing I asked myself while watching the film was why the villains were all ex-Marines. Their cause- the payment of increased pensions to the widows of special forces troops killed on covert operations- is the sort of thing that might inspire retired Generals to write angry letters to the press. It would not normally provoke them to attack a major city with nerve gas. Would it not have been better if the villains had been terrorists of one ideological persuasion or another? There are, I think, two answers to this question. This first is that the scriptwriters probably found it implausible that a gang of terrorists could wipe out an elite force of Navy SEALs; a squad of Marines would stand a better chance. The second, and more important, reason is that the film has some sympathy with Hummel's cause, if not with his methods of pursuing it. It falls within that tradition of films- other examples include the Rambo series and "Clear and Present Danger"- which portray America's armed forces as decent and honourable but their masters, both politicians and Pentagon officials, as anything but. Mason, for example, only takes part in the mission very reluctantly, as he mistrusts (with good cause) the sincerity of the officials who have promised him a pardon.Insofar as a blackmailer threatening to unleash nerve gas on a city can be sympathetic, therefore, Hummel is a sympathetic figure. He is not some cartoonish Bond villain like Goldfinger or Blofeld, but a much-decorated war hero who cares deeply about the brave men under his command, who is full of righteous anger about the shabby way they have been treated by the authorities, and who has been driven to extreme measures by those authorities' refusal to see reason. It is therefore a role which calls for a sensitive, nuanced portrayal and gets one from Ed Harris, an actor who can often lift an otherwise ordinary film above the mundane.There are a number of plot holes; how, for example, did Mason find out the truth about the Kennedy assassination when he was in prison at the time it was committed. And if he posed such a threat why did the authorities send him to a public prison like Alcatraz instead of somewhere much more secret? Or simply kill him? Nevertheless, this is an enjoyable, well-paced action adventure with some good acting and lightened by the occasional touch of humour. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Full tilt but no surprises</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Incredibly formulaic thriller from the director of the equally contrived, though not as interesting, "Bad Boys". "The Rock" manages to borrow from many other films of this genre, and though Jonathan Hensleigh's script has taken a slightly different tack - with an obsessive, determined mercenary who isn't all we believe him to be, and a new, hi-tech deadly weapon - the pic really offers little in the way of freshness and originality.Having said all that, director Michael Bay and his cast do manage to entertain us throughout the movie thanks to some well staged action sequences, great cinematography and special effects, as well as some sprightly thesping. Our director has made the most of the many explosive scenes, and the cast do well, involving the audience in the goings on.Nicholas Cage is likable as the every man come saviour of the world. Sean Connery isn't asked to stretch his talents a great deal, but one can never help but enjoy his presence. Backing these two up is a solid support cast including the little seen Michael Biehn ("Terminator" and "Aliens"), the ever strong Ed Harris ("Apollo 13") and William Forsythe."The Rock" comes recommended to those who enjoy full tilt, adrenalin pumping action without too many surprises.Saturday, September 7, 1996 - Knox District Centre</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the best movie, i've even seen. Great director, great actors and great story. This is the only movie, where the support acting is equal to the main one. Michael Bay is my favourite director and this is the movie, that showed me that he is a genius. The way the camera moves in his movies is unique. Every scene of this movie is nifty. The beginning of "The Rock" takes my breath away every time I watch it. After that I see only great acting and great directing. This movie has even some funny moments, which raise more its quality.Similar movies are "Con Air" and "Face Off", but "The Rock" is better than them, because they don't have Machael Bay as a director. He is the best action director. The rest of his movies ( "Bad Boys 1&amp;2", "Armageddon", "Pearl Harbor", "The Island" and the newest one "Transformers" ) prove that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nicholas Cage is not my idea of a great actor, and I am not a fan of this type of movie -- heck, I don't even know what it would be called, action thriller? That said, I found this movie entertaining. Perhaps that is because I don't watch this type of movie, so I am not going to see it as a collection of clichés, as one commentator remarked.The key, of course, was Sean Connery. There is wonderful irony in learning he is one of the great British secret agents, yet has been a prisoner for decades. It is almost like learning Superman is still alive, but squirreled away in Guantanamo.More precisely, Connery's character is reminiscent of Patrick McGoohan's The Prisoner. If only the series could be revived with Connery in the lead! At any rate, I am a great fan of Connery, as an actor. Cage, he needs to be in the right role, and this fits him fine. The two together have an interesting chemistry.So it is watchable, even if you don't watch this type of movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I mean, come on. This is the kind of bubble gum pop-rock entertainment with gratuitous violence every single mainstream viewer is waiting for. Big deal if you only watch independent movies. This flick was properly made and genuinely exciting.Adrenaline-pumping, interesting, and just genuinely solid, this movie has great sound effects, visual effects, proper acting, a decent story and bedazzling camera use.Michael Bay has kind of made a whole lot of bad movies after this perfectly entertaining work. Armageddon, Pearl Harbor, the Island, face it, it was crap. And now he is going to make a Transformers movie. But a PG-rated, teen-orientated version for god's sake. Come on Mike, we know you can do decent stuff!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, the premise is just a little wacky. Nickolas Cage, with the assistance of Sean Connery are going to bust into Alcatraz to stop some crazy general from destroying civilization. Well, that's a little exaggerated, but that's the basic idea. The General (Ed Harris) has some nasty stuff that only Cage can neutralize, but he needs Connery's assistance to get into Alcatraz to do the job. Connery is some British spy that once escaped from Alcatraz and is locked up in a secret prison because he has information on our government, including who killed Kennedy. That would have been very helpful to Oliver Stone in the making of JFK.The premise is wild, but Cage and Connery are rocking and the supporting cast is a beauty, including the ever-lovely Claire Forlani and the ever-evil John Spenser. Enjoy.</fullReview>

Yet, there are very few that come even remotely close to The Rock. The expert acting, directing, and screening make this movie a 10.0 in my book without any doubt! Sean Connery gives an amazing performance and so does Nicholas Cage! I don't want to spoil the movie for you, but whether you like action, drama, romance, or any other major category... trust me, you'll enjoy this movie.

		<fullReview>Dear Readers,I am a Michael Bay fan. The only better director than him is Sir Ridley Scott. Arguably Bay's best film is Pearl Harbor. His second best is The Rock, an amazing action thriller with Sir Sean Connery, Nicholas Cage, and Ed Harris. The movie blasts you with breath-taking action scenes, some of which are the best ever made. Mixed into it is incredibly tense drama and priceless humor.Enraged at the fact that US Soldiers who have been killed on secret missions that the World didn't know about would not receive military honors and burials, General Frank X. Hummel and a team of vicious Navy SEALS capture rockets containing V.X. gas, a brutally demonically acidic gas that eats away at your flesh and literally tears you apart. Setting up base on the most impregnable island in the United States, the Alcatraz Penitentiary Compound, Hummel demands that the families of the fallen soldiers receive A million dollars each as well as money for his men under his command at Alcatraz. Only two men can stop Hummel: A brilliant Chemist named Stanley Goodspeed and the most lethal convict and spy alive: John Mason. The two form an uneasy alliance and lead a team of SEALS into the lower systems of Alcatraz only to be violently ambushed. Now only Goodspeed and Mason are still alive and have to deactivate the rockets and eliminate Hummel, whose true goal begins to unfold.The Rock rocks, there's no other way of saying it. It's an action fans dream and is great for fans of James Bond. Literally since James Bond himself is the main character. That's right. Sean Connery is BACK!!! Sean Connery plays John Mason, the world's greatest escape artist and one of Britain's best spies. For stealing FBI Secrets he was incarcerated with no name on Alcatraz Island. He escaped, however, and now he is needed to lead a team of soldiers back into The Rock. Helping him is Stanley Goodspeed, a brilliant chemist with the FBI. Goodspeed is played well by the cool Nicholas Cage though at times he's a little strange. Ed Harris's performance is almost as good as Connery's as the grim-faced and determined General Hummel. Harris's ice-cold performance will have you uttering cheers and boos at the same time for this brilliant villain.Signed, The Constant DVD Collector</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An awesome action movie about two men on a mission to save a city from destruction.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is my favorite movie of ALL TIME. For guys and gals that like a good action, thats laced with humor this is the movie for you. Its a powerful, emotional, original, awesome action movie. It has three well known actors who play eccentric characters very well. Unlike other actions, it doesn't really have many OBVIOUS mistakes or plot holes. And its not one of those movies thats all about people shooting people (although there is a lot of that :P). It has a good storyline and for those that aren't that fussed on car chases (i know my mother isn't), there is really only one in the movie. Its got the most powerful feel to it which is conveyed through highly emotional music that will send ya ears to another world!It has an intense climax and a small twist at the end as well. Now i may be making a bit more of a deal than i should about this but i don't care. I LOVE THIS MOVIE. I Don't CARE WHAT ANYONE SAYS. If you absolutely hate actions then maybe this movie isn't for you but otherwise its THE BEST action classic for a long time. WATCH IT. Don't SAY MAYBE. SAY YES. $4 at the video shop ain't that much is it?</fullReview>

Also Sean Connery played great and Nicholas Cage also. My favorite part on this movie is the arguments of Gen. Hammel and Maj. Anderson. I love the lines. You can feel the intensity and the principles they believed. And also i like the explosive scene such as the capturing Humvee's in the road scene.

		<fullReview>I love this movie- great nasty action, cool characters and exciting pacing. I recommend it. But I just wanted to point out a couple of quotes that seem strangely portentous in a movie from 1996.1) The President in the movie, in his one monologue, says that "we are at war with terror," which is why he won't negotiate with the ex-marine hostage takers.2) One of the bad guys tells Ed Harris "you're either with us or against us" when they start to differ in opinion about whether to hit innocent people with poison gas. 3) One of the pilots in the plane which bombs Alcatraz at the end of the movie is Jim Caviezel (totally unrecognizable here in aviators). For anyone who may not know, Jim Caviezel played Jesus Christ in "The Passion of the Christ." This answers the classic question: what would Jesus bomb? The answer: San Francisco, of course.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie defines the words 'ACTION PACKED' and 'HIGH OCTANE'. Fast moving, explosions and amazing camera angles, makes this movie a must see. I saw it when it was released in '96 and loved it. Saw it again after almost 10 yrs and still has the same impact. As for the acting goes, Nicolas Cage is pretty good, and Sean Connery, well, he's a thespian, so he's always the good. The last scene, where Cage puts on the flares and three jet fighters fly above him , is personally my favorite scene. As for the soundtrack, the background music is excellent and grips you in your seat for this nail-biting thriller. Deserves to be in the top 250 movies of all time and in the Top 50 Action movie genre of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A highly decorated General steals a bunch of rockets carrying VX-gas and takes the city of San Fransisco hostage when barricading himself and his mercenaries on Alcatraz, aiming the rockets at the city. It's all up to an ex-con that haven't seen daylight in 30 years and a scientist who's never done field-work to stop him.The Rock has a rather strong story compared to many other action movies. You really need to pay attention. The characters are great. There are really no bad-guy. You have sympathy for all of them and you get to know them as they develop through out the movie. The Rock has a couple of plots. The main goal is to put an end to the situation, but there is also Goodspeed's personal sub-plot. There are nice chemistry and interaction between the characters and the dialog is good. The movie has everything you want, drama, action, suspense and humor and it's all put together very nicely.The cast is quite a line up of stars with grand old man Sean Connery in the lead with Nicholas Cage. They fit their characters perfectly and work very well together. Their performance is great. The rest of the cast is nothing less. John Spencer does a good character of Womack and Ed Harris joins humanity and military roughness as General Hummel. All in all this is a pretty strong cast that works well together.The cinematography is great. It captures the variation in the mood very well, from a romantic love scene to an action filled car chase. It all looks great. The composition and lightening is good and it's Bay so expect nothing less than great, smooth camera moves. The editing, especially the car chase is quite nice. It's intense.This movie would be nothing without the tense, action filled score. With a nice rogue military feel to it and a recognizable theme that you'll be humming the rest of the day. It's an adrenaline booster that bring out the action and really gets you going.As for the effects they're good. They don't over do it and avoid the biggest clichés.All in all The Rock must be said to be one of the best action film. It's tense, thrilling and filled with action. Even if you know what'll happen you can watch it over and over and still get a kick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely, one of the greatest action movies ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This in my opinion is the second best action movie ever made, number one being John Woo's "Face/Off". This film has everything I look for when going to the movies. It has a good story, interesting characters (excellently portrayed by Cage, Connery, and Harris), superb action sequences, and great comedy. This is textbook Bruickheimer movie, and Michael Bay's best film (and probably the only one film of his to actually get good reviews). Premise is simple a revered war hero (Harris) decides to get revenge on the US government for their poor treatment of his soldiers who died in the Gulf, by holding hostage hundreds of tourists at the legendary Alcatraz (The Rock) prison, along the VX gas rockets, that have devastating effects. FBI recruit their top chemical weapons specialist Goodsped (Cage) to help defuse the rockets. They also seek the help of Mason (Connery), a prisoned spy who knows all the government's dirty secrets. Mason is chosen because he is the only one who has escaped the rock alive, and they need him to get into the prison. A must see for all action lovers!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Connery and Cage make this pretty good action movie into an excellent one.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, Connery and Cage have a chemistry and acting ability to make this movie that probably would have been just okay with other actors turn into a really fun action movie. Cage is a guy who is an expert at deactivating weapons, especially chemical ones, and Connery is a man who is locked up for life, but once escaped the infamous Alcatraz prison. What brings them together, former military men led by Ed Harris have taken hostages on the island prison of Alcatraz and they are threatening to launch chemical weapons into the heart of San Francisco if their demands are not met. What ensues is pure action as we have car chases through the streets of San Fran, we have special forces slipping into the prison, and we have many gun fights between forces. Still though Connery and Cage stand above everyone else and really make this movie rise a notch or two above what it would have been without them as they add some humorous dialog into the film. If I had a complaint it would be that the Ed Harris character does not make a very good bad guy as you almost feel sympathetic to him. However, plenty of the other soldiers in his charge are more typical bad guys for you to pull against. All in all a fun action ride that has one of my favorite actors in it, Sean Connery.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just above average action-thriller, nothing else</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is pretty much a typical action-thriller; there are car-chases and shootouts, pretty much every major character utters at least a few one-liners or badass tough-guy lines, etc. You know how it goes. And of course, even though the two groups(Marines and SEAL, respectively) are highly trained military, they make the same mistakes that the military always does in Hollywood action films; throwing grenades with enough time to allow them to be thrown back, run in a straight line away from someone shooting at point blank range with automatic weapons(and surviving without a scratch, of course), half of the time standing in bad cover while shooting, while disregarding the enemy's great cover, etc. This is nothing new to these films, it just annoys me that films are made with so many blatant mistakes made by supposed professionals. It's a bad excuse to do this just because of the action-scenes; look at S.W.A.T.; in every way an average action film, but stays clear of all of the stupid mistakes, yet manages to produce some great action nonetheless. The humor in the film consists entirely of characters acting tough and spouting(mostly bad) one-liners and the likes. The plot is recycled from hundreds of other films like it, many of them better. They just changed the setting and played around with a few details. It has a decent pace, but nearly the entire first half was fairly uninteresting. The last half was reasonably good, but that was when the military mistakes started to appear. The acting is mostly good, and the choice of actors is definitely something the film benefits from; tough guys include Tony Todd of the Candyman series, John C. McGinley and Ed Harris, all three of them being very cool and typical tough guys. The characters are reasonably well-written, but far too many of them are just there to pose an immediate threat, be killed off later by one of our two heroes, or simply spout the infamous one-liners. The action is fairly exciting, but too much of the time, you'll find yourself being distracted and annoyed(well, I was, at least) at the huge number of unrealistic details and(yes, once again) military mistakes. All in all, just a standard, slightly above average action-thriller, and absolutely nothing else. I recommend it to fans of one of the actors, main character or minor, and fans of the genre in general. Just don't expect it to blow you away; only expect to be mildly entertained by something that there's a good chance you've seen before, possibly more well-made. 6/10</fullReview>

Ed Harris, plays a disgruntled Marine Corps Major General to a tee. Simpson and Bruckheimer have really pushed the envelope of the action/adventure genre with this collaboration.

		<fullReview>-MEDIOCRE SPOILERS-The Rock is a true classic because it is so well written for a modern action movie. The characters, the plot and the battles are all at the best they could be. I did have a small problem with the ending. The film's writers made up a 'truth' to a real-life historical conspiracy but the truth is never fully revealed in the movie. The hero(Sean Connery) and the villain(Ed Harris) are told about very deeply. The story reveals tragic events of there pasts that made them into very interesting characters. The story itself is a lot better than the average "kill the terrorists, save the hostages" scenario. The movie has a lot of surprising turns, such as the villain turning good and saving innocent people from being killed by his own men, and then his own men kill him because of that. The action sequences are fairly well planed and executed such as one of the most exciting car chases I've ever seen ripping through San Francisco, followed by an explosive assault on Alcatraz island. The majority of audiences will probably agree that this was the best action movie of 1996. I rate this movie ****/****.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Slam-bang high-tech action-thriller stuff. Ed Harris, as a much-decorated combat commander of legendary status, deploys a hand-picked squadron of elite renegade Marines to take over Alcatraz. He holds hostage not only a civilian tour group, but the entire city of San Fran, at which he's aimed 15 tactical missiles armed with the nastiest nerve gas in the universe. His goal? To get the US government to acknowledge, with posthumous honors and compensation to family members, about 100 men lost -- and unacknowledged -- in covert operations ranging from Vietnam to Desert Storm.Here come the Feds: they send in a team of SEALs led by Michael Biehn (in a reprise, basically, of his role in "Aliens"). Their ringers: Nicolas Cage, in a rather John Cusackish performance as a lab-wonk toxic-weapons expert, hilariously short of combat experience; and Sean Connery, as a long-held secret prisoner of the US, a Brit agent who has all the dirt on the FBI. He knows all the secrets from Roswell (!) to the JFK assassination, and he's the only man ever to escape from Alcatraz. The scripter's inclusion of the presence in San Fran of people who are near and dear to both these characters is more than a little contrived. It has MOTIVATION written all over it in the case of Connery's character, and UP THE ANTE in the case of Cage's. But what the hell: this isn't drama, but melodrama, essentially an hyperbolic mismatched-buddy-cop movie, and the pace, the action, and the stars' charisma are equal to it. An enjoyable cliffhanger, if wildly improbable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I bought this movie after having it highly recommended by several friends. I did not know what to expect. Their opinions of movies tend to differ alot to mine but they were well on for this one. I have to say when i thought about it before i watched it i was under the impression that the action would not be that good as its set in a prison. How wrong i was! The fact is that this movie has now become my favourite action movie to date. It has everything from non-stop action to terrific characters, a terrific story, terrific actors and some very funny lines. This has to be my favourite movie by Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer to date although i haven't seen Bad Boys 2 yet but i rather doubt i will change my mind. The action is amazing with memorable scenes being a terrific car chase, some brilliant shoot-outs at the prison and some great fight sequences and explosions. Sean Connery and Nicolas cage make a great team and both characters are likeable along with the bad guy Ed Harris as he is not evil, but a guy with a good motive and he is also not a guy who just wants money for him and his guys. Michael Bay should be directing more action movies than disaster movies like Armeageddon and Pearl harbour as they have great action but are overlong and lack a good story and good characters. This movie and Bad Boys were good as they contained great characters and great action which i think he can do best. In conclusion I have to say a huge thank you to Jonathan Hensleigh ( Die hard 3 and Armeageddon) for writing this movie. He is completely uncredited and very few people know he re-wrote the whole script for this movie but i think he did an outstanding job and should have been credited for his hard work on the script and his contribution to action movies. His over ones which he re-wrote include Con Air and Gone in 60 seconds which he was credited for but not as a writer. I feel so sorry for him though and i cannot wait till his next movie "The Punisher" comes out. Don't worry Jonathan I will support you all the way! e-mail me if you like! You are the best action movie writer in the business!</fullReview>

He and Goodspeed must stop Hummels evil regime before its too lateI thought the cast of this movie were Great William Forsyte Vanessa Marcil as Goodspeed's Girlfriend Tony "Candyman Todd" as one of the marines that turns on hummel David Morse as Hummels second man in charge and Michael Bhein as Navy seal Anderson who tries to bring down hummel but suffers a fatal deathSome of the action scene in this movie were straight out incredible especially the Hummer and Ferrari scene Ive watches Michael Bay direct some great movie but this one tops them all I give this movie a 10 out of 10 for well casted well directed great storyline and great action scenes</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most intelligent action movie I've ever seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first time have read about this movie, I thought that it's smashing. But I was wrong. It's the best action movie ever made, and it's got the most intelligent plot.Look at Stanley Goodspeed, simply man, who is called into lethal action. He's worried about his fiancee, Carla and their unborn child. He's scared, he cries and he is NORMAL human, not rambo.Then look at John Patrick Mason, who is bitterness and determinated. He's born kille, he want to get out of island, but all the time, he thinks about his doughter, Jade Angelou, which he saw only one time and who is "the only evidence that I exist".And at last, look at my favourite charakter, general Hummel (Ed, I love you!). He isn't bad charakter, he's former war hero, who's soldiers was betrayed by their own government. He lost his wife and best friends, who were forgotten. I think, he was real patriot.Another characters like, mj. Baxter, Womack and com. Anderson are also magnificent.That movie is just awesome..</fullReview>

From the Navy Seals, The Marines, and even the patriotic sad theme that comes on from time to time, it gives the movie so much more. The music is the best in the end scene with the planes though. It is so powerful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me say this to begin with- I decided that The Rock was my favorite movie even before I had finished watching it. With a well arranged plot, and an original set of characters, this movie contains everything a good action movie should. Sure, the plot was excellent, but that's not what saves it from being typical. It's the characters. This movie is more about the characters than it is about the action, unlike most recent action films. They all have their own motivations for what they do, even the bad guy. They should seriously re-release this movie. It's meant to be watched on the big screen. So, if you haven't seen this masterpiece, GO RENT IT NOW! I promise you, you're going to love it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE ROCK Aspect ratio: 2.39:1Sound format: Dolby DigitalA grizzled convict (Sean Connery) - the only man who ever escaped from Alcatraz - is chosen to spearhead a military operation against a disaffected Marine general (Ed Harris) who has seized the former island-prison with a group of like-minded soldiers and is threatening to destroy San Francisco with a series of chemical weapons if the US government fails to restore benefits to the families of undercover operatives killed in the line of duty.The last of the collaborations between über-producers Jerry Bruckheimer and Don Simpson (the latter died during production) and the second film in an ongoing partnership between Bruckheimer and director Michael Bay (the first was BAD BOYS in 1995), whose 'style' emerged fully-formed under the producer's expert tutelage and corresponded entirely with the older man's cinematic ethos: Make it big, fast and furious, and when in doubt, blow something up! David Weisberg's screenplay (co-written with Douglas Cook and Mark Rosner) rings the changes on an old formula by giving the chief 'villain' an altruistic reason for his behaviour, which renders proceedings all the more compelling when Connery's team (including Michael Biehn, William Forsythe and Danny Nucci) arrives to throw a spanner in the works. Nicolas Cage plays an unlikely biochemist employed by Connery to help defuse the missiles, and whose lack of combat experience leaves him at the mercy of Harris' increasingly volatile subordinates (David Morse, Bokeem Woodbine and a clearly psychotic Tony Todd), though Cage's terrified Everyman character quickly learns how to kick butt with the best of 'em. Slick, sleek, brainless and bold, the movie rarely pauses for breath throughout, and is hugely entertaining from start to finish. Bay and Bruckheimer consolidated this film's massive commercial success with a string of crowd-pleasing potboilers, including "Armageddon" (1998), PEARL HARBOR (2001) and BAD BOYS II (2003).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie for the action lover.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie could be one of the greatest action movies ever. The Rock clashed Nicolas Cage and Sean Connery together. Now we all know that each actor is on of the funniest yet most adventurous actors ever. I think that if you see it, you will love it. I don't think that this is a must see for the entire family, due to some language and content. In order to like this movie, you must enjoy gassing of innocent people trying to be stopped, Navy SEALS stopping bad guys, and Military personnel that go bad. Once again, this movie is not for the entire family. Sometimes an odd sense of comedy is tied in with this movie, but not much. Also, if you enjoy special effects, this is an awesome movie for you. Overall, I would rate this movie a 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Micheal Bay seems to be really hated on this site. He is dis-acclaimed for choppy editing, shallow characters, and mindless plot holes. But all in all, as far as mindless action fare goes, Bay's The Rock is brilliant, within the confines of the genre. It's almost as if Bay is restraining himself here. Or maybe it's because Nic Cage and Sean Connery play it wildly over-the-top, but in a fun way. Or maybe it's all those, plus great action, a suspenseful plot, and some fun characters. It's also very funny and filled with good chemistry between it's stars. While it isn't well acclaimed, I'll be honest: I loved this movie for the fact that it's brilliant fun with no point and it KNOWS it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>swinging back and forth between silly action and serious plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I read through all this former comments then I see a lot of hip, hip hooray on all the manly behavior and the heroic stuff from the soldiers and how more or less realistic it was. I don't want to go into this part too much as I just find it way overrated. All in all is this movie an entertaining action flick. But the movie gets definitely saved from the good actors and not the action scenes that were sometimes just quite ridiculous. The writer of this action scenes and the script writer for them should better write silly stories like Indiana Jones as many were as unrealistic as those of the Indy movies.Some of the car scenes tried a bit too hard to be cool that they appeared instead silly and ruined the serious mood of the story (e.g. the cable car which was flying like the Bus from Speed like someone placed a huge charge under it.). Another quite silly thing was the whole Dungeon&amp;Dragons like construction, which was supposed to be under Alcatraz. That reminded me from the first moment more of Temple of Doom of the Indy series and again was quite contra productive for the serious plot.Amazing how much activity in form of active leaking gas pipes (or whatever those flamethrowers were) and moving machinery there was under a building complex, which is supposed to be out of order. An old, complex maze combined with a bunch of booby traps from Ed's man had became that part of the movie much better as this extreme cheap excuse for the ex-con Connery to be back in that prison.That all gave sometimes the impression like the director didn't know if he wanted to make a tense thriller or just a fast paced action flick with A-Team or Indy qualities. Maybe the writers for the excellent plot and the action scenes should have talked more with each other.Personally I had preferred less silly action scenes and action sets and the movie had reached easily much better qualities like "Crimson Tide".But the actors really save the day in many ways as they are much more believable as the described scenes. And the best of the movie is still Hans Zimmer's soundtrack which produces more atmosphere for the whole plot as the action scenes are, except the so often described shower room scene which was good. No wonder that this soundtrack was VERY often used for later trailers for all kinds of movies.Without the described silly action scenes above would I give the movie maybe a 7 or 8 out of 10. But so the silly scenes cost something and reduce the movie to an action flick, which is barely above the average as it does swing too often between lighthearted and serious atmosphere. So I say 5.5 out of 10. That plot idea deserved a better action scriptwriter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a waste of acting talent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a mixture of toxic weapons disaster movie, a mutineering soldiers fighting for a noble cause movie, a conspiracy theory movie, a hostage movie and a James Bond taking on the bad guys movie. It looks as if the writers just jiggled it all up, mixed in as many catchy one-liners they could think of, and called in the SFX people for some pyrotechnics and car-chases.The result is a bumbling film that jerks along with no real focus. The script is contrived to the point of absurdity. Perhaps my suspension of disbelief is not as strong as it could be - but the film lacked the "style" and continuity that makes this possible.Some of the action scenes are good (particularly the shower-room face-off), and Sean Connery does his best with the lines he is given. Nicolas Cage (who I greatly admire) is mis-cast and fails to make much of the awful one-liner "funny" replies he is meant to deliver. Ed Harris is solid but sometimes wooden in his portrayal of an Army General, but then again maybe Army Generals are a supposed to be a little stiff.In summary I was very disappointed with what could have been a decent film, had the writers penned a tighter script with less pandering the mass-market. Too many cheap jokes, pathetic plot twists and no real tension.Not recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good work by leads can't save this "crock"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The late critic Jay Scott, from The Globe and Mail, once wondered whether directors Adrian Lyne and Ridley Scott were in fact the same person, given their too-similar-for-comfort styles. I'd like to pose a similar scenario; that producers Jerry Bruckheimer and Joel Silver are in fact, one and the same person; they both wear beards, and with a few exceptions(ENEMY OF THE STATE and THE REF for the former, THE HUDSUCKER PROXY and THE MATRIX for the latter), they both make obnoxiously loud and dumb action movies. What's worse, they get some talented people to work for them, and then crush them under the weight. Sometimes, the actors are able to make it work(Eddie Murphy in BEVERLY HILLS COP for the former, Bruce Willis, Bonnie Bedelia, and Alan Rickman in DIE HARD for the latter), but mostly not.THE ROCK is the latest example from Silver...excuse me, Bruckheimer. It's about average. Again, the only distinction is good work by the three leads. Connery probably deserves the most praise, because he's saddled with lines like the "prom queen" one, and still comes off looking good. But for crying out loud, he co-produced this crap! Cage claims to have taken this so his career wouldn't take a nose dive after LEAVING LAS VEGAS, and he does a good job in the role, but I'm tired of all the excuses actors use to appear in these monstrosities. Here's a new one; WHY DON'T YOU READ THE F***ING SCRIPT!!! Yes, what can be good in the script stage can still be screwed up, but if you're not obligated(by your contract or a friend), and you don't need the money, YOU SHOULDN'T DO THIS CRAP!!! Sorry. Anyway, Harris, to be fair, has a more dimensional role than normal for these movies, and he does it well. His scene with Michael Biehn(also good) is one of the film's high points. Also, there's an admittedly tense scene on the "rock." But mostly, this follows the MO of Bruckheimer/Silver; Thou shalt bludgeon thy audience rather than entertain them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>TIme to grow-up, Mr. Bay</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I make movies for 15-year-old boys? What a crime!" -Michael Bay You know what, Mike? I was 15 when I saw this movie back in the summer of 1996 and I wasn't too impressed, so maybe you ought to take back that ludicrous comment. As a matter of fact I went to see it twice (June and July 1996), just to make sure my judgement was honest and correct.Since debuting with Bad Boys in 1995, Bay has averaged about one movie every two years. But I think that it's quite sad and pathetic that in 16 years and nine movies he has not matured as a filmmaker in the slightest. If anything he's regressed.The Rock has characters with just a touch more depth than we're used to in Bay films. It's not necessarily a big story but he seems to stretch it out over two hours with heinously over-cut action scenes and extraneous sub-plotting.General Francis Xavier Hummel (Ed Harris) takes over Alcatraz with some poisonous gas rockets and aims them at San Francisco with the intention of vaporising everyone unless the families of each member of his dead team is paid $1,000,000. A nerdy and heavily bored FBI agent, named Stanley Goodspeed (Nicolas Cage), is called to San Francisco from Washington to observe and instruct the inevitable SEAL operation to overthrow the Marines on Alcatraz. But wait, there's more. Alcatraz is a maze of twisted metal and broken walls. They won't stand a chance without someone who has knowledge of how to break out. Or break in.And so enters the philosophizing and lanky-haired John Patrick Mason (Sean Connery) at about 45 minutes into the movie. He's been in jail for 30 years and doesn't appear to be annoyed at having to work for the very people who have held him without trial for so long. There is an utterly pointless and indulgent car chase before he actually gets down to business.Once on the island, the SEALS, as predicted, are crap and get killed instantly. So, basically, Hummel wants to honor his fallen comrades by killing more American soldiers. How absurd, but not much in this film makes sense. Plus these SEALS have thoroughly extensive training and, in real life, there is NO WAY they'd end up being so useless.Goodspeed and Mason are not a great pairing. I don't know what the deal is with Nic Cage, when he's good he's great, but more often than not he's so unbelievably awful I wonder how he manages to get work. Goodspeed isn't very appealing. He's annoying, not funny, and little of his dialogue sounds natural coming from his mouth. When he tries to be tough, he just seems ridiculous. Mason is just an old James Bond. Hell, he's even a British Secret Agent. The role was written with Connery in mind, so don't expect anything but his elite brand of OAP smart-ass cool.Coherent editing is not this movie's strength. In fact, coherence is hardly something one would associate with The Rock. There are so many distractions and superfluous plot points that the only way Bay can compensate is to turn every scene into a epileptic blur. The target audience is familiar with this kind of film-making anyway, and it has sadly become the accepted norm for action movies.The Rock is inferior and less engaging than a similar movie that came out the month before its release. Executive Decision attempts the same theme and an identical form of tension. In 135 minutes, it wastes no time on sub-plotting, develops far more likable characters and is way more exciting.Exec Dec is played straight. The Rock is played to look cool and hip. It's not. And apart from Zimmer's entertaining score, there's not much to recommend. This rock could have skipped along the surface, but merely sinks to the bottom under its over-written, over-wrought, over-directed weight.Oh, and if Mason is supposed to have a major beef with Womack then perhaps they should have cast someone older than John Spencer who would have been 19/20-years-old when his character first crossed Mason.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't like Michael Bay. He's a terrible director, with his sexism, racism, ugly visuals, mechanical storytelling and scripts which could have been written by 5 year olds. So it's embarrassing for me to admit I like this movie, but I do. It's only a 3 star movie (It's very fun but it's not desperately good in many areas) but I was looking for flaws throughout and I couldn't find that many. It's some ludicrous plot about terrorists taking over Alcatraz and planning to use chemical weapons on San Francisco. Nicolas Cage (before he became a joke) and Sean Connery team up and try to stop them. This film knows its purpose: It wants to entertain and do nothing else. With that, it succeeds. Cynical film goers may hate it, but the film is an insane adrenaline rush with some crazy dialogue, huge shootouts, a lot of big explosions and there's even a random car chase thrown in there. It's hard not to feel exhilarated, and Nicolas Cage and Sean Connery have a lot of chemistry.However, as you can expect, Michael Bay's direction is less than stellar, and the film isn't very tense and I consider tension to be the most important part of an action movie. The plot is stupid, and the villain is flat. However, it's an action film so what do you expect? This is a fun, well made although slightly overpraised movie with Michael Bay for once being given a good script to work with and it's the perfect antidote to the Transformers films and Bay's many other cinematic abominations. It's a movie which knows what it wants to be and what it should be, and for action junkies it is pretty much a guaranteed good time. The bottom line: Expect loads of fun. Don't expect anything else!6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A remarkable action film on an epic scale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Rock is one of those "today they don't make movies like this anymore" movies. A gem from 90's mainstream cinema. The Rock is also Michael Bay's best film by far to date, in my opinion. Bad Boys was a solid action film. Armageddon was almost a disaster for me except for the emotion and a few scenes, despite the cast was strong and the visual effects were jaw dropping I enjoyed Pearl Harbor, but in comparison with "Tora Tora Tora", it was mediocre. It was grand on a massive scale, but humdrum in most parts. Bad Boys 2 was better than the first as an action flick, but it wasn't great or remarkable though. As for The Island, it was Michael Bay's the second best for me. It was solid, good story, good action, no Michael Bay extravaganza etc. As for Transformers movies, other than the first installment which was pretty fine and again solid entertainment and breathtaking special effects, the sequels were overblown, uneven, big, noisy, overdone and so on! However, The Rock is a great, stylish, classy and subtle action film. It is almost an epic who can give you goosebumps. Also the movie has an amazing soundtrack. The action is spectacular here. The direction is subtle and stylish. It has an original, very gripping story and the best Alcatraz film ever to date (better than the classic "Escape from Alcatraz") Sean Connery is great as always, but also Nicolas Cage does an amazing job here. In those years, Nicolas Cage wasn't an action star, as I remember, his first debut as an action star was Snake Eyes, then The Rock. He is more subtle in The Rock. Ed Harris, what can I say? He rocks! Also we see "Candyman" in the movie as one of the henchmen of the villain. The car chase sequence is one of the bests ever! Honestly, I prefer this one over all the action scenes in Transformers movies. Militarism here is handled very well. Bythe way, the film never tries to be politically correct which is good. The moments within the aircraft scene is maybe the best in the movie and now it becomes an iconic moment in Michael Bay cinema. And I will never forget those green balls!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Rock is one of the best action films of the 90's. I was surprised that I never heard of it until recently being the movie buff I am and with the big name director, composer, producer, and actors. I think Michael Bay is a pretty good director despite what everyone else says.This is about a ruthless general who captures the Alcatraz prison and is bent on taking San Francisco hostage unless he's paid the money he wants because he feels the American government did not recognize his fallen soldiers.The acting is very good here. Sean Connery still has some great action moves in his old age. Nic Cage is a great actor despite what everyone else said. Of course, I loved Ed Harris. He is one of the best.Unlike most action movies, this movie has great character development. The plot has been seen before but the creators brought the plot to a whole new level. The score by Hans Zimmer is a magnificent piece.Overall, this is an excellent action movie. I wanna see more of these action films. I rate this film 10/10.</fullReview>

Often we find this? lumbering yet majestic beast? devoured, picked apart by the savage predator, all that remains left? for scavengers of? little intelligence to enjoy. Ironically the voracious critic is? unable to digest the Action Movie, often tearing it apart? simply for the fun of it. Confused by the? vivid colours and? often loud displays of prowess performed by this? simple creature? the critic reacts with hostility? Don't get me wrong, I don't think that spending 20 million dollars on petrol and a box of matches is good enough, an action movie needs some kind of plot and some level of acting, but on the other hand a well crafted action movie is just as hard to make as some kind of art-house flick about lesbian Jews in the Nazi party. Much like movies are viewed with a great deal of snobbery by certain people, so are action movies viewed with a great deal of snobbery by certain critics. In the case of The Rock, those critics need to shut up.When General Hummel (Ed Harris) decides to hold San Francisco hostage by bringing 15 rockets containing the very nasty VX gas to Alcatraz, it falls down to science-wiz Stanley Goodspeed (Nicolas Cage), ex-SAS officer John Mason (Sean Connery) and a handful of soon-to-be-killed Navy Seals to go there and deal with the threat. Neither Stanley or Mason want to go to Alcatraz but one is the only man who the government trust to be able to disarm the rockets containing the nasty poison, the other is the only man ever to escape from Alcatraz. I'll leave you to work out which is which. It seems that Mason has spent the last 30 years of his life in prison because in the 60s he stole a lot of very secret information about the U.S. government. He's a dangerous man. Hummel, by the way, isn't doing this for the money. He has taken this drastic course of action because he is tired of the way the U.S. military and the U.S. government conduct themselves. I think we can all empathise. However honourable his intentions may be, he did unfortunately choose The Candyman as one of his henchmen, so we know it's going to come to no good. After many seriously gruesome deaths, the fate of the world is saved, Goodspeed and Mason gain a respect for one another and we leave, picking the popcorn from between our teeth.This is a Don Simpson/ Jerry Bruckheimer action movie. We know that the good guys are going to win. We know that the bad guys are all going to die. We know that a car will explode/ overturn at the slightest provocation, unless driven by the hero. What we don't know is how well the action is going to be pulled off or if the plot and acting will carry us from one set piece to the next. My friends, The Rock delivers. It has a thoughtful villain, someone who is trying to right an injustice. The two heroes are not your typical action movie characters, one is a chemist who is more at home at the office rather than the shooting range, the other a pensioner. In fact let me dwell upon Cage and Connery for a moment here. Cage seems to me to be one of the finest leading men in Hollywood. He is highly versatile, good looking and not afraid to make himself look silly. Anyone prepared to sit in a pair of swimming trunks to play the guitar in a scene deserves your respect. As for Connery well? in The Rock the former Mr. Universe contestant still looks pretty big. Lets be frank here, he's basically playing a version of James Bond who has grown old, he even uses a Bond response when Goodspeed tells him his name. ("But of course you are".) Ed Harris is fantastic, giving Hummel just the right level of intensity and sheer righteous indignation. The supporting cast also seem to know exactly what is expected of them, doing their jobs of getting beaten up by the heroes or standing around looking concerned by the bad guys with great aplomb.Interestingly for an action movie the set pieces do not really stand out. I do not think that this is because they are not any good, but more because the cast are so great that when you leave you think about them more than the stunts. Yet I know I've watched an action movie, it FEELS like an action movie. The stunts are all good, the fight scenes are enjoyable and the gun battles suitably? explosive. But when you have two actors who have won Oscars and one who has been nominated four times you have to expect some distractions from the F-18s, explosions and gun-toting sociopaths. I mean that in a good way.Every now and then one of the cast will come out with some blinding lines, the kind which seem designed simply to be spliced into trailers. A few examples are: "Now Womack, you're between The Rock, and a hard case." "What's it gonna take to equip a flight of F-18s with thermite plasma within the next 36 hours?" "An act of God." And my personal favorite: "Get the Pentagon. And call the San Francisco Office. It seems Alcatraz was just reopened." Saying that The Rock is one of the best action movies made in the 90s seems like faint praise when one of it's main rivals consisted of Keanu Reeves on a fast moving bus. But it really is a good film, with all the right parts in all the right places. Shame it hasn't got a bunny too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like a heavy metal album made into a movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just before the credits roll at the finale, a brief line of text appears on screen dedicating The Rock to Don Simpson, the Producer who died before it was released. Now while he was alive, Simpson was the walking definition of all the stereotypes of Hollywood excess. He hoovered up cocaine by the bucketload, gave jobs to actresses in exchange for 'favours' and had an ego so bloated he cast himself in a role in Days Of Thunder despite having no previous acting experience, so The Rock couldn't be more of a fitting tribute. It is a loud, brash and incredibly fast paced film where everything is done to excess. The action is spectacular, the explosions enormous and the bad guys keep on finding new and more inventive ways to die, all to a pounding military soundtrack.The story is a spin on the old Die Hard formula with Nicholas Cage starring as a mild mannered FBI Chemical weapons specialist who finds himself running around on Alcatraz with John Mason (Sean Connery) the only man to ever escape the prison and facing off against a squad of disillusioned US Marines who are holding San Francisco to ransom with some deadly bio-weapons. And from this we are treated to all manner of chaos, especially as Mason isn't exactly a willing volunteer...Needless to say, the level of violence goes through the roof. It may take a while for things to really start moving but once Mason makes his initial escape attempt to visit his teenage daughter in a truly jaw-dropping car chase, the pulse speeds onwards without stopping faster than you can say "Hey, we haven't seen anyone go flying through a window in a little while." And when our heroes and their doomed Navy SEAL escorts finally make it to Alcatraz a whole string of inventive set-pieces await.What makes it work though is that underneath all the violence and macho posturing, the film has a very sly sense of humour as is readily apparent in the numerous daft lines (the brief nod to Roswell in particular is especially good) and the overwhelming bravado. After all, most people would be traumatised if they were nearly crushed in a stolen Ferrari by an exploding tram car, not Nicholas Cage. He just gets up, brushes himself off and tells a bemused onlooker "It's not mine," before punching him in the face and stealing his bike. Not to mention the fact that Cage and Connery make a great double act. Cage has long been adept at playing the bemused everyman thrust into a situation beyond his comprehension but it is Connery who shines. Those who remember him best as the suave, tuxedo clad James Bond may be surprised at the grizzled beast he plays here, as John Mason is an aggressive, foul-mouthed and really, REALLY angry man as ruthless as he is charismatic and capable of quoting Oscar Wilde while being beaten around the head without making it seem contrived.In short then a typical end to Don Simpson's reign as the king of excessive Californian mayhem. With the likes of Top Gun and Beverley Hills Cop to his name, the Producer bows out with a film that not only matches the adrenaline thrill of those classic eighties releases, but also manages to be even louder than they were. Add on a conflicted villain played by Ed Harris who is taking things way too seriously and you have yourselves a highly watchable film with 'guilty pleasure' written all over it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rented The Rock from the local video store. $2.10 for one-night rental. I didn't waste my money, but I probably should've rented something else.My major beef with this movie is the fact that Michael Bay and his editor seem to have cerebral palsy, because there is a cut after every two frames it seems. There is okay action in the movie, and I get the gist of what is actually happening, a.k.a. Nicholas Cage is chasing Sean Connery, but that's about where the line is drawn.Michael Bay is incapable of designing a shot where the camera doesn't move. I mean, I like moving camera, but not too much of it. You have to take a motion sickness pill before you watch a movie of his. Basically all of his movies are like that, so I'm not a big fan.I don't think anyone likes Michael Bay (who is about as shallow as a kitchen sink) or Jerry "I'm Incapable of Being Subtle, So I'll Blow Something Up Whenever I Can" Bruckheimer's movies. I just see no good review's on their movies.(P.S., Black Hawk Down was the best Bruckheimer movie, as was Pirates of the Caribbean, but mainly because of the director's.)</fullReview>

Ed Harris gives a great performance as the not quite but almost evil general who seizes Alcatraz Island for ransom to receive compensation for deaths of his fellow Marines in black ops missions around the world. There is a crap load of action. This cemented Cage as the actor in demand and lead to several other action movies for him. And Connery never looked better in his old age. This was one you had to see at the theaters if you didn't you missed the boat. I need to get this on DVD and I will when I find the time to do so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When you look at the plot outline, it looks like the same old "nukes stolen by military-turned-extortionist" formula that's been used in many other movies. One thing that makes "The rock" stand out, is that the motives behind the behaviour of most characters - especially the main "bad guy" - raise thoughts on very real philosophical and ethical issues. However some of the characters fall into the standard Hollywold mold of being either completely good, completely evil, or completely stupid. Probably the most remarkable asset of this movie is the very intense emotion carried by the soundtrack.One very interesting point is that the chemical weapon referred to in the film (VX nerve gas) is accurately described in most aspects compared to its real-life counterpart, as an extremely deadly and dangerous substance. The effect on its victims was only slightly exaggerated for dramatic effect, citing that VX gas causes the victim's skin to melt and liquefy.Writing this almost 10 years after "The rock" was first released, i must say that this is one of the movies that have made a notable impression in the past decade. Its outstanding soundtrack, which was composed and arranged by musical genius Hans Zimmer, is truly one of the best film soundtracks of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welcome to the Rock...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Rock is a movie where old meets new.It combines two great actors of our time, Sean Connery and Nicholas Cage. Connery was already cool as Bond, but now that he's old and angry he's even cooler. Nicholas Cage is one of those actors that you instantly feel sorry for when something bad happens to their character. I don't know why, maybe it's that face of his.Plot-wise the Rock has a nice twist near the end and over-all it is very rough but not too icky. One problem that this movie definitely has is the fact that some action-scenes were filmed a little "conservatively", such as Connery's car-chase and the part where Cage gets chased by the marines. You never get a clear idea where either of these scenes are going because they're made up of such tight close-ups and often the camera is pointing in the direction of where they're coming from rather than where they're going.Also I question the use of the soundtrack near the beginning when the marines steal the missiles as it sounded a tad too patriotic (since these are technically the bad-guys).Even with these little flaws the movie is exciting, funny and quite impressive all-around.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent, but nothing special</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since "The Rock" is a Jerry Bruckheimer movie, you pretty much know what to expect: lots of action, explosions, chases, one-liners, cheesy dialog, sentimental rubbish, and plot holes. The question is: do the good things (the action and the one-liners) outweigh the bad. In some movies like "Crimson Tide" they certainly do. In others, like "Armageddon" and "Pearl Harbor", they clearly don't. I'd say "The Rock" falls somewhere in the middle. It does some things right, some things wrong, and ends up being watchable, although not really special.First, the good things. The acting is generally above par, even though Nicolas Cage isn't very convincing. Ed Harris and Sean Connery makes up for that though. Secondly, the plot is fairly believable (for a mindless action movie that is) and even though there is again a lot of scientific nonsense, the movie doesn't cross the line into ridiculousness too much. One of the really nice touches is that the "bad guy" (Harris) is actually a fairly decent guy instead of the usual crazed maniac. The problem was that I cared more for the bad guy than for Cage's dull character or Sean Connery on autopilot. The one-liners could have used some serious work too. Oh well, at least the action is generally quite good. "The Rock" really screws up when it tries to add some depth, though. This movie would have worked as a mindless action movie, but instead (probably to please a larger audience) all kinds of romantic/family sub plots had to be added. These plots are all quite unbelievable and boring as hell. Also, the movie gets way too sentimental at times, for example in the totally unnecessary and very unbelievable scene in which an entire SWAT team gets slaughtered by the bad guys. If all the sentimental sub plots would have been dropped and the movie would have been shortened by thirty minutes, it would have been great. As it is now, it's a mildly entertaining movie with some good action and a couple of nice touches, but also with way too much sentimental scenes that don't go anywhere. ** out of **** stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, I've spent a good portion of my life in the armed forces, and I can tell you that the type of decisions about life and death begin made by Ed Harris in this movie are overglorified as hell. He leads a cast of annoying, underachieving actors who play this goofy marine outfit who has decided they want to bringjustice to the world again. True, they were portrayed as having some greatinjustice done to them in the past, but you don't try to get revenge like some Iron Curtain Communist. Nick Cage is your typical bad actor in this movie, and one has to wonder what ever convinced Sean Connery to go along for the ride onthis movie. Cage is like that shaky trigger finger I had towards the end of my military career...you kinda get used to it but you wish it would go the hell away. To add to the shame, the action is contrived and the plot is udderly rediculous. Some people say the car chase is the best they've ever seen in a movie. Hello! Have you ever gotten out of bed people? I've had more interesting car chaseson my way to the grocery store in my 85 Tempo. Then we get to the part aboutthe SEAL team. I've come to know a few elite soldiers in my life time, and none of them would be so stupid as to get caught in a shower room at a grossdisadvantage. The whole access to the island is rediculous, crawling throughtunnels of fire and mysterious moving parts that are supposed to look like they have some function in the world. This movie is a horrid depiction of soldiers. Then there's the background music. It sounds like Dean Martin crossed withreally bad John Williams. If they were alive, real composers like Brahms, Mahler, Shostakovich and Hindemith would love to line up as the firing squad to shoot rotten eggs at the people who wrote the score to this movie. You might think this is a negative review, but I actually give this movie a 9 out of 10, for the comedy factor. This is the perfect movie to kick back with a case of beer, and laugh out loud at with your best friends.</fullReview>

When I first sat down to watch this movie at the age of 12, I was satisfied with what I was seeing. After the movie ended, I place the DVD back in the box and completely forgot about it. One year later, I would re-watch it and completely fall in love with it.The Rock tells the story of a retired army general who steals a lot of deadly weapons and then sets up his own mini military base in Alcatraz (AKA. The Rock) The Government is soon aware of this and sends in a full SEALS team, along with an FBI chemist (Cage) and an ex-convict of Alcatraz who happened to work in the British Intelligence (Connery) Chessy, Check. Over the top, Check. Awesome, double check.This movie will leave you at the edge of your seat. Not only does it have some of the best Hollywood action scenes of all time, it also has one of the GREATEST action actors in the history of cinema: Michael Biehn. Yes, you heard right. I think he is the main reason why I praise this movie so much. Not only does he deliver a brilliant (as always) performance but he also says some of the best b-movie lines of all time.Besides Biehn, this movie is pure greatness. If you by are a person who enjoys nice action flicks, then you will find The Rock amazing. However, if you happen to be one of those picky "I want realistic stuff" person, then stay far far far away from this movie. You have been warnedGreat Hollywood Action movie.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The plot is laughable, with as many holes as swiss cheese, but the acting is good and the action fast paced. The basis for all of the action is an extortion threat against the government. In exchange for $100 million in payments to the families of marines who died on secret missions and thus (supposedly) were never recognized by the government, a bunch of renegade marines led by a highly decorated, capable, experienced marine general will not destroy San Francisco.Before the movie begins this renegade marine combat unit captured the former Alcatraz Island Prison, "the Rock," and has about 80 civilian tourists hostage on the island. They also brought with them surface-to-surface guided missiles and missile launchers(on the Alcatraz ferry or some other unstated means of transport). Although the US military has no weapons with lethal chemical or biological warheads, the missiles in this movie are armed with deadly mass destruction chemical warheads. The missiles apparently have aerodynamic controls, and are not ballistic missiles, because they can radically change direction in mid-flight. As such, US fighter aircraft, if deployed in time, could easily shoot them down after they were launched, but that solution is not considered in the movie. (Perhaps the chemical would be released into the city's atmosphere even if the missiles were destroyed in flight, but the possibility is not even discussed by the authorities. Nor is the option discussed of using the military's knowledge of the missiles' remote control communications to redirect the guidance systems via appropriately coded radio commands.) The major action is then about a seal team's attempt to forcibly recover and disable the missile warheads. A second action sequence is the escape of the Sean Connery character, who is a prisoner held incommunicado by the White House, and a violent chase through the hills of San Francisco with lots of crashes and fireballs.The premise of the script has major problems. In any extortion threat, both the criminal and victim lose once the threat is carried out. That is, once executed, the bad guys no longer have bargaining power. For extortion to work the victim has to believe that whatever he is afraid will happen will occur if he does not comply with the criminal's demands, AND WON'T occur if he does comply. That point is lost on the criminally insane marines commanded by the Marine General, ably played by Sam Harris, and by the inept or uncaring script writer. The bad marines want the money and think that if they launch the missiles after their deadline is up that the government will then send them $100 million, like paying a ransom AFTER learning that a kidnapped victim is dead.Another problem with the scenario is that the script fails to address how the bad guys expected to be able to have access to the $100 million even if the government agreed to give it to them. After all, they would still be on an island in the middle of San Francisco bay. The government could transfer money to accounts designated by the criminals, but the government could also then freeze those accounts or arrest anyone who tried to use the money. The plot outcome is also predictable. The character played by Nicolas Cage is obviously going to be the hero who will survive. Whether Sean Connery will also survive is not as sure, but it is easy to predict that he will not fail in his mission. Also, there is no doubt that San Francisco will not end up being destroyed. In the movie the government elects to keep the threat secret, so as to prevent panic among the citizens. The movie could have been made more interesting by having the government experts argue over notifying or not notifying the public, and, if the decision was to notify the public, whether to recommend evacuation or the alternative of staying indoors with wet blankets covering windows or other places that outside air could get in. (This was what Israel advised its citizens to do in the first Gulf War when under attack by Iraqi modified SCUD ballistic missiles.)I know crashes and explosions are expensive and dangerous to produce in a movie, but having seen many of these I find new ones rather repetitive and boring and not a reason to see a movie. I'd prefer the producers had used the money instead to get a better script.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When me and my friend sat down to watch "The Rock" we were looking forward to movie our friends praised it as. "The best action movie...ever!" was the general opinion, with only slight variations. The film started out well enough, but felt overly contrived. In terms of Mr. Connery's being questioned, you were just begging for all persons involved to stop acting, for the good of humanity. There came a point in the film where me and my friend started betting on what cliched action movie scene would come next. One rather memorable disagreement was "Dude, there is no way they could put in a car chase, it's just not that kind of movie..." Pausing to look at the screen as a Hummer launched into the air. I can appreciate a good testosterone pumped action flick, but this movie was, for lack of a MORE appropriate word, stupid. The script was lifeless, and a piece of paper was as likely to explode as anything else that did crash and burn in the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the machines rose up and annihilated humanity, in an event which would come to be known as The Great Readjustment, the robot overlords ordered the eradication of all human art and culture. Within the space two months, sweeper teams had purged all of North America of every human artifact and man-made object. The fires would burn for months.When the ashes cleared, a cyborg child would find a metallic safe buried eight feet under a mound of charred, superheated rubble. Its contents were mostly molten, unrecognisable, with the exception of one artifact: a DVD copy of Michael Bay's "The Rock", upon which a severed, cauterised hand was fused. Why this human had risked life and limb to preserve "The Rock" was unknown. What is known, however, is that this discovery would elicit the first ever retraction of an executive order in Machine History. Within a nanosecond, a clause was added to subroutine 9242439C, thereby mandating the preservation of what was once known as "The Rock".And so it came to pass that Michael Bay's "The Rock" became the universe's last ties to that which was homo sapien. Why the machines chose to preserve such an object is unknown. Perhaps they possessed some kernel of sentimentality, some desire to preserve a connection with that which came before. Or perhaps a clue lies in the archive number eventually assigned to "The Rock": 0111010001101010, binary for The Great Justification.1/10 ? Stop it Bay, you're hurting people.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Rock is one of the worst and most annoying action movies I have ever seen. The characters are completely flat. Sean Connery clearly was not really interested in the project. Still, relying on his routine he easily outplays Nicholas Cage. If you like hyper nervous action movies, duologue's restricted to shouting "Move, move, move!", don't bother about characters and wants your senses get overloaded, then this movie is for you. If you are not, then only one remarkable scene remains. Halfway the movie Sean Connery escapes to meet his daughter. Then it immediately becomes clear, that Connery is a good actor. Alas it only lasts five minutes. Because of him I reward a 2, otherwise it would have been a well-deserved 1.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Rock" is not Michael Bay's most popular film but it appears to be his most acclaimed and least hated, at least on the internet. This is one of the reasons that watching "The Rock" is such a frustrating experience. The script is slightly less dumb than Bay's other movies (except for the massively underrated "The Island"), but it's still packedwith terrible attempts at humor and a boring plot. This was, after all, written by the team that gave us "Double Jeopardy". It's not just a matter of how incredibly complicated and intricate Bay's style of film-making is that is impressive. Bay is more than just another commercial hack, and he has a rare, vast knowledge of his craft, real skill, a remarkable work ethic. That is why it is so frustrating that he does not choose to make more interesting features, ones with half-decent scripts maybe? "Armageddon" isn't as good as this, but at least it makes more sense as a Criterion inclusion. Hey, at least there's that wicked chase scene.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Rock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From director Michael Bay (Bad Boys, Transformers), I have said to myself I have seen this film many times, but I always remember I haven't, and I always love it. Basically Brigadier General Francis X. Hummel, USMC (Ed Harris) and his small army of renegade marines have stolen three warheads, filled with the deadly VX gas that instantly destroys all human internal organs, and melts the skin. Hummel threatens to fire these warheads on San Francisco, and kill the 81 hostages he has captive at Alcatraz prison, aka The Rock, unless he and his soldiers are paid a high ransom. FBI chemical/biological weapons expert Dr. Stanley Goodspeed (Nicholas Cage) is assigned to try and get into The Rock and retrieve these weapons. The only way he can do this is to get help from the only man known to have escaped the prison, top-secret federal prisoner John Patrick Mason (Sir Sean Connery). After attempting escape in a high speed chase, Mason eventually agrees to help the Goodspeed and the FBI in their mission and get inside The Rock. They successfully get inside, but Hummel and his group know they are inside, and will stop at nothing to make sure they can't get to them. It comes to a point where the FBI sees no other choice but to fire a missile on Alcatraz and San Francisco, but eventually Hummel and the other villains get what they deserve and the day is saved, with Mason being allowed to get away, and Goodspeed marrying his pregnant fiancée. Also starring John Spencer as FBI Director James Womack, David Morse as Major Tom Baxter, William Forsythe as Special Agent Ernest Paxton, The Terminator's Michael Biehn as Commander Anderson, Vanessa Marcil as Carla Pestalozzi, Scrubs' John C. McGinley as Marine Captain Hendrix, Candyman's Tony Todd as Captain Darrow, Titanic's Danny Nucci as Lieutenant Shephard, Claire Forlani as Jade Angelou and Philip Baker Hall as Chief Justice. The one moment I do always remember is the bit when Cage crashes his car, and some guy says "Dude, you just f***** up your Ferrari", and he replies "It's not mine!" Connery and Cage do well in their roles, Harris is a good villain, and the supporting cast do very well too, it is one of those action thrillers you are never going to look away from because there are so many explosive moments to get your attention, making it a brilliant film. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Sound. Nicolas Cage was number 33, and Sir Sean Connery number 8 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Connery was also number 3 on The 50 Greatest British Actors. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ed Harris is a highly decorated officer and a man with a conscience. And he's had it with the wicked ways of the armed forces. Good man with a good cause? You'll be the judge of that. He only wants $100 million bucks (to donate some 89 mill to the families of soldiers 'forgotten' by the military and some pocket money for himself and his loyal army buddies of course) or else he'll gas the people of San Francisco with VX in no time... Well in 48 hours at least.Sean Connery, man without identity. Aged man, left to rot in prison cell for stealing FBI boss Hoover's microtapes long time ago. And only man ever to successfully escape from Alcatraz, or The Rock as the former inmates call it. He's the only man familiar enough with the web of tunnels under the prison. When 'offered' a full pardon after being behind bars for three decades, it's hard to say no... And besides, it's his only choice really. They don't like him but they sure as hell need him.Nicolas Cage, FBI's chemical weapons specialist, soon-to-be-father and a beatlemaniac. A sissy lab rat... But not for long! He's the man when bombs need to be defused. And believe me some mean fire crackers are needed to be defused and fast!There's the main characters, tho I wish they would have given John C. McGinley a bigger role. Great acting nevertheless. And yes you really _can_ imagine what's going to happen and how it all ends. ;) Lots of dead bodies, wrecked cars, gun firing and explosions. Pools of blood, guts and new creative ways to die. Heheh!But altho the movie is filled with old clichés, who cares?! It's still entertainment at best! The Rock is one of those movies where you can hardly catch your breath, when someone turns on the turbo switch again. ;) Phenomenal non-stop action!A movie that you can just watch and enjoy and laugh about without giving it another thought after seeing it... _But_ there are important issues in the film if you want to start a deeper conversation. Shouldn't be too hard task to find what they are I'm sure.I recommend to all intense action lovers.</fullReview>

Its jingoistic bullshit in the extreme, and the lines they come out are cringe worthy.The actual plot is so stupid I'd need about 50 pages to go into it properly; why the hell would Ed Harris go to all the trouble of stealing VX gas when a few normal bombs planted around the city would have the same effect(for blackmail anyway)? Why the hell would they set up on a ISLAND, letting everyone know where they are, so escape would be nigh on impossible? Its SO dumb, that it makes the film unwatchable. I could go on but wont.The only redeeming factor in the whole thing is seeing Cage stab himself in the heart, if only the film ended there. Utter, utter sh*te.</fullReview>

They don't interact, they merely display their own idiosyncrasies with no reference to anyone else. It really is that bad.Like most American films involving the military, there is virtually no indication of any professionalism at all. People lose tempers, shout, go ballistic for no reason and play the maverick which is either the true state of the American military or the Hollywood take.While Sean Connery is competent here, Nicholas Cage is most deservedly not. Perhaps in an attempt to keep up with Connery's professionalism as an actor, Cage shouts all the time and overacts terribly in every scene the two share. The result is Cage looks like an amateur.Don't bother to watch this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Takes the fun out of movie watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Rock" suffers most from bad writing. The script is just bad. It relies on special effects, action, and emotions from characters who the writers feel are superior to the viewer. They take all the fun out of movie viewing. The movie takes all the stock elements of routine movie making and keep the very worst ones. Whatever makes a movie less appealing, they do. The movie is meant for people already coupled, probably making it a woman's movie. Instead of boy meets girl, it copies the formula of 99% of other movies in which boy already owns girl. Its a movie designed to delight only the rich, wealthy viewer with a family. The two lead characters are impossible to like. They have superiority complexes that would even make Sly and Arnie look meek. This might pass if the movie was made as a comic farce, but it isn't. Half of the movie's dialog consists of the lines in which Connery claims "winners", which the movie has no subtle pretense to mean "men who can do the job, perform, survive, understand, etc", can only be men who were early childhood successes, early developers who were part of early established marriages, who were successes in high school, who had sex with the "prom queen". Yes, it is nonsense. Its also the most Republican propaganda ever in a movie. The viewer doesn't care if any of these characters get killed. Even if you live in the target city, you probably won't care. The plot is over the top, which is okay if the people are interesting. These aren't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like many adolescent males, I hurriedly saw The Rock soon after its release as soon as I could. Like everyone else, I said it was a great movie, had lots of action, was extremely cool. Blah blah blah.Then I saw Beverly Hills Cop and Top Gun and realized that Jerry Bruckheimer is the most overrated producer in Hollywood. It also solidified my point that Michael Bay is both overrated and not talented. The release of Armageddon and Pearl Harbor cemented that thought so hard in my brain that I will not be seeing another of his movies again.There are ambitious directors like Oliver Stone, Steven Spielberg, and Sam Mendez. Then there are wannabes like Brian DePalma, Walter Hill, and Michael Bay. If John Hughes had been able to rebound from his failure Curly Sue with something along the lines of Ferris Bueller or the Breakfast Club, he would be back on my grade-A list.With the Rock we get a by-the-numbers action effort that uses a lot of dialogue to try and get depth out of thin characters. Nicolas Cage and Sean Connery are fun to watch, but only on surface value. Both have done better work on better movies. Ed Harris shows he will never lose his "tough-guy" image, even 20 years after The Right Stuff.That brings me to the next victim, Hans Zimmer. Poor Hans, he is forced into making typical action garbage that proves several things: 1. He is not James Horner 2. He is not John Williams-- Williams' ability to extract emotion from the audience will, probably, never be matched in our lifetime. 3. He is not Jerry Goldsmith-- Jerry has gone through every type of topic known to man and yet he is still the most underappreciated talent in Hollywood. Thankfully, Hans rebounded with Gladiator. Proving he finally knows how to write music. As you can guess, he didn't get the Oscar for it.The action in The Rock is all about lingering. They linger on a crushed corpse, the linger on an impaled corpse, they linger on a "frustrated" Ed Harris. Action is about that, action. It is about fluidity and motion, not sitting around while something else happens. If they want to sit around, then that's suspense.Overall, a fair enough action effort that has no surprises or lasting appeal. John Woo would get it right with Face/Off. 2.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

Noisy incomprehensible and some of the laziest acting by Sean Connery I've ever seen. The villain (Ed Harris ? a great actor completely wasted) is a highly-decorated (aren't they all in these sort of movies) US general who has taken over Alcatraz and is threatening to blow up San Francisco Bay area (pity that couldn't have been the Michael Bay area) unless $100 million is paid in ransom, as restitution to families of soldiers who died in secret operations. This is taking our compensation culture too far methinks. But that's Okay then as far as the plot is concerned as at least he's not doing out of any selfish motive and you cannot have a depiction of a really psychotically evil military man these days otherwise you might have the Right Wing reaching for their assault rifles. Of course the only man who can stop him is a geriatric prisoner (arise Sir Sean) a former Alcatraz escapee and you've guessed the rest. This movie is offensives on just about every level. The nadir of this film, which incidentally gave me the biggest snigger, was the line from Connery when he talks about his anxieties about making it sexually unmolested from the prison showers everyday. The idea that any prisoner no matter how perverted would be interested in Connerys flaccid old ass had me hooting. Is Connery now so old and senile as to not see how dumb and funny that line is. Or is it symptomatic of the hubris of elderly superstars that nobody tells you the obvious. Which is sad because Sean Connery always struck me as a pretty grounded individual with few airs (not to mention hairs) and graces?Rent the Sean Connery classic The Hill (1965) to see what a fine actor he can be and get this dire rubbish out of your system.</fullReview>
